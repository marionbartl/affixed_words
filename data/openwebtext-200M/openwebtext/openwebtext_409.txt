( Check out our complete collection of Extraordinary Art from Ordinary Objects . )
Paintings normally require canvas and most theater takes a stage , but carvings can come out of almost any material – a fact which some talented artists have put to into practice in amazing ways .
Most people are familiar with amazingly carved ice statues and perhaps even giant cheese sculptures , but what about eggs , pencils or books ?
Here are three approaches to carving used to create amazing art from ordinary ( and often fragile ) objects .
Lew Jensen , Don Lisk and Brian Baity and others have approached the art of egg shell carving in a variety of ways and with strikingly varied results .
Some artists work layered reliefs into the seemingly one - dimensional shells , others are subtractive and emphasis the relationship between figure and void .
One set of artists has even gone into the business of taking larger bird eggs to create lamp shades .
Mizuta Tasogare and Kato Jado divide their incredibly intricate pencil carvings into four basic types and the rest they consider variations on these basic themes .
Any mistake , they note , is fatal for an individual work which must remain intact throughout the delicate carving process .
Creating link after link without breaking through thin wood barriers and while dealing with the material change between the graphite and surrounding wood is extremely challenging .
Brian Dettmer is a kind of “ book surgeon , ” performing “ autopsies ” on old volumes with engaging three - dimensional results .
He uses an array of precision instruments to create or reveal patterns within a given book or set of books , often taking advantage of the particular appearance , form and content of his subject material .
In many cases , the connection between the material , process and product is overtly evident , as he reveals an interpretation the past through history books and the dissects virtual bodies via anatomy texts .
You have till March 31 to apply for funding for the Google Summer of Code .
Here 's a project I 'd like to mentor .
Apply at Google , thanks to the LispNYC .
( If you 're interested but not eligible for the Google SoC , please contact me directly . )
Erlang - in- Lisp
I am really missing a robust higher - order message - passing process algebra for Common - Lisp .
The challenge is : can you do as well as Erlang ?
And the proof of the pudding is : can you actually run Erlang code ?
The previous attempts failed to produce a complete workable solution :
cl - muproc - full erlang - style programming , not stable on all platforms , intraprocess threads only
gbbopen - distributed blackboard ( linda - style ? ) rather than erlang - style , works stably on many platforms ( requires threads )
philip - jose - server spawning clients via ssh , server has transactional threads via green continuations ( could notionally have one server per system thread ) .
NetCLOS - implements actors on top of CLOS , allegro 5 only
ABCL /R - implements actors , applicability to issue at stake unknown .
ParGCL - GCL only , uses MPI that allows for fancy message passing in a restricted managed context .
Erlisp - stalled in early stage .
And then of course , you can find inspiration in Termite , Dreme , Kali , Tube , things by Queinnec & co , etc . ( see the readscheme bibliography on Distributed , Parallel , and Concurrent Programming .
As far as I know , all these systems assume a trusted network and are otherwise insecure .
A better system would route messages via SSL .
Nah .
A better system would allow to plug in new methods for exchanging messages onto the IOlib event loop .
Thus project would thus be :
develop a few low - level message - passing handlers on top of the IOlib event loop ; to be supported : a simple protocol on top of an arbitrary stream ( TCP socket , unix pipe , SSL ) .
unix sockets , with their fd-passing goodness a protocol on top of HTTP / HTTPS requests a protocol on top of UDP ( with or without a layer for managing timeouts or message acknowledgment )
if needed , generalize an API to plug - in message handlers on top the IOlib event loop
on top of low - level message - passing and / or mixed in with it , implement some trivial protocol for messaging for testing ( take or adapt it from philip - jose ) some easy text protocol that precisely and safely implements Erlang semantics possibly a compatible implementation of the Erlang wire protocol
develop robust fork - based concurrency fork and manage children the right way , do n't try broken SIGCHLD handling , use waitpid implement a portable run-program with every feature a shell spawner may have , from fd redirection to setsid - use it to spawn local and remote processes implement a protocol for talking to children using point - to - point unix sockets .
develop protocols for routing messages between processes handle broken connections and ( in the abstract case ) reopening connection handle brokers , directories , name service ( to support the abstract case )
manage processes know how to probe a process status , kill a process ( see philip - jose ) learn about load - balancing , process niceness , processor affinity , etc .
support multiple concurrency models adapt cl-muproc to allow for Erlanging using native threads concurrency .
adapt philip - jose to allow for Erlanging using green threads .
in either case , take special care for proper handling of asynchronous interrupts , as they actually require clever synchronization under the hood .
Actually implement Erlang on top of this Lisp system implement enough of the Erlang semantics to run simple examples implement a parser front end for Erlang syntax implement enough of Erlang syntax semantics and basic libraries to run standard libraries , test suites and benchmarks make sure we can interoperate with existing Erlang implementations
Support additional programming styles on top of the previous framework implement mobility in the style of the Tube port some variant of NetCLOS or ABCL / R2
There 's more than enough work for two interns , maybe three .
Some of the tasks can be started in parallel , others depend on previous tasks , so three is a stretch and more is probably too much .
One intern could focus on the messaging protocol while the other one would focus on the concurrency .
Mr Concurrency would start with fork , run-program , and if the other one is late or fails to deliver , would continue implementing a CLSH variant on the SCSH pattern .
Mr Messaging would implement various messaging and if the other one is late or fails to deliver , would continue implementing various protocols to interoperate with existing software .
A hypothetical third intern would start from the other end , parsing Erlang , transforming it into forms runnable in Termite or some such project , identifying what primitives are needed , maybe trying to build a bridge between C modules for Erlang and Lisp , possibly working on interfacing with Erlang internals .
Hopefully , all interns would deliver in a timely fashion and cooperate towards a full - fledged Erlang - in - Lisp implementation .
Obviously there is n't enough time to implement and fully debug everything in the list above ; depending on the intern 's preferences , more time could be spent perfecting some of the previous features , or they could be left done just well - enough to go on the next features .
Yes , I would eagerly mentor such a project .
Actually , I may even fund such a project if there are more good applicants found than are accepted by Google .
As the name suggests , green fields stretch in every direction here in Campoverde .
But where grapes once dominated , the landscape now has a new king : kiwi .
Somewhat improbably , Italy has grown to become the world ’s largest producer of the odd furry fruit , according to the National Institute of Agricultural Economics , surpassing even New Zealand , which coined the name for the fruit once known as the Chinese gooseberry .
You do n’t think “ kiwi ” when you think Italy .
In fact , two of the letters that spell the word do n’t even form part of the Italian alphabet .
Nevertheless , kiwi cultivation is booming , with annual production at more than 400,000 tons , earning millions of dollars for farmers and reviving the economy in once - moribund sections of Italy that people might have otherwise abandoned for the city .
Advertisement
A kiwi plant , it turns out , adapts fairly easily to the infrastructure used for grapes .
It is planted along the same configuration of long , furrowed rows ;
The thin trunk is latched to a post , and its branches spread laterally to form a canopy , just like the grape vine .
From a distance you might not even spot the difference , except that the leaves of the kiwi plant are rounder , fuller and a deeper shade of green .
Here in Italy ’s central Latina province , where farms replaced swampland drained during the Mussolini era , Gianni Cosmi has gradually been converting his family farm over to kiwi .
He still dedicates about 50 acres to grapes , much of which ends up as wine .
But 35 acres is now planted with kiwi .
Sure , he agreed , it ’s a shift in identity .
But it ’s a profitable one .
“ With grapes and wine , there is history , ” Cosmi , 47 , said .
“ With the kiwi , there is adventure . ”
Or , what one might call the wow factor .
It is quite the attention - grabber when you say you raise kiwi , Cosmi marveled as he surveyed the rows and rows of spindly kiwi trees covering his land .
Advertisement
“ If you provide kiwi to the world , everyone takes note , ” he said .
“ It is still seen as exotic and something different . ”
About 80 % of Italy ’s kiwi production is exported , the bulk to Europe and 15 % going to the United States .
Italy sends kiwis at roughly the opposite end of the calendar from when other big producers such as New Zealand do , providing the U.S. a virtual year - round supply .
Even though kiwis need a lot more water than grapes , the green , tart fruit can earn three times the profit that grapes bring in , Cosmi said .
It requires a bit more manual labor , as well .
Workers inspect the round pre-fruit pods for the perfect shape .
Those that are judged lopsided are picked and tossed .
Advertisement
The fruit thrives in central Italy because of the climate , with its relatively mild winters and warm - but - not - scorching summers , and because of the area ’s mineral - rich volcanic soil .
And , it ’s naturally organic , said Cosmi , a former mayor of nearby Aprilia .
No need for pesticides and only a little fertilizer .
--
Italian kiwi took root here in Latina , and Renato Campoli was its pioneer .
Thirty years ago , as a young man , Campoli was one of the first Italians to plant the fruit , almost on a lark .
Advertisement
“ I was looking for something new to do in agriculture , ” said Campoli , suntanned and with thick white hair .
The tomatoes , beets and cows raised on his little family farm did n’t yield much of a living .
A friend in Sweden had come across a mysterious fruit called a kiwi , and he challenged Campoli : Plant that !
“ I did n’t know a thing about it , not how to cultivate it , water it , prune it , ” Campoli , 57 , recalled with a laugh .
Advertisement
That first year , he was ready to give up .
He was on the verge of destroying the first several hundred boxes of kiwi that he had grown because , traveling the length and breadth of Italy , he could n’t find a buyer .
Finally , an organic co-op near Lake Bolsena agreed to take the fruit .
--
Slowly , Campoli built what he assumed would be a niche market .
But , over time , business took off as the fruit ’s popularity grew across the world and Italy positioned itself to fill in the Southern Hemisphere ’s production gaps .
Campoli ’s life was transformed .
His five - acre farm is today a 50 - acre spread .
His son , who would assuredly have run off to the city in search of work , is instead getting an environmental engineering degree and will come home to run the business .
Campoli did n’t even taste a kiwi before he started growing it .
It was a bit strange ; some of his relatives thought it too sour .
Today he is expanding into a new variety of the fruit , with yellow flesh , called “ Kiwigold . ”
Advertisement
The sweeter golden kiwi , unlike the green version , was patented by the New Zealand company that developed it , and so Italian growers such as Campoli have to get a license to plant it .
Word has it that efforts are underway to create a red version .
Italians are learning to love kiwi , sort of .
More kiwi is eaten in Italy than anywhere else in Europe , and per capita consumption is seven times that in the United States .
Its price has come down over the years and these days the fruit costs only a few cents more than apples or bananas .
But here where it ’s grown , kiwi still has n’t permeated the culture the way , say , garlic is king in Gilroy .
There are no gigantic kiwi statues at local gas stations here .
There are no kiwi festivals , the way Tuscany has olive festivals and cinghiale ( wild boar ) festivals .
You can order and be served a kiwi at the Campoverde coffee bar , but the barman might not cut it correctly ( as he did n’t the other day when a visitor ordered one ) .
Cosmi , the former mayor and proud kiwi grower , hopes this will change .
He is also president of the Latina Kiwi Consortium , an umbrella grouping of the province ’s farmers .
The consortium ’s logo is a kiwi cut in half and plopped inside an image of the ancient Roman Colosseum .
Advertisement
Italian kiwi farmers , who have a trade magazine and biannual conventions ( standing room only the last few years ) , plan to launch a publicity campaign with radio and TV spots , billboards and other promotional gimmicks , Cosmi said .
They will extol the fruit ’s vitamin - rich nutritional virtues , as well as its environmentally friendly cultivation , in an effort to expand both consumption and the market .
“ Come back in 10 years , ” Cosmi said , gesturing toward the green - checkered horizon , “ and it will all be kiwi . ”

Only 1,761 feet to go .
Another tangible and fanfare - free milestone occurred over the weekend at ground zero , where two steel columns of 1 World Trade Center rose above street level for the first time .
That means the 1,776 - foot skyscraper , until now an entirely subterranean structure , will be doing the rest of its climbing in the public eye .
In contrast to the heavily orchestrated ceremonies of past years — white doves taking flight ( they turned out to be homing pigeons ) and a 20 - ton cornerstone being set into place ( it had to be picked up again and moved off site ) — the latest milestone was noted quite modestly by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
Rather than staging speeches , the agency simply handed out prepared , two - sentence statements from Anthony R. Coscia , the chairman , and Christopher O. Ward , the new executive director .
One World Trade Center , also called the Freedom Tower , broke through the street - level barrier on Saturday when workers for DCM Erectors attached new sections atop two of the 24 jumbo columns that form the building ’s perimeter .
The additional steel brought the columns to a height of about 15 feet above grade .
The authority said the 22 other columns were expected to sprout through May , June and July .
Tishman Construction Corporation is the construction manager for the project , which is to be completed in 2012 .
For now , the best vantages of the rising columns are either from the corner of Washington and Vesey Streets ( through a chain - link fence ) or from within the second - floor gallery of the Winter Garden at Battery Park City .
If you wait long enough , however , you wo n’t have any trouble seeing the structure from almost any nearby vantage .
And if you wait longer than that , you wo n’t be able to avoid seeing it from almost anywhere , since it will be the tallest in New York City .

Banking and Credit Is A Shell Game
The Problem - This is an attempt to state it simply , because if you understand the problem , then you 're going to see the solution clearly as well .
If it does n't make sense the first time you read it , try reading it again .
Eventually , the whole picture will sink in ...
A quick history of money 1 ) Once , gold and silver were considered the only '' real ' ' money , but it was heavy and risky to carry around ...
2 ) So people paid goldsmiths to store the money , and got paper receipts for it ...
3 ) After a while , people used the receipts like money , and left the gold in the bank most of the time .
So the bankers got clever and came up with a scam ...
4 ) The banks printed off receipts for more gold than they actually had , and '' loaned ' ' those receipts out to charge interest on it .
As long as everyone did n't redeem their receipts gold at the same time , this let them make a lot of money charging interest , because they could charge interest on MONEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE .
An analogy can be made using property and titles .
Here 's the scam in another way : Step 1 : Acquire a vacation home , Step 2 : Sell the title to the home to one person , Step 3 : Sell the title to the home to a DIFFERENT person , Step 4 : Hope they both do n't show up on the same weekend !
Fractional reserve banking lets a bank say to a depositor that all his money is safe and sound at the bank , while at the same time they get to loan most of it out to someone else to charge interest on it .
So there are two people with a legitimate claim to the same pile of money .
So whose is it , really ?
And where is it ?
It gets stranger :
When you receive your loan , if you deposit it into a bank , this bank can loan your loan money out again .
This process can be repeated indefinitely , and if you do the math you find that much more money is on deposit in all the banks than existed in the first place .
This begs the question ... where did all this extra money come from ?
It had to come from somewhere , right ?
This would be true if all money were physical objects , but today money is a concept , an idea , a number .
The answer is ... it is created by the bank !
What does this mean ?
1 ) Loaning money while claiming it is still on deposit increases the money supply , essentially creating more money ( otherwise deposits would vanish ) .
In essence , for the bank to have your cake and loan it too , it must create more cake .
This increase in money supply is the cause of inflation .
2 ) Almost every dollar that exists is owed to a bank somewhere , because at some time in history , it was created when it was " loaned " out by a bank .
3 ) The amount of money owed to banks is more than all the money in existence !
So we can not possibly get out of debt under this system .
The bulk of this debt is in the form interest , which is an arbitrary amount of money banks demand in return , but never gave .
4 ) There is no money , in the real sense .
Just checks , data stored on computers , and promises .
It is all created by typing on a keyboard , and signing signatures .
The only tangible assets in regard to money anymore is the collateral we pledge when we ask for a loan .
The money they loan you comes from nowhere , but the assets you lose in foreclosure are real !
5 ) Because the US government borrows from the Federal Reserve , bankers have the power to influence our society and government by controlling finance .
They decide to create ( or not create ) money depending on who 's asking , and for what .
They choose what projects get funded , and let other needs wither on the vine by starving them of working capital .
This subtle yet immense power is more than enough to undermine democracy , and guide the course of a nation 's history .
So what 's the solution ?
Simple .
The public must demand that money must not be created and issued as loans from private banks .
It must be something that is openly and publicly controllable , issuable , accountable , and interest - free .
Otherwise , a class of parasites will rise to power in society by cleverly disguising the fact that the money they are creating , spending , and buying the world up with is money that is n't even real .

" Of course , banks do not really pay out loans from the money they receive as deposits .

" The actual process of money creation takes place primarily in banks .
Bankers discovered that they could make loans merely by giving their promise to pay , or bank notes , to borrowers .
In this way banks began to create money .
Transaction deposits are the modern counterpart of bank notes .
It was a small step from printing notes to making book entries crediting deposits of borrowers , which the borrowers in turn could ' spend ' by writing checks , thereby ' printing ' their own money . "

Mr Brown said he was always vigilant when dealing with the economy
Gordon Brown Gordon Brown says the slump in the UK housing market is " containable " , after the sharpest monthly decline in prices since the early 1990s .
The prime minister said a 2.5 % fall in March , recorded by the Halifax , should be seen in the context of 10 years in which property prices had risen 180 % .
He acknowledged a " difficult situation " but said the UK was better placed to cope than in previous slowdowns .
The Conservatives accused Mr Brown of economic " incompetence " .
' Difficult situation '
The 2.5 % house prices fall in March was the biggest monthly decline since September 1992 , the Halifax said .
It puts prices 1.1 % higher than they were a year ago , the slowest annual growth rate for 12 years .
Because we 've got low inflation we can cut interest rates , because we have had low debt , we can afford to keep our public spending programme in line
Gordon Brown
House price ' sharp decline '
In an interview with BBC political editor Nick Robinson , Mr Brown said : " We 've seen house prices rise by about 180 % over the last 10 years and they have risen by about 18 % over the last three years , so a 2.5 % fall is something that is containable . "
He cited the US credit crunch , which has led to falls in property prices there , saying the whole world was " in a difficult situation arising from what 's happened in America " .
But the number of UK homes being repossessed was a " fraction of what happened in the early 90s " .
' Incompetence '
He said : " We will keep looking to see what we can do to be on the side of homeowners and homebuyers and also of course businesses seeking funds for investment . "
Ministers would meet the Council of Mortgage Lenders to " discuss the kind of arrangements " needed to help homeowners and homebuyers , Mr Brown added .
The Halifax said nine of its 12 UK regions had recorded an increase in house prices over the past year , the biggest being Scotland 's 5.3 % and Northern Ireland 's 3.5 % .
Three had experienced a fall : south - west England by 3.3 % , the West Midlands by 3.7 % and Wales by 5.3 % .
Meanwhile , the International Monetary Fund has warned that potential global losses from the credit crunch will reach $ 945bn ( £ 472bn ) and could be even higher .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said the latest UK housing figures meant millions of homeowners were being " confronted with the consequences of Gordon Brown 's economic incompetence " .
The PM rejects suggestions that he is " in denial " about the state of the British economy
Nick Robinson ,
BBC political editor
Read Nick 's thoughts in full
He added : " Gordon Brown failed to prepare .
He borrowed in a boom and allowed the debt bubble to grow .
Now the whole country is paying the price . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable said the falling market would be a welcome " correction " for first - time buyers struggling to get on the property ladder .
But he warned that up to three million people who borrowed 90 % or more of their property 's value over the last year or so " have been sucked into negative equity " .
He added that the credit crunch had meant mortgage rates had not been cut despite interest rate cuts , meaning many people were " finding it impossible to service their mortgage " .
Better UK forecast However , in his BBC interview Mr Brown said the government had taken the correct " long - term decisions " on the economy , contrasting the position now to the global downturn in the early 1990s .
He added : " If you look back 15 years ... we had 15 % interest rates , 10 % inflation , rapidly rising unemployment , public spending having to be cut , taxes having to rise dramatically .
" If you look at this situation , because we 've got low inflation we can cut interest rates , because we have had low debt , we can afford to keep our public spending programme in line and to borrow at the right time to help the economy come though difficult times .
" And that 's why people are forecasting that British growth will be higher than growth in other countries who are equally affected by what 's happening around the world . "
Mr Brown 's interview comes at a difficult time for the Labour leader , with a Populus opinion poll for the Times suggesting that the Conservatives had 39 % support , compared with 33 % for Labour and 17 % for the Liberal Democrats .
He has also faced criticism from within his own MPs at Westminster - with 74 signing early day motions expressing concern about his decision to axe the lower 10 p starting rate of income tax .
Asked if he would rethink the 10 p rate , Mr Brown said it was one of a package of measures in the last Budget which , as a whole , saw those on the lowest incomes gaining the most .
Asked more generally about his position , he said being in government was about taking the right " difficult long term decisions " and that over " the next few months " people would see the results .
He denied " dithering " , saying he had made the big decisions on nuclear power , airport expansion and climate change - adding that his government " would not play to the gallery " and would be judged in the long term .

What are these ?
If beauty is in the eye of the beholder , then try to be beheld by a feminist .
A new study finds that women who describe themselves as feminists are more forgiving than other women when assessing the attractiveness of women who are either very underweight or very heavy .
Writing in the journal Body Image , researchers said the findings added evidence to the argument that women who considered themselves feminists might be less likely to be taken in by the notion that the most important thing for women is to be thin .
That belief , especially in younger women , can lead the way to an eating disorder .
“ Feminism , ” the authors write , “ does appear to afford women a more inclusive perception of who is physically attractive . ”
For the study , the researchers , led by Viren Swami of the University of Westminster in London , showed a set of photographs to 129 women who said they were feminists and 132 who said they were not .
The photographs were of 10 women , faces concealed and wearing tight gray clothing , who ranged in body mass index from emaciated to obese .
Scott McClellan , making the media rounds to promote his book and push back against the ferocious counter - attack by Bush loyalists , declined to come out tonight for John McCain and said he liked what he had heard from Barack Obama .
" I have n't made a decision , " McClellan told Katie Couric on CBS 's " Evening News , " when asked if he was backing the Arizona senator .
McClellan paid homage to McCain , saying that the Republican nominee had " governed from the center , and that 's where I am . "
But without prompting , he said he was " intrigued by Sen. Obama 's message . "
" It 's a message that is very similar to the one that Gov. Bush ran on in 2000 , " McClellan said .
He offered similar comments about Obama on ABC's " World News Tonight . "
In his book , the former Bush spokesman describes his upbringing in a house where his mother was the moderate Democrat mayor of Austin ( Carole Keeton Strayhorn later became a Republican before running as an independent for governor in 2006 ) .
McClellan recounts how , when he first came to work for Bush in 1999 , he admired the governor 's willingness to work across party lines in the Texas capitol .
McClellan is the third high - profile member of Bush 's original Texas circle to express interest , if not support , for Obama .
Matthew Dowd and Mark McKinnon , both top - level advisers in Bush 's 2000 and 2004 runs and former Democrats , have also praised the likely Democratic nominee .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Taliban has created a “ resilient insurgency ” in Afghanistan and will likely maintain or increase the pace of its attacks this year , the Pentagon said on Friday .
U.S. Sergeant Eric McWilliams ( L ) and other soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division , 506th Infantry Regiment , 2nd Battalion , 4th Platoon prepare to clear a cave in a suspected Taliban area near the Pakistani border in Khost province May 21 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rafal Gerszak
In a report to the U.S. Congress , the Pentagon also singled out the safe havens for insurgents in Pakistan ’s border areas as the biggest threat to security in Afghanistan .
It said Washington and its allies had made substantial progress since ousting the Taliban from power after the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States but lasting success would take time and require much more than just military means .
“ The Taliban regrouped after its fall from power and have coalesced into a resilient insurgency , ” the report said .
In a sign of the increasing anxiety in Washington and other Western capitals about rising violence in Afghanistan , Congress ordered the comprehensive report when it approved the Pentagon ’s annual budget for this year .
The report said NATO and U.S. forces had killed some key insurgent leaders and removed sanctuaries inside Afghanistan .
“ Despite these setbacks , the Taliban is likely to maintain or even increase the scope and pace of its terrorist attacks and bombings in 2008 , ” it said .
“ The Taliban will challenge the control of the Afghan government in rural areas , especially in the south and east .
The Taliban will also probably attempt to increase its presence in the west and north , ” the report added .
The 72 - page report offered some of the starkest U.S. comments yet on Pakistan ’s border areas .
TRIBAL AREAS
“ The greatest challenge to long - term security within Afghanistan is the insurgent sanctuary within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) of Pakistan , ” it said .
U.S. officials say the sanctuaries have flourished in recent months as Pakistani security forces have stopped pressuring insurgents while the government tries to strike peace deals with local tribes .
The U.S. commander of NATO forces in eastern Afghanistan said this week insurgent attacks there rose by 40 percent this year and Defense Secretary Robert Gates blamed that rise partly on a lack of pressure on the Pakistani side of the border .
The United States has some 32,000 troops in Afghanistan .
Some 14,000 serve as part of a 53,000 - strong NATO force charged with stabilizing the country while the remaining 18,000 perform missions ranging from training to counter - terrorism .
The report painted a positive picture of the Afghan army but said the police had faced problems .
“ Generally , police development has been hindered by a lack of reform , corruption , insufficient U.S. military trainers and advisors and a lack of unity of effort within the international community , ” it said .
In addition , no comprehensive strategy exists to tackle the drug trade in Afghanistan , the world ’s top supplier of opium .
“ While progress has been made in some areas , overall counter - narcotics efforts in Afghanistan have not been successful , ” the report said .
“ There is a clear nexus between narcotics and the insurgency in Afghanistan that threatens U.S. gains in Afghanistan and the region , ” it added .
' Yurp ' Says Auf Wiedersehen to Dubya ' Bush Damaged America 's Image Around the World '
German politicians from both the ruling coalition and the opposition are taking aim at outgoing US President George W. Bush ahead of his week - long farewell trip to Europe .
The Iraq war , Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib have damaged America 's reputation , they say .
On Friday , JPMorgan announced its first top - level management jobs since the banks initially reached their agreement to merge on March 16 .
Of 26 executives named to executive positions in the investment banking and trading division , only five are from Bear Stearns .
Business line executives will announce the next level of management decisions by mid-April , but many Bear Stearns employees are n't waiting that long .
Options Group , a financial recruitment and consulting firm , started getting resumes from Bear employees " the Sunday the $ 2 share offer was announced , " said Michael Karp , its chief executive .
" We started seeing flow in Asia right away .
All night we were seeing flow from Europe . "
" All investment banks and commercial banks have interviewed people from the investment bank in Bear Stearns , " he added .
Options Group is getting about 10 to 15 resumes a day globally even now from Bear Stearns employees , including investment bankers , he said .
JPMorgan by far is the bigger bank , with 180,000 employees worldwide , including 26,000 in investment banking and trading .
Bear Stearns , the fifth - largest investment bank before it nearly collapsed last month , has 14,000 in all .
Job losses are expected at both .
One banker at a rival firm said resumes have been coming in from not just current Bear employees , but also business school graduates whose offers to join Bear had been rescinded .
The banker said most of the resumes he was getting were from junior to mid-level Bear Stearns bankers .
The investment banking businesses of the two companies overlap and Bear Stearns employees are preparing for the worst , said one Bear employee , who requested anonymity .
But these people face the tough task of finding jobs in a bad market .
The global credit crunch and a slowing U.S. economy have led to tens of thousands of job cuts on Wall Street in recent months .
" They are coming into a market at a time when Wall Street does n't offer much opportunity , " said John Challenger , chief executive of employment consulting firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
There may still be a few options for at least some of the bankers .
" Selectively we are seeing demand from hedge funds , where we are seeing people who are looking for private equity - type bankers to come in and help them grow their businesses , " Options Group 's Karp said .
" Smaller investment banks and boutique banks are looking for people selectively . "
JPMorgan plans to give employees from both companies who lose their jobs access to career placement services , a person briefed on the matter said .
" We are going to work with competitors -- which we have never done before -- private equity , hedge funds , asset managers and corporate clients -- of which we have some 13,000 -- to try to help them find jobs , " the source said .
" We hope that helps ease the pain a bit because nobody feels good about this . "

An asteroid the size of Alaska slammed into Mars about 4.4 billion years ago , creating a 70,000 - trillion - kiloton blast that forever deformed the Red Planet , suggest three studies out Wednesday .
" It was a bad day for any Martians when this happened , " says planetary scientist Francis Nimmo of the University of California - Santa Cruz , lead author of one of the studies in today 's Nature journal .
PHOTO GALLERY : This week in space Half the size of Earth , Mars has a curious split appearance , featuring a largely smooth northern plain and mottled southern highlands .
Since close - up mapping of Mars in the 1970s , scientists have debated the origins of the split , with massive volcanism seen as the most likely culprit for the planet 's northern lava plains .
A few others scientists , including Mars rover expert Steve Squyres of Cornell University , suggested an asteroid impact instead .
In one of the new studies , a team led by MIT 's Jeffrey Andrews - Hanna sought to settle the debate by using gravity observation to electronically remove volcanic deposits — 18 miles of basalt — obscuring the original shape of the northern plains .
The work revealed an impact basin 6,600 miles wide , " very smooth and regular and elliptical , " says Andrews - Hanna .
" It was not at all what we expected to find .
The impact idea was pretty unpopular . "
Earlier gravity measures had shown the crust of Mars was thinner on its northern half , triggering the impact analysis led by Nimmo and another led by Caltech 's Margarita Marinova .
Both agreed that a roughly 1,500 - mile - wide asteroid striking Mars ' northern hemisphere at an angle would explain the crustal difference .
" The tremendous melting generated by the impact would have very definitely generated the southern highlands , " as the blast dumped rock from one side of the planet to another , Nimmo says .
More proof of the blast could come from low - altitude gravity measurements of Mars ' southern hemisphere , Nimmo adds , which would reveal eggshell - like cracks in the southern hemisphere 's crust left over from the impact .
" As much as I love this idea , I do n't consider it proven by these reports , " says Squyres , a planetary scientist at Cornell .
" They strongly support the idea , but it 's a hard thing to definitively prove if you are not there . "
If proven , northern Mars would contain the largest impact basin in the solar system , says Andrews - Hanna .
" Essentially , it hit the reset button on life on Mars . "
The Mars impact came about the time a similar strike on Earth by an asteroid about half the size of the planet led to the creation of the moon .
" The early solar system was a very dangerous place to be a planet , " says Andrews - Hanna .

Exposing Bush Administration Corruption
INVESTIGATE & PROSECUTE THESE TREASONOUS THIEVES : Exposing Bush Administration Corruption People should demand accountability — who profits and who pays , and they need to address the consequences of militarism gone mad .
by Stephen Lendman On May 16 , 2008 , SueAnn Arrigo sent extensive government corruption and cover - up information to Henry Waxman , Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee — in 12 separate cases .
This article covers four of them .
Information for this article comes from long - time business , finance and political writer and analyst Bob Chapman , who publishes the bi-weekly International Forecaster .
It 's power - packed with key information and a valued source for this writer , who obtained voluminous material directly from this publication .
People need to know it .
Read on .
SueAnn Arrigo is the source .
She was a high - level CIA insider .
Her title was Special Operations Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence ( DCI ) .
She also established the Remote Viewing Defense protocols for the Pentagon in her capacity as Remote Viewing Advisor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) .
Her work earned her a two - star general rank in the military .
She called her new ranking a " ploy " so the Pentagon could get more of her time and have her attend monthly Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings .
Only high - level types are invited , and she was there from October 2003 to July 2004 .
Part of her job involved intelligence gathering on Iraq and Afghanistan — until August 2004 , when she refused to spread propaganda about a non-existent Iranian nuclear weapons program and left .
She followed in the footsteps of others at the CIA who resigned for reasons of conscience and became critics — most notably Ray McGovern , Ralph McGehee , and Phil Agee .
On May 16 , 2008 , Arrigo sent extensive government corruption and cover - up information to Henry Waxman , Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee — in 12 separate cases .
This article covers four of them , or about one - third of what Congress got .
The 12 are explosive and revealing , but just the tip of the iceberg .
They contain evidence of : government corruption and war profiteering ;
sweetheart deals and kickbacks ;
high - level types on the take ;
trillions of missing dollars .
On September 10 , 2001 , Rumsfeld admitted that , " according to some estimates , we cannot track $ 2.3 trillion in transactions . "
Imagine the current amount , and its corrosive effect on the nation According to CIA aide SueAnn Arrigo , DCI George Tenet told her to assemble " a moving van full of Pentagon documents showing Defense Contractor kickbacks to Pentagon officials . "
SueAnn Arrigo offers a glimpse of militarism gone mad , and at great personal risk .
In August 2001 , she says DCI George Tenet told her to assemble " a moving van full of Pentagon documents showing Defense Contractor kickbacks to Pentagon officials . "
She did as instructed , not exposing the corruption she learned about , but concealing it .
She believes now that this was done so the CIA could divert defense business to Halliburton and " Carlyle - related contractors . "
She stated : " The mood at the CIA and Pentagon was ' war is coming ' because the Bush family stands to make billions from it — so get ready . "
Arrigo was shocked at what she found and how brazenly the Pentagon wrote it up .
The perpetrators must have been feeling untouchable , she thinks , especially since 2001 .
According to her , the CIA used the material to blackmail or bribe its officials " into ' working on ' the Halliburton - Carlyle team . "
Top CIA types were involved , and Tenet laid it out for Arrigo : she says he told her , " You 've given me the keys to the kingdom .
[ These documents ] will make me rich . "
Arrigo collected three types of information .
Her recent report covers just one of these , but it includes plenty of incriminating evidence .
Her precise recall of dates and names is incomplete , but the events she recollects are very revealing about how Washington operates .
Perhaps it 's always been this way — but never to the degree it reached under George W. Bush .
Arrigo exposes the scheme — the systematic looting of the U.S. Treasury to enrich contractors , high - level officials at the Pentagon , and CIA and others well - placed in government .
Exact amounts are unknown , but at a mimimum the costs amount to multi-billions , even trillions — at taxpayer expense , diverted from essential social and infrastructure needs .
Case 1 : Ordering Unneeded New Fighter Aircraft Arrigo discovered high - level Pentagon corruption that involved bid-rigging and implicated " an Air Force general on the JCS and a Defense Contractor , Boeing . "
She disclosed it to JCS Chairman Hugh Shelton and DCI George Tenet , and in both instances drew blanks .
She also reported it to the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , the investigative arm of Congress .
Her information leaves unaddressed the larger issue of whether new - generation planes are needed at an enormous cost to taxpayers .
Arrigo believed they were not , and several Air Force generals agreed .
Not other JCS members , however , who she learned are involved in the corruption .
There 's more .
They " had the gall to try to force through another unneeded plane contract for Boeing , " Arrigo says .
At an early 2004 JCS meeting , she says she complained about the previous undelivered order because it did n't meet Pentagon specifications .
Yet one general in particular tried " to force the US military to buy another [ unneeded ] upgrade . "
One other JCS member backed her to no avail , and the new order went through .
Arrigo concluded that the new plane orders were given for the purpose of enriching Boeing and high - level Pentagon types who were getting rewarded for their cooperation .
She also learned how much that cooperation was worth — an average of $ 22,000 " for each [ JCS ] meeting vote , " she reports , according to their bank records .
Not U.S. bank records , but CIA - arranged Swiss accounts set up specifically for this purpose .
Everyone at the meeting cashed in , except Arrigo and one dissenting general .
More disturbing is that this is standard Pentagon practice — handouts to contractors ; kickbacks to complicit brass ; and taxpayers swindled out of multi-billions — year after year .
Jeff St. Clair wrote about all this in his 2005 book " Grand Theft Pentagon : Tales of Corruption and Profiteering in the War on Terror . "
It 's an explosive account of how military contractors scam multi-billions at taxpayer expense and not a whiff of it is reported in the mainstream media .
It 's the reason U.S. annual " defense " spending tops $ 1.1 trillion ( conservatively ) , once all military , homeland security , veterans , NASA , debt service and other allocations are included .
Case 2 : Halliburton Delivers Half Full Cartons to the Pentagon's " Swing Shift " Arrigo refers to the Pentagon 's Receiving Department " swing shift " personnel .
Only that group is involved in the scheme , says Arrigo , so other shifts are shut out and can't report it .
As a CIA insider , she checked and found damning evidence — about " the military [ not ] getting supplies to the troops on time . "
She also learned that Halliburton has its " representative to the CIA , " and one at the Pentagon as well .
Both get federal salaries , but neither was " hired by CIA or the military through their personnel departments .
Neither had done military training or trained at the [ CIA 's ] ' Farm ' as a spy . "
Arrigo was disturbed by what she learned , but was ordered to back off by superiors .
Things got worse .
Arrigo worked at the CIA for over 30 years , reporting directly to Tenet .
But she was n't prepared for what she found — a new section at the Agency that existed without her knowledge .
It employed 40 people , all working for Halliburton " while being paid by the US taxpayer as if they were CIA . "
The section was secret .
No files were set up on them .
From what Arrigo determined , they were never interviewed , never vetted .
She concluded : " CIA had a back door in its security to let Halliburton put anyone they wanted in [ its ] hallways .
It was an outrageous [ breach ] of US National Security , " especially in a post - 9/11 " war on terrorism " climate .
Shocked , Arrigo told Tenet about the section .
His reply : " Yes , I know . "
The head of CIA building security also knew .
Arrigo asked what he'd do about it .
His answer : " Keep my mouth shut so I can stay alive , and I suggest you do the same . "
She says she asked asked if he , the CIA or Halliburton might kill her if she talked .
He said he did n't think so .
Arrigo dug deeper .
She got inside Halliburton 's area and asked questions .
Why , she sought to learn , was the company shipping half the contracted - for amounts and shortchanging the troops and taxpayers ?
Halliburton , she alleges , " set up the same corrupt system of swing shift receivers [ for ] at least three continents .
They received the cartons and signed [ off ] that the goods were all received properly .
Then the shortages later were chalked up to thefts or war damage , etc. " Arrigo again informed Tenet .
His answer : " This is nothing new , " then added : " Have a report about it on my desk before Christmas [ 2001 ] . "
Arrigo told Tenet he was responsible for " correct ( ing ) Halliburton 's short - shipping and its invasion of the CIA . "
He said he could n't , because the White House tied his hands .
Call Congress , Arrigo said , urging Tenet to be " a man of courage . "
Tenet ignored her , so Arrigo faxed documents revealing Halliburton fraud to the GAO — omitting national security secrets .
One of the documents bragged about the scheme 's profitability , asserting that having high - level officials involved made it foolproof .
The scheme was clever indeed , and even more devious than Arrigo imagined at first .
Halliburton uses each shortage complaint as a new order .
" In that way , " she says , " [ it ] never [ loses ] by having to make good for [ what 's ] missing , " and it gets paid double for the same merchandise .
By now Arrigo knew too much , and had taken risks to learn it .
What she says happened next , however , is shocking : Halliburton 's " CIA Representative " confronted her , tore out her phone , ransacked her office , removed every shred of paper , and hauled her off bodily " to a prison cell " inside basement offices .
She says she was intimidated and threatened , and thought she might be killed .
The message was clear .
She says she complained to Tenet , and showed him her bruises .
According to her , he responded dismissively : " There , there , everything will be all right in the morning . "
GAO still has Arrigo 's files .
It began investigating , but stopped .
She thinks that Congress has the authority to resume the investigation and asked Waxman to do it .
That 's where things now stand .
Case 3 : The White House Conspiracy to Cook the Books — Halliburton , Carlyle and CIA
In 2002 , Arrigo tried a new tack — ingratiating herself with " Halliburton 's Man " and using the relationship to her advantage .
She offered cooperation for access to his space and made him think she was on his side .
It worked , went on for four and one - half months through late May , and paid off with plenty of insider knowledge " about Halliburton and how it works . "
Enough to fill a book , she says , but her account sticks to highlights .
First off , according to Arrigo , is that Dick Cheney never stopped running Halliburton .
" He called in orders to the man I worked for almost every day , and sometimes two or more times a day .
He remained [ Halliburton 's ] functional head in all but name .
No one .... had the power to override his orders . "
Second , Cheney never divested himself of Halliburton profits , according to Arrigo .
" He merely hid how [ he got them ] through a series of shell companies . "
One of Arrigo 's jobs was to liaison between Halliburton and CIA 's " creative accounting departments . "
In other words , their co-conspiratorial Treasury - looting efforts , and Arrigo got insider access to them .
Her advanced math and computer software training qualified her .
In a few months , she became expert in how the CIA and Halliburton hid what she calls their " financial illegalities . "
She explained , " Computers are good ways to fool most people because [ they do n't ] look inside of them . "
They can be programmed " to print out one set of books for regulators , another for Defense Contractors , another for the Pentagon , another for the taxpayer , " and so forth .
It 's simple .
Decide what you want , and machines will create it in any desired form .
The trick is doing it expertly .
Most criminals can't do this , so they need professionals to do it for them .
This means such crimes are never secret ; computer experts know about them .
The CIA thus is more vulnerable than ever before to exposure by people of conscience like Arrigo .
She says Halliburton has less expertise than the CIA , so the CIA took charge to make their two computer systems compatible .
This took several years and involved over 100 programmers .
They came , left for other jobs , and took insider knowledge with them , thus risking more leaks about the corruption of Halliburton , other contractors , the CIA , the Pentagon , high - ups in government , and such financial institutions as the Basel - based Bank of International Settlements .
Many investigations are ongoing , but huge pressure is exerted to quash them .
Leaks , it is feared , may unravel the whole scheme .
For now , though , cover - up software hides it , while taxpayers fund it .
Amounts involved , already up to unimaginable levels , keep growing .
Arrigo gives an example of how the system works .
Suppose Halliburton sold product A in 100 Lot Sizes , in Quantity X at Price Y to the Pentagon on a given date .
Most civilian invoices disclose such details .
Pentagon invoices do n't .
This provides contractors with a chance to cheat .
and can allow Pentagon brass to profit .
Missing information conceals whether all merchandise was delivered , as there is nothing to indicate quantities shipped .
Further , repackaging also hides proper amounts .
Just omitting the price conceals whether a shipment was shorted , but the CIA is more clever than that .
It experimented with " tested receivers " at some of its " front companies " to learn how best to deceive .
What works best , she says they have found , is " shifting prices around like random noise " — one day this cost , another day a different one , and so forth .
Ledger entries are inflated , undercut , omitted , added , or varied in amounts of similar transactions .
Like a " professional crime institution , " Arrigo alleges , the CIA is expert at falsifying books so no one catches on .
Another example , according to Arrigo , is that the CIA varies its front company prices monthly .
Suppose , she suggests , Halliburton made a purchase " when it [ used ] a cost inflation idea of cheating .
Halliburton [ has ] an incentive to inflate the cost of its purchases [ to ] justify [ its ] high [ price ] to the military . "
So , as standard practice , it uses the CIA 's highest price and claims that amount for its cost .
But comparing two sets of books can reveal the scheme , and methodology , therefore accounting entries had to become more sophisticated to conceal it .
Halliburton , says Arrigo , can take CIA prices and double them on its books .
It can then claim the Agency recorded half the charge " accidentally , " saying its front company promised a 50 % discount , but never delivered .
This makes the CIA look bad , and it can balk .
No matter .
Halliburton still does it , she reports , but she notes that the CIA has " lots of fronts with lots of customers and worse problems [ to hide ] than merely jacking up prices .
Some fronts [ are ] fictitious and [ make ] no products . "
Others , she says , have real customers plus fake ones to launder money .
Case 4 : Halliburton 's Rigged Back Door Accounting Computer at the Pentagon
In early 2002 , the GAO received damning evidence : that Halliburton overbills and short - ships — deliberate fraudulent acts — as standard company practice .
The GAO can expose the fraud by examining Halliburton and Pentagon invoices that do n't match and are grossly inflated .
Further , the GAO can show that payments exceed amounts billed .
One document Arrigo provided to the GAO lists Halliburton 's CIA and Pentagon staff , what little official records disclose about them , their secret office locations , and their private security staff .
Arrigo discovered that Halliburton 's ' top CIA man ' served prison time for felony fraud .
Another , at the Pentagon , was convicted as well — for stealing Army vehicles , then profiteering by shipping them overseas .
One document Arrigo provided to the GAO lists Halliburton 's CIA and Pentagon staff , what little official records disclose about them , their secret office locations , and their private security staff .
Arrigo discovered that Halliburton 's ' top CIA man ' served prison time for felony fraud .
Another , at the Pentagon , was convicted as well — for stealing Army vehicles , then profiteering by shipping them overseas .
Arrigo says Dick Cheney knew about these security breaches and blocked background checks to conceal them , but she found out about them , just as she learned about the Pentagon fraud that followed .
She says she has a handwritten Cheney memo instructing " his man " " to make sure that the Pentagon pays us all that it owes us and then some . "
Arrigo claims that the CIA 's forgery department verified that the writing is Cheney's .
Arrigo says she also has a letter from Halliburton 's " Pentagon man " to his CIA counterpart .
In it , he brags how he 's " getting more than we bargained for [ from ] the Pentagon " and suggested they get together to compare notes .
They did , and Arrigo taped their conversation .
The evidence , once more , is damning — about how easy it is to scam the system at the Pentagon ; befriend accounting personnel ; install company programmers ; check bills supposedly behind in payments ; and install a special software code for higher amounts .
Arrigo informed George Tenet about what she was learning , expecting he'd " stop Halliburton from ripping off the American taxpayer via the CIA and the Pentagon . "
Tenet , she says , appeared unperturbed , responding : " Well , you certainly have done a thorough job , as usual . "
He then offered to inform the White House to " correct the problem . "
Arrigo did that herself , and informed the GAO as well .
Only later did she learn that the Bush administration blocked an investigation .
This article covers four of Arrigo 's 12 cases .
Their evidence shows systemic contractor , government , CIA and Pentagon fraud involving enormous amounts of money .
One or more articles will follow if more material can be obtained .
It 's not what the Pentagon and CIA want revealed , so getting it is never simple , and revealing it is not without risks .

Gary Matthews , a philosophy professor , described Mr. Robison as “ an almost motherly figure who looked after everyone in the department and was very kind , ” while Fred Feldman , another philosophy professor who first met Mr. Robison in 1969 , said : “ I had tremendous respect and affection for him .
He was a wonderful guy , a very generous , thoughtful and gentle man . ”
They also said Mr. Robison bragged about both his sons .

Such sharply contrasting views are sure to renew questions about the truthfulness of memoirs in general and Mr. Burroughs ’s in particular .
Children of the psychiatrist with whom Mr. Burroughs was left in “ Running ” filed a lawsuit over inaccuracies .
It was settled in August 2007 by changing some language on the acknowledgments page and a financial settlement of an undisclosed amount .
Also , Mr. Burroughs and his publisher , St. Martin ’s Press , agreed to call the work a “ book ” instead of a “ memoir ” in the author ’s note .
Regardless of whether one is persuaded that Mr. Robison was as sinister as Mr. Burroughs depicts him , clearly the picture of a courtly philosopher is incomplete .
Even his closest friend for nearly 45 years , Edmund Gettier , said that the kind and courteous man he knew “ puzzled me in a way . ”
“ He was my best friend .
We spent hours and hours together , and yet I knew nothing about his home life . ”
Mr. Burroughs ’s older brother , John Elder Robison , who wrote a memoir of his own , “ Look Me in the Eye , ” last year about growing up with Asperger ’s syndrome , says his father was an alcoholic who mercilessly whipped him with a belt until he was old enough to defend himself .
He writes that his father once lifted the toddling Augusten onto his knee and put out a cigarette on his forehead .
“ He was mean as hell when he was drunk , no question about that , ” John Elder Robison said by phone .
The brothers now live next door to each other in Amherst .
( Mr. Burroughs and his partner also have an apartment in Lower Manhattan . )
Introduction
When one manufacturer has a breakthrough in hard drive capacity , the other manufacturers rush to make sure their product line contains at least one entry at the new capacity level .
However , it can sometimes take a while for actual product to arrive after these announcements , so it can be difficult to buy the particular drive that a consumer wants .
Fortunately , the distribution channels have begun to fill with 1TB drives over the last several months , and consumers are now able to buy these massive hard drives with relative ease .
In our head - to - head comparison today , we pit Seagate 's 1TB Barracuda 7200.11 ES.2 against Western Digital 's 1TB Caviar GP , along with updated results from the Hitachi 1TB drive that kicked off the " Era of Tera " .
The Combatants
After Hitachi , Seagate was the first of our competitors out of the gate with its 1TB drive announcements , listing several different incarnations of its largest - capacity drive .
Seagate positions their Barracuda 7200.11 as a desktop - class drive .
Seagate leverages its industry - leading five - year warranty and PMR recording technology in their mainstream 7200.11 desktop class drive .
Anyone familiar with Seagate 's drive naming conventions will recognize that this drive is the eleventh generation of their 7200 RPM mainstream drives , marking over 15 years that they have been producing drives at that spindle speed .
We were surprised once again at the launch of this new class of drive , as Seagate announced the 7200.10 series just over a year ago .
The major enhancement in the 7200.11 product series over the 7200.10 is a simple increase in areal density .
The platter size increases from 188GB on the 7200.10 series to 250GB on the 7200.11 product .
This increase in density is the primary reason for the claim of this drive being " second generation PMR recording technology " .
The other major change is an increase from 16MB cache to 32 MB cache on the 1TB drive .
We will look to find out what performance benefits , if any , come with this " second generation " technology .
Western Digital followed Seagate 's lead in introducing their 1TB Caviar GP in July of 2007 , though their approach to the technology differs considerably .
Where the Seagate drive focuses on reliability and trading on their established name , the Western Digital Caviar GP seeks to set itself apart with its low power consumption .
This " green " approach - dubbed " environmentally responsible storage " in their product literature - attempts to portray the GP line as environmentally friendly due to a low power consumption figure .
While we can all appreciate lower power requirements in our computing components , it remains an open question if users are willing to accept any performance trade - offs to get there .
Our main question today is if Western Digital 's focus on being " green " comes at the cost of performance , and how does the new Seagate 7200.11 compare to the 7200.10 series .
Let us look at the specifications to see the numbers behind the headlines .

Some reports suggest people may be starving in North Korea 's rural areas North Korea is said by some international observers to be on the brink of famine .
The United Nations World Food Programme estimates that the country is more than one million tonnes of grain short of what it needs to feed its people this year .
The United States has agreed to send half a million tonnes of food aid .
But with the first shipment due to arrive some time in the next few days , how much is really known about the nature of the food crisis inside one of the most closed countries in the world ?
North Korea makes no secret of the fact that its people 's plates may be far from full .
State media quotes the country 's long - standing leader , Kim Jong - il , as insisting that the issue be given top priority .
" Nothing is more pressing than solving the people 's food problem , " he is reported to have said on a recent visit to a farm in the north of the country .
North Korea has long suffered from serious shortages - the centralised economy is notoriously inefficient and the distribution system is failing .
North Koreans are noticeably smaller and thinner than their vastly richer and better fed South Korean neighbours .
But in 2008 the situation has been made much worse by the serious flooding that hit last year 's harvest .
Some people are predicting that the country is about to experience a famine on the scale of the one that claimed up to one million lives in the mid-1990s .
' Nothing to eat '
The South Korean human rights group , Good Friends , is affiliated with an aid agency that has access to North Korea .
It has been making alarming claims about the current levels of hunger .
" More deaths are coming from the rural farming community because , essentially , they have nothing to eat , " their spokesperson , Erica Kang , said .
Based on testimony from North Korean officials , the group claims army personnel are beginning to desert , the ration system is breaking down even in the capital , Pyongyang , and citizens have been shot for trying to cross the Chinese border to escape the hardship .
But others are not so sure .
North Korea has relied on foreign aid for years
The South Korean government dismisses claims that things have got this bad .
It has recently promised to send 50,000 tonnes of corn , but has so far held off from offering the large - scale aid donations made in recent years .
Marcus Noland from the Peterson Institute for International Economics , a Washington based think - tank , has written one of the most comprehensive studies of the mid-90s famine .
" It is very difficult to calculate the overall food shortfall in North Korea , " he says , " and there are very large margins of error . "
Mr Noland believes that the World Food Programme has consistently overstated the amount of aid North Korea needs .
But he points to one very telling indicator , the sky - rocketing prices that North Koreans are paying for rice and corn on the black market .
A sure sign of widespread food shortages and hunger - and perhaps the portent of famine .
Assessment teams
But while observers disagree about the extent of the crisis , they have even less knowledge of its distribution .
North Korea 's tight controls grant very few opportunities to travel outside of Pyongyang for foreign diplomats or aid workers .
Very little is known about which part of the population , rural or urban , is suffering the most and in what part of the country , north or south .
It may be that even the North Korean government is unaware of the full extent of the crisis , despite Kim Jong - il 's exhortations mentioned above .
It is possible top leaders may not be fully aware of the situation
There is evidence that during the last famine the ruling elite were shielded from the true picture .
A system that proffers harsh punishment for administrative failure does not tend to encourage bearers of bad news .
Lies percolate upwards .
But the arrival of the first wave of American aid will create an opportunity to grasp a better understanding .
The food was sent with one condition - that independent monitors be allowed into the country to assess the situation on the ground .
For the past week a team from the World Food Programme , accompanied by staff from US aid organisations , has been travelling to schools , hospitals and individual homes across North Korea .
The observers are few in number and their assessment will be rapid , but nonetheless , it will be a rare glimpse , at least in recent years , of everyday life and how people are coping .
Their report will be made public in the next few days .

What are these ?
Matilda is waltzing home from Iraq , and the Australians are lucky but chastened .
Lucky for having lost not one soldier in combat of the 2,000 sent to join the " coalition of the willing " attack on Iraq in March 2003 .
Chastened because Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is now pulling no punches in decrying the subservience of his predecessor , John Howard , to Washington .
Announcing the withdrawal of the 550 Australian troops still in Iraq on Monday , Rudd echoed recent charges by former White House spokesman Scott McClellan about the Bush administration ’s " shading " of intelligence to " justify " an unnecessary war .
Rudd told Parliament he was most concerned by " the manner in which the decision to go to war was made ; the abuse of intelligence information , a failure to disclose to the Australian people the qualified nature of that intelligence " ; and the government ’s silence on " the prewar warning that an attack on Iraq would increase the terrorist threat , not decrease it . "
Rudd added :
" This government does not believe that our alliance with the United States mandates automatic compliance with every element of the United States ’ foreign policy . "
Stung by Rudd ’s candor , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino fell back on the canard that " the entire world " agreed on the threat posed by Saddam Hussein .
As President Lyndon Johnson would have put it , that dog wo n’t hunt .
If all agreed , why then was President George W. Bush unable to secure the approval of the UN Security Council , without which an armed attack on another country is illegal under international and U.S. law ?
Among " coalition of the willing " leaders not named Bush , only the faith - based former British Prime Minister Tony Blair hangs on pathetically to the notion that " everyone " believed Saddam Hussein had WMDs .
This is particularly odd since Blair acknowledges the authenticity of the ( in ) famous Downing Street Memos .
Perhaps his conversion to Catholicism will prompt him to confess that he lied  a reality long beyond dispute .
The Downing Street Truth
As some will recall , Blair sent his intelligence chief off to Washington in summer 2002 to confer with his opposite number , and Bush intimate , CIA Director George Tenet .
In the spring of 2005 , a patriotic truth - teller leaked to British media the minutes of a summit meeting of UK national security officials convened on July 23 , 2002 , at 10 Downing Street .
( The minutes , which became known as the Downing Street Memos , were composed that same day by one of those officials and sent to the other participants . )
The minutes revealed that at CIA headquarters on July 20 , 2002 , Tenet informed his British counterpart that President Bush had decided to attack Iraq for regime change ; that the war would be justified by the " conjunction " of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism ; and that " the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . "
So we did not really need Scott McClellan ’s recent revelations to understand that the intelligence was " fixed , " even though our country ’s fawning corporate media ( FCM ) made a Herculean effort to suppress this key evidence  in part by ignoring and disparaging the Downing Street Memos when they surfaced three years ago .
Among the saddest aspects of this whole affair , at least for those who have been in the intelligence profession , is that no one within the U.S. intelligence establishment saw fit to go public and disclose the deception that was being used to " justify " a war of aggression .
No one .
The only seasoned officials with the courage to speak out were three Foreign Service officers  Brady Kiesling , Ann Wright , and John H. Brown  each of whom resigned before the war since it was clear to them , even without access to the most sensitive intelligence , that the war could not be justified .
As for intelligence officials outside the United States , there were several profiles in courage .
Katharine Gun , a translator in the British equivalent of our National Security Agency , did successfully leak a very damaging Jan. 31 , 2003 , memorandum from NSA revealing that the U.S. and UK were pulling out all stops to sell the war , even intercepting messages to UN delegations in New York and elsewhere .
It was all part of a last - ditch attempt to pressure nonaligned members of the UN Security Council into acquiescing to the U.S. / UK desire to strike Iraq .
Gun thought she might succeed in slowing or even stopping an attack on Iraq , if the world learned the lengths to which Bush and Blair were going to have their war .
Gun ’s explosive document , carried by the London Observer on March 2 , 2003  just two and a half weeks before the attack on Iraq  was suppressed or trivialized by the FCM in the United States .
( Gun , who acknowledged leaking the document , was fired and charged under the Official Secrets Act .
But the case collapsed when the British government balked at providing evidence that might have disclosed some government law experts had concluded that the Iraq invasion was illegal .
Gun is now a member of VIPS / West . )
And after the war began , Danish Army Intelligence Major Frank Grevil gave the Danish media documents showing that Danish intelligence had reported to its government that the U.S. public rationale for war was not supported by authentic intelligence .
Grevil ( another VIPS member ) was sentenced to four months in prison for his efforts to tell the truth .
Andrew Wilkie : Rising to the Challenge
Until he quit nine days before the attack on Iraq , Andrew Wilkie was a senior analyst in Australia ’s premier intelligence agency , the Office of National Assessments ( ONA ) .
Of all the Australian , British , and American all - source intelligence analysts with direct knowledge of how intelligence was abused in the run-up to the war , Wilkie was the only one to resign in protest and speak truth to power .
Those who dismiss such efforts as an exercise in futility should know that on Oct. 7 , 2003 , the Australian Senate , in a rare move , censured then - Prime Minister Howard for misleading the public in justifying sending Australian troops off to war .
The Senate statement of censure noted that Howard had produced no evidence to justify his claims in March 2003 that Iraq had stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons , and it castigated him for suppressing Australian intelligence warnings that war with Iraq would increase the likelihood of terrorist attacks .
One senator accused Howard of " unprecedented deceit . "
Ask the American FCM why they ignored that story .
Thanks to Wilkie ’s courage and determination , many Australians were able to come to an early understanding that the reasons adduced for war on Iraq were cooked in Washington and served up by Australian leaders all too willing to give unquestioning support to the Bush administration .
Those Australian leaders are now being held accountable .
VIPS invited Andrew Wilkie to Washington in July 2003 to speak at a briefing arranged by Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) in the House Rayburn Building .
There were 14 TV cameras in that room , but not one minute of TV coverage that afternoon or evening .
After his presentation , we strongly encouraged Wilkie to keep throwing light on this dark chapter of history ; he was pleased to join VIPS / East .
We expressed our hope that U.S. intelligence analysts who also watched the deceit close - up would soon join him in speaking out .
With a wan smile , Wilkie shook his head and pointed to the cost , including the character assassination to which he had already been subjected at the hands of his government .
One VIPS Testifies
On Aug. 22 , 2003 , Wilkie had an opportunity not yet afforded any VIPS of the American , British , or Danish chapters .
He laid out his case before parliament in Canberra , testifying that the attack on Iraq had little to do with WMDs or terrorism .
One particularly telling part of his testimony :
" Please remember the government was also receiving detailed assessments on the U.S. in which it was made very clear the U.S. was intent on invading Iraq for more important reasons than WMDs and terrorism .
Hence all this talk about WMDs and terrorism was hollow .
Much more likely is the proposition the government deliberately exaggerated the Iraq WMDs threat so as to stay in step with the U.S. "
In the wake of Wilkie ’s testimony , Australian pundits became more critical of the Howard government and its persistent refusal to acknowledge that , as one journalist put it , they were " conned by master manipulators masquerading as purveyors of objective intelligence . "
Sounds a little like Scott McClellan , no ?
But , thanks to the FCM , most Americans hear it for the first time only five years later .
The candor of Wilkie ’s Aug. 22 , 2003 , testimony to the Australian parliament helps to dispel the myths and canards still wafting around about  among other things  how " the entire world " believed Saddam Hussein was a dangerous threat .
Accordingly , we include some of the more telling Wilkie excerpts below .
( Emphasis added in bold . )
Opening Remarks to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization ( ASIO ) , the Australian Secret Intelligence Service ( ASIS ) , and the Defense Signals Directorate ( DSD )
Aug. 22 , 2003
Andrew Wilkie Mr. Chairman , thank you for inviting me to appear before the Committee .
You would be well aware that I resigned from the Office of National Assessments , before the Iraq war , because I assessed that invading Iraq would not be the most sensible and ethical way to resolve the Iraq issue .
I chose resignation , specifically , because compromise or seeking to create change from within ONA were not realistic options .
At the time I resigned I put on the public record three fundamental concerns .
Firstly , that Iraq did not pose a serious enough security threat to justify a war .
Secondly , that too many things could go wrong .
And , thirdly , that war was still totally unnecessary because options short of war were yet to be exhausted .
My first concern is especially relevant today .
It was based on my assessment that Iraq ’s conventional armed forces were weak , that Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction program was disjointed and contained , and that there was no hard evidence of any active cooperation between Iraq and al - Qaeda .
Now the government has claimed repeatedly I was not close enough to the Iraq issue to know what I ’m talking about .
Such statements have misled the public and have been exceptionally hurtful to me .
I was a senior analyst with a top - secret positive vet security clearance .
I ’d been awarded a superior rating in my last performance appraisal , and not long before I resigned I ’d been informed by the deputy director - general that thought was being given to my being promoted .
Because of my military background ( I had been a regular army infantry lieutenant colonel ) , I was required to be familiar with war - related issues and was on standby to cover Iraq once the war began .
Now , in fairness to Australian and allied intelligence agencies , Iraq was a tough target .
From time to time there were shortages of human intelligence on the country .
At other times the preponderance of anti-Saddam sources desperate for U.S. intervention ensured a flood of disinformation .
Collecting technical intelligence was equally challenging .
A problem for Australian agencies was their reliance on allies .
We had virtually no influence on foreign intelligence collection planning , and the raw intelligence seldom arrived with adequate notes on sources or reliability .
More problematic was the way in which Australia ’s tiny agencies needed to rely on the sometimes weak and skewed views contained in the assessments prepared in Washington .
A few problems were inevitable .
For instance , intelligence gaps were sometimes back - filled with the disinformation .
Worst - case sometimes took primacy over most - likely .
The threat was sometimes overestimated as a result of the fairy tales coming out of the U.S.
And sometimes government pressure , as well as politically correct intelligence officers themselves , resulted in its own bias .
But , overall , Australian agencies did , I believe , an acceptable job reporting on the existence of , the capacity and willingness to use , and immediacy of the threat , posed by Iraq .
Assessments were okay , not least because they were always heavily qualified to reflect the ambiguous intelligence picture .
How then to explain the big gap between the government ’s prewar claims about Iraq possessing a massive arsenal of WMDs and cooperating actively with al - Qaeda and the reality that no arsenal of weapons or evidence of substantive links have yet been found ?
Well , most often the government deliberately skewed the truth by taking the ambiguity out of the issue .
Key intelligence assessment qualifications like " probably , " " could , " and " uncorroborated evidence suggests " were frequently dropped .
Much more useful words like " massive " and " mammoth " were included , even though such words had not been offered to the government by the intelligence agencies .
Before we knew it , the government had created a mythical Iraq , one where every factory was up to no good and weaponization was continuing apace .
Equally misleading was the way in which the government misrepresented the truth .
For example , when the government spoke of Iraq having form [ being up to no good ] , it cited pre-1991 Gulf War examples , like the use of chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds .
Mind you , the government needed to be creative , because 12 years of sanctions , inspections , and air strikes had virtually disarmed modern Iraq .
The government even went so far as to fabricate the truth .
The claims about Iraq cooperating actively with al - Qaeda were obviously nonsense .
As was the government ’s reference to Iraq seeking uranium in Africa , despite the fact that ONA , the Department of Defense , and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade all knew the Niger story was fraudulent .
This was critical information .
It beggars belief that ONA knew it was discredited but did n’t advise the prime minister , Defense knew but did n’t tell the defense minister , and Foreign Affairs knew but did n’t tell the foreign minister .
In closing , I wish to make it clear that I do not apologize for , or withdraw from , my accusation that the Howard government misled the Australian public over Iraq , both through its own public statements as well as through its endorsement of Allied statements .
The government lied every time it said or implied that I was not senior enough or appropriately placed in ONA to know what I was talking about .
And the government lied every time it skewed , misrepresented , used selectively , and fabricated the Iraq story .
But these examples are just the tip of the iceberg .
For instance , the government lied when the prime minister ’s office told the media I was mentally unstable .
The government lied when it associated Iraq with the Bali bombing .
And the government lied every time it linked Iraq to the War on Terror .
The prime minister and the foreign minister in particular have a lot to answer for .
After all , they were the chief cheerleaders for the invasion of another country , without UN endorsement , for reasons that have now been discredited .

LA Times :
President Bush 's contentious nominee for the Federal Election Commission removed his name from consideration Friday , potentially ending a stalemate that had paralyzed the agency .
Hans von Spakovsky , a former Justice Department official who never had Democratic support to win confirmation , withdrew his nomination , saying it was time for the protracted deadlock to end .
Bush " reluctantly accepted " Von Spakovsky 's request , the White House said .
Democrats have objected to Von Spakovsky 's tenure at Justice , where he oversaw voting rights matters .
The standoff has held up other Senate confirmations to the six - member FEC , which is without a quorum and has been unable to conduct business .
Do n't look now , but it appears the Democratic party is acting like a true opposition party ...
Harry Reid :
GOP Insiders Worry About McCain's Chances
For four months John McCain had a clear field while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were at each other 's throats .
Given the opportunity , the Arizona Senator failed to define the debate in favorable terms , spending much of the valuable primary months defending himself on charges that his campaign staff was top heavy with lobbyists .
Conversely , McCain has so far eluded the anti-Republican tidal wave that threatens to sweep away the party 's candidates at every level , from county councils to the U.S. Senate .
Amid the early wreckage -- GOP partisan identification in the tank , three defeats in rock - solid GOP House districts , and the National Republican Senatorial and Congressional Committees scratching for cash -- McCain stands competitive with Obama in national polls , running just 2.5 points behind .
The McCain campaign to date lends itself to contradictory assessments .
The odds makers are leaning decisively in Obama 's favor but McCain is not out of the running .
Rick Davis , McCain 's campaign manager , has posted a PowerPoint study asserting that McCain currently hold slight leads in Wisconsin , Michigan , Missouri and Nevada , and that Ohio is " a dead heat " and that Pennsylvania could go Republican .
" This is a very good position for our campaign to be in , " Davis contends
In fact , the survey data is not as favorable as Davis claims - Obama leads in all five of the most recent Pennsylvania polls by an average of 5.8 points , and he leads in Wisconsin by 2 points .
Polling in the 19 states identified by RealClearPolitics as battlegrounds shows Obama in a better position than McCain , ahead in such Bush ' 04 states as Colorado and Iowa , and running very close in Virginia , New Mexico and Nevada .
In addition , the data on RealClearPolitics dispute another of Davis ' claims --- that McCain has stronger favorable / unfavorable ratings than Obama .
Instead , the recent average for McCain is 47.3 favorable to 40.8 unfavorable , or a +6.5 ; for Obama , it 's 50.3 to 38.5 , or +11.8 .
In not - for - attribution interviews , a number of Republicans were neither optimistic about his chances nor positive in their assessment of his campaign so far .
" I think we 've got a world of problems , " said one Republican strategist with extensive experience in presidential campaigns .
He said this came home to him with a thud when he watched Obama and McCain give speeches last Tuesday , with the Democrat speaking before " 20,000 screaming fans , while John McCain looked every bit of his 72 years " in a speech televised from New Orleans .
This Republican cited the liberal blogger Atrios ' description of McCain 's speech with a green backdrop that made McCain " look like the cottage cheese in a lime Jell - O salad . "
For McCain to stand a chance of winning , the operative contended , the campaign , the Republican National Committee , or an independent group will have to finance sustained negative ads developing a broad assault on Obama 's credibility as a national leader at a time of terrorist threat .
McCain , however , has gone out of his way to aggressively discourage such activity , the operative pointed out , which , he argued , may kill McCain 's chances .
Another strategist with similar presidential experience said " McCain has not claimed the maverick ground that should be his .
He has not seized the mantle of ' change ' and reform that he could own by going to Washington and saying , ' you know me .
You know I 've been a reformer all my life .
Now , here 's how I am going to change Washington if you elect me president . '
And he has not taken economic turf .
He has not explained how he is going to grow , not Washington , as the Democrats plan , but this economy to meet the challenges of global competition . "
Earlier this year , Rich Lowry , editor of the National Review , wrote :
McCain is an America nationalist and progressive reformer in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt , but the real consistent line throughout his career is a belief in his own righteousness .
This can lead him to great prescience , as on the surge ; foolhardy lack of proportion , as on his crusade for campaign - finance reform ; and party - splitting , self - destructive stubbornness , as on immigration reform .
If Republicans pick him , he wo n't be the safe , known quantity they usually look for in a next - in - line nominee , but a go - it - alone politician , unpredictable except for the courage and irascibility he 'll bring to whatever he does .
Asked what he thinks of the McCain campaign so far , Lowry replied :
I 'd say middling .
But he 's always going to have an enthusiasm , money , and charisma gap .
The question is whether he can make up what might well be a solid Obama lead throughout the summer in the fall when people really focus on Obama ...
Probably the most important development in this period was McCain 's embrace of the theme of reform , which I hope wo n't be jettisoned amid the critical reviews of the delivery and presentation of his New Orleans speech .
Tom Mann of the Brookings Institution argues that " McCain continues to embrace Bush policies on the most important issues , relying on a reputation for independence and moderation that could be lost in the heat of battle with Obama and the Democrats ....
At the end of this long interlude , the only rationale for his election that has emerged is that Obama cannot be trusted to lead the country at a time of great danger because he is too inexperienced , naïve , liberal , elitist , and out of touch with American values .
' Elect me because the other guy is worse . '
Not much of an argument in the face of gale - force winds blowing against the Republican Party . "
Along similar lines , Norman Ornstein , of the American Enterprise Institute , questioned whether McCain and his aides have " spent enough time and effort developing themes for why he should be president , not just why Obama should not -- especially themes that address the deep - seated anxiety voters feel that goes beyond current economic conditions . "
Arch - conservative Bay Buchanan suggested that it may not matter what McCain does .
Writing in Human Events on June 4 , she declared :
In reality there is only one candidate .
Barack Obama .
In November he will win or he will lose .
John McCain is relevant only in so far as he is not Barack Obama .
The Senator from Arizona is incapable of energizing his party , brings no new people to the polls , and has a personality that is best kept under wraps .

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Government legislation that will require all gasoline sold in Canada to contain 5 percent ethanol by 2010 passed the House of Commons on Wednesday .
The bill , which also calls for diesel to contain 2 percent renewable fuels by 2012 , won the support of the main opposition Liberal Party but was opposed by two smaller parties that had voiced concern about food - crop production being diverted to fuel .
However , the governing Conservatives and the Liberals have both backed the idea , arguing that only a small portion of food crops such as corn will be used to make the biofuel .
The bill must now be approved by the Senate , where passage is likely since it is dominated by the Liberal Party .
The legislation would create demand for an estimated 2 billion liters of ethanol and 600 million liters of biodiesel .
Canada has 16 ethanol plants built or under construction , according to industry data , with a total capacity of 1.6 billion liters produced from corn and wheat .
There are currently three biodiesel plants with a combined capacity of 97 million liters , mainly using animal fats .
A plant that would produce 225 million liters of biodiesel from canola oil is under construction in Alberta .
The United States has mandated that 9 billion gallons ( 34 billion liters ) of biofuel be sold in 2008 , the equivalent of nearly 8 percent of anticipated gasoline demand .
That amount will slowly increase each year to 36 billion gallons in 2022 .
A few words of advice for the graduating class of 2008 :
When you get your first real job , you may feel rich .
But do n’t act like it .
There are a handful of money moves you can make now that will virtually ensure your financial security -- and possibly create great wealth -- later in life .
The younger you are , the greater the opportunities and the easier the wealth strategies are to execute .
But if you start out spending too much , too fast , your ability to set yourself up for long - term wealth diminishes and eventually evaporates .
That makes the first months and years after graduation pivotal to lifetime financial security .
“ Good habits are important to start early , ” said Laura Tarbox , founder of Tarbox Group , a financial planning firm in Newport Beach .
“ Take your finances as seriously as you do your relationship and career decisions , and you ’ll end up way ahead of everybody else .
But you ’ve got to do it now .
If you start even five years later , it just does n’t work . ”
The key , experts say , is a simple one : Live like a poor college student for a couple more years .
While you ’re doing that , you can pay off your debt , start a savings plan and embrace healthy habits that will serve you well for life .

Here ’s how to start :
Calculate your net worth
Make a list of your assets and debts .
Your net worth is your assets minus your debts .
At this point in your life , the list probably is short and depressing .
The typical college graduate has virtually no assets and about $ 23,000 in debt -- $ 20,000 in student loans and $ 3,000 on credit cards .
That ’s a negative net worth of $ 23,000 .
Advertisement
Save your list and do n’t despair , said Mark Brown , a financial planner in Denver .
Things will change quickly , and it will serve as a reference point .
Recalculate your net worth each year to chart your progress and inspire you to keep going .
“ You have to look at where you ’ve come from to see the progress that you have made , ” Brown said , “ and to know that you ’re actually getting somewhere . ”
List your goals
Advertisement
People who record what they want are far more likely to get it , Brown said .
Whether your objectives are personal , professional or financial , take a few minutes to think about what you want and when you want it , and put those goals on paper .
Revisit the list periodically to see whether your goals have changed or have been achieved .
If you ’re not reaching the milestones you ’ve set , you need to consider whether they were unrealistic or you need to revise your strategy .
If you are reaching your goals , give yourself a pat on the back .
You ’ve earned it .
Add up your payments

Six months after graduation , you ’ll need to start paying off student loans , noted Dara Duguay , director of the office of financial education at Citigroup Inc. and author of “ Please Send Money : A Financial Survival Guide for Young Adults on Their Own . ”
But many new graduates do n’t even know how much they owe until they start getting the bills .
By then , some have locked themselves into other monthly expenses -- a lease on an apartment or a car , for example -- that make paying debts difficult .
Before you make any new financial commitments , find out how much you already owe , the interest rates on your debts , your minimum monthly payments and the terms of the loans .
You ’ll then be able to figure out how much of your disposable income will have to go to paying your loans and how much you ’ll have left for other spending -- including paying more than the minimum amounts due .
Prioritize your debts

Debts are not all alike .
Some , such as federally guaranteed student loans , are relatively low - cost .
It ’s OK to pay these off slowly , said Elaine Bedel , president of Bedel Financial Consulting Inc. in Indianapolis .
Other debts , such as credit card balances and private student loans , tend to have higher interest rates .
You ’ll want to pay these off quickly .
To accomplish that , first rank your debts by their interest rates , with the highest - rate loans at the top .
Then add up your minimum payments , and figure out how much more than that total you can pay on your debts each month .
Advertisement
Apply that extra amount to the highest - rate debt until it is paid off .
Cross it off your list .
Attack the loan with the next - highest rate in the same way .
Keep going until you have no debt .
Economize
Keep the old car and the roommate for as long as you can , suggests Margie Mullen , a financial planner in Los Angeles .
Pack a lunch several times a week .
At least for the moment , live frugally .
Nobody expects you -- quite yet -- to drive a BMW and live in a spacious apartment on the beach .
If you economize now , you do two important things :
You get in the healthy habit of living on less than you earn , and you give yourself the ability to pay off debts and save .
By doing this now you ’ll be more capable of buying costly things when society ’s expectations of you are greater , such as when you attend your 10 - year college reunion .

Sign up for the 401( k )
There ’s a good chance your employer offers a retirement plan that lets you save for your future and get a tax benefit in the bargain .
At a private employer , such a plan is called a 401 ( k ) .
Teachers are offered similar programs called 403 ( b ) plans , and public service workers have access to 457 plans .
Retirement , you ask ?
That may be the last thing on your mind , and you may figure you ’ve got better things to do with your cash .
But you do n’t , Tarbox said .
Here ’s why :
Many employers match the contributions their employees make to these retirement plans .
For example , for every $ 1 you contribute , your employer might kick in , say , 50 cents -- a 50 % match .
That means for each dollar of your pay that you save , you sock away $ 1.50 .
Advertisement
Better yet , the money you contribute comes out of your paycheck before taxes are computed .
As far as the government is concerned , you never earned it .
That means you do n’t have to pay tax on it ( at least not until you withdraw the money several decades from now ) .
And the tax break is instant .
So if you ’re in the 25 % income tax bracket , you can contribute $ 100 each pay period but doing so reduces your take - home pay by only $ 75 .
Plus , if your employer offers a 50 % match , your contribution instantly grows to $ 150 at no cost to you -- and that ’s before your savings , once invested through the retirement plan , start growing on their own .
Start saving now
Advertisement
Because your nest egg will earn an investment return , it ’s crucial to start saving now .
Consider two hypothetical graduates :
Sallie Smart , 22 , economizes like crazy in her first years after school so that she can save $ 500 a month in her 401 ( k ) , and she keeps that pace up indefinitely .
Her employer matches 50 % , pitching in $ 250 a month .
If she earns a 9 % annual return on her investments , when she wants to retire at age 65 she ’ll have $ 4.1 million in her nest egg .
Patty Procrastinator lives a little better when she first gets out of college and does n’t start saving in the 401 ( k ) until she ’s 32 .
From that point , she also saves $ 500 a month , her employer adds $ 250 a month , and she earns a 9 % return -- just like Sallie .
But at age 65 , Patty will have only $ 1.7 million .
That decade of delay will cost Patty $ 2.4 million .
Incidentally , Sallie contributes from her own money just $ 60,000 more than Patty does .
The rest of the difference comes from employer contributions and investment returns .

Here ’s Eva Amsen ’s idea for a event at SciBarCamp :
My idea : find 4 or 5 volunteers from different backgrounds to sit on a 20 minute panel and ( with audience feedback ) make a list of Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Science .
Since we have a wide audience , this hopefully would be a varied list .
Actually , maybe we could just put up a large sheet of paper and have people write down what they think should be on the list and get back to it later .
It ’s a really interesting idea , and relates to the question in my last post about finding ways to better incorporate science into public policy .
My number one suggestion for Eva ’s list is a deep practical understanding of how science works : what it means to know something , how something comes to be known , the provisional nature of all knowledge , the need to be aware of our own biases , and so on .
A sign that this is curretly lacking is the enormous pressure climate scientists are under to present a clear and simple story to the public about climate change .
If they admit to uncertainty or complexity , it is seized on by their opponents as evidence that climate change is not happening .
Yet such uncertainty is an essential part of the scientific process .
One must confront it head on to get at the truth , and a public discourse in which this uncertainy is absent cannot possibly reflect the underlying truth ; in a democracy , this means that science can play at most an indirect role in decision making .
In a letter Richard Feynman explains how a colleague once saw through to where the truth lay between two competing points of view , one simple and clear , the other complex :
He smiled and reminded me he was an expert on judging evidence in difficult physics experiments .
In physics the truth is rarely perfectly clear , and that is certainly universally the case in human affairs .
Hence , what is not surrounded by uncertainty cannot be the truth
In his wonderful review of Ed Hutchins ’ book “ Cognition in the Wild ” ( read the whole thing ! ) , Cosma Shalizi writes of the amazing things enabled by mass literacy .
I wonder what changes in civilization would be enabled by mass scientific literacy ?

Japanese researchers have come up with another cool way to keep you cool .
The same guys who brought us the USB Air-Conditioned Shirt have now developed a seat cushion that can keep you comfy down below .
Kuchofuku ’s new Suzukaze Air-Conditioned Cushion brings delight to your derriere with a fan - powered blast of air that , evidently , “ dissipat[es ] the heat and moisture accumulated around the buttocks . ”
Now that ’s a winning slogan if I ’ve ever heard one .
This half - pound gadget is also quite energy - efficient .
Its low - power fan , according to company estimates , will only hike up your electric bill by five cents a month — and that ’s with eight hours a day of use .
I ’d love to be a fly on the wall during the marketing meetings for this thing .

Last Tuesday , when ABC News published this report on the screenplay for Oliver Stone ’s upcoming George W. Bush biopic , we thought for certain it was an April Fools ’ prank .
A subtle one , surely , but the tipoff was the parts about Bush ’s drinking vodka from a garbage can and yelling stuff like , “ I ’d like to stuff a plate of freedom fries down that slick piece of shit ’s throat ! ” — things we ’d always assumed our president was doing and saying every single day behind closed Oval Office doors but , sadly , would n’t get to see in the big - screen adaptation of his life ’s story .
Turns out it was no prank !
The Hollywood Reporter apparently obtained a copy of the very same early draft of the script , which they sent to four Bush biographers , all of whom are skeptical of its accuracy : “ It leaves you with the impression that the White House is run as a fraternity , ” says Robert Draper , author of Dead Certain : The Presidency of George Bush .
“ This notion that his schedule is driven by what ’s on ESPN is ludicrous . ”
What concerns us , mostly , is n’t the film ’s accuracy but how funny it is — and W sounds like a laugh riot !
We ’re slightly worried about the casting , though ; can Josh Brolin really handle pratfalls and physical comedy that his role as George W. Bush surely requires ?
Might Will Ferrell have been the better choice , even though that would ’ve been painfully obvious ?
To what extent is Judd Apatow involved in W? Did Seth Rogen write the screenplay , or will he just appear as one of Bush ’s Cabinet members ?
( He would make a perfect John Ashcroft ! )
Are we finally getting a movie version of That ’s My Bush !?
It sure looks like it !

If you 've ever used ActiveResource or for that matter , coded anything that involves interacting with a remote API , you 've probably had the misfortune of having that API go down or become unresponsive .
The experienced old geezers would already have forseen the problem and set a timeout on those API calls .
For the rest of us , it 's a good time to get acquainted with the idea of fail - fast and how no response is better than a slow response .
So what happens when the API you 're accessing via ActiveResource or Net:: HTTP ( or whatever , really , so long as there 's a network socket involved ! ) becomes unresponsive ?
Unfettered outbound remote connections can kill your server
ActiveResource ( or Net : : HTTP or whatever you 're using ) would block while waiting for the API to return .
What did we learn about blocking IO in Operating Systems 101 ?
That your process or thread gets stuck waiting for a response that 's what .
So now your Mongrel / Thin / Ebb / X web server process basically stuck waiting for a response from an API that might return a response in 30 seconds , or maybe it 'll never return at all .
It wo n't be long before all your web server processes get blocked and its time to " kill dash nine " ( kill - 9 ) some processes and bring out the 500 error page .
Yes , your server has been incapacitated and your website is now basically offline .
Timeouts and you
If you 're using Net: : HTTP you can easily safeguard yourself against errors like this by setting a timeout on the socket connection .
Like so :
def fetch_something_from_some_api(uri ) http = Net:: HTTP.new(uri.host , uri.port ) http.read_timeout = timeout response = http.start { http.request( Net::HTTP::Get.new("#{uri.path}?#{uri.query} " ) ) } response.is_a ?( Net : : HTTPSuccess ) ? do_something_with(response.body ) : nil rescue Timeout :: Error logger .
warn ( " Timeout accessing #{uri} : # {$!} " ) nil rescue logger .
warn ( " Error accessing #{uri} : # {$ !} " ) nil end
Take note that you really do need to explicitly rescue from the Timeout : : Error ( or Interrupt ) since it 's a child of the Interrupt class and not a StandardError .
Any good client library should also allow you to specify a timeout on the socket connection so read the API documentation .
So what 's this about ActiveResource ?
So back to ActiveResource : Michael Koziarski was kind enough to commit my 2 patches ( this and this ) to ActiveResource so now on edge Rails , you can do this :
class Person < ActiveResource :: Base self.site = ' http://api.people.com:3000/'
self.timeout = 5 end
This sets the timeout to 5 seconds on the underlying Net:: HTTP instance that ActiveResource uses .
The default timeout ( to be exact , the read_timeout ) for Net : : HTTP is 60 seconds on most Ruby implementations ( that includes MRI ) .
That 's far too long if your ActiveResource call is in a public - facing controller !
If you are using ActiveResource anywhere and have n't safeguarded your application with a timeout , I think it 's a good idea to fix it by using edge Rails or at least applying the patch !
Smart Power Strips the Garlic of Vampire Electronics
May 3rd , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
I cover a lot of upcoming or future technology , but it ’s time to step into the present and aim for the past .
Today we ’re going to look at a technology available right now that can make some wanton energy waste history .
It ’s a surge protector that stakes the hearts of vampire electronics without hassling you , the sleeping victim .
Vampire appliances are pretty much anything you can plug in that still sucks energy when it ’s supposedly turned off .
Some are pretty obvious – the clocks on your microwave or VCR / DVD player burn all day , everyday .
We know they ’re not “ off ” because we cans see their LEDs glow .
But other electronics , from your television to your cell phone charger also draw power when they ’re plugged in but not in use .
Check out a handy graph from Good Magazine .
Some gadgets are notorious , like your plasma TV .
Estimates claim that 5 % or more of U.S. energy usage is insidiously wasted by “ stand - by mode ” or certain misleading “ off ” buttons .
A whopping 5 % may not sound like much , but it adds up to about $ 1 Billion dollars per year – and energy prices will probably continue to rise .
Be honest – how many times would you go around the house unplugging everything before it got old ?
Smart greenies have been switching off their surge protectors , but it ’s easy to forget while watching your favorite late - night TV show or blogging at 4 am .
So what can we do about these metal - toothed Nosferatu in our midst ?
How about a surge protector that turns off all your appliances for you ?
Smart Power Strips are easy to use : One “ master ” outlet on the strip controls six other “ slave ” outlets .
When the power usage of the master outlet decreases ( by a large enough amount ) , it automatically turns off the slave outlets .
If you plug your “ master electronic ” like a TV or computer into the master outlet , all your periphery appliances – printers , speakers , Playstation , etc. – are automatically turned off .
Oh wait , you have a Tivo and you do n’t want all of your peripheries to turn off ?
No worries , the Smart Power Strip has three “ constant ” outlets that behave like normal , so you wo n’t miss your favorite shows .
And of course , when you turn the “ master ” back on , the “ slaves ” will buzz to life .
So instead of housing a legion of thirsty vampires , you can sleep soundly with a gadget that puts your electronics on a diet .
For the best deal , check out Amazon.com .
This is not the first or only such gadget on the market .
Your choices range from super - smart peripherals to wall monitors to watt - counting surge protectors .
You can even use a low cost , old - fashioned timer .
For your energy efficient computer needs , you can download power - saving freeware .
These applications extend beyond home use too ; businesses are jumping on the band wagon to reduce their energy costs and boost the bottom line .
These steps could provide big savings for offices with lots of computers and copy machines .

The FBI is conducting 14 criminal investigations of mortgage lenders and the firms that turned their high - risk loans into complex securities that have left investors worldwide with huge losses , a top official at the federal agency said Tuesday .
“ We ’re looking at the whole range of those involved -- including the investment banks and other entities that bundled the loans up for sale and the institutions that held them and reported [ to investors ] on their value , ” Neil Power , head of the FBI ’s economic crimes unit , said in an interview from Washington .
The sub - prime lending investigations also extend to home builders , he said .
The principal focus of the probes is whether companies juggled their books to conceal problems with mortgages made during the frenzy of the housing boom .
In some cases , Power said , agents are looking into whether corporate executives used inside knowledge of lending problems to benefit themselves at the expense of other shareholders .

The disclosure of the FBI inquiries highlights the barrage of legal troubles confronting the home - loan business as mortgage defaults and foreclosures rise ever higher and lenders and government policymakers struggle to keep millions of borrowers from losing their homes .
In another development that came to light Tuesday , a fired loan officer alleged that a joint venture between No. 1 mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp . and Los Angeles - based builder KB Home improperly inflated home appraisals and falsified incomes to put borrowers into homes they could n’t afford .
Countrywide , which is being acquired by Bank of America after reporting a $ 1.6 - billion net loss for the second half of 2007 , said it had investigated the claims in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by Mark Zachary , a former regional vice president for the joint venture in Texas .
In a statement , the company said it “ found no merit to his accusations ” contained in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Houston .
Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting more than 30 investigations into the mortgage meltdown .
Erik R. Sirri , head of the SEC ’s market regulation division , said recently that securities firms and banks sold “ too many lottery tickets ” tied to home loans and failed to look closely enough at their growing risks .

The FBI is looking at many of the same cases as the SEC , the agency said .
“ There is a lot of overlapping , ” Power said .
He declined to identify the companies being investigated , but at least one Southern California name already has emerged : Irvine ’s New Century Financial Corp. , a shuttered firm that once was the largest independent lender to borrowers with poor credit .
New Century sought bankruptcy protection last April from its creditors , chiefly the Wall Street firms that lent money to New Century , purchased its loans and pooled them to create bonds backed by mortgage payments .
Advertisement
In its filings with the SEC , New Century said in March that a federal criminal investigation was focused on how it accounted for losses when it was forced to buy back soured loans in 2006 , and whether its executives profited by selling stock while misleading other shareholders .
The company later said the SEC was investigating as well .
The FBI ’s New Century probe is continuing , according to a federal source who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case .
Countrywide and its chairman , Angelo Mozilo , are the subjects of one of “ several large investigations ” of mortgage lenders being conducted from the SEC ’s Los Angeles office , an agency official said last fall .
It was n’t clear whether that probe was separate from a previously reported SEC inquiry into Mozilo ’s stock sales .
Countrywide also has said it was cooperating with investigations by the attorneys general of California and Illinois .
The Illinois case grew out of an investigation into a broker the state has charged with luring borrowers into loans they could n’t afford .

Starting about two weeks ago , Japan Today has been publishing video ads through Google AdSense for the Church of Scientology , much to the annoyance of some of their readership .
Although it is perfectly easy for Japan Today to block these advertisements ( despite claiming they cannot – see the 434th comment labeled “ sailwind at 11:45 PM JST – 19th April ” ) , the adverts ran for at least a week indicating that the management at Japan Today prefers the income over any hackles promotion of that wonderful organisation might raise within their audience .
( As a side note , I posted a follow - up message to point out that the JT Editor was wrong in his or her observation about being unable to block advertisements , but they deleted my message . )
Next , they ran an open thread on why people join cults , which more than a few of the regulars found quite ironic considering they had been running adverts for the not in the least bit cultish Church of Scientology .
However , the final straw was the commentary piece published today , Japan in need of moral education , by Peter Zimmatore .
I read it and thought the whole article sounded a bit fishy , so I did a web search for the Metempiric Foundation and turned up just one other hit , an event that sounds like some sort of vaguely religious gathering .
This caused me to merely roll my eyes , but searching for the author ’s name turns up a lot of Scientology - related hits .
Whilst I fully understand that there may be other people in the world with the same name as him and I am most willing to be corrected in my assumptions , I can only conclude that this article has been written by a member of the Church of Scientology .
Further evidence from the article includes :
This was a transplant from the world of therapy ( Carl Rogers / Abraham Maslow ) and their psychology - based influence .
The Church of Scientology is well - known for its opposition to both psychiatry and psychology .
For teenagers and young parents , we need to have a technique that makes them able to confront and handle the defects they have developed and to redirect them to the need and desire to want to live a virtuous life .
This description sounds like Scientology ’s auditing process .
Why is Japan Today publishing articles that have a hidden agenda ?
Is it willingly or unwittingly supporting the Church of Scientology ?
I have emailed the editor of Japan Today to ask him or her to clarify the web site ’s position , but I am yet to receive a reply .
However , I did notice that they deleted three comments by people making jokey comments directed at the aforementioned article appearing to be a Scientology plant , which is not a good sign .
Update : Between writing this article and publishing it , Japan Today has seen fit to remove all bar one comment ( perhaps they missed that one ? ) associating that article or the author with the Church of Scientology , using not the usual method that sends an email to the comment author with a reason for deleting , but with a purge that does not notify the poster .
Japan Today is also in need of moral education .
Was Japan Today paid to publish that commentary ?
A more honourable site would have at least left the comments standing to help the reader understand where the article is coming from .
How will this affect your usage of Japan Today ?

It is Japan Today alone that I hold responsible for this .

Last month , Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank appeared at a Boston town hall meeting cosponsored by the Service Employees International Union , which has recently focused its attention on the business practices of the nation ’s largest banks .
The event addressed the impact of such things as abusive credit card fees and arbitrary interest rate increases .
As the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , Frank oversees the banking industry , and he has cosponsored legislation that would rein in some of these credit card abuses .
At the meeting , Frank spoke about the need for competitively priced banking services for working families , and was largely sympathetic to the folks assembled to tell their tales of debtors ’ woe .
At the end of Frank ’s remarks , SEIU Local 509 ’s president Mike Grunko asked him whether those gathered could take Frank ’s speech as “ your commitment to get the credit card bill to the floor , ” according to the American Banker .
Grunko ’s remark was intended to be far more lighthearted than the response he got from Frank , who replied somewhat icily , “ I ’m sorry you asked me that .
I did n’t come here to be asked questions about this …I filed that bill .
I ’ve been working for it and I really do n’t like the suggestion that I need you to tell me that I ’ll be true to my word . ”
And then he left for another event , for which he was late .
In an interview , Frank explains that he was indeed insulted by Grunko ’s question , largely because he ’d just been talking about all the things he was doing on behalf of consumers and working families , and he thought Grunko ’s request for a “ commitment ” to do things he ’d already been doing was unfair .
“ There was this implication that we ca n’t be trusted , ” Frank says .
Frank ’s prickly closing of the town hall meeting was emblematic of his sometimes difficult relationship with consumer groups that want to put some constraints on the nation ’s enormous financial services industry .
It ’s not the first time Frank has exchanged testy public remarks with people who generally consider him an ally in their fight to protect consumers from the practices of the largely unregulated banking and credit card industries .
Last fall , Frank appeared at the National Consumer Law Center ’s annual convention in Washington , speaking to a group of several hundred consumer lawyers who are on the frontlines of the nation ’s foreclosure crisis .
For 12 years , Republicans had largely ignored these folks , and consumer protection issues in general , so Frank ’s appearance was a major improvement .
But the lawyers seized the opportunity to yell at Frank for the work he was doing on a bill to combat predatory lending that they believed was insufficiently proactive .
True to form , Frank yelled back .
For his part , Frank says he thought the lawyers were far more interested in preserving the right to sue after something happens than preventing the problems associated with predatory lending in the first place , which he thought his bill was attempting to do .
“ I was very unimpressed with that group , ” he says .
Frank ’s occasional public dustups with consumer groups are akin to the problems that Al Gore had with environmentalists when he was vice president :
It ’s an issue of expectations .
Consumer advocates were thrilled when Frank ascended to the chairmanship of the powerful banking committee in 2007 , after the Democrats regained the House in the 2006 election .
Republicans were horrified .
Frank had been a staple of GOP fundraising materials in 2006 , when Republicans warned darkly that if the Democrats regained control of the House , Frank , a fire - breathing gay liberal from Massachusetts , would end up in control of the banking committee and , of course , the world would come crashing down on corporate America .
The reality has been something less dramatic .
Frank does indeed have strong liberal credentials , particularly on social issues .
He backs legislation to decriminalize pot smoking and voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the Iraq War .
His support for consumer legislation has also been strong .
Back in 2001 , he even tried to re-regulate cable TV rates .
But since taking over as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , he ’s been nothing but pragmatic , which has n’t come as much of a surprise to those in the finance world .
Floyd Stoner , a longtime lobbyist with the American Bankers Association , says , “ We had worked closely with Chairman Frank when he was the ranking member and his track record there was as a legislator who worked well across the aisle . ”
As for Frank ’s reputation as a combative liberal , Stoner says that Frank is “ a liberal who understands markets . ”
Frank ’s working relationship with the industry he regulates , in fact , tends to frustrate the consumer advocates who nonetheless support him .
Few would talk on the record about him , but the consensus among them is that Frank is a “ vote counter . ”
Advocates say that he is a chairman who does n’t waste a lot of time pushing for initiatives he knows he does n’t have the votes for .
As a result , the legislation coming from his committee is far less consumer friendly than might be expected from someone with such a liberal reputation .
Take the credit card legislation he cosponsored that is currently pending in the House , the so - called Credit Card Holders ’ Bill of Rights .
Credit cards are among the most profitable segments of the banking industry , in part because the issuers are able to essentially change the terms of the contracts whenever they choose .
Make your car payment late one month , for example , and you could see all your credit cards jacked up to 36 percent interest .
These sorts of abuses are rampant in the industry , yet the House bill offers only modest solutions , such as requiring credit card issuers to send out bills at least 25 days before they ’re due , rather than 14 , or banning companies from changing the interest rate retroactively , as well as more disclosure rules for the already complex credit card contracts .
Ira Rheingold , executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates ( NACA ) , laments , “ We ’re living in a country in an incredible debt crisis , and all they can come up with is some new disclosure rules ? ”
Consumer groups would like to see more stringent measures , such as a ban on over - the - limit fees on purchases that the card issuer still allows to go forward , and many more restrictions on subprime cards that have low limits but very high fees .
Consumer advocates were particularly upset with Frank over the anti-predatory - lending bill passed by the House in November .
The bill came out of Frank ’s committee , and while it purported to address some of the abuses in the subprime mortgage industry that have led to the current crisis , a whole litany of consumer groups ended up opposing the legislation because they said it would end up leaving consumers worse off than if Congress did nothing at all .
The bill , they argued , provided weak federal remedies for people whose homes were going into foreclosure because of predatory lending , while at the same time invalidating much stronger state consumer protection laws , like those in North Carolina , which started to deal with predatory lending long before the subprime debacle forced Congress to jump on the bandwagon .
Part of the problem , from the advocates ’ perspective , is that Frank can only be as good as the committee itself .
“ Fundamentally , he ’s doing the best he can , ” says Linda Sherry , the director of national priorities at Consumer Action .
“ The committee is badly partisan , ” she notes , saying that the divide makes it incredibly hard to get anything done .
Indeed , the House Financial Services Committee is famous as a plum assignment , not because it gives members an opportunity to wrestle with fascinating issues of public policy , but because it gives them a perch from which to fundraise from the lucrative industry they are charged with overseeing .
Few legislators join the Financial Services Committee because they want to whack banks for screwing over consumers .
One reason , in fact , that the committee is so conservative is that Democrats have placed some of their more endangered Blue Dog members on it so these legislators can raise more money to stay in office — people like Melissa Bean , a relatively new Democrat from Illinois who represents a Republican - leaning district .
Since taking office in 2004 , Bean has raised more than $ 1.3 million from the financial services and real estate industries overseen by her committee .
According to consumer advocates , Frank often has trouble corralling his own party members to support measures that would benefit consumers over banks , much less getting Republicans on board .
The credit card bill is a good example .
In mid-March , Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - N.Y. ) , the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit , held a hearing on the Credit Card Holder ’s Bill of Rights .
Consumer groups arranged for several people to testify about their troubles with the credit card companies , and some flew in from out of town .
But when they arrived on Capitol Hill to testify , they were presented with privacy waivers that would have allowed congressional staffers to turn over the financial information of these witnesses to the credit card companies they were testifying against .
It ’s not unusual for congressional witnesses to sign waivers , but usually the waivers simply allow congressional staffers to review financial records and other documents as a way of vetting the witnesses before they testify .
The waivers presented to the credit card witnesses were designed broadly to give the credit card issuers freedom to discuss the witnesses ’ entire financial history publicly , and basically discredit them with it .
The waiver created something of a row .
Consumers and their advocates objected to the waivers , while Republicans refused to let the witnesses testify without them .
In the end , Frank and Maloney decided to bump the consumer witnesses off the panel and continue with the proceedings , with promises to work out the waiver issue at a later date .
( “ You do n’t want to lose on a procedural issue , ” explains Frank . )
Meanwhile , the credit card executives got to hold court without publicly facing people who have been deeply affected by their business practices .
( The consumers have been rescheduled to appear on Thursday . )
The hearing flap demonstrated the banks ’ power in Congress , and what Frank has to grapple with , even to advance the weakest of consumer protection bills .
Frank agrees that his committee has some fairly conservative Democrats , whose defections on key consumer measures make it all but impossible to pass anything .
He says it ’s not the campaign contributions that are the problem , though , but the votes .
He says that the conservative Democrats hear a lot from the many real estate agents and mortgage brokers in their districts , and they listen to them because they can deliver big voting blocks come election time .
Most of the consumer advocates understand these dynamics .
Under the circumstances , they still give Frank high marks for oversight , among other things .
After all , when the Republicans ran the committee , they never held any hearings at all on credit card abuses .
They also give Frank kudos for his relentless criticism of the Bush administration ’s anti-regulatory approach to the financial markets , which they believe has been useful in changing attitudes not just among Republicans but Democrats regarding the limits of the free market .
And in the end , at least one consumer advocate suggests that if Congress is n’t doing more on consumer issues , part of the blame lies with the advocates themselves .
NACA ’s Rheingold says that he ’s frequently heard Frank tell consumer groups that many of the members of his committee “ do n’t care what you have to say . ”
Rheingold says that so long as there are no electoral consequences to voting against consumers , the banks are going to prevail , and he notes of Frank , “ I ’m not sure it ’s his fault . ”
On that point , Frank concurs .
He , too , is critical of the consumer advocates , who he says do a lot to help draft legislation and get the language right , but then fail to help get the bills passed .
As a result , they get out - lobbied by the mortgage brokers and others from the financial sector , who flex considerable political muscle .
Frank says he has been extremely frustrated with the inability of the consumer groups to “ mobilize their troops ” on bills he would like to see pass , such as one reining in overdraft fees at banks that was blocked late last year by community bankers , who flew in hundreds of members to lobby on the Hill .
“ I was looking for help we were n’t able to get , ” he says .
Frank says it ’s encouraging that SEIU has gotten interested in the banking issues , because the powerful union has the potential to bring some more muscle to the consumer issues , but so far he has n’t seen much in the way of results .
“ They just assume if the chairman is for you , the speaker is for you , then that ’s enough . ”

Only one country in the world has eliminated the shortage of transplant kidneys .
Only one country in the world has legalized financial payments to kidney donors .
That country is Iran .
In an important report , transplant surgeon nephrologist Benjamin Hippen argues that the Iranian system has saved thousands of lives and it should be used if not as model then to inform America ’s efforts to eliminate its deadly shortage .
In the Iranian system organs are not bought and sold at the bazaar .
Instead a non-profit , volunteer - run Dialysis and Transplant Patients Association ( DATPA ) mediates between recipients and donors .
Recipients who cannot be assigned a kidney from a deceased donor and who cannot find a related living donor may apply to the DATPA .
The DATPA identifies a possible donor from a pool of people who have applied to the DATPA to be donors .
Donors are medically evaluated by transplant physicians , who have no connection to the DATPA , in just the same way as are non-financially compensated donors .
The government pays donors $ 1,200 plus limited health insurance coverage .
In addition , charitable organizations also provide renumeration to impoverished donors .
Thus demonstrating that Iran has something to teach the world about charity as well as about markets .
Will wonders never cease ?
Recipients may also contribute to donor remuneration .
Hippen reports that the system works well , although better follow - up of donors would be an improvement .
He concludes with a call to legalize financial compensation in the United States .
Batchelor had gone out in the thong to feed the pigeons a pie
Neighbours spotted David Batchelor in his street in Perth in the underwear which left his genitals partly exposed .
Perth Sheriff
Court heard that children walking home from school had been passing by at the time .
His lawyer said that Batchelor had been drunk and there was no sexual element to the way he had behaved .
He admitted committing a breach of the peace .
When officers had turned up to investigate they found Batchelor still partially dressed and with his flimsy thong on the wrong way round .
At the court previously , Fiscal Depute Hannah Kennedy said : " The witnesses watched as the accused walked between the common close entrance and the pavement .
He went behind some bushes outside his house .
The witnesses were alarmed by his actions and concerned for the children who had passed
Hannah Kennedy
Fiscal Depute
" There were a large number of schoolchildren passing his home address at this stage .
" He returned to his flat then reappeared still wearing this item .
" It was still exposing his genitalia .
The witnesses were alarmed by his actions and concerned for the children who had passed . "
Batchelor claimed he had not seen anyone around , but then confessed he looked at everyone as they went past and the " schoolgirls were bonnie . "
Mrs Kennedy added : " Asked why he did it , he replied ' I do n't know .
I was just feeding the birds and if I was wanting to do that I would just go down town and get a whore ' . "
Sheriff Michael Fletcher said : " The alcohol seems to be at the root of the problem and nothing much can be done about that , given his attitude towards it . "

Just yesterday Fraser wrote about the Milky Way ’s demotion from a 4 - arm spiral galaxy to a 2 - arm .
This is n’t the only change we ’ll have to accept about our home galaxy : a Milky Way mapping project has discovered stars in the galaxy moving slower and in more elliptical orbits than predicted .
This means we might have to redraw the map we have of our own neighborhood yet again .
Astronomers using the Very Long Baseline Array ( VLBA ) – a collaboration of ten radio telescopes across the United States – tracked the positions of masers in a dozen star - forming regions in the Milky Way .
They used parallax to determine the distance to the masers , then combined this information with how the masers shifted in the plane of the sky , giving a 3 - dimensional model of their movement .
Drawing a map of the Milky Way is a challenging task , as we only have an edge - on view of the galaxy in which we reside .
To top it off , it ’s full of dust and gas that muck up the view in the visible light spectrum .
Using the VLBA ’s radio antennae , though , has made it possible to track radio- emitting bodies as they move across the sky because radio waves travel more easily through matter than does light .
Since the VLBA functions as one huge telescope , it can track the position of stars with great accuracy .
“ Right now , our map of the Milky Way still has large areas marked ‘ Here there be dragons . ’
Ten years from now , those areas will be filled in , ” said Mark Reid , of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
Reid presented these findings at a press conference at the 212th American Astronomical Society meeting .
Instead of neatly circling the galactic center , the stars mapped by Reid and his colleagues are tracing an elliptical orbit .
Previous maps of the Milky Way have assumed that the material in our galaxy orbits the center in a circular fashion , so stars that do n’t follow this path come as somewhat of a surprise .
The stars are moving slower likely because of the loss of angular momentum when they interact gravitationally with other matter in the galaxy , traveling through what is called a ‘ density wave ’ .
The best description of a density wave I ’ve run across has to be Phil Plait ’s over at Bad Astronomy :
If you were in a helicopter over a traffic jam on the freeway , it would look like the jam is a permanent fixture of the traffic .
But in reality , cars leave the jam at the same rate as cars entering it .
So while the jam itself stays put , the cars making it up always change .
So it is with spiral arms : they are places where the matter in the galaxy is compressed , but stars enter the jam and stars leave .
The arm looks permanent , but over time its resident stars , gas , and dust change
This probably wo n’t be the last time the map of the Milky Way gets edited .
The European Space Agency ’s Gaia satellite is set to launch in 2011 , and will provide a 3 - dimensional map of 1 billion stars located as far as 30,000 light - years away from Earth .

Recently , a friend of ours , Simon , moved to Over , just North of Cambridge , UK .
He was moving to a lovely property , with a nice garden and a pond .
Simon was n’t so keen on the pond though .
It ’s not very child friendly , and with two young ones running around the garden , he thought it would be safer to get rid of it .
A few buckets and hours of sweating later , Simon lifted the pond lining to discover a laminated piece of paper sitting at the bottom of the gaping hole that once was the previous owner ’s pond .

Update :
For those who do n’t want to read the image , here ’s the full text .
I waited for someone else to type it up , since I could n’t be bothered – I think they call that crowdsourcing ? 😉
10th July 2003
To whom it may concern :
If you are reading this then I can only assume that you have removed the pond under which this note was buried .
Of course , as I am not around at the moment , I am not in a position to comment on why you may have chosen to remove the pond and , it is fair to say , that there could be any number of reasons for doing so .
I will not try to list those potential reasons right now but there could be quite a lot of them .
One of the more bizarre reasons could be that the removal of the pond was the direct result of a bite on the ankle from a Wildebeest , but I shall not speculate .
Anyways , I would like you to be aware that the digging of this pond and it ’s subsequent filling with water and stocking with fish and aquatic plants took a considerable amount of personal effort .
It ’s not just the digging of the hole you know ( although clearly that is a major part ) , but also the consideration that had to be given to the sitting of the pond , its shape and size , its location close to a convenient electrical supply , etc etc etc .
I have to admit that I am a bit miffed about all this .
You have just destroyed ( yes , I know its a strong word to use but there are principles involved here ) something that took me a long time to do .
If I came along and destroyed something that it had taken a long time for you to do then I think you would be a bit miffed as well , so just think on that .
Enough of this .
Just get on with what it is you think you are doing , you snivelling pond destroyer .
Oh , and by the way , I hope your head falls off .
More funny stuff on That Canadian Girl :
Not only was the driver of a Ford Bronco that fatally struck a 12 - year - old girl unlicensed , but San Jose police say she is an illegal immigrant , too , renewing the debate on whether undocumented people should be allowed to apply for driver ’s licenses .
The revelation that Adriana Fierro De Marin , 31 , was in the country illegally struck yet another cord with the family of Breanna Slaughter - Eck , still reeling from the loss of the Hoover Middle School sixth - grader .
“ I ’m worried that she just might flee now and walk away from all this , ” said Joe Castro , the man who raised Breanna for the last four years .
For her part , Breanna ’s mother simply wants justice .
Breanna was biking home from Hoover on June 12 , on her last day of school , when a Ford Bronco making a left turn slammed into her .
The crash is still under investigation and no charges have been filed .
But Breanna ’s death and the disclosure by authorities that Fierro de Marin is an undocumented immigrant and unlicensed driver highlights one of the more controversial and lingering topics in the state Capitol .
There have been nine attempts since 1999 to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for driver ’s licenses .
Each of the efforts has failed – opposed by Republicans who say it ’s inappropriate to provide state services and benefits to people in the country illegally .
State Sen. Gil Cedillo , D - Los Angeles , says safety is more important .
“ We have every day , 2 1 / 2 million people taking the roads who , if given the opportunity , would apply for driver ’s licenses , ” said Cedillo , whose latest proposal passed the Senate and is back before the Assembly this summer .
“ We ’re endangering the lives of pedestrians and motorists in California every single day . ”
Lt. Carl Neusel , an assistant division commander for the Santa Clara County Sheriff ’s Office , estimates about a third of the unlicensed drivers deputies encounter are undocumented .
“ It ’s a problem , ” he said .
More importantly , traffic experts say , the focus should be on all unlicensed drivers , illegal or not , because statistics link such drivers to more high - risk , hazardous behavior .
Statistics show that nationwide one of every five fatal crashes involves drivers without a valid license .
In California , nearly a quarter of all crashes from 2001 to 2005 involved drivers without a license , according to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety .
xxxxx
“ Are these people risky ?
Yes , ” said Robert Scopatz , who co-authored studies of unlicensed drivers for the auto club .
Scopatz said unlicensed drivers cut through all demographics and that unlicensed illegal immigrants are only a tiny portion of the problem .
Simply put , Scopatz said , unlicensed drivers tend to have more societal issues , among them problems with alcohol or drugs that prevent them from getting a license .
“ The biggest risk they pose to society is that their bad attitudes are reflected in their driving , ” he said .
In the San Jose area last year , the California Highway Patrol alone issued 3,886 citations to drivers without a license .
Statewide , CHP issued 132,042 in 2007 .
“ Unfortunately , it ’s pretty common ; we come across it more often than we should , ” said Sgt. Trent Cross , spokesman for the Bay Area ’s California Highway Patrol division .
While having a license does n’t guarantee safety , it helps , Cross said .
“ It shows that you went to the DMV and passed the test and it shows you have a basic understanding of how to operate a motor vehicle . ”
Driving without a license in California is a misdemeanor , but the penalties could be greater if it involves an injury or fatality .
The decision whether to file criminal charges against Fierro De Marin will be made by the Santa Clara County District Attorney ’s Office .

Local authorities are n’t responsible for enforcing immigration laws , and police in many cities , including San Jose , have standing policies that limit officers from notifying immigration authorities about a suspect ’s status unless felony charges are involved .
However , before a suspect is booked into jail , they are asked a series of questions – whether they are U.S. citizens , their place of birth and their immigration status .
The answers can alert federal agents whether the inmate is in the country illegally .
In Fierro De Marin ’s case , police initially arrested her on suspicion of felony vehicular manslaughter and misdemeanor driving without a license , but released her to spend more time developing the case , said San Jose police spokesman Enrique Garcia .
Since felony accusations were involved , police alerted immigration officials about her status , Garcia said .
Efforts to reach Fierro De Marin on Thursday were unsuccessful , but last week she told the Mercury News she was driving to pick up her own daughter from the same school when the crash happened .
“ I feel so bad .
I ’m so , so sorry , ” said Fierro De Marin , whose family moved here from Mexico 20 years ago .
“ It ’s as if it happened to me . ”
Meanwhile , Cedillo said Breanna ’s death should serve as a reminder that many undocumented immigrants are driving California ’s streets and highways without proper training .
Once again , Republicans oppose Cedillo ’s bill , SB 60 .
“ There are arguably good reasons why we want to know who is here – and identification is not a bad idea – but what we do is we send a wrong message to law - abiding Californians that we have to follow the law but everyone else doesn’t , ” said Assemblyman Anthony Adams , R- Monrovia .
“ That ’s the fundamental problem . ”
Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich have discovered how roots find their way past obstacles to grow through soil .
The discovery , described in the forthcoming edition of Science , also explains how germinating seedlings penetrate the soil without pushing themselves out as they burrow .
" The key is in the fuzzy coat of hairs on the roots of plants " says Professor Liam Dolan .
" We have identified a growth control mechanism that enables these hairs to find their way and to elongate when their path is clear . "
Root hairs explore the soil in much the same way as a person would feel their way in the dark .
If they come across an obstacle , they feel their way around until they can continue growing in an opening .
In the meantime , the plant is held in place as the hairs grip the soil .
This ability is governed by a self - reinforcing cycle .
A protein at the tip of root hairs called RHD2 produces free radicals that stimulate the uptake of calcium from the soil .
Calcium then stimulates the activity of RHD2 , producing more free radicals and further uptake of calcium .
When an obstacle blocks the hair 's path , the cycle is broken and growth starts in another location and direction .
" This remarkable system gives plants the flexibility to explore a complex environment and to colonise even the most unpromising soils , " says Professor Dolan .
" It also explains how seedlings are able to grow so quickly once they have established . "
In nutrient poor soils such as in parts of Australia and sub-Saharan Africa , plants have adapted by producing more root hairs .
A better understanding of this adaptation will allow the development of crops able to grow in inhospitable environments .
This research was funded by the BBSRC , a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship and MEXT of Japan .

An introduction to ABC's
Part of the reason why I have n't volunteered to write a PEP for ABC's is because I do n't feel that I understand the various proposals and the background discussion well enough .
However , it occurs to me that writing the rationale section of a PEP can often be the hardest part , and I think I understand the issues well enough to write that preface .
So here 's my contribution : ---
In the domain of object - oriented programming , the usage patterns for interacting with an object can be divided into two basic categories , which are ' invocation ' and ' inspection ' .
Invocation means interacting with an object by invoking its methods .
Usually this is combined with polymorphism , so that invoking a given method may run different code depending on the type of an object .
Inspection means the ability for external code ( outside of the object 's methods ) to examine the type or properties of that object , and make decisions on how to treat that object based on that information .
Both usage patterns serve the same general end , which is to be able to support the processing of diverse and potentially novel objects in a uniform way , but at the same time allowing processing decisions to be customized for each different type of object .
In classical OOP theory , invocation is the preferred usage pattern , and inspection is actively discouraged , being considered a relic of an earlier , procedural programming style .
However , in practice this view is simply too dogmatic and inflexible , and leads to a kind of design rigidity that is very much at odds with the dynamic nature of a language like Python .
In particular , there is often a need to process objects in a way that was n't anticipated by the creator of the object class .
It is not always the best solution to build in to every object methods that satisfy the needs of every possible user of that object .
Moreover , there are many powerful dispatch philosophies that are in direct contrast to the classic OOP requirement of behavior being strictly encapsulated within an object , examples being rule or pattern - match driven logic .
On the the other hand , one of the criticisms of inspection by classic OOP theorists is the lack of formalisms and the ad hoc nature of what is being inspected .
In a language such as Python , in which almost any aspect of an object can be reflected and directly accessed by external code , there are many different ways to test whether an object conforms to a particular protocol or not .
For example , if asking ' is this object a mutable sequence container ? ' , one can look for a base class of ' list ' , or one can look for a method named ' __getitem__ ' .
But note that although these tests may seem obvious , neither of them are correct , as one generates false negatives , and the other false positives .
The generally agreed - upon remedy is to standardize the tests , and group them into a formal arrangement .
This is most easily done by associating with each class a set of standard testable properties , either via the inheritance mechanism or some other means .
Each test carries with it a set of promises : it contains a promise about the general behavior of the class , and a promise as to what other class methods will be available .
This PEP proposes a particular strategy for organizing these tests known as Abstract Base Classes , or ABC .
ABCs are simply Python classes that are added into an object 's inheritance tree to signal certain features of that object to an external inspector .
Tests are done using isinstance ( ) , and the presence of a particular ABC means that the test has passed .
Like all other things in Python , these promises are in the nature of a gentlemen 's agreement - which means that the language does not attempt to enforce that these promises are kept .

Olbermann challenges
Rice to prove devotion to country , job and Iraq mission David Edwards and Ron Brynaert

Print This Email This MSNBC's Keith Olbermann challenged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to prove her devotion to country , job and mission on his Countdown show Wednesday night .
Taking aim at the Pentagon 's stop - loss policy which involuntarily extends the active duty status for its troops , Olbermann called it " de facto draft - gate . "
" There is no draft , no force service , right ? " Olbermann continued .
" Tell that to the kids who are stop - loss into their third , fourth , fifth tours in Iraq . "
Olbermann added , " Tell that now again to the State Department for the second consecutive year , the State is warning its diplomats that there are about 300 openings in Iraq and apparently the number of volunteers is down to roughly zero . "
" They may be forced to go there or quit , " the MSNBC host noted .
" Secretary of State Rice said that those staffers who have protested the involuntary assignments are offensive to her and cast a very bad light on the Foreign Service . "
Olbermann then essentially challenged Rice to put her body where her mouth is .
" Well , heres the suggestion , Madam Secretary , your term is expiring in no more than nine months and four days , why dont you show your devotion to the country and that department youve headed and show those whove made those offensive remarks what you re made of , " Olbermann stated .
" Why dont you ask the next administration to let you continue serve at State at one of those great jobs in Iraq . "

The government rationed food during World War II and gasoline in the 1970s .
Now , it 's imposing quotas on another precious commodity : 2008 dollar coins known as silver eagles .
The coins , each containing about an ounce of silver , have become so popular among investors seeking alternatives to stocks and real estate that the U.S.
Mint can't make them fast enough .
In March , the mint stopped taking orders for the bullion coins .
Late last month , it began limiting how many coins its 13 authorized buyers world - wide are allowed to purchase .
...
Your health is your life , and your wealth represents the fruits of your labor .
I assume you do n’t want to be wasteful with either of them .
Here ’s how to save both at the same time :
Reduce Your Consumption of Drugs –
That includes alcohol , cigarettes , over the counter , prescription and otherwise .
Drugs are a huge financial drain , and in most cases , unhealthy for the human body .
A significant portion of the global population abuses the crap out of them on a daily basis , legally and illegally .
Learn to Cook and Prepare Healthy Food – People who eat every meal out tend to have lighter wallets and heavier rear ends .
With the exception of pricey , upscale dining establishments , you ’ll find that most restaurants use lower - grade ingredients and employ sketchy sanitary practices that fall well below the standards you embrace in your own kitchen .
So when you eat out , you ’re either spending more cash or eating low - grade product .
Regardless , you lose .
The ability to cook and prepare healthy meals is a vital skill everyone should know how to do .
Brown Bag the Leftovers for Lunch – Always cook enough at dinnertime so you can enjoy lunchtime leftovers the following day .
Leftovers are faster , easier , cheaper and healthier than anything you ’ll find at the local fast food eatery .
Avoid Overpriced , Unproven Supplements – Most people assume that FDA approved nutritional supplements are proven products .
Wrong !
Do you really think the FDA has enough resources to precisely verify every new dietary supplement proposed to hit the market ?
I assure you , they do n’t and there is no feasible way they ever will .
Remember , the FDA concentrates its efforts on drugs , not supplements .
Under the active Dietary Supplement and Health Education
Act , producers of dietary supplements do not have to verify that their product is effective , safe or at all healthy prior to placing it on store shelves .
Sometimes someone has to become dreadfully ill from a dietary supplement before it even becomes a “ blip ” on the FDA ’s radar .
Drink Filtered Tap Water – I ’ve said it before , people go to work and trade priceless hours of their lives for dollars and then waste the dollars buying something that ’s already free .
A Brita water filter is an inexpensive investment that makes free tap water as healthy and pure as the bottled water for sale at the local supermarket .
Since a penny saved is a penny earned , you ’ll be making money every time you take a sip .
Also , substituting beverages like soda for filtered tap water is another healthy way to save .
Stop Driving Like a Maniac –
The faster you accelerate your vehicle , the more gas you will burn .
People who are heavy on the pedal use up to 37 % more gas during every mile of city driving .
At $ 4 a gallon , that ’s a lot of wasted money .
Also , the faster you drive , the less time you have to react to hazardous road conditions .
Bottom line : Drive responsibly at or below the speed limit .
Brew Your Own Coffee – Is coffee perfectly healthy for you ?
It ’s hard to say for sure .
There is a good deal of medical research to validate both sides of the argument ( see here and here ) .
However , one point remains certain : millions of people across the globe drink coffee every single morning .
Many of them wasting significant amounts of money on fatty , sugar and cream packed coffee beverages from Starbucks - style coffeehouses .
So the real question is :
How do you make the coffee drinking habit healthier and less expensive ?
The answer is simple .
Brew your own coffee .
If you like , add a dash of low fat milk and a single packet of sugar .
It ’s quick , fairly healthy and way cheaper than Starbucks .
We have a Cuisinart Two - to - Go Coffeemaker and absolutely love it .
Wear Helmets and Protective Body Gear – How many motorcyclists , bicyclists , skateboarders , etc. do see foolishly blazing around without wearing any form of protective body gear ?
It ’s your life .
A quality bicycle helmet will cost you $ 40 and 2 seconds of your time to put it on before you ride .
If you do n’t wear one and end up crashing and cracking your head open , it could cost you thousands of dollars in medical bills and take months , if not years , for your body to fully recover .
Stay In and Hang Out – Your home is your haven .
It ’s the safest , most comfortable environment to relax and socialize in .
It also happens to be a far cheaper alternative to the local bars , pubs and clubs .
You can save money on gas and entertainment costs while avoiding a lungful of secondhand smoke .
So login to eBay , sell some stuff you do n’t use , buy yourself a Wii and invite over a few of your favorite people .
Do n’t forget to crank - up the tunes . 😉
Buy Healthy , Generic Brand Food –
When it comes to the bare essentials on your grocery list , generic brands can provide the same food quality at a significantly reduced cost .
U.S. food manufacturers are forced to follow a set of standards which basically guarantees the quality of the food they produce .
Many large - scale grocery chains purchase name brand products directly from the manufacturer and simply slap their own generic brand label on the packaging .
You should always compare the generic brand ’s list of ingredients to a name brand product just to make sure everything matches up .
Eat Fresh Produce that is In Season – Based on abundant crops and excessive supplies , produce that is in season is fresher , more nutritious and cheaper than produce that is out of season .
Take a quick look around the produce isle .
The fresh , seasonal produce will be piled high and priced low .
The fluctuations in price can be quite significant .
For instance , an ear of corn will cost about 10 cents in the summer and nearly a dollar in the wintertime .
Play Sports with Your Friends – Racquetball , tennis , kickball , basketball …
Honestly , it does n’t matter what you play , so long as it ’s an active sport that you enjoy .
When you play sports with your friends you ’re basically hitting 3 birds with 1 stone .
You ’re getting healthy exercise and quality social time without spending a dime .
Walk a Mile Everyday – Most medical professionals agree that walking is the healthiest form of exercise .
Studies have shown that overweight twenty - somethings spend significantly more on medical bills over the course of their lives .
Adding a 1 mile walk into your daily routine is a quick way to get some exercise and lose a couple pounds without spending money on a gym membership .
My colleagues and I walk a mile everyday after lunch .
We walk , we talk and we come back to the office feeling refreshed .
Do Some Weekly Meal Planning – A little meal planning can reduce the cost of preparing a meal by preventing you from overspending on ingredients you do n’t need .
It ’s also much less stressful to prepare a meal without running around at the last second trying to figure out what ingredients you have so you know what you can cook .
This scenario is exactly why most people give up and waste their money at unhealthy fast food restaurants .
Buy in Bulk , Cook in Bulk – Join a discount shopping club like Costco .
Even though there ’s a membership fee , discount clubs can be extremely cost - effective if you purchase the majority of your groceries in bulk .
Buying and cooking food in bulk is a great way to save money and maintain a healthy diet .
If you cook a week ’s worth of healthy food in bulk , you ’ll probably end up eating healthier all week long than you would have otherwise .
Angel and I usually cook in bulk for the entire week on Sunday evenings .
Having our food already prepared when we return home from work is a huge time saver and stress reducer on busy week nights .
Eat Slow to Eat Less –
By eating slow you give yourself enough time to properly chew your food , which is much healthier for your digestive system .
It also gives you enough time ( usually 20 minutes is needed ) to realize you ’re full .
Many people eat so fast that they continue stuffing their faces long after their stomachs are at capacity .
The slower you eat , the less you will eat .
The less you eat , the less money you will spend on food .
Reduce Consumption of Sugar - Loaded Deserts – Consuming a sugary snack on occasion is fine for you , but not when you habitually fix one onto the end of every single meal you eat .
Most sugar - loaded deserts have little nutritional value and simply empty your wallet and make your jeans 2 sizes too small .
Get Annual Medical Check - Ups –
If you think that scheduling medical check - ups when you ’re healthy is a waste of your time and money , think again .
The exact opposite is actually true .
Annual medical check - ups are the best form of severe illness prevention , and prevention is greatest cure of all .
Regular medical check - ups can detect potential health issues before they get out of control , allowing you to treat the condition before it becomes an expensive , time consuming drain on your life .
Wash Your Hands Before Eating – Washing your hands takes two seconds and kills thousands of germs that could potentially lead to illness .
When you catch a cold , what do you do ?
You buy expensive over the counter medications .
Do you want to stay healthier and wealthier ?
Wash your hands before you eat , EVERY SINGLE TIME you eat !
If you ca n’t wash your hands , use a quality hand sanitizer .
scientology ’s tax exemption – basic criteria for revocation
I posted the following at the Enturbulation.org forum in response to an initiative by some Texas Republicans to revoke Scientology ’s tax exemption in Texas .
I pointed out why the initiative was flawed ( in short , their basis for revocation included inapplicable administrative requirements instead of actual criteria ) ,
The entire post can be read here , posted under the nick “ tikk . ”
[...]
That all said , there are many * valid* reasons to propose that Scientology ’s exemption be revoked .
But Texas is in no position to revoke any Scientology church ’s exemption unless it does so on the federally based criteria ( and even then , a federal preemption issue may arise ) .
To this , one need refer to the instructions for IRS Form 1023 , which is the IRS application for charitable 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) exempt status .
Without getting too deeply into the hows and whys , there are a limited number of bases by which religious entities have their federal exemption revoked .
One is inurement , which is where the corporate officers of a religious entity personally profit–individuals cannot personally benefit or maintain a private interest in church funds .
A related basis for revocation is where the religious entity ’s beliefs are deemed by the IRS to not be “ truly and sincerely held . ”
In other words , where a religious corporation is built purely to evade taxes , and its belief structure fraudulent .
A religious entity also must not engage in political activity , such as campaigning for a particular candidate , although the IRS seems to selectively enforce this prohibition , often in a partisan manner .
Enforcing this prohibition is made more difficult , too , by the necessity of permitting free speech latitude , so that church officials can express their opinions on political matters .
It ’s not always easy to tell where political speech stops and political activity begins .
Finally , a religious entity must not maintain practices derived from its beliefs that are “ illegal or contrary to clearly defined public policy . ”
Note that this prohibition focuses on practices , not beliefs–it would be unconstitutional for the IRS or a court to deny an exemption based on a religious group ’s beliefs .
Practices are another matter .
The most relevant case on this matter is Bob Jones University v. United States , 461 U.S. 574 ( 1983 ) ; the university had its exemption revoked due to its policy against interracial dating .
Courts have also advanced the same concept in the affirmative sense ; that is , religious entities must not only refrain from illegal activity , but serve a general community interest .
As for Scientology , arguments can be made both for an against , with regard to each of these criteria .
Does Scientology exist solely for DM ’s private benefit ?
Even if this were true , proof would be difficult come by , as Miscavige need not maintain an existence apart from his role as head of Scientology ( and how would the IRS , or anyone , be able to tell the difference , necessarily ? ) .
Are Scientology ’s beliefs truly held ?
While a good argument can be made that Hubbard cynically created a money - making machine that was only facially religious , its present - day adherents truly and sincerely hold its beliefs , regardless of whether those beliefs were fraudulently formed .
It ’s a point not worth arguing , in my opinion .
Does Scientology engage in political activity ?
Not often , except on behalf of itself , usually to request the state department intervene on its behalf with regard to its treatment by France or Germany .
But CCHR is also tax exempt ( although there are multiple CCHR corporate entities ) , and it is essentially a single - issue lobbying group .
It seems possible that CCHR is vulnerable to revocation for its political activity .
Scientology is most vulnerable , it would seem , on the public policy question .
It does not contribute to the general community interest , as it is entirely self - interested .
Even where Scientology demonstrates a charitable side , such as where Volunteer Ministers appear at disaster sites such as Katrina and 9/11 , its internal correspondence reveals its true purpose as PR - related .
Scientology also maintains practices such as disconnection and fair game ( of both ex-members and critics ) , which are contrary to US public policy , and harm the general community interest .
Obviously , there are many other reasons why Scientology ’s practices ( not beliefs ) fail to serve the general community interest or run contrary to public policy .
But the aforementioned language framework should be your guide when complaining to the IRS or public officials .
The spying bill that 's now being debated in the Senate does more than just update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act – and let companies like AT&T off the hook for snooping on your phone calls and e-mails .
The legislation , oddly enough , also offers a new definition for " weapons of mass destruction . "
It 's an improvement over old attempts to define WMDs .
But the term is still a mess .
Under the old FISA bill , you could eavesdrop on foreign powers ( or agents of foreign powers ) who were trying to engage in " sabotage " and " international terrorism . "
To that , the new bill adds the practice of trafficking in weapons of mass destruction as being grounds for eavesdropping .
And exactly what * are * WMDs under the new FISA bill , you ask ?
Let 's go to Thomas , that very useful government database , and find out .
Under title VII , section 110 , there is the new definition :
` (1 ) any explosive , incendiary , or poison gas device that is designed , intended , or has the capability to cause a mass casualty incident ;*
` ( 2 ) any weapon that is designed , intended , or has the capability to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons through the release , dissemination , or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors ;*
` (3 ) any weapon involving a biological agent , toxin , or vector ( as such terms are defined in section 178 of title 18 , United
States Code ) that is designed , intended , or has the capability to cause death , illness , or serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons ; or *
` (4 ) any weapon that is designed , intended , or has the capability to release radiation or radioactivity causing death , illness , or serious bodily injury to a significant number of persons .'*
Now , two things of interest leap to my attention here .
First is the qualifier of " significant number of persons "
as the definition of a mass casualty incident .
That 's good ; many discussions just default to explaining WMDs as " any chemical , biological , radiological , or nuclear weapon . "
Thus , you get the ridiculous examples of the FBI calling a few grams of ricin or a cylinder of chlorine a " WMD " if someone threatens to use it against the public .
They do n't consider quantity to be a factor in prosecuting a case .
When the term " WMD " was defined by the United Nations in 1948 , they specifically meant " things on the scale of an atomic bomb . "
No one has defined what " significant number of persons " is , though .
I guess it 's like pornography , you know mass casualties when you see them ( 100 people ?
1,000 ? 10,000 ? ) .
Again , at the least , it takes more than a few ( or a few dozen ) casualties to constitute a mass - casualty event ( FBI , take note ) .
Second , see subparagraph where it says that " any explosive , incendiary , or poison gas device " ?
Here 's where they screwed up big time , by not asking anyone with a Defense Department background for advice .
The military ( and arms control community ) deliberately excludes incendiary devices from the definition of a chemical weapon
( and thus , would exclude incendiaries from the WMD definition ) .
They are conventional weapons with specific guidelines ( see Protocol III here ) .
Just because incendiary weapons use chemicals does not make them unconventional weapons , and I do n't think we need to track nations or arms dealers who traffic in napalm , fuel - air explosives and flamethrowers .
I really wish they would leave explosives out , too .
They are not on the scale of WMDs – again , by the UN definition , a single explosive device does n't come close to the effect of an atomic bomb ( although kudos to the Air Force for trying ) .
Oklahoma City was a tragedy , but it was not a WMD event , and the two planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 were not WMDs – they were improvised high - explosive devices .
If I had to guess , this is the work of some eager beaver who has Justice Department background and he wants to ensure that older ( and inaccurate ) Title 18 definitions of WMD still apply for the law enforcement community .
There continues to be debate within the Defense Department about including high - yield explosives in the definition – a strategy document from the Office of the Secretary of Defense says no , the antiterrorism community says yes .
This is a significant addition , however , and I 'd be very curious to find out who sponsored this part of the legislation .
It is certainly an expansion of powers for the " combating
WMD " community and demonstrates that the government is still afraid of the WMD boogeyman ( but not enough to get its definition straight ) .
So , no more nuclear weapons conversations with Iranians or North Koreans on the phone .
Big Brother is listening .

One of the biggest drawbacks of wind power is its unpredictability .
Sometimes the wind blows ; sometimes it does n't .
Not so 1,000 feet up .
There , you get a constant breeze unimpeded by trees , hills , and buildings .
To tap into this steady current , Magenn , a company based in Ottowa , Ontario , has come up with a novel idea : dirigibles .
The prototype Magenn Air Rotor System ( MARS ) is essentially a wind turbine built around a blimp .
The electricity generated by the wind travels down a tether to a transformer at a ground station , where it is then transferred to the power grid .
The whole apparatus is designed to weather - vane so that it 's always facing the wind .
It 's stabilized by something called the Magnus effect – the same physical phenomenon that keeps a golf ball aloft if you give it enough backspin .
Here 's what it looks like :
( Animation courtesy of Magenn )
Magenn claims that the MARS has many advantages over conventional windmills :
The wind blows about twice as strong at 1,000 feet , the Magenn 's floating blimps are less expensive per unit of energy , and they can be moved around more easily , allowing them to follow changing wind patterns and to be deployed for disaster relief or to provide power to communities in the developing world that are not connected to a power grid .
The company plans to begin shipping a 10 - killowat version of its MARS in 2009 or 2010 , which is about 25 feet by 65 feet and 1,200 pounds .
They have n't finalized their price yet , but they are shooting for between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000 per unit ( buyers will end up paying about $ 10,000 more for the helium , which is not included ) .
Magenn says that you can't hook one up to your house if you live within a city or town boundary , and , if you plan on putting one up in North America , you 'll have to get a permit from the FAA .
The company says it is planning on coming out with a backpack version for use by campers , probably in five to ten years .
Greentech Media reports that the company has secured $ 5 million in funding from the Quercus Trust , a California - based investor in renewable energy .

Great news :
The Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Corynne McSherry arm - twisted Lockheed Martin into giving up on their crazy attempt to stop people from posting 3D models of the WWII bombers that they built at government expense , claiming a trademark in the design :
Last month we told you about Lockheed Martin 's effort to use trademark infringement claims to cause the removal of digital images of classic military aircraft from TurboSquid , a stock images site .
The central mark at issue was the term " B - 24 , " which Lockheed managed to register as a trademark for use in connection with scale models of airplanes .
We sent an open letter to Lockheed 's licensing agency , demanding that they withdraw their improper objections .
We 're pleased to report that Lockheed has decided to withdraw its claim , and TurboSquid is putting the images back up forthwith .
This is a good outcome , but the problem remains .
Because online communication and commerce often depends on intermediaries like TurboSquid , who may not have the resources or the inclination to investigate trademark infringement claims , it is much too easy for trademark owners like Lockheed to ignore fair use and shut down legitimate content .
And not every target of improper claims is going to have the resources to push back .

The government has been editing Minister of Industry Jim Prentice 's Wikipedia entry , removing mentions of the recent copyright - reform controversy and hailing the minister as personifying " experience , confidence and competence , ability and capability . "
The edits , discovered by University of Ottawa internet law professor Michael Geist — a vocal opponent of Prentice 's pending copyright legislation — have been anonymously made over the past week with several attempts to remove criticisms of a bill the minister is expected to table before Parliament breaks for its summer session some time over the next few weeks .
Geist , who was tipped off by a reader of his blog , tracked the IP address of the person or persons making most of the edits back to Industry Canada .
A spokesperson for Prentice did not return several requests for comment .
The Wikipedia website allows anyone to edit an entry , which allows for incorrect information — or opinionated views — to be added .
The site 's open architecture provides a way for incorrect information and opinions to slowly be filtered out as additional users add to or remove from entries .
Among the information removed by Industry Canada employees were some paragraphs including speculation , such as :
" Prentice has been responsible for developing new Canadian Intellectual Property laws akin to the DMCA in the United States , partly due to pressure from US - based advocacy groups .
While he had promised to ' put consumers first , ' the draft legislation seems to cater strictly to industrial groups and Prentice has now suggested consumer interests may not be heard for years .
Indeed , Prentice has refused to talk to a group of protesters who went to his office to express their concern . "
Another statement that was deleted , this time on May 29 , was :
" The minister is planning on introducing a bill on June 5 2008 and is not communicating with the public or the press on the bill .
The minister is being heavily influenced by foreign publishers and distributers . "
On May 27 , Geist said someone from Industry Canada added the following information :
" Recent developments have shown that no such draft legislation exists and that Minister Prentice has yet to publically release any documents on the copyright issue .
Minister Prentice is expected to draft a bill on copyright that will strike a balance between consumers and producers , while bringing Canada in line with current WIPO international standards . "
The glowing comments about Prentice were added on May 29 , Geist said , and included claims that " Prentice has been praised for his strong management of the Industry portfolio .
He has been dubbed the unofficial deputy prime minister , and is seen as the strongest Minister in the Harper government . "
The praise , however , was quickly deleted , Geist said .
A statement that Prentice is a possible future contender for leadership of the Conservative Party was still up as of this writing , as was a section titled " copyright controversy " that read :
" It is rumoured that Prentice has been responsible for developing new Canadian Intellectual Property laws akin to the DMCA in the United States , partly due to pressure from US - based advocacy groups .
While he had promised to ' put consumers first , ' the commentators have suggested that the draft legislation seems to cater strictly to industrial groups and Prentice has now suggested consumer interests may not be heard for years .
Indeed , Prentice has refused to talk to a group of protesters who went to his office to express their concern stating ' When ( Canadian Heritage Minister Josée ) Verner and I have reached a consensus and we 're satisfied , we will introduce a bill . ' "
The editing of Wikipedia pages by political staff is not a new phenomenon .
Politicians in the United States , United Kingdom , Australia and Japan have had their entries edited by staff .
The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Ahh - Inspiring Bathroom Reader Pong , Atari 's most popular game ( Image : screenshot of Pong from the Atari Arcade Hits # 1 , 1972 , by Hasbro Interactive [ wikipedia ] )
If you know anything about the pop culture of the 1970s , the name Atari is synonymous with video games .
So what happened ?
Where did Atari go ?
Here ’s the story .
THE GAMBLER
In the early 1960s , a University of Utah engineering student named Nolan Bushnell lost his tuition money in a poker game .
He immediately took a job at a pinball arcade near Salt Lake City to make back the money and support himself while he was at school .
In school , Bushnell majored in engineering and , like everyone else who had access to the university ’s supercomputers , was a Spacewar !
Addict .
But he was different .
To his fellow students , Spacewar !
Was just a game ; to Bushnell , it seemed like a way to make money .
If he could put a game like Spacewar !
Into a pinball arcade , he figured that people would line up to play it .
( Photo : Stibbe.net ) FALSE START Bushnell graduated form college in 1968 and moved to California .
He wanted to work for Disney but they turned him down , so he took a day job with an engineering company called Ampex .
At night he worked on building his arcade video game .
He converted his daughter ’s bedroom into a workshop ( she had to sleep on the couch ) and scrounged free parts from Ampex and from friends at other electronics companies .
The monitor for his prototype was a black - and - white TV he got at Goodwill ; an old paint thinner can was the coinbox .
When he finished building the prototype for the game he called Computer Space , he looked around for a partner to help him manufacture and sell it .
On the advice of his dentist , he made a deal with a manufacturer or arcade games , Nutting Associates .
Nutting agreed to build and sell the games in exchange for a share of the profits , and in return , Bushnell signed on as an engineer for the firm .
If you ’ve never heard of Computer Space , you ’re not alone .
The game was a dud .
It sounded simple - the player ’s rocket has to destroy two alien flying saucers powered by the computer - but it came with several pages of difficult - to - understand instructions .
The fact that it was the world ’s first arcade video game only made things worse .
Neither players nor arcade owners knew what to think of the strange machine sitting next to the pinball machines .
“ People would look at you like you had three heads , ” Bushnell remembered . “ ’ You mean you ’re going to put the TV set in a box with a coin slot and play games on it ? ’ ” ( Photo : Flippers [ wikipedia ] ) NUTTING IN COMMON Still , Bushnell was convinced that Nutting Associates , not the game , was to blame for the failure .
And he was convinced that he could do a better job running his own company .
So he and a friend chipped in $ 250 a piece to start a company called Syzygy ( the name given to the configuration of the sun , the earth , and the moon when they ‘ re in a straight line in space ) .
That ’s what Bushnell wanted to name it … but when he filed with the states of California , they told him the name was already taken .
Bushnell liked to play Go , a Japanese game of strategy similar to chess .
He thought some of the words used in the game would make a good name for a business , and company legend has it he asked the clerk at the California Secretary of State ’s office to choose between Sente , Hane , and Atari .
She picked Atari .
FAKING IT Bushnell hired an engineer named Al Alcorn to develop games .
Meanwhile , Bushnell installed pinball machines in several local businesses , including a bar called Andy Capp ’s Tavern .
The cash generated by the pinball machines would help fund the company until the video games were ready for market .
Alcorn ’s first assignment was to build a simple Ping - Pong - style video game .
Bushnell told him that Atari had signed a contract to deliver such a game to General Electric and now it needed to get built .
According to the official version of events , Bushnell was fibbing - he wanted Alcorn to get used to designing games and wanted to start him out with something simple .
Ping - Pong , with one ball and two paddles , was about as simple as a video game can be .
In reality , there was no contract with G.E. and Bushnell had no intention of bringing a table tennis game to market .
He was convinced that the biggest moneymakers would be complicated games like Computer Space .
“ He was just going to throw the Ping - Pong game away , ” Alcorn remembers .
But then Alcorn gave him a reason not to .
OUT OF ORDER Instead of a simple game , Alcorn ’s Ping - Pong had a touch of realism : if you hit the ball with the center of the paddle , the ball bounced straight ahead , but if you hit it with the edge of a paddle , it bounced off at an angle .
With Alcorn ’s enhancements , video Ping - Pong was a lot more fun to play than Bushnell had expected .
As long as the game was fun , Bushnell decided to test it commercially by installing Pong , as he decided to call it , at Andy Capp ’s Tavern .
Two weeks later , the owner of Andy Capp ’s called to complain that the game was already broken .
Alcorn went out to fix it , and as soon as he opened the machine he realized what was wrong - the game was so full of quarters that they had overflowed the coin tray and jammed the machine .
( Photo : ProhibitOnions [ wikipedia ] )
That was only half of the story .
The bar ’s owner also told Alcorn that on some morning when he arrived to open the bar , people were already waiting outside .
But they were n’t waiting for beer .
They ’d come in , play Pong for a while , and then leave without ordering a drink .
He ’d never seen anything like it .
That was their first indication that Pong was going to be a hit .
JUST A COINCIDENCE
But did Nolan Bushnell really come up with the idea for Pong … or did he lift it from another video game company ?
Video game history buffs still debate the issue today .
Here ’s what we do know :
In the late 1960s , a defense industry engineer named Ralph Baer invented a video game system that could be played at home on a regular television .
The system featured 12 different games , including Table Tennis .
( Photo : Ralph H. Baer Consultants )
Magnavox licensed Baer ’s system in 1971 and prepared to market it as Odyssey , the world ’s first home video game system .
The company planned to sell the system through its own network of dealers and distributors .
In May 1972 , the company quietly began demonstrating the product around the country … and on May 24 it demonstrated it at a trade show in Burlingame , California .
“ In later litigation , ” Steven Kent writes in The Ultimate History of Video Games , “ it was revealed that Bushnell not only attended the Burlingame show but also played the tennis game on Odyssey . ”
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
Did Bushnell have a revelation when he played the Odyssey game ?
Did it convince him that simple games like Pong would be more popular than complicated games like Computer Space ?
Or was it just as he claimed - that he instructed Alcorn to invent a ping - pong game , perhaps inspired by he Magnavox Odyssey , only because it was the simplest one he could think of ?
We ’ll probably never know for sure .
As far as the law was concerned , the only thing that really mattered was that , unlike Willy Higginbotham ( Tennis for Two ) and Steve Russell ( Spacewar ! ) , Ralph Baer actually had patented his idea for playing video games on a TV screen and had even won a second patent for video Ping - Pong .
His patents predated the founding of Atari by a couple of years .
Bushnell never applied for a patent for Pong , and did n’t have a case for proving he ’d invented it .
And even if he did , he did n’t have a chance fighting a big corporation like Magnavox in court .
SMART MOVE
So why did Atari become synonymous with video games instead of Magnavox ?
It was skillful maneuvering by Bushnell .
Since he could n’t win in court , Bushnell paid a flat fee of $ 700,000 for a license to use Baer ’s patents .
That meant that Atari bought the rights free and clear and would never have to pay a penny in royalties to Magnavox .
And because Magnavox was now the undisputed patent holder , they had to sue Atari ’s competitors in court whenever competing game systems infringed the patents .
Atari did n’t even have to chip in for the legal fees .
Magnavox Odyssey , signed by Ralph Baer . ( Photo : Wgungfu [ wikipedia ] )
Magnavox had Odyssey on the market while Atari was still years away from manufacturing a home version of Pong .
But Magnavox would n’t capitalize on their exclusive market .
Their first mistake was selling the product exclusively through their own network of dealers , when it would have been smarter to sell them in huge chain stores like Sears and Kmart .
Their second mistake was implying in their advertising that Odyssey would only work with Magnavox TVs .
That was n’t true , but the company was hoping to increase TV sales .
All they ended up doing was hurting sales of Odyssey .
In 1975 they discontinued the 12 - game system and introduced a table tennis - only home video game to compete against the home version of Pong .
Then in 1977 they introduced Odyssey2 to compete against Atari ’s 2600 system .
Yet in spite of all the effort - and in spite of the fact that they , not Atari , owned the basic video game patents - Magnavox was never more than a me - too product with a marginal market share .
Magnavox finally halted production in 1983 .
KING PONG
From the moment it was introduced in 1972 , Atari ’s arcade game , Pong , was a money maker .
Placed in a busy location , a single Pong game could earn more than $ 300 a week , compared to $ 50 a week for a typical pinball machine .
Atari sold more than 8,000 of the machines at a time when even the most popular pinball machines rarely sold more than 2,500 units .
Atari would have sold a lot more machines , too , if competing game manufacturers had n’t flooded the market with knockoffs .
But there was no way that Atari could fight off all the imitators .
Instead , Atari founder Nolan Bushnell managed to stay one step ahead of the competition by inventing one new arcade game after another .
( One of these games , Breakout , in which you use a paddle and a ball to knock out holes in a brick wall , was created by an Atari programmer named Steve Jobs and his friend Steve Wozniak , an engineer at Hewlett - Packard .
Do their names sound familiar ?
They should - a few years later , they founded Apple Computer . )
THE ATARI 2600
In 1975 Atari entered the home video game market by creating a home version of Pong .
Selling its games through Sears Roebuck and Co. , Atari sold 150,000 games that first season alone .
Bushnell was ready to introduce more home versions of arcade games , and he ’d decided to do it by copying an idea from a competing video game system , Channel F .
The idea : game cartridges .
It was a simple concept : a universal game system in which interchangeable game cartridges plugged into a game player , or “ console . ”
There was just one problem : inventing a video game cartridge system from scratch and manufacturing it in great enough volume to beat out his competitors was going to cost a fortune .
The only way that he could come up with the money was by selling Atari to Warner Communications ( today part of AOL Time Warner ) for $ 28 million in 1976 .
Bushnell stayed on as Atari ’s chairman and continued to work on the cartridge system .
Atari 2600 .

Introduced in mid-1977 , the Atari Video Computer System ( VCS ) - later renamed the Atari 2600 - struggled for more than a year .
Atari ’s competitors did n’t do much better , and for a while it seemed that the entire video game industry might be on its last legs - the victim of the public ’s burnout from playing too much Pong .
ALIEN RESURRECTION
Then in early 1979 , Atari executives hit on the idea of licensing Space Invaders , an arcade game manufactured by Taito , a Japanese company .
The game was so popular in Japan that it actually caused a coin shortage , forcing the national mint to triple its output of 100 - yen coins .
Space Invaders on the Atari 2600 .
Image : Kudla.org Just as it had in Japan , Space Invaders became the most popular arcade game in the United States , and the most popular Atari game cartridge .
Atari followed up with other blockbuster cartridges like Defender , Missile Command , and Asteroids ; by 1980 it commanded a 75 % share of the burgeoning home video game market .
Thanks in large part to soaring sales of the VCS system , Atari ’s annual sales grew from $ 75 million in 1977 to more than $ 2 billion in 1980 , making Atari the fastest growing company in U.S. history .
But it would n’t stay that way for long .
THE BEGINNING OF THE END Within months of bringing VCS to market , Bushnell was already pushing Warner to begin work on a next - generation successor to the system , but Warner rejected the idea out of hand .
They had invested more than $ 100 million in the VCS and were n’t about to turn around and build a new product to compete with it .
Warner ’s determination to rest on their laurels was one of the things that led to Bushnell ’s break with the company .
By the time Space Invaders revived the fortunes of the VCS , Noland Bushnell was no longer part of the company .
Warner Communications had forced him out following a power struggle in November 1978 .
If Bushnell had been the only person to leave the company , Atari ’s problems probably would n’t have gotten so bad .
But he was n’t - Warner also managed to alienate nearly all of Atari ’s best programmers .
While Atari made millions of dollars , Warner paid the programmers less than $ 30,000 a year , did n’t share the profits the games generated , and would n’t even allow them to see sales figures .
The programmers did n’t receive any public credit for their work , either .
Outside of the company , few people even know who had designed classic games like Asteroids and Missile Command ; Warner was afraid that if it made the names public , the programmers would be hired away by other video game companies .
BREAKOUT
So Atari ’s top programmers quit and formed their own video game company , called Activision , then turned around and began selling VCS - compatible games that competed directly against Atari ’s own titles .
Activision dealt a huge blow to Atari , and not just because Activision ’s games were better .
Atari ’s entire marketing strategy was based around pricing the VCS console as cheaply as possible - $ 199 - then reaping huge profits from sales of its high - priced game cartridges .
Now the best games were being made by Activision .
Atari sued Activision several times to try to block it from making games for the VCS but lost every time , and Activision kept cranking out hit after hit .
By 1982 Activision was selling $ 150 million worth of cartridges a year and had replaced Atari as the fastest growing company in the United States .
THE ATARI GLUT Activision ’s spectacular success encouraged other Atari programmers to defect and form their own video game companies , and it also prompted dozens of other companies - even Quaker Oats - to begin making games for the VCS .
Many of these games were terrible , and most of the companies that made them soon went out of business .
But that only made things worse for Atari , because when the bad companies went out of business , their game cartridges were dumped on the market for as little as $ 9.99 apiece .
If people wanted good games , they bought them from Activision .
If they wanted cheap games , they pulled them out of the discount bin .
Not many people bought Atari ’s games , and when the cheap games proved disappointing , consumer blamed Atari .
Meanwhile , just as Bushnell had feared , over the next few years , new game systems like Mattel ’s Intellivision and Coleco ’s ColecoVision came on the market and began chiseling away at Atari ’s market share .
With state - of - the - art hardware and computer chips , these game systems had higher - resolution graphics and offered animation and sound that were nearly as good as arcade video games … and vastly superior to the VCS .
Adding insult to injury , both ColecoVision and Intellivision offered adapters that would let buyers play the entire library of VCS games , which meant that if consumers wanted to jump ship to Atari ’s competitors , they could take their old games with them .

But what really finished Atari off was Pac - Man .
In April 1982 , Atari released the home version of Pac - Man in what was probably the most anticipated video game release in history .
At the time , there were about 10 million VCS systems on the market , but Atari manufactured 12 million cartridges , assuming that new consumers would buy the VCS just to play Pac - Man .
Big mistake - Atari ’s Pac - Man did n’t live up to its hype .
It was a flickering piece of junk that did n’t look or sound anything like the arcade version .
It was n’t worth the wait .
Atari ended up selling only 7 million cartridges , and many of these were returned by outraged customers demanding refunds .
ATARI PHONE HOME
Then Atari followed its big bomb with an even bigger bomb : E.T. , The Extra-Terrestrial .
Atari guaranteed Steve Spielberg a $ 25 million royalty for the game , then rushed it out in only six weeks so that it would be in stores in time for Christmas ( video games typically took at least six months to develop ) .
Then they manufacture five million cartridge without knowing if consumers would take any interest in the game .
[ YouTube Link ]
They did n’t .
The slap - dash E.T. was probably the worst product Atari had ever made , worse even than Pac - Man .
Nearly all of the cartridges were returned by consumers and retailers .
Atari ended up dumping millions of Pac - Man and E.T. game cartridges in a New Mexico landfill and then having them crushed with steamrollers and buried under tons of cement .
TOO LITTLE , TOO LATE
That same year Atari finally got around to doing what Noland Bushnell had wanted to do since 1978 : they released a new game system , the Atari 5200 .
But in the face of stiff competition from ColecoVision , which came out with Donkey Kong ( the 5200 did n’t ) and had better graphics and animation , it bombed .
Staggering from the failures of Pac - Man , E.T. , and the 5200 , Atari went on to lose more than $ 536 million in 1983 .
THE LAST BIG MISTAKE
In 1983 Atari had what in retrospect might have been a chance to revive its sagging fortunes … but it blew that opportunity , too .
Nintendo , creators of Donkey Kong , decided to bring its popular Famicom ( short for Family Computer ) game system to the United States .
The Famicom was Nintendo ’s first attempt to enter the American home video game market , and rather than go it alone , the company wanted help .
It offered Atari a license not just to sell the Famicom in every country in the world except Nintendo ’s home market of Japan , but also to sell it under the Atari brand name .
Consumers would never know that the game was a Nintendo .
In return , Nintendo would receive a royalty for each unit sold and would have unrestricted rights to create games for the system .
Atari and Nintendo negotiated for three days , but nothing ever came of it .
Nintendo decided to go it alone - and it was good choice .

For Feist , an Israeli , the anniversary is a chance to celebrate the Jewish state ’s hard - fought achievements and swap stories of survival and patriotism over a glass of local wine .
For Shamali , it is time to mourn the Nakba , or “ catastrophe ” , when 700,000 Palestinians , his own family among them , fled in fear of Jewish attacks as violence mounted .
He lives in the Gaza Strip , where Islamist rule makes alcohol taboo and an Israeli blockade cuts into any festivities .
Their opposing views on the conflict into which they were born reflect lives lived in close proximity -- they grew up about 60 km ( 37 miles ) from each other -- but worlds apart .
Shamali slept in his mother ’s arms in April 1948 as she fled the family home in Jaffa , a biblical city now a part of the Israeli city of Tel Aviv but for centuries a bustling Arab port .
He has never since set foot in his parents ’ house , but dreams of one day reclaiming it .
“ I do n’t know how or when , but one day I will go back to our house in Jaffa , ” Shamali told Reuters in an interview at his dimly lit Gaza City office .
“ I feel it in my heart . ”
The son of a German farm worker who fled Nazi Germany for a kibbutz in British - ruled Palestine , Feist was born a few months later than Shamali into the infant state of Israel , created as a haven for Jews after six million died in the Holocaust in Europe .
For Feist , Jaffa and other towns are now an inseparable part of his homeland and his view is that Palestinians gave up their rights there decades ago .
“ You ca n’t come back and say ‘ my mother used to live here 50 years ago and it is mine now ’ .
So what ? ”
Feist told Reuters at his airy apartment in Rehovot , near Tel Aviv .
“ The Arabs did n’t want to live with the Jews so they left .
No one pushed them . ”
REFUGEES
That ’s not how Shamali sees it .
When his parents and their four sons left Jaffa , they expected to return in months .
He said they had hoped violence between Jews and Arabs would abate .
It never happened .
As violence on both sides killed thousands in the months after a U.N. decision in 1947 to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states , the Shamali family and their neighbors crammed into a truck bound further down the Mediterranean coast to Gaza , outside the zone designated to Jewish control .
They slept on the beach while they hunted for lodgings .
After attending a United Nations school for refugees , Shamali built a business fixing cars and says he studiously avoided the politics and violence that shaped so many others .
But he resents Israelis for “ stealing ” his land and bristles at Feist ’s suggestion he gave up the right to his Jaffa home .
“ How can the Israelis push us out of our land and homes and bring millions of people from Russia instead ? ” he said , referring to Jewish immigration .
“ No one just leaves their house for no reason . ”
Shamali ’s garage is struggling because of an Israeli economic and military cordon meant to isolate Hamas , which seized the enclave in June .
His workshop was empty this week due to fuel shortages that have forced most cars off the road .
The spirited businessman once shuttled back and forth to Tel Aviv to collect spare parts , but has not left Gaza -- which is encircled by Israeli fences -- since Israel tightened restrictions last June .
“ The worst thing is the lack of freedom , ” he said .
TANKS
Feist also fixes vehicles -- tanks .
He began his compulsory military service just before the 1967 Middle East war in which Israel captured and occupied the Gaza Strip and West Bank , and has fought in four conflicts .
His three sons have all seen battle .
Feist now runs his own electrical business in Rehovot .
He rarely comes into contact with Palestinians and has visited Gaza only four times in his life -- three of those as a soldier , long before Israel pulled out its troops from the enclave in 2005 .
Like many Israelis , Feist views the conflict with the Palestinians as important but remote -- a serious problem but one that rarely disrupts his daily life , especially now suicide bombings have tailed off from a peak six years ago .
“ Do you know how many people get hurt in traffic ? ” he joked , as he relaxed in shorts and a T - shirt in a living room bedecked with roses .
“ Terrorism is a big problem but Israeli drivers are a much bigger problem . ”
Feist says he does not fret about much - discussed threats to the continued existence of the Jewish state and laughs if asked whether Israel will survive the next 60 years .
“ For us as Jews , the best place to live is Israel -- just like for the English , the best place to live is in England , ” he said .
“ Why should Israel not exist in 60 years ?
You do n’t talk about other countries just ceasing to exist ? ”
Despite the pride expressed by Feist and others , this week ’s festivities mask widespread disenchantment with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s government , which many Israelis view as corrupt and say has failed to protect its citizens .
Meanwhile Shamali ’s patriotism overlooks bitter rivalry between Hamas and President Mahmoud Abbas ’s Fatah faction , as well as mounting frustration at slow progress in efforts to secure Palestinian statehood .
After lives punctuated by battle , both men believe it is time to talk .
But they hold little faith in a U.S. - sponsored peace drive launched by Abbas and Olmert last year .
Both are ready for compromise and would accept a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip alongside Israel .
For Shamali , that means relinquishing his dream of return to Jaffa .
But perhaps , he says , it is worth it for the sake of his young grandson who wanders into his office as he reminisces .
“ Israel is 60 years old and during that time neither they nor us have had the chance to sleep , ” he said , ruffling the toddler ’s hair .
“ It ’s been 60 years of violence and 60 years of pain . ”
Sad but true ... animals meet their maker on the highways and byways every day .
We ’ve all seen them ... deer , raccoons , pheasants , geese , even bears from Hiking Gurus ... that happened to , ( on purpose or accidentally ) , play in traffic .
We look the other way and pretend that we did n’t see that big 12 point buck or that big old fat pheasant rooster laying on the shoulder of the road .

Explanation :
In this sweeping view , the 10 kilometer - wide crater Heimdall lies on the north polar plains of Mars .
But the bright spot highlighted in the inset is the Phoenix lander parachuting toward the surface .
The amazing picture was captured on May 25th by the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Though the lander looks like it might be dropping straight into Heimdall , it is really descending about 20 kilometers in front of the crater , in the foreground of the scene .
The orbiter was 760 kilometers away from Phoenix when picture was taken , at an altitude of 310 kilometers .
Subsequently the orbiter 's camera was also able to image the lander on the surface .
The parachute attached to the backshell and the heat shield were identified in the image , scattered nearby .
Of course , the Phoenix lander itself is now returning much closer views of its landing site as it prepares to dig into the Martian surface .

OpenGL Gems is coming out on April 15th , 2017 .
The paperback version will be available via this Amazon page , please bookmark it !
OpenGL Gems is the authorative guide on OpenGL programming published by Learning Curve / Education for software developers !
This book in 3D C++ programming series clearly , and in easy to follow language , explains fundamental principles used behind programming 3D games using the OpenGL cross - platform framework .
OpenGL Beginner 's Introduction Tutorial ( Fundamentals ,
Perspective , Projection , Camera , 3D Graphics Pipeline )
I really hope you do not just copy and paste source code from tutorials and actually study 3D graphics fundamentals and commit them to memory .
I can't stress enough how much it matters to understand basic principles first .
And the purpose of this tutorial is to go over such absolute " must - know " ideas common to graphics programming .
This article is for someone who has questions like " which direction is positive Z in OpenGL " , or " Was the game Starbound made using OpenGL ? "

Not many people would enjoy listings upon listings of source code presented without any context or general explanation of what the heck is going on .
Especially , when it comes to a vast subject such as 3D graphics programming .
However , if you take that road , eventually you will get stuck in a pool of mud .
I am not worried about that you will .
But that when you do , you will get discouraged to continue learning OpenGL , which is one of the most powerful and fantastic frameworks for creating interactive 3D graphics and computer games .
Learning 3D Graphics From Scratch
You can't copy and paste OpenGL source code built on layers of complexity , and tell me you can " make it your own , " without at least understanding the OpenGL basics and computer graphics creation as a whole .
And in the world of OpenGL , that " least " is a lot .
While the rest of OpenGL tutorials on this site are full of examples and source code , in this introduction for absolute new - comers to OpenGL , we 'll investigate some of the fundamental principles behind creating 3D graphics in general , in any language , on any platform or Operating System .
This is for those who love 3D graphics , and have lots of inspiration for creating computer games , but can't find those tutorials that , in common language , explain how the whole puzzle fits together .
However , I do understand that this is Internet .
You can come to OpenGL from any background possibly imaginable .
If you already have a good grasp of what perspective projection is and what back - face culling is , you would probably want to skip this part and go directly to download OpenGL base code page .
Better yet , you can pull it from my GitHub and fork it out .
You can follow my GitHub account , ( or you can follow me on Twitter ) if you want to stay in touch .
I do , however , still suggest reading this intro , regardless of where you 're coming from .
Because not only does it contain 3D fundamentals but also addresses some information on how this series of OpenGL tutorials are structured and why it is here .
More importantly some really basic OpenGL - related information ( like general naming convention that OpenGL uses for functions and variables ) is explained and if you do n't understand it , things will get tough for you .
Update : 04-03-2017 , as of right now OpenGL no longer supports Immediate Mode .
But for legacy and educational purposes , I left that section as part of this article .
First Fundamental Principles : 3D Graphics Rendering , Perspective , Polygons ( Triangles ) , Rasterizing , Cartesian Coordinate System , Choosing Between Perspective - Projection and Orthographic - Projection Mode , Looking Down Z - Axis ( Default or " Reset " Camera Position , ) Viewing Volume , Camera Frustum , Viewing Distance , Viewing Volume , Clipping Planes , Etc .
It is n't one ( or any ) of my goals to appear in the top 10 results in Google , but to provide a reliable source for OpenGL tutorials .
The reason is simply that I thought there was lack of detailed explanation - based tutorials out there , the kind you would see in a book .
Only this time you do n't have to buy anything ( except of course , maybe the OpenGL book " OpenGL Gems " which is founded in years of OpenGL research and interest in game development ( gamedev ) .
I wrote OpenGL Gems in addition to all of the free tutorials on this site !
It being my own book , I am a little biased , but I actually do recommend getting it only in one case .
That is , if you are passionate about OpenGL and want to actually get to know how to gain control over making things happen in 3D .
I really owe it to years of research out of personal interest .
I love making video games .
I wrote the book , simply because I liked the idea of sharing it with others .
You do n't have to get it to continue having access to the rest of tutorials on this site , but if you do you have my gratitude .
Writing tutorials ( or any other documentation or books ) is hard work and it is time - consuming .
Not everyone has the opportunity and patience to write a few solid tutorials .
But with time and patience everything is possible .
I think there 's a great deal of demand for complete 3D - tutorials that walk you through the process from start to finish .
You have a video card and it 's such a powerful device .
But the knowledge that takes to get anything done with it can be comprehensive .
With the recent advances in computer graphics hardware that can now draw millions of polygons at 60 FPS - what 's your weapon of mass rendering ?
Nvidia GTX , ATI Radeon R9 , 4 K graphics anyone ?
I did n't pick OpenGL because it was " better " or more portable than D3D ( and is it really anymore ? ) but because this is what I know about the most .
In the future I will try to document D3D as well but only if there 's enough demand ( send me an e-mail to let me know you 're interested in D3D , if you are , whoever you are ) .
Well , I think it 's time to actually start writing something useful .
3D Basics Everyone Should Know Before Touching OpenGL
In this part I will cover 3D graphics in general and most of the following topics do n't have to be constrained to OpenGL alone .
So what is exactly 3D and how can it be represented to the viewer on the computer screen ?
To describe the idea behind rendering 3D objects on the screen it 's best for me to use a 3D object .
Lets examine the following image of a wire - framed 3D cube .
For your brain ( that is if you believe the brain is the main processing mechanism behind perception ) 3D objects are so common , that by looking at this picture you will instantly recognize a " 3D " shape
Other than that , though it 's nothing more than a collection of 12 ( twelve ) 2D lines connected to each other at a certain angle between them .
Yet , it 's hard to think of this image as being " flat " or two - dimensional .
The results of 3D data rendered on the screen is always a flat picture .
What are the main requirements to render an object , so that you will be able to correctly recognize it as a 3D object ?
And not just a collection of lines ?
The idea is to render objects to the screen the way you would see them in real life .
And how do we see objects in real life ?
This is where the idea of perspective view comes from .
In the pre-computer age , artists had used the same techniques for painting their masterpieces that today 's 3D software is using for creating impressive , animated 3D graphics .
The point behind perspective is that all objects farther away from the viewer look smaller than objects closer to the viewer .
Ultimately they disappear into the " vanishing point " .
Luckily for us , OpenGL supports perspective - based rendering out of the box .
We just need to supply a list of vertices , or in other words , pack vertex data into an array and send it ( or upload ) to the GPU for residence .
And matrix calculations required to do perspective projection have been abstracted by matrix libraries .
Still , it 's nice to be aware of how these fundamentals work , as basic as they are .
3D Cartesian Coordinate System
Now lets take a look at the OpenGL coordinate system we will be using .
This is so - called 3D " Cartesian " coordinate system .
As you can see , additionally to the x and y - axis known in 2D graphics we have the z - axis which extends into negative space from the center of the screen ( from the camera , or from the " viewer " ) and into positive space from the center of the screen towards the viewer .
This image visually mimics this principle :
Perspective and Orthographic Projections
As we take little steps towards an increase in the wealth of OpenGL knowledge , I think it 's the right time to explain 3D camera projection here .
There are two primary types of camera perspective projections .
One is perspective based , the other is often used for making 2D games .
They are ... you guessed it .
Perspective Projection and Orthographic Projection .
First , I want to talk about Perspective Projection , because we 've already seen an image describing it .
Objects that you 're going to render will be actually what we might call " projected " to the screen .
Another term for this is " rendered " or " rasterized . "
Although rasterization commonly refers to the process of drawing 3D graphics in software ( without using the graphics card . )
What I mean by projection is the actual conversion from the 3D coordinates ( usually vertices of objects ) to the 2D flat surface of the screen .
Since the computer screen has only two dimensions we somehow have to display the 3D objects on the 2D screen .
And that 's precisely what projection does for us .
In OpenGL , something called Projection Matrix is used to perform this operation ( There is a matrix tutorial on this site somewhere , but we 'll get to it later . )
Mathematically , Perspective Projection works as follows .
Let 's take a single pixel to demonstrate .
Imagine we have a pixel with coordinates of ( 5 , - 3 , 2 ) on the X , Y and Z - axis respectivel and we want to project it onto the 2D screen area of certain dimension .
We can do it with the following algebra ( math ) formula .
Assume we have a C structure ( or class ) POINT3D containing the coordinates of the point initialized with the mentioned values for this example .
// Initialize point POINT3D point = { 5 , - 3 , 2 } ; //
Find the right position on the screen in 2D coordinates float x2d = ScreenWidth * point.x / point.z + ( ScreenWidth / 2 ) ; float y2d = ScreenHeight * point.y / point.z + ( ScreenHeight / 2 ) ; // Project the 3D point to the screen Pixel ( x2d , y2d ) ;
This formula does not count aspect ratio .
So it produces a slightly distorted image , on non-square screen resolutions .
Which is not a big problem , it can be adjusted and distortion is barely visible on screens whose dimensions do n't greatly diverse .
Still , we must fix this if we care about accurate image .
If width is greater than height , which is the case most of the time , you need to additionally multiply resulting X coordinate by HEIGHT / WIDTH fraction , and leave Y coordinate alone .
If the height is greater than width , do the reverse of that and multiply resulting Y coordinate by WIDTH / HEIGHT ratio .
Aspect ratio adjustments :
// Initialize point float aspect = ScreenHeight / ScreenWidth ; //
Find the right position on the screen in 2D coordinates float x2d = aspect * ScreenWidth * point.x / point.z + ( ScreenWidth / 2 ) ; float y2d = ScreenHeight * ScreenHeight * point.y / point.z + ( ScreenHeight / 2 ) ;
Let 's take the rest of the formula apart .
As you already know , usually in 2D all coordinates are based on the 4th quadrant in 2D Cartesian Coordinate system .
That means that ( 0 , 0 ) is at the upper left corner of the screen .
In 3D graphics , we want our view , or the camera to be exact , ( camera is explained a little further into this tutorial ) to be located as in the following image , so that we 're always looking straight down the negative space of the z -axis .
A Brief Introduction To Matrices
If you got this far , it 's a great idea to at least briefly mention matrices , and how they work .
No , I will not go into gritty 3D matrix details , and how to use them .
It 's just , in 3D graphics we never really will be dealing with the formula I demonstrated just above in its raw form .
It is represented as a matrix .
Do n't worry if you are not yet familiar with matrices , that 's okay .
You will gradually gain a deeper understanding of them .
What follows below is an excerpt from my WebGL Gems book , which is available on sister website ( WebGL is like OpenGL for the web - browser , be sure to check it out ! )
I just took part of the chapter from WebGL Gems to match this tutorial 's format .
Now as I said , our matrix representation of this formula will be a little different .
We can't just plug in these values and have a projection matrix .
This is due to the fact that the actual camera projection in determined by a slightly more complex set of trigonometric functions .
In fact , when we created the starfield ( check JavaScript source code by right - clicking and going to " View Source " ) , we cheated a lot by skipping worrying about near and far clipping planes , field of view angle ( or the angle of view ) and camera scaling factor .
In a real OpenGL program , we cannot do that because near and clipping planes are required arguments for perspective - projection 3D camera creation function .
Also recall that we had to divide the x coordinate by screen ratio ( height / width ) to make the objects in the view proportional to the screen without an odd skewing effect .
This effect was created by the fact that our screen is not square .
Had it been , we could avoid this calculation altogether .
Tangent Metamorphosis Into Camera's View Matrix
We will now , for the first time , factor in the FOV ( field of view ) into our camera projection calculation .
We are not changing anything .
We 're looking at the same thing from a different angle .
The tangent angle .
In order to do this we need to introduce the tangent formula into equation .
This is just a trigonometrical way of rewriting our starfield projection calculation .
Tangents work with triangles that have a 90 degree angle .
But our camera viewing angle can be anything we want .
How do we deal with this problem ?
By simply dividing any angle by 2 we can ensure that it will be part of a 90 - degree triangle .
Still do n't believe me ?
Take a look at this diagram I created :
By the way , the blue areas are invisible to the camera , even if there are objects there .
These objects lie outside of the clipping plane .
They are discarded by the 3D volume clipping algorithm .
Defining our camera perspective using the tangent of the FOV angle is important because instead of taking a wild guess , we can now choose the viewing angle of our camera lens .
In normal circumstance it can range from 45 to 90 degrees .
The approximate field of view of an individual human eye ( measured from the fixation point , i.e. , the point at which one 's gaze is directed ) varies by facial anatomy , but is typically 30 degrees up ( limited by the eye brow bone ) and about 45 degrees in both left and right directions combined .
When choosing this angle for your own games or applications , just think intuitively .
How wide should be the viewing angle in degrees ?
Anything above 90 degrees will start to look unnatural .
Instead of relying on the screen width and height we will now rely on the camera 's viewing angle or FOV .
It 's just an intuitive way to base our camera projection on .
Having said this , introducing the camera lens matrix calculation or camera 's View matrix :
1 / tan ( fov / 2 )
Literally coming from this point of view we can construct the following 4x4 projection matrix :
( 1/tan ( fov / 2 ) ) /a 0 0 0 0 1/tan( fov/2 ) 0 0 0 0 - zp/zm -(2*zfar*znear )/zm 0 0 -1 0
Where the following is true :
= camera 's viewing angle or " field of view " = distance from camera lens to near clipping plane= distance from camera lens to far clipping plane= zfar + znear= zfar - znear
Again , I do n't want you to worry much , if you do n't understand some of these calculations .
Or what the dinosauric 4x4 matrix represents .
Matrices are just grid - based sets of data , they are used to multiply a vertex data set ( X , Y , Z ) by each value in a column , for each axis respectively .
And fov ( field of view ) , znear , zfar , zp and zm are the minimum parameters required to construct our 3D camera view .
And of course ... there is " one more thing " that went into this calculation that we have n't talked about yet .
The aspect ratio .
Perspective projection construction functions usually require the following parameters to be supplied in order to create standard camera view :
Aspect Ratio :
The width / height of the screen represented by a single number .
The field of view angle .
Common examples : 45 , 90 .
Distance from camera lens to near clipping plane .
Far Clipping Plane :
Distance from camera lens to far clipping plane .
This way we are no longer tied to the limitation of our simplified math from earlier in the tutorial .
This is a solid representation of our 3D camera that gives us various levels of control over its field of view and aspect ratio .
And finally , here is what our camera model looks like from above looking down the Y axis .

( I modified it a little )
I hope that preceding explanations have cleared that fog and provided enough material to start experimenting with being a cameraman in games or applications written by yourself .
As we continue moving forward , in further examples presented throughout tutorials on this site , we will take a look at how this knowledge can be used in practice to do some interesting things .
I hope these basic principles have sunk in deep enough and provided enough mental ingredients to cook and boil on slow fire for a while .
In fact , the principles and math behind them are so simple .
It 's just a matter of focusing on the right thing .
If our patience is tested by them , then how much more impatient would we be when we study advanced subjects that require far more mental endurance than this ?
Viewing Volume and Viewing Distance
As you recall objects that appear farther from the viewer are smaller , and this is the exact relationship between the 2D points and the perspective , which is achieved by division of the both horizontal and vertical coordinates by the amount of how far away the object is .
However there is a problem .
By merely dividing the x and y coordinates by depth ( the z coordinate ) we will only get the ratio between the depth and vertical / horizontal position of the pixel .
And what we need is how they are actually related to the Viewing Distance and Viewing Volume .
These two terms are explained below .
The Viewing Volume is the space between the near clipping plane ( or the viewing plane ) and the far clipping plane as seen on the second picture below .
So , back to our equation for a second , we simply multiply x and y by ViewingDistance to get the right relationship between the viewing volume and the X and Y coordinates .
Simple as that .
Viewing Distance is closely related to the viewing volume .
The longer the viewing distance , the narrower is the line of sight and therefore the smaller the viewing volume .
Well , the good news is that we do n't have to worry about all of this in OpenGL since everything is done behind the scenes .
However , you still need to understand these terms to understand why images appear the way they appear on the screen , and I just wanted to explain the basics of perspective projection .
The above formula could be used in a software 3D rendered but we 're not interested in that at this moment .
Final Camera Projection
In summary , here 's how a few objects ( as opposed to a pixel in previous example ) would be projected onto the screen solely from 3 - dimensional vertex data representation .
At the center and a bit to the right of the camera , depicted in the next diagram , we 're seeing two spheres in two colors : orange and blue .
One slightly behind the other .
Both spheres exist in a " world coordinate system " and simultaneously being projected onto a flat 2D screen .
I tried to make the projected version of the spheres as it appears on the screen as close as possible to what it would be like .
It 's a close approximation .
Just keep in mind that the whole object is projected on the flat screen pixel by pixel ( and polygon by polygon , of course ) .
Spheres are made up of hundreds of triangles .
Regardless of what the object we 're rendering is ( cube , sphere , cone ) we 're still just rendering triangles , or discarding ones that are facing away from the camera using a back - face culling algorithm .
I talked about viewing volume and how it is related to the perspective projection equation .
But what is viewing volume ?
It is also known as the " clipping volume " or more commonly " frustum . "
In the diagram above , it is represented as the cone with the top sliced off .
It has pyramid - like structure .
This is the visible volume of currently rendered scene .
Anything outside of it will not be visible on the screen .
There are two planes , the viewing plane and the far clipping plane .
The viewing plane is actually the screen and the far plan indicates how far you can " see " , whatever is behind the far clipping plane will not be visible
The viewing volume is the space between those two planes .
The viewing volume is sometimes called clipping volume because you usually want to clip your polygons against it .
Orthographic Projection
There is another type of camera projection called " orthographic " .
The math is a little less complicated behind it .
We 're completely ignoring the scaling to Z. Objects that appear farther from the camera , will not appear smaller on the screen , but of their actual size no matter how far or close they are .
This type of projection is never used in games that require first person view , since it ignores the Z - axis coordinate completely .
Orthographic can still be used with success for making isometric games , games with unusual or skewed camera perspective , and it is absolutely the best choice for making 2D games .
In other words , if you draw a bunch of trees close and far away from the view , they will all appear the same size which is a good set up for platformers that use 2D sprites , always facing the camera .
3D Camera
At this point I should explain what camera is .
The camera is always located at the origin of the virtual " view " .
However , it is not necessarily located at the origin of the Coordinate System ( z=0 , y=0,z=0 ) since you can move the camera around and transform it to anywhere in the world space .
The camera and the view are representative of the same thing .
Camera is only mentioned to represent a " virtual " viewing point , but there is actually no physical camera anywhere around .
There is usually some space between the origin of the camera and the viewing plane ( the screen on which objects are rendered to , or the near clipping plane ) .
As you saw in the previous diagrams .
That space is the viewing distance .
If you look straight ahead into your 3D camera , you are considered to be looking down the Cartesian coordinate system 's z- axis into the " negative Z space " .
Camera rotation is possible around all 3 axis , as long as we are rotating around only one axis at a time .
Complex rotations are achieved by combining rotations around multiple axis .
Camera rotation is responsible for moving the view .
That 's what happens when you move your virtual head around with the mouse or arrow keys .
Lets examine the camera a little closer .
Camera , as any other object in space has 2 coordinate systems .
The two are the Local Coordinate System and the World Coordinate System .
The local coordinates are the camera 's rotation degrees on all of it's LOCAL xyz - axis and actual displacement from the local coordinate system ( but usually all objects are designed around their origin , or center at 0,0,0 ) .
The world coordinates specify the camera 's position in the world .
For example , when you walk around in a first - person view game , you are actually moving the camera 's coordinates in World coordinate system , and when you look around you change the camera 's local axis rotation coordinates .
Combined , the simulate illusion of walking and looking around simultaneously .
It is possible to use the local camera coordinates for moving as well by translating them to the new location .
But only before rotation transform is performed .
Rotation is done in local coordinates around ( 0,0,0 ) to keep math simple , and if you move the camera before rotating it , to say a position like [ 0 , 5 , 0 ] , it will not rotate correctly as its center will be displaced and taken into account during rotation .
Which usually results in a " wobbly " rotation effect .
Remember this rule : always rotate around the local center ( 0,0,0 ) first , and only then translate the model to some world coordinate .
This is the proper order of doing basic 3D transforms .
However , there are cases when you need to transform first , and then rotate , though not as common , and is usually reserved for more complex rotations .
If this sounds confusing , do n't worry .
It will all settle down the more you study and actually code a few basic rotations and transforms in OpenGL , if you have n't already .
Here 's how the camera 's coordinates are transformed .
If you understand this so far , that 's good .
Now , let 's move on to object rotation basics .
This is exactly the same as demonstrated on the camera rotation part of the above image .
The only difference is that we 're not viewing the world FROM that object , but are in fact OBSERVING that object from the current camera position .
This is the way an object is rotated around all of the 3 possible axis .
When we get down to actually doing it in the following tutorials , I will make it more clear , so do n't worry if you do n't get something at this moment .
Just the same way it is with the camera , the objects also have two coordinate systems and as you might have guessed already , the objects are positioned according to the LOCAL and WORLD coordinate systems .
The local coordinates are usually used for rotating the object and the world coordinates are used for positioning the object in the world or , say , in a 3D level .
Backface Culling
As you add objects and static polygons ( e.g. walls , terrain , etc. ) to your 3D world you want to clip all of the polygons that are not located in the camera 's viewing volume .
You also want to clip off parts of the polygons that are on the edge of the view volume against the bounding box of the screen .
The former is provided for us by OpenGL .
Another issue associated with drawing polygons is that you do n't want to draw the back faces ( or sides ) of the polygons when they are facing the camera .
Imagine a textured polygon which is rotated by 180 degrees so its " back " is facing us .
Let 's also assume that that polygon is a part of a bigger structure , a wall for example .
Usually you will never want to see what 's " behind " the wall .
Have you ever wanted to see what 's behind your room 's wallpaper ?
I surely hope not .
The point is , if you rotate a textured polygon , its coordinates are reversed judged against the camera view and you never want to see that anyway and that space is usually covered with another side of the wall , so why bother drawing it ?
That 's right , there is no reason to and a technique called Back - face Culling comes to our help .
Back - face culling works this way : it calculates the normal of the polygon ( a normal is a perpendicular pointing straight out of the polygon at a 90 degree angle and is very common in 3D graphics calculations ) and if it is pointing roughly in the same direction as the camera ( at least over or equal 90 degrees away from the camera ) the surface of that polygon is not rendered as illustrated in this image .
OpenGL Variable and Function Naming Conventions
In conclusion I want to say a few words on this topic .
OpenGL was made for use with various environments , not just Windows .
You can always find more information in the numerous OpenGL books that are reasonably affordable , for a technical book , considering the amount of knowledge you would have gained by the time you finished a book .
In this section I explain naming conventions for both OpenGL functions and variables .
Although you do n't have to use OpenGL - defined types I still feel obligated to describe them here so that anyone who wants their software to be platform - independent understand what this all means .
Well , lets see .
OpenGL has a number of predefined types .
If you never plan being platform - independent it might be the best way to use local C types such as int , float and double .
However if that 's not the case , OpenGL has definitions that will work on the current system whatever the system is .
All you have to do is add GL in front of the standard C types .
For example , if you want to use a floating number type use GLfloat instead of C's float and if you want to use an int , use GLint .
That works for the rest of the normal C types as well .
If you want to use an unsigned value , just add a " u " between GL and the type like so : GLuint ; is an unsigned integer .
There is also a GLboolean which is identical to bool in C. GLbitfield is used to define binary fields .
A little less obvious type in OpenGL is clamp ; its variations are clampf and clampi for floating and integer variables respectively .
It is short for ColorR AMPlitude and used for color compositions .
There are no types for pointers .
Pointers are defined the usual way .
For instance this is an array of pointers to int : GLint * i[ 16 ] ;
Each OpenGL function has a neat naming convention and its format is :
< library >< function name >< number of arguments >< type of arguments >
To demonstrate this on a real name function I will use the glVertex3f function .
glVertex3 f( 0.0f , 0.0f , 0.0f ) ; | | || | | || | | |+- f means all parameters are floats | | | | | +- 3 is the number of parameters | | | +- Vertex is the name of the function that renders a 3D point ( or a vertex ) | +- gl specifies the opengl library
The last two parameters are mostly encountered in the functions that are responsible for drawing primitives .
Many other functions are usually used in this form :
< library >< function name >
Final words
Well , what can I say , this has been a long read but this is n't even close to the full picture .
I tried however to cover most general topics that came to my mind .
This should definitely make it easier for beginners to read the rest of tutorials .
Hope the illustrations helped you in some way to understand the described topics better .
Now , sit tight and wait for the next tutorials which will actually put what 's been said in here to action !

Prices of their homes are now falling too .
Gated mansions and hillside estates have held their own through most of the real estate slump , but data released Monday showed big drops in the region ’s most exclusive neighborhoods .
Median sale prices fell by 13 % in Beverly Hills in April , compared with the same month last year .
Rancho Palos Verdes dropped 18 % over the same period , while Newport Beach ’s 92660 ZIP Code took a 34 % hit , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
Experts say these areas and others are catching up with price declines that struck first in outlying suburbs such as the Antelope Valley and the Inland Empire , where many first - time home buyers purchased their properties with sub - prime loans .

“ You ca n’t have one market hugely cheaper than another forever , ” said UC Berkeley professor Thomas Davidoff , who specializes in real estate .
Davidoff and others say the time lag stems from the fact that affluent homeowners generally do n’t have to sell under duress , unlike struggling borrowers facing escalating mortgage payments .
But wealthy homeowners are increasingly finding out that if they want to sell their homes , they will need to discount the prices .
O. Bruton Smith , an auto dealership and racetrack magnate , more than a year ago put his stately Italianate house in the Beverly Hills 90210 ZIP
Code on sale for $ 12 million .
Buyers were scarce , and so in February he cut $ 500,000 from the asking price .
In March , Smith breached what realty agents say is the Maginot line of mansions in the area :
He slashed the price to below $ 10 million , to $ 9.995 million .
That may have done the trick .

“ It ’s a psychological break point , ” Michael Libow , the agent listing the house , said of the $ 10 - million mark .
The reduced asking price has been drawing three or four potential buyers a week to see the house , Libow said , and an offer came in last weekend .
The decline in the high - end market can be seen in both the Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area markets , according to a study released Monday by First Republic Bank of San Francisco .
The weak economy suggests that prices will remain depressed for some time , said First Republic ’s president , Katherine August - deWilde .

“ People worry about their jobs and incomes -- even rich people , ” she said .
Orange County ’s more expensive neighborhoods are also seeing price declines , DataQuick figures show .
“ The market over $ 1 million has definitely changed , ” said Aliso Viejo broker Steven Thomas .
Thomas said his review of local data found that the number of Orange County homes going into escrow at selling prices above $ 1 million was down 30 % in April from a year earlier .

Foreclosures , which had been almost unheard of in high - end markets a year ago , now account for a substantial share of listings .
In Coto de Caza , where the average listing price is $ 2 million , 17 % of the 167 homes for sale are either foreclosures or “ short sales , ” in which the listing price is below the amount owed on the property , Thomas said .
In Mission Viejo and Laguna Hills , Thomas added , foreclosures and short sales make up more than 40 % of the homes for sale .
Elsewhere in Orange County , “ there is tremendous activity below $ 500,000 , ” Thomas said .
Despite the recent declines , home values in affluent areas still tend to fare better than in the region as a whole .
The median price for a home in Southern California last month was $ 385,000 , DataQuick said .
That ’s the same as it was in March but down 24 % from the $ 505,000 median a year earlier .
DataQuick said 15,615 homes sold in the six - county region last month , down 19 % from a year earlier and the lowest number of homes sold in April since 1995 .

Though sales were down from a year ago , they did increase sharply -- by 22 % -- from March , DataQuick said .
Two - thirds of that sales gain was from homes priced at less than $ 500,000 , DataQuick said , suggesting that bargain hunters are snapping up homes being sold at steep discounts or through foreclosure .
Despite widespread declines , a few high - end enclaves are seeing increases in median sale prices .
Although home values declined 18 % in Rancho Palos Verdes , for example , homes in the adjoining 90274 ZIP Code ( which includes Palos Verdes Estates , Rolling Hills Estates and Rolling Hills ) saw their values rise by the same percentage .
In Newport Beach , the coastal 92663 ZIP Code saw an April price increase of 66 % , to $ 2.49 million , DataQuick said .
However , only 10 homes were sold , which means that a few extraordinary transactions could account for dramatic percentage changes .

Expensive markets often resist declines for several reasons .
Sellers in high - priced areas often have a large amount of equity in their homes or own them outright .
That makes them more able to sit on their houses and ride out a market downturn than people desperate to unload a house with a mortgage they can’t handle .
But with the passage of time , sellers who want to move but have been waiting for a market turnaround grow weary of waiting , Berkeley professor Davidoff said .
“ It ’s like being in a teakettle .
People eventually want to get out , ” he said .
The weakening overall economy will be another likely drag on prices at the high end , said John Burns , an Irvine real estate consultant .

“ Executives are now losing their jobs too , ” Burns noted .
Finally , tighter lending standards and higher interest rates for jumbo mortgages -- those for more than $ 729,000 -- are making it harder for some people at the high end to get loans , said USC real estate professor Delores Conway .
Conway believes “ sales activity will go up if there is more liquidity . ”
But some affluent buyers say high prices , not tough credit standards , are keeping them from purchasing a home .
It ’s simple , they say : Just as in the under - $ 500,000 market , buyers will come forward in expensive neighborhoods when prices fall .

Simon Lee , a commercial real estate investor who has been shopping for a house in Bel - Air , Pacific Palisades and Brentwood , said he believes that prices in those areas are still inflated in today ’s market .
“ I think it needs a major adjustment , 25 % or 30 % , ” he said .
Lee said he was among a small group of bargain hunters scouring those Westside neighborhoods for homes priced under $ 2 million .
“ I see the same people every week at the open houses , ” he said .

An Unauthorized Bibliography
There ’s nothing new within this book ; there are no secrets .
“ It ’s nothing special , ” Bruce used to say .
And so it was n’t .
With over 750,000 copies sold in nine languages , The Tao of Jeet Kune Do is the bestselling martial arts book in modern history .
Although Bruce Lee ’s name and photo appear on the cover , dedicated fans know that he did not actually write Tao of Jeet Kune Do— at least not in its current form .
( The book is a compilation of Bruce ’s personal notes , organized and published posthumously by Dan Inosanto , Linda Lee and Gilbert Johnson . )
While credit for fighting methods expressed in Tao of JKD is rightfully given to boxer Edwin Haislet , fencers Hugo and James Castello , and others , we are left to infer that Jeet Kune Do ’s philosophical underpinnings are Bruce ’s unique contribution .
Quite the contrary , Jeet Kune
Do is an orthodox expression of Taoist , Buddhist , and Western metaphysical principles .
From the poem on the book ’s opening page , to the passionate expressions of its final chapter , ideas in Tao of JKD can be traced directly to earlier written works .
Here is a sampling of these sources .
Into a soul absolutely free
From thoughts and emotion ,
Even the tiger finds no room
To insert its fierce claws .
Inspired by the Tao Te Ching , chapter 50 : “ It is said that he who knows how to live meets no tigers or buffaloes on the road … for in him , a tiger finds nothing to lay his claws upon . ”
Turn into a doll made of wood : it has no ego , it thinks nothing , it is not grasping or sticky .
Let the body and limbs work themselves out in accordance with the discipline they have undergone .
Probably inspired by Chuang
Tzu ’s classic tale of the wooden fighting cock .
If nothing within you stays rigid , outward things will disclose themselves .
Moving , be like water .
Still , be like a mirror .
Respond like an echo . ( pg. 7 )
Lao
Tzu chapter 8 uses a water analogy to describe the highest level of human virtue .
Chuang
Tzu chapter 7 explains “ The mind of the ultimate man functions like a mirror .
It neither sends off nor welcomes ; it responds but does not retain . ”
Truth has no path .
Truth is living and , therefore , changing .
It has no resting place , no organized institution , no philosophy .
In August 1929 , spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti delivered a speech to his followers , formally dissolving their organization .
His talk was transcribed and titled Truth is a Pathless Land .
In Buddhism , there is no place for using effort .
Just be ordinary and nothing special .
Eat your food , move your bowels , pass water and when you ’re tired go and lie down .
The ignorant will laugh at me , but the wise will understand .
This is a direct quotation of Chan ( Zen ) Buddhist master Linji .
An assertion is Zen only when it is itself an act and does not refer to anything that is asserted in it .
Taken from Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki ’s essay , Practical Methods of Zen Instruction .

Author , The Art of War Sun TzuAuthor , The Art of War
Jeet Kune
Do favors formlessness so that it can assume all forms and since Jeet Kune
Do has no style , it can fit in with all styles .
As a result , Jeet Kune
Do utilizes all ways and is bound by none , and , likewise , uses any techniques or means which serve its end .
The superiority of formlessness was expressed in The Art of War ( chapter 6 ) , written two thousand years ago .
Empty your cup so that it may be filled ; become devoid to gain totality .
This is a reference to the famous koan , which can be found in the 101 Zen Stories collection .
Just as yellow leaves may be gold coins to stop the crying children , thus , the so - called secret moves and contorted postures appease the unknowledgeable martial artists .
Presenting yellow leaves as golden coins is a traditional example of the “ skillful means ” used by Zen teachers .
Such acts are intended to be compassionate , rather than cunning or ignorant as Bruce Lee implies here .
The form of an attack is generally dictated by the form of the defense used by the opponent .
In other words , between opponents of approximately the same caliber , an attack can rarely be successful unless it deceives or outwits the defense .
“ Warfare is the tao of deceit ” — Sun Tzu ’s most famous quotation .
Prajna [ wisdom ] immovable does n’t mean immovability or insensibility .
It means that the mind is endowed with capabilities of infinite , instantaneous motion that knows no hindrance .
Takuan Soho , Zen Buddhist master of 17th century Japan , gave this instruction to the Shogun ’s fencing teacher .
It was subsequently reported by D. T. Suzuki in his essay , Zen and Japanese Culture .
Let your opponent graze your skin and you smash into his flesh ; let him smash into your flesh and you fracture his bones ; let him fracture your bones and you take his life !
Do not be concerned with your escaping safely –lay your life before him !

Bruce Lee and Eric Hoffer
Eric Hoffer Eric Hoffer
We have more faith in what we imitate than in what we originate .
We cannot derive a sense of absolute certitude from anything which has its roots in us .
The most poignant sense of insecurity comes from standing alone and we are not alone when we imitate .
It is this with most of us ; we are what other people say we are .
We know ourselves chiefly by hearsay .
Secretiveness can be a source of pride .
It is a paradox that secretiveness plays the same role as boasting : both are engaged in the creation of a disguise .
Boasting tries to create an imaginary self , while secretiveness gives us the exhilarating feeling of being princes disguised in meekness .
Of the two , secretiveness is the more difficult and effective .
For the self - observant , boasting breeds self - contempt .
Yet , it is as Spinoza said , “ Men govern nothing with more difficulty than their tongues , and they can moderate their desires more than their words . ”
Humility , however , is not verbal renunciation of pride but the substitution of pride for self - awareness and objectivity .
We are told that talent creates its own opportunities .
Yet , it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities , but its own talents as well .
That we pursue something passionately does not always mean that we really want it or have a special aptitude for it .
Often , the thing we pursue most passionately is but a substitute for the one thing we really want and cannot have .
It is usually safe to predict that the fulfillment of an excessively cherished desire is not likely to still our nagging anxiety .
In every passionate pursuit , the pursuit counts more than the object pursued .
The entire contents of Tao of JKD pages 205-207 were copied verbatim from Eric Hoffer ’s book , A Passionate State of Mind !
Hoffer ’s name is not mentioned anywhere in Tao of JKD .
Bruce Lee , Plagiarist ?
Immature poets imitate ; mature poets steal ; bad poets deface what they take , and good poets make it into something better , or at least something different .
( T.S. Eliot )
In this semi- biographical movie Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story , Lee is portrayed as a noble teacher of all who would learn the martial way , regardless of race or nationality .
And The Tao of Jeet Kune
Do exhorts the martial artist to investigate the root of martial arts , rather than focusing on its various branches and leaves .
Ironically , by neglecting to acknowledge its many sources , the book makes such an investigation needlessly difficult — especially for non-Chinese who lack the relevant cultural literacy .
Perhaps this is why Jesse Glover , one of Lee ’s first students , derided Tao of JKD as “ … at best a poor joke on a great martial artist . ”
To mistake Bruce Lee for a rebel or a radical would be a mistake .
Wisely , he built his Jeet Kune
Do on the shoulders of giants ; their names are Lao Tzu , Eric Hoffer , Krishnamurti , Alan Watts , Sun Tzu and Fritz Perls .

Sixty - eight per cent of Italians , fuelled by often inflammatory attacks by the new rightwing government , want to see all of the country 's 150,000 Gypsies , many of them Italian citizens , expelled , according to an opinion poll .
The survey , published as mobs in Naples burned down Gypsy camps this week , revealed that the majority also wanted all Gypsy camps in Italy to be demolished .
About 70,000 Gypsies in Italy hold Italian passports , including about 30,000 descended from 15th - century Gypsy settlers in the country .
The remainder have arrived since , many fleeing the Balkans during the 1990s .
Another 10,000 Gypsies came from Romania after it joined the European Union in January 2007 , according to an Italian human rights organisation , EveryOne , part of the approximately half million Romanians believed to be in Italy .
Romanians were among the 268 immigrants rounded up in a nationwide police crackdown on prostitution and drug dealing this week , after new prime minister Silvio Berlusconi 's likening of foreign criminals to " an army of evil " .
But Romanian officials have sought to distinguish between the Romanians and Romanian Gypsies entering Italy .
Flavio Tosi , the mayor of Verona and a member of the anti-immigrant Northern League party , said his city had the biggest Romanian community in Italy , 7,000 strong , " working as builders , artisans and domestics .
And they themselves say the Roma are a problem , " he said .
In a second poll , 81 % of Italian respondents said they found all Gypsies , Romanian or not , " barely likeable or not likeable at all " , a greater number than the 64 % who said they felt the same way about non-Gypsy Romanians .
Young Neapolitans who threw Molotov cocktails into a Naples Gypsy camp this week , after a girl was accused of trying to abduct a baby , bragged that they were undertaking " ethnic cleansing " .
A UN spokeswoman compared the scenes to the forced migration of Gypsies from the Balkans .
" We never thought we 'd see such images in Italy , " said Laura Boldrini .
" This hostility is a result of the generally inflammatory language of the current government , as well as the previous one , " said EveryOne director Matteo Pegoraro .
" Italian football stars at Milan teams assumed to have Gypsy heritage , such as Andrea Pirlo , are now also the subject of threatening chants . "
Commenting on the attacks in Naples , Umberto Bossi , the head of the Northern League party said : " People are going to do what the political class cannot . "
The defence minister , Ignazio La Russa , said yesterday he would consider deploying soldiers to Italian streets to help fight crime , while a group of Bosnian Gypsies in Rome said they were mounting night guard patrols of their camp to defend against vigilante attacks .
Europe 's leading human rights watchdog urged the government to prevent attacks on Roma communities .
Christian Strohal , head of Vienna - based OSCE 's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights , said : " The current stigmatisation of Roma and immigrant groups in Italy is dangerous as it ... increases the potential for violence . "

Nintendo is n't the only winner to emerge from the casual - gaming revolution : Majesco Games , a New Jersey game publisher that flirted with bankruptcy just a few years ago , is making a comeback by concentrating on games for Wii and the DS handheld .
This winter , the company is working on a new game by the creators of the super - popular 1997 music game PaRappa the Rapper for the Wii .
The high - profile title marks a dramatic turnaround for a company that , just a few years ago , was in dire financial straits after its entire lineup of big - budget games bombed .
" The problem with the old Majesco was that they made three or four big bets and they missed on all of them , " Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter said .
" If one out of four worked , they probably would have been OK . "
Casual gaming – with its lower development costs and wider sea of potential gamers – is proving to be a potent market for publishers such as Majesco .
With Wii outpacing Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation 3 in sales , Majesco is focusing on fun , family - friendly games for the millions of gamers hooked on the DS and the white - hot Wii .
It 's a lesson Majesco learned the hard way .
In 2003 , the company , previously known for releasing budget software , went public and invested in a slate of console games like Psychonauts and Advent Rising , both of which sucked wind at retail .
After those failures , the company revised its business plan to take advantage of casual gaming 's lower development costs .
Majesco bailed on next - gen gaming development altogether in 2006 , canceling several games and selling others , like The Darkness and Ghost Rider .
" They had to dramatically lower their cost structure just to keep from going bankrupt , " Pachter said .
On Monday , Majesco reported an operating loss of only $ 1.7 million for 2007 , down from $ 7.7 million the previous year .
Pachter predicts Majesco will likely be profitable again within the next year on the strength of its casual - game offerings .
The comeback started when Majesco scored one of the first breakout hits for the Nintendo DS with Cooking Mama , a girl - oriented game in which players use the touch screen to roll dough , make meatballs , chop carrots and cook up different recipes .
Majesco licensed Cooking Mama from Japanese gamemaker Taito .
In its home country , the game did n't do especially well , but it exploded in the United States , selling more than 500,000 copies .
A sequel and a Wii version soon followed , and sales of the series have surpassed 1 million units , Majesco CEO Jesse Sutton said .
The focus on small , fun games has paid off for Majesco .
" They 've been pretty savvy about the games they 've decided to chase , " Pachter said .
Majesco is hoping for another winner with its upcoming Wii music game .
The company is working directly with Tokyo game designer Masaya Matsuura and New York graphic artist Rodney Greenblat , the team that gave PaRappa the Rapper its innovative look and feel .
Pachter says that while Majesco will have a small market share going forward , the company 's lower cost structure means it can make a profit off significantly lower revenues .
" Activision can't even consider making a game unless is does between $ 50 ( million ) and $ 100 million , but ( Majesco is ) happy to make a game that does $ 5 million in revenue , " Pachter said .
" Small guys can have small victories , and it works . "
It is with Russ Roberts and it covers the roots of our current crisis , why things are far more troublesome than most people expected ( and that is the really tough question ; real estate bubbles have burst before ) , why monetary policy matters at all , the tricky balancing act played by the Fed , why a gold standard is n’t the answer , and many other macroeconomic topics .
My core attitude , in case you do n’t already know it , is that monetary policy is both an art and a science and there are no secret ways of getting it right , understood by only a few .

Addendum : Arnold Kling summarizes .
A masters student researching terrorist tactics who was arrested and detained for six days after his university informed police about al - Qaida - related material he downloaded has spoken of the " psychological torture " he endured in custody .
Despite his Nottingham University supervisors insisting the materials were directly relevant to his research , Rizwaan Sabir , 22 , was held for nearly a week under the Terrorism Act , accused of downloading the materials for illegal use .
The student had obtained a copy of the al - Qaida training manual from a US government website for his research into terrorist tactics .
The case highlights what lecturers are claiming is a direct assault on academic freedom led by the government which , in its attempt to establish a " prevent agenda " against terrorist activity , is putting pressure on academics to become police informers .
Sabir was arrested on May 14 after the document was found by a university staff member on an administrator 's computer .
The administrator , Hisham Yezza , an acquaintance of Sabir , had been asked by the student to print the 1,500 - page document because Sabir could not afford the printing fees .
The pair were arrested under the Terrorism Act , Sabir 's family home was searched and their computer and mobile phones seized .
They were released uncharged six days later but Yezza , who is Algerian , was immediately rearrested on unrelated immigration charges and now faces deportation .
Dr Alf Nilsen , a research fellow at the university 's school of politics and international relations , said that Yezza is being held at Colnbrook immigration removal centre , due to be deported on Tuesday .
" If he is taken to Algeria , he may be subjected to severe human rights violations after his involvement in this case .
He has been in the UK for 13 years .
His work is here , his friends are here , his life is here . "
Of his detention , Sabir said : " I was absolutely broken .
I did n't sleep .
I 'd close my eyes then hear the keys clanking and I would be up again .
As I realised the severity I thought I 'd end up in Belmarsh with the nutcases .
It was psychological torture .
" On Tuesday they read me a statement confirming it was an illegal document which should n't be used for research purposes .
To this day no one has ever clarified that point .
They released me .
I was shaking violently , I fell against the wall , then on the floor and I just cried . "
Bettina Rentz , a lecturer in international security and Sabir 's personal tutor , said : " He 's a serious student , who works very hard and wants a career in academia .
This is a great concern for our academic freedom but also for the climate on campus . "
Students have begun a petition calling on the university to acknowledge the " disproportionate nature of [ its ] response to the possession of legitimate research materials " .
A spokesman for Nottingham University said it had a duty to inform police of " material of this nature " .
The spokesman said it was " not legitimate research material " , but later amended that view , saying : " If you 're an academic or a registered student then you have very good cause to access whatever material your scholarship requires .
But there is an expectation that you will act sensibly within current UK law and would n't send it on to any Tom , Dick or Harry . "
At its annual conference next week the University and College Union will debate a motion on " assaults on academic freedom by the DIUS [ Department for Innovation , Universities and Skills ] " .
Sally Hunt , general secretary of the UCU , said : " If we really want to tackle problems like extremism and terrorism , then we need to be safe to explore the issues and get a better understanding .
The last thing we need is people too frightened to discuss an issue or research a subject because they fear being arrested or reported . "
The higher education minister , Bill Rammell , said : " The government does not want to or has never asked for staff or students to spy on their colleagues or friends .
We want universities to work with staff and students on campus to isolate and challenge the very small minority who promote violent extremism . "
Sabir 's solicitor , Tayab Ali , said : " This could have been dealt with sensibly if the university had discussed the issue with Rizwaan and his tutors .
This is the worrying aspect of the extension of detention [ under the Terrorism Act ] .
They can use hugely powerful arrest powers before investigating . "
I ’m delighted to release Paver 0.7 .
If you missed my original announcement , the short story is that Paver is a new build , distribution and deployment scripting tool geared toward Python projects .
My original announcement and the new foreword to the docs explain the motivation .
Ben Bangert and others pointed out a giant documentation bug in 0.4 : there was a fair bit of reference doc but no doc that said “ here ’s how you get started with Paver ” .
Now there is : Paver ’s Getting Started Guide .
Paver 0.7 is a big step up from 0.4 ( hence the version number bump ) .
I implemented one of the two major features I had planned for 1.0 : distutils / setuptools integration .
It ’s really cool .
Have you ever wanted to just slightly change how “ sdist ” or “ upload ” or “ develop ” worked ?
Now you can , just by writing a function in your pavement .
py file .
And do n’t worry , you do n’t need to duplicate anything between setup.py and pavement .py .
It all just moves into pavement .py and Paver can even generate a setup.py file for you , since most people are use to the common “ python setup.py install ” command .
I ’ve gone even farther than that with making it easy to use Paver and not annoy users that do n’t yet have Paver .
Paver can create a small zip file of Paver ’s core bits so that “ python setup.py install ” will work just fine even for users who do n’t have Paver installed .
Paver can also create a virtualenv bootstrap script for you , so that users do n’t necessarily need to install your package on their systems in order to use it .
Paver ’s got new documentation tools that work great with Sphinx .
It ’s now easy to mark sections of sample code files and then include those sections in your documentation , using the built - in version of Ned Batchelder ’s Cog .
And I ’m definitely eating my own dogfood .
Paver is built using Paver itself and the source distribution includes the paver - minilib so that setup.py install should work fine ( let me know if it does n’t ! )
The new Getting Started Guide uses the new documentation tools .
There are even more changes than these , and you can look at the changelog for the full list .
Note that if you ’re using Paver 0.4 , there are a couple of trivial breaking changes .
Back in a bit .

" Now is there any new business , " says Giblets .
" Well the boat 's sinking , " says me .
" Giblets seems to recall that coming up at the last meeting , " says Giblets , " which would make that old business . "
" Well it 's more sinking - er than it was last time , " says me .
" That 's kind of new . "
" And under Old Business we agreed to form a Boat Sinking Committee to launch an investigation into the possibility of making a preliminary report on the subject of recommending the formal and official declaration of a Boat Sinking Committee , " says Giblets .
" The Boat Sinking Committee has sunk , " says me , " along with their half a the boat . "
" Well that wraps up the old business ! " says Giblets .
" Who wants a grilled cheese ! "
" The boat 's also on fire , " says me .
" Perfect , " says Giblets .
" The water from the sinking and the fire from the burning will cancel each other out , leaving us standing on dry land . "
" I feel like there 's something wrong with that but I can't put my finger on it , " says me .
" Because my finger would burn or drown . "
" Next order of business ! " says Giblets .
" Should Giblets grill his grilled cheese on rye bread or cheddar cheese loaf ? "
" See , I almost wonder if this is n't the time for grilled cheese , " says me , " what with the burning and the sinking and all the fire coming out of the cheese grill . "

" But I do n't know whether to try to put out the fire or try to bail out the boat or scream and panic and scream , " says me .
" Come to think of it this is really the kind of discussion that calls for a Boat Burning Committee . "
" Well it looks like there 's no other choice , " says Giblets .
" The motion is for the rye .
All in favor ? "
" I think the Boat Burning Committee 's first course of action should probably be to figure out if we 're on fire now , " says me .
" And if so , do we Stop Drop and Roll , do we See Something Say Something , or do we Click It or Ticket ? "
" In that an abstention ? " says Giblets .
" Cause that makes it one in favor and one abstention . "

" Any seconds ?
Anyone ? "
" Now for the new business , " says Giblets .
" Why 's it so hot in here ? "
" Now is there any new business , " says Giblets .
"
Well the boat 's sinking , " says me .
" Giblets seems to recall that coming up at the last meeting , " says Giblets , " which would make that old business .
"
" Well it 's more sinking - er than it was last time , " says me .
" That 's kind of new . " " And under Old Business we agreed to form a Boat Sinking Committee to launch an investigation into the possibility of making a preliminary report on the subject of recommending the formal and official declaration of a Boat Sinking Committee , " says Giblets .
" The Boat Sinking Committee has sunk , " says me , " along with their half a the boat .
" " Well that wraps up the old business ! " says Giblets .
" Who wants a grilled cheese ! " " The boat 's also on fire , " says me .
" Perfect , " says Giblets .
" The water from the sinking and the fire from the burning will cancel each other out , leaving us standing on dry land . "
" I feel like there 's something wrong with that but I can't put my finger on it , " says me .
" Because my finger would burn or drown . " " Next order of business ! " says Giblets .
" Should Giblets grill his grilled cheese on rye bread or cheddar cheese loaf ? " " See , I almost wonder if this is n't the time for grilled cheese , " says me , " what with the burning and the sinking and all the fire coming out of the cheese grill .

As it happens , there 's another universe in the back of the closet next to the bookshelf in the spare room .
It 's nearly identical to ours , except that in this universe , 9/11 never happened . *
Everything else is the same : George Bush , Barack Obama , Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , Yemen , Guantanamo , Bagram , the torture networks , the secret prisons , and on and on - but there were no planes crashed into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon , no yearly donning of sackcloth and ashes by politicians at ground zero , no annual pageants of official grief .
In describing our own universe to the natives , I attempted to explain the significance of 9/11 , how it changed everything forever , but they were frustratingly unable to comprehend .
The United States , they said , had spent its time killing and torturing and enslaving the world before 2001 , and spent its time killing and torturing and enslaving the world afterward as well ; the only difference was the loss of some three thousand souls , an evidently paltry cost given the American government 's valuation of human life .
I attempted to explain the situation to them again , and felt that I was close to succeeding , but our conversation was cut off by a NATO air strike .

After years of groaning unemployment and morbid obesity , America has rediscovered its love of life by killing a thing .
While the thing had killed other things , it had frequently killed the wrong kinds of things , in the wrong kinds of ways , and it was important , America felt , to kill it , along with several hundred thousand other things , to stress the point .
" There is a long and honorable tradition of killing things in America , " said the secretary of killing things .
" But this thing did not kill things in the way that things are supposed to kill things .
And so I am pleased to say that we killed it . "
While killing this thing is an important victory in America 's global war on things , America 's fight to kill things will go on .
" The killing of this thing does not mark the end of our effort to kill things , " the president of killing things said in a special statement .
" Things are still out there .
We must - and we will - remain devoted to killing things , at home and abroad . "
The thing 's corpse has been decorated with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Nobel Peace Prize , and will be married to Kate Middleton and Prince William this afternoon in an emotional public ceremony before being added to America 's collection of things America has killed , which is known to include an impressive selection of Afghans , Iraqis , Pakistanis , Yemenis , Palestinians , Latin Americans , Vietnamese , Filipinos , African slaves , Native Americans and children of all ages .

Freedom !
If there 's one thing America loves , it 's ... well , war .
But if there 's two things America loves , it 's war and torture .
But if there 's three things America loves , it 's war , torture , and genocide .
But if there are several dozen things America loves , they are war , torture , genocide , chattel slavery , apartheid , ethnic cleansing , assassination , poverty , institutionalized bribery , remote - controlled flying death robots and somewhere down the list , between prison labor and lagoons of toxic pig shit , there is almost certainly a special place in our national heart for freedom .
And so it is that the United States is fighting to free the Libyan people from the Libyan people by killing the Libyan people .
The situation is fairly straightforward , after all - Libya faces a humanitarian crisis , and the only way to address a humanitarian crisis is to bomb it with hundreds of cruise missiles .
I 'm told that the Red Cross still delivers bottled water and medical supplies by duct - taping them to the nose cone of an outgoing Tomahawk .
More importantly , the Libyan people are oppressed by a bloodthirsty dictator - a dictator who kills his own people - and the least we can do is kill those people ourselves .
How , I ask , can we stand idly by and allow people to be slaughtered by a ruthless tyrant when we could be slaughtering them instead ?
You may ask , what makes getting killed by the United States any better than getting killed by Qaddafi ?
Because we are America , killing for a great American cause , in the name of Americanness , and our murder victims , in their last moments , as their houses are burnt and their schools destroyed and their neighbors incinerated and their families turned into hamburger , will come to know our American values : of freedom , of liberty , of toxic pig shit .

" That way we preserve the fall - not just for us , but for the children . "
" But I 'm not real sure why I moved into last year in the first place , " says me .
" I mean I was pretty happy in the year before that , and the year before that was even nicer .
And now that I think about it I really coulda spent the last twenty years or so living in that day in third grade when I kicked the winning ball in kickball and went on to win the school spelling bee . "

Well now .
Israel , the Palestinians , and Gaza .
It 's a sad story , and we 're terribly sorry about it all , of course , feeling pronounced Official Regret in our pronounced Official Regretbones , and we feel compelled at this juncture to demand a request for an investigation into the possibility of an inquiry into the formation of a select bipartisan panel looking into whether or not to request an investigation .
Which would be conducted by Israel , of course .
No need to get too pushy here .
Now , you might say this week 's events represent an atrocity , a massacre , a savage and criminal slaughter of humanitarian aid workers by a paranoid , murder - happy police state to further prolong the suffering of a million and a half refugees penned up in an open - air concentration camp .
And you 'd be right .
But what you'd be overlooking is the fact that Israel has a right to defend itself .
In particular , Israel has the right to defend itself from the millions of non-Israelis stubbornly living on land seized from them by Israel .
Indeed , every day the Middle East 's Only Democracy finds itself surrounded by a deadly horde of beggars , children and amputees who would stop at nothing to live next to it , with nothing to defend itself but two hundred nuclear warheads and one of the best - financed militaries in the world .
Who in that position would n't attack a flotilla of aid ships attempting to smuggle contraband food and terrorist medicine to the stockpile of potentially rogue humans in Palestine ?

Literally tens of Americans were shocked this week to discover that
Now , is this video disturbing ?
Of course .
Were atrocities committed , innocents slaughtered , corpses desecrated and children maimed ?
Absolutely .
But was it all done according to proper procedure ?
Ah , now , that 's the question .
We should all certainly be willing to support a full and complete investigation into the possibility of an official recommendation for preliminary motions toward an investigation , looking into the matter of whether or not the people here were properly murdered in triplicate , signed twice on the goldenrod form , in accordance with the Code of Canon Law .
And we should n't rest until any guilty parties have been found , and strongly - worded disciplinary Post - Its firmly applied to their personnel files .
Apart from that , I do n't think we have to spend much time thinking about this sort of thing - this is an isolated incident , just like Literally tens of Americans were shocked this week to discover that the United States military likes to kill people .
Unsettling news , yes , particularly for those of us who had assumed in good faith that one million Iraqis had accidentally slipped on a banana peel one morning and fallen into a pile of mislaid cruise missiles , but before we leap to all sorts of unsightly conclusions , calling Our Boys " mass- murderers " just because they happen to enjoy the occasional mass - murder , let 's remember that in the fog of war with the eggs and the omelettes and the War Is Hell , who can say what 's right and wrong , what 's good and evil , who 's an unarmed pregnant woman and who 's a ticking time bomb threatening to produce future foreigners ?
Our troops have a job to do , after all - defending our country from those countries who would defend their country from our country - and if we hounded and nit - picked them after every little massacre , gang rape or atrocity , they 'd hardly get any killing done at all .
Now , is this video disturbing ?

Apart from that , I do n't think we have to spend much time thinking about this sort of thing - this is an isolated incident , just like this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this - and one has to accept a certain amount of rape , torture and murder with one 's military .
After all , if the military was n't free to rape and torture people , then it certainly would n't be free to murder them ; and if the military was n't free to murder people , then it would n't be free to slaughter them en masse ; and if the military was n't free to slaughter people en masse , then what would we even have a military for ?

So I guess I musta slept late or forgot the alarm or hit the snooze too many times or somethin cause when I wake up this mornin I 'm in the future .
The future 's a lot like the present only it 's older and more used up .
The streets are dusty and the the cars are pre-crashed and the ground 's retired and the sky 's closed for repairs so most people just stay inside and break things at home .
I go out to get some breakfast but when I get there I 'm already there .
" Pleased to meet you , future me , " says me .
" I know , I remember , " says future me .
" Future Giblets wants waffles , " says future Giblets but all the waffles have already been eaten by those bastards in the past .
There 's not much to do so we head out to the movies .
It 's a remake of a sequel of a spinoff of a show about a show about the time we saw this show .
" Looks pretty good , " says me .
" Ehh , I seen it before , " says future me .
" Future Giblets wants jujyfruits , " says future Giblets .
We head out to the lobby to get some snacks but by the time we get there we 've already had em .
We spend most a the afternoon diggin around in the backyard for scraps .
I find half a Saturday morning and an old arrowhead an part of a used July but the guy at the scrapyard says he can only give us six - fifty for em on accounta they 're all covered with people .
We figure we 'll get some ice cream on the way home but the ice cream 's all melted and the truck 's broken down and the ice cream man 's been eaten by thousands of tiny mice so we settle for some popsicles instead .
The next day we take a bus to the past .
They 're closed when we get there so we end up campin out in fronta the ticket booth with some woolly mammoths and a dodo .
" Future Giblets wants an omelette , " says future Giblets .
" Waawk , " says the dodo .

Connect with Your Creative Writer
Photo by Cindy Loughridge
Do you have to complete a piece of writing but are putting it off ?
A report , a blog article , or a letter ?
Are you finding that the moment you sit down to write , your mind seems to go blank ?
Crap !
Writers block !
What can you do about it ?
Although , the term writers block is popular , this feeling of blockage and mind blanking is not specific to writing , but of any creative feats .
Other examples include , brainstorming for a new business , dancing , musical performances , music composition , painting or photography .
I ’ve personally experienced this during my photography work , blanking out as I stand in front of a client waiting for me for direction .
I call these Creative Blocks , where your mind just comes up empty and you feel lost .
It ’s purely mental .
Through practice and observation , I ’ve gotten pretty good at getting past these blank moments , and this article shares some insights for unlocking your creativity .
Throughout the article , I will be using writing as the example , but keep in mind that it is equally applicable to any creative activity .
Creativity & Mental Blocks
Before digging into how we can unlock these creative blocks , here are some observations on the subject of feeling mentally blocked .
The more we Think about it , the worse it becomes .
The more we think about not knowing what to write , the stronger the feeling of not knowing what to write , the harder is it to come up with creative and original content .
Creativity is a miraculous interaction of the mind and spirit .
Regardless of how we label it , I believe it is inter - linked with spiritual realm of things ( not religion ) .
Talk to any exceptional artists and they ’ll explain that the creative space is comparable to that of no-mind spiritual state .
My brilliant cellist friend once explained it perfectly , “ that place in you which is infinite and unexplainable and nothing physical can compare to that space .
When I am in that place , all thoughts clear out .
It ’s just me and the field of infinity . “
We all have the capacity within us to access this place of infinite creativity .
However , what may be blocking us is our mind , our thoughts , the inner noise created by ourselves , consciously and unconsciously .
When we are working in that creative space , we are experiencing flow .
We feel happy , content , and passionate .
Time just flies .
Think of the last time you were deeply in joy with writing , creating something or deeply immersed in a project .
What did that feel like ?
There is no such thing as “ I am not a creative person “ , it may only be the case because we keep telling ourselves that .
Creativity is something that can be cultivated .
We are born with access to the creative space , some of us may be more in - tuned to it , but it is never too late to get in touch with that side of ourselves .
When we need to produce something creative on a deadline , we may succumb to fear and start to procrastinate .
Our thoughts get in the way sometimes , because we are afraid that we wo n’t be able to produce quality result in time , and so we push it away .
How to Overcome Writer ’s Block
From my experience as a writer , I ’ve learned that unless I was exceptionally inspired to write about a particular topic , I will experience writer ’s block every single time .
Sitting in front of a blank screen , my mind chatter would fire off random and discouraging thoughts .
Ones like the following :
How should I start the article ?
Errr.. I donno .
How to structure the body ?
Can this article be as good as the last ?
Crap , I do n’t know what to do .
I do n’t feel very good .
I think I ’m gonna check email .
And to get a drink after that .
I ’ll delay this a bit more .
Can you relate ?
If so , you are not alone .
It is quite normal to hear mind chattering .
As widespread and as ‘ normal ’ as these self - destructive thoughts , they are not the problem .
The problem is when we start to believe in these thoughts .
The secret to overcoming writer ’s block is simple , and that is to just do it .
Literally !
Here ’s a simple stepped process that I follow when doing any sort of writing :
Step 1 : Awareness –
At any point during the following steps , you may be interrupted by your mind chatter yapping in the background .
When you hear him or her , just say , Thank you for sharing .
And continue on with what you ’re doing .
Step 2 – Topic Selection –
When selecting a topic , always choose one that you align with , closely .
Preference goes to topics that you are personally experiencing now or in a recent past .
Being able to emotionally connect with what you ’re writing about is the seed for inserting that passion into your writing .
Passion adds energy into a piece of writing and makes it come alive .
If you do not connect with the available topics and you do n’t have alternative options , visualize what it would feel like to be passionate about that topic .
Step 3 – Brainstorm & Capture Random Ideas – Spend 5 - 10 minutes to list out everything you can possibly talk about for this topic .
List out all ideas , thoughts , sentences that come to you .
List in bullet points and do so as fast as possible .
Do not judge the thoughts that come to you , write everything down .
No editing , just listing .
Do n’t worry about spelling , structure , or grammar .
You can always delete them later .
The point of this step is getting as many ideas down as possible .
Also , this step helps you to get into the flow and rhythm of creative thinking .
Step 4 – Roughly Organized the Flow – See if you can move some of the thoughts from last step into meaningful groupings .
It does n’t have to be perfect or finalized .
This step helps you to organize your thoughts a bit and starts to create a sense of logical flow .

Step 5 – Jumping
Over the Block – Start writing your opening paragraph without too much editing .
Your first attempt might suck , and you will hear yourself shouting that in your head .
Ignore them and continue to write without caring about how it sounds .
Do n’t bother erasing , just keep going .
If you want to rephrase a paragraph , just write it above the old paragraph without removing the old paragraph .
No perfection here , we ’re just getting thoughts in paragraph form .
Do n’t worry about tweaking , do that later .
The point of this step is to create the article flow .
I ’ve found that often time , we get stuck at properly re-wording a sentence .
In the end , we ’ve spent so much time tweaking every detail that we still do n’t know how the writing will flow .
The important point here is to just write and get your ideas down in paragraph form , regardless of how sloppy or casual a paragraph may sound .
You can always come back to perfect the paragraphs later , or re-write them once you have the important ideas down .
Step 6 : Going with the Flow – After doing step 5 for a while , you will find an emotional connection with your writing .
For me , this typically takes about 3 - 5 paragraphs of just writing without editing , at which point , words and nicely phrased sentences would flow out of me , effortlessly .
Now , follow that flow .
Either continue to write the rest of the article draft , or go back to re-phrase previously written paragraphs .
Step 7 : Keep a Scratch Pad –
As you come up with better ways of re-phrasing ideas , take your old wordings and paste them into a separate file known as the scratch pad .
For example , I keep a file on my laptop called “ blah.doc ” which acts as my scratch pad of random paragraphs and sentences during writing .
As useless as they may seem , they can pose as a pointer to the original idea .
Even if the original phrasing is rough around the edges and not presentable , keeping the words mean no ideas are lost .
Step 8 : Rephrasing & Trimming the Extra Pounds –
Go through the article several times .
At each sentence , ask yourself whether you can better phrase the sentence using less words ?
Add clarifying sentences only when you feel that it adds to the article .
Do paragraphs sound verbose and not add value to your writing ?
If so , cut it out .
Tips for Unlocking Creativity
In addition to the steps above , here are the habits and tips which have helped me get more in - tuned with my inner creativity :
Follow Your Heart – Being inspired and passionate about what you ’re creating is like swimming with the waves , they help push you in the direction you want to go without too much extra effort .
Equally , when you ’re creating something you do n’t have much passion for , is like swimming against the waves , you can get back on the shore , but you ’ll have to work a lot harder , while spending more energy doing so .
Tell the Truth – If you aim for truth without letting your ego take center stage , you will find that brilliance results as a side effect to your efforts .
Practice candidness and speaking honestly , your authenticity will shine through and people will know because they too can feel it .
Here ’s a sweet quote you might like : “ Even in literature and art , no man who bothers about originality will ever be original : whereas if you simply try to tell the truth ( without caring two pence how often it has been told before ) you will , nine times out of ten , become original without ever having noticed it . ” ~ C.S Lewis Keep a Notebook at all Times – Always carry some form of paper and pen with you .
You will never know what strokes of inspiration you ’ll encounter as you enter the realms of everyday life .
Writing Down Ideas –
We tend to get creative ideas during the week at times when we are not in front of the computer .
Make a habit of writing everything down in your notebook , everything from inspirational quotes , to ideas that strike you , to personal thoughts and observations .
For example , for this blog , I keep a doc containing a list of topics for future articles , and I add to this list whenever I feel that passion kicking in my heart about some new topic .
Inviting Creativity – When we get ideas , often our mind is so loud that we do n’t notice them .
Even when we notice these ideas , we start judging them .
We would come up with reasons why they would n’t work .
However , when we do this , we are really sending messages to our unconscious mind that we ’re not interested in receiving notices of creative ideas .
And we stop receiving them as often .
Make a habit of seeking creative ideas , and create a space that welcomes them without judgment when they come , noting them down and give gratitude for having received them .
Give it Time – Send out a clear intention on what you would like to create and think about it over the next few days .
You ’ll find that once the intent is sent , you ’ll start receiving related ideas at random times .
Make sure you write everything down as it comes .
You ’ll be thankful you did .
Establish an Enjoyable Routine –
We are creatures of habits and we are strongly subjective to associations .
It ’s a good idea to create a routine or ritual around when you write or do anything creative .
With time , your mind will associate the routine with falling into a creative space .
My personal routine is : having hot tea , listening to ambient music without singing , and having a blanket or my little dog covering my lap .
It ’s true ! :)
Meditate – I cannot emphasize enough the benefits meditation and spending alone time for gaining mental clarity and easier access to your creative space .
There are some fantastic guided meditation audio at Zencast , free of charge .
For starters , just start with 5 - 10 minutes of silent time every morning with complete focus on your breath .
Practice , Practice , Practice –
The more we do something , the better we get .
Period .
Not only do we get better , it becomes easier , or rather , we adapt to it .
The more opportunity we spend in that creative space , the easier it will be to fall into it next time .
It ’s like anything else .
Photo by Katsuaki Shoda Exposure –
If you want to be good at something , expose yourself to it as much as possible .
If you want to become a better writer , read powerful and inspirational writing , often .
If you want to be a photographer , check out publications from photographers whose work you connect with , or inspires you .
Find someone with the kind of results you want , and model the positive traits they have .
Assimilate these traits and develop them into your own style .
Remove Distractions –
There ’s nothing like being interrupted while you ’re in the zone .
Once you are interrupted , you need to spend extra time in order to get yourself back in that state again .
If you ’re about to get in your creative zone , it ’s a good idea to get rid of all potential interruptions .
Turn off the TV , put your phone on mute , do n’t answer the door , put pets in another room , let your spouse known what you ’re up to , etc. Just Be Yourself –
When you try hard to sound good , you ’ll come off sounding unauthentic , and people are sensitive to that .
Do n’t try to be anything , just BE .
Be in the moment as you are , right now .
And from where we are , see what unfolds in this moment .
Cross - train –
Think of the creative space as an infinite field of energy and intelligence .
The activities we consider to be creative endeavors , such as writing , drawing , dancing or playing instruments , are simply tools that give us glimpses into that space .
And when we practice other creative activities , we access different channels to the same stream of energy .
Try doing something creative that frightens you or you do n’t have much experience with .
Go dancing or take a salsa class if dancing is n’t your thing .
If you do n’t think you ’re a good writer , write a personal letter to yourself , make it introspective and intimate .
If you feel that the best you can draw are stick figures , you have to check out this book : Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain and workbook .
Phenomenal book on developing the creative side of your brain .
What do you do that makes you feel creative ?

Talk soon .
AT&T's new chief technical officer , John Donovan , wants you to know that his company does not , under any circumstances , slow down BitTorrent users or throw other monkey wrenches in the operation of specific applications .
" No .
Never have .
No interest in it .
It 's never been our policy , " Donovan told Wired.com when asked if AT&T engaged in packet shaping ( the process of slowing down or blocking certain applications ' data packets to render them less efficient ) .
The statement stands in contrast to other ISPs , such as Comcast , which has , a lawsuit alleges , blocked BitTorrent traffic .
Comcast has stated that it does not block any websites , applications or peer - to - peer services .
Other ISPs , such as Canada - based Rogers , have been observed injecting their own content into internet data , in order to modify the appearance of Google 's homepage , for instance .
Donovan did , however , indicate that AT&T will begin testing usage - based pricing starting this Fall .
That 's driven by the economics of building network capacity , he says , not by an attempt to make more money .
According to Donovan , one percent of the company 's customers account for 20 percent of the network usage ; the top five percent account for 40 percent of the usage .
Because the network must be able to accommodate peak traffic loads , AT&T – like other network providers – finds itself building far more capacity than most users need , just support the most prolific users .
" It 's almost a taxation issue , " Donovan said , comparing the overhead required to support the top 1 percent with the annual taxes the corporation must pay .
" Traffic on our backbone is growing 60 percent per year , but our revenue is not , " he said .
Usage - based pricing trials will be , he says , an attempt to encourage greater efficiency in the way customers use capacity .
" I do n't view any of our customers , under any circumstances , as pirates – I view them as users , " Donovan said .
" A heavy user is not a bad customer . "
What he wants to do is gently encourage more efficient usage of his network , and usage - based pricing may be one of the ways that happens .
Such measures may not even be necessary , as Donovan admits that users self - adjust their habits to take advantage of off - peak times .
For instance , he said , BitTorrent on the company 's network peaks around 4 a.m. , when other traffic is at an ebb .
Overall P2P traffic accounts for about 20 percent of the network 's usage , Donovan said .
But really , he 'd rather talk about the massive increase in bandwidth that the company is planning .
On the wireless front , AT&T is currently in the midst of a 3 - G upgrade , based on HSPA technology , that will take over - the - air download speeds from 1.7
Mbps now to 7 Mbps in the next phase and , finally , to 11 Mbps .
( The company did not provide specifics on when these speeds would be in effect . )
Starting in 2012 or 2013 , the company will begin its deployment of fourth - generation " Long - Term Evolution " ( LTE ) technology , which promises speeds of up to 100 Mbps .
For wired internet access , Donovan boasted of a recently - upgrade backbone that 's now capable of 40 Mbps , and stated that the company is in the process of deploying fiber optic networks to people 's homes , starting with all new housing developments .
It 's not just about fat pipes , either : AT&T also wants to bring you content and applications .
Top of the list is internet video , with new interfaces that will let you watch any video content online – not just cable TV channels – on your television .
" We should be able to radically reshape the interface for TV , " Donovan said .
" The remote will be dead .
The channels will be dead .
If all the historical video is available online there 's no reason we can't organize that for you . "
Even though it aspires to become a content provider , the company is also open to allowing other companies to offer competitive content and applications over AT&T 's data lines , Donovan said .
Donovan did not address questions relating to the company 's alleged data connections with the National Security Administration .
Wired.com reported in 2006 that the company provided NSA officials with full access to customers ' phone calls and internet traffic via a secret monitoring closet , a claim that the company has not confirmed nor denied .
AT&T officials insisted that anything related to the company 's involvement with the NSA was off the table , as a precondition of the meeting with Wired.com .
Also , Donovan did not offer any specifics on the company 's possible plans to monitor network traffic for copyright violations , as public policy chief James Cicconi suggested it might .
Donovan said such monitoring was technically possible , and could be targeted either at specific applications or at specific copyrighted content , via deep packet inspection .
However , he said the company was not currently monitoring such usage on an individual customer level .

Expanding Washington ’s influence industry by 8 percent in 2007 , industries and interests spent $ 17 million for every day Congress was in session .
The drug industry spent the most of all , paying lobbyists 25 percent more last year .
WASHINGTON– Corporations , industries , labor unions , governments and other interests spent a record $ 2.79 billion in 2007 to lobby for favorable policies in Washington , the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has calculated .
This represents an increase of 7.7 percent , or $ 200 million , over spending in 2006 .
And for every day Congress was in session , industries and interests spent an average of $ 17 million to lobby lawmakers and the federal government at large .
“ At a time when our economy is contracting , Washington ’s lobbying industry has been expanding , ” said Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the 25 - year - old watchdog group .
“ Lobbying seems to be a recession - proof industry .
In some respects , interests seek even more from our government when the economy slows . ”
CRP , which tracks lobbying spending on its award - winning Web site , OpenSecrets.org , found that , for the second straight year , health interests spent more on federal lobbying than any other economic sector — $ 444.7 million .
The finance , insurance and real estate sector was second , spending about $ 418.7 million .
Looking more specifically within the larger sectors the Center tracks , the pharmaceuticals / health products industry outspent all industries by shelling out $ 227 million for lobbying services , or an average of $ 1.4 million for the 164 days that the 110th Congress met in 2007 .
The drug industry has spent $ 1.3 billion on federal lobbying over the last 10 years , more than any other industry .
Its reported lobbying increased 25 percent in 2007 .
The second - biggest spender among industries in 2007 was insurance , which spent $ 138 million on lobbying , followed by electric utilities , which spent $ 112.7 million , the computers / Internet industry , which spent $ 110.6 million , and hospitals and nursing homes , which paid lobbyists at least $ 90.5 million .
The securities and investment industry , which ranked sixth , spent $ 87.3 million , increasing its lobbying 40 percent over 2006 .
Drilling even further to look at particular corporations , trade associations , unions and other organizations , the biggest spender in 2007 was again the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Although the business booster ’s reported lobbying decreased about 27 percent last year , following a record year in 2006 , the Chamber and its affiliates still managed to spend nearly $ 52.8 million on in - house lobbyists and with K Street firms .
General Electric was the number - two spender ( $ 23.6 million ) , followed by three interests in the health sector : the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( $ 22.7 million ) , American Medical Association ( $ 22.1 million ) and the American Hospital Association ( $ 19.7 million ) .
Other big spenders on the Top 20 list included AARP , Exxon Mobil , AT&T , General Motors , the National Association of Realtors , Verizon Communications and several defense contractors , Northrop Grumman , Boeing and Lockheed Martin .
The amount of money spent on federal lobbying has increased about 8 percent annually since the late 1990s , making last year ’s growth typical .
But some interests vastly increased their lobbying in 2007 .
Blackstone Group , the private equity firm lobbying to prevent higher taxes on its profits , ramped up 477 percent to spend $ 5.4 million .
The National Education Association , the nation ’s largest teacher ’s union , spent $ 9.2 million last year — up 464 percent — and presumably focused its lobbying on the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind act .
Among Washington ’s lobbying firms , Patton Boggs reported the highest revenue from registered lobbying for the fifth year in a row , $ 41.9 million , an increase over 2006 of more than 20 percent .
The firm ’s most lucrative clients included the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management , the candy and pet food company Mars Inc. , telecom giant Verizon , the pharmaceutical manufacturers Bristol - Myers Squibb and Roche , and the American Association for Justice ( formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America ) .
The Center for Responsive Politics calculated spending on lobbying as narrowly defined under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 , because that is what is disclosed to the Senate Office of Public Records ( SOPR ) and House Legislative Resource Center .
Spending by corporations , industry groups , unions and other interests that is not strictly for lobbying of covered government officials , but is still meant to influence public policy , is not reported — and may exceed what was spent on direct lobbying .
Such activities include public relations , advertising and grassroots lobbying .
Spending on lobbying was reported twice a year to Congress in 2007 .
The year - end reports were due Feb. 14 to SOPR , which was the data source for the Center ’s analysis .
The Center ’s Lobbying Database on OpenSecrets.org now includes approximately 42,000 reports from 2007 that were available electronically from SOPR on April 7 , in addition to data back to 1998 .
Despite SOPR ’s new electronic filing system , it still took about eight weeks for complete year - end lobbying data to become electronically available to the public .
Beginning this year , lobbying reports will now be filed quarterly .
April 21 is the deadline for reports covering lobbying in January through March of this year .

If we could extract all the geothermal energy that exists underneath the United States to a depth of two miles , it would supply America ’s power demands ( at the current rate of usage ) for the next 30,000 years .
Getting at all that energy is not feasible — there are technological and economic impediments — but drawing on just 5 percent of the geothermal wealth would generate enough electricity to meet the needs of 260 million Americans .
The Department of Energy ’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) asserts that reaching that 5 percent level , which would produce 260,000 megawatts of electric power and reduce our dependence on coal by one - third , is doable by 2050 .
So what is holding us back ?
Tapping geothermal energy means facing the harsh realities of thermodynamics :
Typically , geothermal electricity is generated when hot water or steam underground is piped to the surface to drive a turbine , usually through heating an intermediate working fluid that actually turns the turbine ’s blades .
The turbine drives a dynamo that then produces the electricity .
Crucially , the temperature of the piped - up water dictates the efficiency of a turbine - based system : the hotter the better , with a minimum of about 200 degrees Fahrenheit needed .
But there is a limited number of geothermal hot spots that naturally contain water and that heat it to such high temperatures at accessible depths .
Probably the best example of one in the United States is The Geysers .
In a valley 72 miles north of San Francisco , steam billows from the earth ’s surface .
( This prompted the first European visitor to the site , in 1847 , to believe he had discovered the gates of hell . )
An elaborate array of gleaming metal pipes brings steam up from underground to drive turbines that generate 850 megawatts of electricity .
California , Nevada , Idaho , and Oregon all have enough high - temperature hot spots to potentially meet a significant portion of their electrical demand — as much as 60 percent in the case of Nevada — but rarely are the temperatures as high as at The Geysers , which produces steam of 400 degrees and hotter .
Most of the time , developers have to look as far as six miles below ground to locate hot , flowing liquids .
Finding suitable drill sites can be a big headache .
Doug Glaspey , chief operating officer of U.S. Geothermal , an Idaho - based company that just finished building a 13 - megawatt geothermal electrical plant in southern Idaho , says he wishes he had “ X - ray vision , so I could see where the reservoirs are .
The highest - risk part of this business , bar none , is searching for reservoirs .
Drilling a well costs two to three million dollars per well .
If it fails , you got nothing . ”
Moreover , once companies hit a good hot spot , they still have to set up a power plant or a heating system , which requires big up - front costs and multiple wells .
Glaspey estimates that it costs “ $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million per megawatt ” to build a geothermal power station .
In addition , geothermal power plants have energy efficiencies of just 8 to 15 percent , less than half that of coal plants .
High up - front expenses plus relatively low efficiency makes the cost of geothermal electricity about double that of coal , which sells for around five cents per kilowatt - hour .
Gerald Nix , recently retired geothermal technologies manager at the NREL , believes that improving exploration and drilling technologies could make geothermal power cheaper than coal , however .
Current attempts to refine these technologies fall under the banner of engineered geothermal systems ( EGS ) , which can squeeze heat out of spots where the rock is not porous or permeable enough for water to circulate , or where there is not enough water in the first place .
EGS uses techniques such as reopening old fissures in the rock , and then pumping water through the fracture .
EGS could contribute at least 100,000 megawatts to the U.S. geothermal power budget by 2050 , according to a 2006 report , “ The Future of Geothermal Energy , ” written by a team led by MIT chemical engineering professor Jefferson Tester .
What is desperately needed to advance EGS , Tester says , are large - scale demonstration projects .
“ It ’s not as if we do n’t know how to drill holes and fracture rocks , ” he says , “ but we have to demonstrate EGS on a scale that would be useful for commercial enterprise . ”
Uses for geothermal energy go beyond generating electricity : Geothermal sources not hot enough to make electricity efficiently can heat buildings by circulating water through pipes .
This country has a swath of such lower - temperature hot spots .
Draw a line from North Dakota to Texas , and nearly every state west of that line has sources with temperatures of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit .
Even without a handy hot spot , the ground can be tapped to reduce our need for fossil fuels .
All of the United States ’ soil is suitable for a technology known as geothermal heat pumps , which transfer heat from the ground to homes in the winter and reverse direction to provide cooling in the summer .
Heat pumps have the potential to provide nearly all U.S. households with heat and hot water .
In fact , the amount of thermal energy in the ground available for heating — more than a million megawatts — dwarfs the amount available for electricity generation .
Yet , according to the NREL , we use less than 1 percent of that .
The reason : a lack of research investment .
The tide seems to be turning in favor of geothermal energy in the U.S .
Geothermal energy research has been a victim of poor funding for years .
Consequently , much of our technology dates back to the 1970s , when the oil crisis spurred an interest in geothermal energy .
At that time , the U.S. Geological Survey sifted through its vast collection of data to determine the extent of the resource , while big oil and power companies invested in power plants such as the one at The Geysers .
When oil prices dipped in the 1990s , the tide went out on all types of renewable energy .
At the Department of Energy ( DOE ) , geothermal funding plunged from $ 100 million in the 1980s to a little more than $ 20 million in recent years .
Competing with oil and gas exploration for geological expertise , and with only minimal backing from the government , U.S. geothermal projects largely became the realm of small companies in the West .
Elsewhere around the globe , aggressive public policy has pushed geothermal success .
For example , Iceland ’s energy policy has emphasized geothermal power since the 1970s .
As a result , 85 percent of Icelandic houses are heated geothermally , and five geothermal plants now provide almost a quarter of the country ’s electricity .
With climate concerns , oil prices , and energy security now on everyone ’s mind , the tide seems to be turning again in favor of geothermal energy in this country .
The 2007 Energy Act authorized the DOE to spend $ 95 million for geothermal research ( although Congress has appropriated only a fraction of that so far ) .
Unfortunately , the Energy Act failed to extend tax credits for renewable energy producers , which are crucial , MIT ’s Tester says , given the initial costs of finding geothermal resources and setting up plants .
But the private sector is beginning to push geothermal energy in the United States , too .
Last year renewable energy developers paid millions of dollars in land leases for geothermal development in the Northwest .
The huge untapped geothermal potential in the United States is also grabbing international attention .
Last September the Nordic financial group Glitnir announced that it plans to invest $ 1 billion in the U.S. geothermal market over the next five years .
Even the big oil companies are starting to pay attention .
Nix says that representatives from ExxonMobil , Shell , and Chevron have attended recent EGS workshops .
Furthermore , construction companies are noticing that there is money to be made with heat pumps .
( Although installing one entails a higher initial cost than a natural gas furnace , a pump will pay for itself in 10 years . )
The California Energy Commission estimates the cost of a pump to be about $ 7,500 for an average - size home .
Currently roughly 1 million pumps are installed in the United States , and 50,000 to 60,000 pumps are being added every year .
In total , more than 3,400 megawatts of geothermal power is currently under development in the United States , according to the Geothermal Energy Association .
With the right backing , the heat beneath us could help keep the planet from warming up .

Summary
In this article , which is based on Chapter 1 of the book ,
In this article , which is based on Chapter 1 of the book , Programming in Scala , you 'll get an overview of the Scala language and insights into its design .
The name Scala stands for “ scalable language . ”
The language is so named because it was designed to grow with the demands of its users .
You can apply Scala to a wide range of programming tasks , from writing small scripts to building large systems .
Scala is easy to get into .
It runs on the standard Java platform and it interoperates seamlessly with all Java libraries .
It ’s a great language for writing scripts that pull together Java components .
But it can play out its strengths even more for building large systems and frameworks of reusable components .
Technically , Scala is a blend of object - oriented and functional programming concepts in a statically typed language .
The fusion of object - oriented and functional programming shows up in many different aspects of Scala ; it is probably more pervasive than in any other widely used language .
The two programming styles have complementary strengths when it comes to scalability .
Scala ’s functional programming constructs make it easy to build interesting things quickly from simple parts .
Its object - oriented constructs make it easy to structure larger systems and to adapt them to new demands .
The combination of both styles in Scala makes it possible to express new kinds of programming patterns and component abstractions .
It also leads to a legible and concise programming style .
Because it is so malleable , programming in Scala can be a lot of fun .
This initial chapter answers the question , “ Why Scala ? ”
It gives a high - level view of Scala ’s design and the reasoning behind it .
After reading the chapter you should have a basic feel for what Scala is and what kinds of tasks it might help you accomplish .
Although this book is a Scala tutorial , this chapter is n’t really part of the tutorial .
If you ’re anxious to start writing some Scala code , you should jump ahead to Chapter 2 , “ First Steps in Scala . ”
A language that grows on you
Programs of different sizes tend to require different programming constructs .
Consider , for example , the following small Scala program :
var capital = Map ( " US " -> " Washington " , " France " -> " Paris " ) capital += ( " Japan " -> " Tokyo " ) println ( capital ( " France " ) )
( " Japan " -> " Tokyo " )
This program sets up a map from countries to their capitals , modifies the map by adding a new binding , and prints the capital associated with the country France .
The notation in this example is high - level , to the point , and not cluttered with extraneous semicolons or type annotations .
Indeed , the feel is that of a modern “ scripting ” language like Perl , Python or Ruby .
One common characteristic of these languages , which is relevant for the example above , is that they each support an “ associative map ” construct in the syntax of the language .
Associative maps are very useful because they help keep programs legible and concise .
However , sometimes you might not agree with their “ one size fits all ” philosophy , because you need to control the properties of the maps you use in your program in a more fine - grained way .
Scala gives you this fine - grained control if you need it , because maps in Scala are not language syntax .
They are library abstractions that you can extend and adapt .
In the above program , you ’ll get a default Map implementation , but you can easily change that .
You could for example specify a particular implementation , such as a HashMap or a TreeMap , or you could specify that the map should be thread - safe , “ mixing in ” a SynchronizedMap “ trait . ”
You could specify a default value for the map , or you could override any other method of the map you create .
In each case , you can use the same easy access syntax for maps as in the example above .
This example shows that Scala can give you both convenience and flexibility .
Scala has a set of convenient constructs that help you get started quickly and let you program in a pleasantly concise style .
At the same time , you have the assurance that you will not outgrow the language .
You can always tailor the program to your requirements , because everything is based on library modules that you can select and adapt as needed .
Growing new types
Eric Raymond introduced the cathedral and bazaar as two metaphors of software development .
1
The cathedral is a near - perfect building that takes a long time to build .
Once built , it stays unchanged for a long time .
The bazaar , by contrast , is adapted and extended each day by the people working in it .
In Raymond ’s work the bazaar is a metaphor for open - source software development .
Guy Steele noted in a talk on “ growing a language ” that the same distinction can be applied to language design .
2 Scala is much more like a bazaar than a cathedral , in the sense that it is designed to be extended and adapted by the people programming in it .
Instead of providing all constructs you might ever need in one “ perfectly complete ” language , Scala puts the tools for building such constructs into your hands .
Here ’s an example .
Many applications need a type of integer that can become arbitrarily large without overflow or “ wrap - around ” of arithmetic operations .
Scala defines such a type in a library class scala .
BigInt .
Here is the definition of a method using that type , which calculates the factorial of a passed integer value :
3
def factorial( x : BigInt ) : BigInt = if ( x == 0 ) 1 else x * factorial(x - 1 )
factorial ( 30 )
265252859812191058636308480000000
BigInt
*
-
java.math.BigInteger
BigInt
Now , if you callyou would get : looks like a built - in type , because you can use integer literals and operators such asandwith values of that type .
Yet it is just a class that happens to be defined in Scala ’s standard library .
If the class were missing , it would be straightforward for any Scala programmer to write an implementation , for instance , by wrapping Java ’s class ( in fact that ’s how Scala ’sclass is implemented ) .
Of course , you could also use Java ’s class directly .
But the result is not nearly as pleasant , because although Java allows you to create new types , those types do n’t feel much like native language support :
import java.math .
BigInteger def factorial( x : BigInteger ) : BigInteger = if ( x == BigInteger .
ZERO ) BigInteger.ONE else x.multiply ( factorial(x.subtract(BigInteger.ONE ) ) )
BigInt
Growing new control constructs
is representative of many other number - like types — big decimals , complex numbers , rational numbers , confidence intervals , polynomials — the list goes on .
Some programming languages implement some of these types natively .
For instance , Lisp , Haskell , and Python implement big integers ; Fortran and Python implement complex numbers .
But any language that attempted to implement all of these abstractions at the same time would simply become too big to be manageable .
What ’s more , even if such a language were to exist , some applications would surely benefit from other number - like types that were not supplied .
So the approach of attempting to provide everything in one language does n’t scale very well .
Instead , Scala allows users to grow and adapt the language in the directions they need by defining easy - to - use libraries that feel like native language support .
The previous example demonstrates that Scala lets you add new types that can be used as conveniently as built - in types .
The same extension principle also applies to control structures .
This kind of extensibility is illustrated by Scala ’s API for “ actor - based ” concurrent programming .
As multicore processors proliferate in the coming years , achieving acceptable performance will demand you use more parallelism in your applications .
Often , this means rewriting your code so that computations are distributed over several concurrent threads .
Unfortunately , creating dependable multi- threaded applications has proven challenging in practice .
Java ’s threading model is built around shared memory and locking , a model that is often difficult to reason about , especially as systems scale up in size and complexity .
It is hard to be sure you do n’t have a race condition or deadlock lurking — something that did n’t show up during testing , but might just show up in production .
An arguably safer alternative is a message passing architecture such as the “ actors ” approach used by the Erlang programming language .
Java comes with a rich thread - based concurrency library .
Scala programs can use it like any other Java API .
However , Scala also offers an additional library that essentially implements Erlang ’s actor model .
Actors are concurrency abstractions that can be implemented on top of threads .
They communicate by sending messages to each other .
An actor can perform two basic operations , message send and receive .
The send operation , denoted by an exclamation point (! ) , sends a message to an actor .
Here ’s an example in which the actor is named recipient :
recipient !
msg
receive
receive { case Msg1 => ... // handle Msg1 case Msg2 => ... // handle Msg2 // ... }
A send is asynchronous ; that is , the sending actor can proceed immediately , without waiting for the message to be received and processed .
Every actor has a mailbox in which incoming messages are queued .
An actor handles messages that have arrived in its mailbox via ablock :
A receive block consists of a number of cases that each query the mailbox with a message pattern .
The first message in the mailbox that matches any of the cases is selected , and the corresponding action is performed on it .
If the mailbox does not contain any messages that match one of the given cases , the actor suspends and waits for further incoming messages .
As an example , here is a simple Scala actor implementing a checksum calculator service :
actor { var sum = 0 loop { receive { case Data ( bytes ) => sum += hash ( bytes ) case GetSum ( requester ) => requester !
sum } } }
sum
receive
Data
bytes
sum
GetSum
sum
requester
requester !
sum
requester
GetSum
This actor first defines a local variable namedwith initial value zero .
It then repeatedly waits in a loop for messages , using astatement .
If it receives amessage , it adds a hash of the sentto thevariable .
If it receives amessage , it sends the current value ofback to theusing the message send .
Thefield is embedded in themessage ; it refers usually to the actor that made the request .
We do n’t expect you to understand fully the actor example at this point .
Rather , what ’s significant about this example for the topic of scalability is that neither actor nor loop nor receive nor message send (! ) are built - in operations in Scala .
Even though actor , loop and receive look and act very similar to control constructs like while or for loops , they are in fact methods defined in Scala ’s actors library .
Likewise , even though (! ) looks like a built - in operator , it too is just a method defined in the actors library .
All four of these constructs are completely independent of the Scala language .
The receive block and send (! ) syntax look in Scala much like they look in Erlang , but in Erlang , these constructs are built into the language .
Scala also implements most of Erlang ’s other concurrent programming constructs , such as monitoring failed actors and time - outs .
All in all , actors have turned out to be a very pleasant means for expressing concurrent and distributed computations .
Even though they are defined in a library , actors feel like an integral part of the Scala language .
This example illustrates that you can “ grow ” the Scala language in new directions even as specialized as concurrent programming .
To be sure , you need good architects and programmers to do this .
But the crucial thing is that it is feasible — you can design and implement abstractions in Scala that address radically new application domains , yet still feel like native language support .
What makes Scala scalable ?
Scalability is influenced by many factors , ranging from syntax details to component abstraction constructs .
If we were forced to name just one aspect of Scala that helps scalability , we ’d pick its combination of object - oriented and functional programming ( well , we cheated , that ’s really two aspects , but they are intertwined ) .
Scala goes further than all other well - known languages in fusing object - oriented and functional programming into a uniform language design .
For instance , where other languages might have objects and functions as two different concepts , in Scala a function value is an object .
Function types are classes that can be inherited by subclasses .
This might seem nothing more than an academic nicety , but it has deep consequences for scalability .
In fact the actor concept shown previously could not have been implemented without this unification of functions and objects .
Scala is object - oriented
Object - oriented programming has been immensely successful .
Starting from Simula in the mid-60 ’s and Smalltalk in the 70’s , it is now available in more languages than not .
In some domains objects have taken over completely .
While there is not a precise definition of what object - oriented means , there is clearly something about objects that appeals to programmers .
In principle , the motivation for object - oriented programming is very simple : all but the most trivial programs need some sort of structure .
The most straightforward way to do this is to put data and operations into some form of containers .
The great idea of object - oriented programming is to make these containers fully general , so that they can contain operations as well as data , and that they are themselves values that can be stored in other containers , or passed as parameters to operations .
Such containers are called objects .
Alan Kay , the inventor of Smalltalk , remarked that in this way the simplest object has the same construction principle as a full computer : it combines data with operations under a formalized interface .
5
So objects have a lot to do with language scalability : the same techniques apply to the construction of small as well as large programs .
Even though object - oriented programming has been mainstream for a long time , there are relatively few languages that have followed Smalltalk in pushing this construction principle to its logical conclusion .
For instance , many languages admit values that are not objects , such as the primitive values in Java .
Or they allow static fields and methods that are not members of any object .
These deviations from the pure idea of object - oriented programming look quite harmless at first , but they have an annoying tendency to complicate things and limit scalability .
By contrast , Scala is an object - oriented language in pure form : every value is an object and every operation is a method call .
For example , when you say 1 + 2 in Scala , you are actually invoking a method named + defined in class Int .
You can define methods with operator - like names that clients of your API can then use in operator notation .
This is how the designer of Scala ’s actors API enabled you to use expressions such as requester !
sum shown in the previous example : (! ) is a method of the Actor class .
Scala is more advanced than most other languages when it comes to composing objects .
An example is Scala ’s traits .
Traits are like interfaces in Java , but they can also have method implementations and even fields .
Objects are constructed by mixin composition , which takes the definitions of a class and adds the definitions of a number of traits to it .
In this way , different aspects of classes can be encapsulated in different traits .
This looks a bit like multiple inheritance , but is different when it comes to the details .
Unlike a class , a trait can add some new functionality to an unspecified superclass .
This makes traits more “ pluggable ” than classes .
In particular , it avoids the classical “ diamond inheritance ” problems of multiple inheritance , which arise when the same class is inherited via several different paths .
Scala is functional
In addition to being a pure object - oriented language , Scala is also a full - blown functional language .
The ideas of functional programming are older than ( electronic ) computers .
Their foundation was laid in Alonzo Church ’s lambda calculus , which he developed in the 1930s .
The first functional programming language was Lisp , which dates from the late 50s .
Other popular functional languages are Scheme , SML , Erlang , Haskell , OCaml , and F\# .
For a long time , functional programming has been a bit on the sidelines , popular in academia , but not that widely used in industry .
However , recent years have seen an increased interest in functional programming languages and techniques .
Functional programming is guided by two main ideas .
The first idea is that functions are first - class values .
In a functional language , a function is a value of the same status as , say , an integer or a string .
You can pass functions as arguments to other functions , return them as results from functions , or store them in variables .
You can also define a function inside another function , just as you can define an integer value inside a function .
And you can define functions without giving them a name , sprinkling your code with function literals as easily as you might write integer literals like 42 .
Functions that are first - class values provide a convenient means for abstracting over operations and creating new control structures .
This generalization of functions provides great expressiveness , which often leads to very legible and concise programs .
It also plays an important role for scalability .
As an example , the receive construct shown previously in the actor example is an invocation of a method that takes a function as argument .
The code inside the receive construct is a function that is passed unexecuted into the receive method .
In most traditional languages , by contrast , functions are not values .
Languages that do have function values often relegate them to second - class status .
For example , the function pointers of C and C++ do not have the same status as non-functional values in those languages : function pointers can only refer to global functions , they do not give you the possibility to define first - class nested functions that refer to some values in their environment .
Nor do they provide the possibility to define name - less function literals .
The second main idea of functional programming is that the operations of a program should map input values to output values rather than change data in place .
To see the difference , consider the implementation of strings in Ruby and in Java .
In Ruby , a string is an array of characters .
Characters in a string can be changed individually .
For instance you can change a semicolon character in a string to a period inside the same string object .
In Java and Scala , on the other hand , a string is a sequence of characters in the mathematical sense .
Replacing a character in a string using an expression like s.replace ( ' ; ' , '.') yields a new string object , which is different from s .
Another way of expressing this is that strings are immutable in Java whereas they are mutable in Ruby .
So looking at just strings , Java is a functional language , whereas Ruby is not .
Immutable data structures are one of the cornerstones of functional programming .
The Scala libraries define many more immutable data types on top of those found in the Java APIs .
For instance , Scala has immutable lists , tuples , maps , and sets .
Another way of stating this second idea of functional programming is that methods should not have any side effects .
They should communicate with their environment only by taking arguments and returning results .
For instance , the replace method in Java ’s String class fits this description .
It takes a string and two characters and yields a new string where all occurrences of one character are replaced by the other .
There is no other effect of calling replace .
Methods like replace are called referentially transparent .
Functional languages encourage immutable data structures and referentially transparent methods .
Some functional languages even require them .
Scala gives you a choice .
When you want to , you can write in an imperative style , which is what programming with mutable data and side effects is called .
But Scala generally makes it easy to avoid imperative constructs when you want , because good functional alternatives exist .
Why Scala ?
Is Scala for you ?
You will have to see and decide for yourself .
We have found that there are actually many reasons besides scalability to like programming in Scala .
Four of the most important aspects will be discussed in this section : compatibility , brevity , high - level abstractions , and advanced static typing .
Scala is compatible
Scala does n’t require you to leap backwards off the Java platform to step forward from the Java language .
It allows you to add value to existing code — to build on what you already have — because it was designed for seamless interoperability with Java .
6 Scala programs compile to JVM bytecodes .
Their run -time performance is usually on par with Java programs .
Scala code can call Java methods , access Java fields , inherit from Java classes , and implement Java interfaces .
None of this requires special syntax , explicit interface descriptions , or glue code .
In fact , almost all Scala code makes heavy use of Java libraries , often without programmers being aware of this fact .
Another aspect of full interoperability is that Scala heavily re-uses Java types .
Scala ’s
Int s are represented as Java primitive integers of type int , Float s are represented as float s , Boolean s as boolean s , and so on .
Scala arrays are mapped to Java arrays .
Scala also re-uses many of the standard Java library types .
For instance , the type of a string literal " abc " in Scala is java.lang .
String , and a thrown exception must be a subclass of java.lang .
Throwable .
Scala not only re-uses Java ’s types , but also “ dresses them up ” to make them nicer .
For instance , Scala ’s strings support methods like toInt or to Float , which convert the string to an integer or floating - point number .
So you can write str.toInt as a shorter alternative for Integer. parseInt ( str ) .
How can this be achieved without breaking interoperability ?
Java ’s
String class certainly has no toInt method !
In fact , Scala has a very general solution to solve this tension between advanced library design and interoperability .
Scala lets you define implicit conversions , which are always applied when types would not normally match up , or when non-existing members are selected .
In the case above , when looking for a toInt method on a string , the Scala compiler will find no such member of class String , but it will find an implicit conversion that converts a Java String to an instance of the Scala class RichString , which does define such a member .
The conversion will then be applied implicitly before performing the toInt operation .
Scala code can also be invoked from Java code .
This is sometimes a bit more subtle , because Scala is a richer language than Java , so some of Scala ’s more advanced features need to be encoded before they can be mapped to Java .
Chapter 29 , “ Combining Java and Scala , ” explains the details .
Scala is concise
Scala programs tend to be short .
Scala programmers have reported reductions in number of lines of up to a factor of ten compared to Java .
These might be extreme cases .
A more conservative estimate would be that a typical Scala program should have about half the number of lines of the same program written in Java .
Fewer lines of code mean not only less typing , but also less effort at reading and understanding programs and fewer possibilities of defects .
There are several factors that contribute to this reduction in lines of code .
First , Scala ’s syntax avoids some of the boilerplate that burdens Java programs .
For instance , semicolons are optional in Scala and are usually left out .
There are also several other areas where Scala ’s syntax is less noisy .
As an example , compare how you write classes and constructors in Java and Scala .
In Java , a class with a constructor often looks like this :
// this is Java class MyClass { private int index ; private String name ; public MyClass ( int index , String name ) { this .
index = index ; this .
name = name ; } }
class MyClass ( index : Int , name : String ) {}
Int
index
String
name
In Scala , you would likely write this instead : Given this code , the Scala compiler will produce a class that has two private instance variables , annamedand anamed , and a constructor that takes initial values for those variables as parameters .
The code of this constructor will initialize the two instance variables with the values passed as parameters .
In short , you get essentially the same functionality as the more verbose Java version .
The Scala class is quicker to write , easier to read , and most importantly , less error prone than the Java class .
Scala ’s type inference is another factor that contributes to its conciseness .
Repetitive type information can be left out , so programs become less cluttered and more readable .
But probably the most important key to compact code is code you do n’t have to write because it is done in a library for you .
Scala gives you many tools to define powerful libraries that let you capture and factor out common behavior .
For instance , different aspects of library classes can be separated out into traits , which can then be mixed together in flexible ways .
Or , library methods can be parameterized with operations , which lets you define constructs that are , in effect , your own control structures .
Together , these constructs allow the definition of libraries that are both high - level and flexible to use .
Scala is high - level
Programmers are constantly grappling with complexity .
To program productively , you must understand the code on which you are working .
Overly complex code has been the downfall of many a software project .
Unfortunately , important software usually has complex requirements .
Such complexity can’t be avoided ; it must instead be managed .
Scala helps you manage complexity by letting you raise the level of abstraction in the interfaces you design and use .
As an example , imagine you have a String variable name , and you want to find out whether or not that String contains an upper case character .
In Java , you might write this :
// this is Java boolean nameHasUpperCase = false ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < name.length ( ) ; ++i ) { if ( Character.isUpperCase(name.charAt( i ) ) ) { nameHasUpperCase = true ; break ; } }
val nameHasUpperCase = name.exists(_.isUpperCase )
Whereas in Scala , you could write this :
The Java code treats strings as low - level entities that are stepped through character by character in a loop .
The Scala code treats the same strings as higher - level sequences of characters that can be queried with \glspl{predicate} .
Clearly the Scala code is much shorter and — for trained eyes — easier to understand than the Java code .
So the Scala code weighs less heavily on the total complexity budget .
It also gives you less opportunity to make mistakes .
The predicate , _.isUpperCase , is an example of a function literal in Scala . 8
It describes a function that takes a character argument ( represented by the underscore character ) , and tests whether it is an upper case letter .9
In principle , such control abstractions are possible in Java as well .
You ’d need to define an interface that contains a method with the abstracted functionality .
For instance , if you wanted to support querying over strings , you might invent an interface Character Property with a single method has Property :
// this is Java interface CharacterProperty { boolean has Property ( char ch ) ; }
With that interface you can formulate a method exists in Java :
It takes a string and a Character Property and returns true if there is a character in the string that satisfies the property .
You could then invoke exists as follows :
// this is Java exists ( name , new Character Property { boolean has Property ( char ch ) { return Character.isUpperCase(ch ) ; } } ) ;
Scala is statically typed
However , all this feels rather heavy .
So heavy , in fact , that most Java programmers would not bother .
They would just write out the loops and live with the increased complexity in their code .
On the other hand , function literals in Scala are really lightweight , so they are used frequently .
As you get to know Scala better you ’ll find more and more opportunities to define and use your own control abstractions .
You ’ll find that this helps avoid code duplication and thus keeps your programs shorter and clearer .
A static type system classifies variables and expressions according to the kinds of values they hold and compute .
Scala stands out as a language with a very advanced static type system .
Starting from a system of nested class types much like Java ’s , it allows you to parameterize types with generics , to combine types using intersections , and to hide details of types using abstract types .
10
These give a strong foundation for building and composing your own types , so that you can design interfaces that are at the same time safe and flexible to use .
If you like dynamic languages such as Perl , Python , Ruby , or Groovy , you might find it a bit strange that Scala ’s static type system is listed as one of its strong points .
After all , the absence of a static type system has been cited by some as a major advantage of dynamic languages .
The most common arguments against static types are that they make programs too verbose , prevent programmers from expressing themselves as they wish , and make impossible certain patterns of dynamic modifications of software systems .
However , often these arguments do not go against the idea of static types in general , but against specific type systems , which are perceived to be too verbose or too inflexible .
For instance , Alan Kay , the inventor of the Smalltalk language , once remarked : “ I ’m not against types , but I do n’t know of any type systems that are n’t a complete pain , so I still like dynamic typing .
” 11
We ’ll hope to convince you in this book that Scala ’s type system is far from being a “ complete pain . ”
In fact , it addresses nicely two of the usual concerns about static typing : verbosity is avoided through type inference and flexibility is gained through pattern matching and several new ways to write and compose types .
With these impediments out of the way , the classical benefits of static type systems can be better appreciated .
Among the most important of these benefits are verifiable properties of program abstractions , safe refactorings , and better documentation .
Verifiable properties .
Static type systems can prove the absence of certain run-time errors .
For instance , they can prove properties like : booleans are never added to integers , private variables are not accessed from outside their class , functions are applied to the right number of arguments , only strings are ever added to a set of strings .
Other kinds of errors are not detected by today ’s static type systems .
For instance , they will usually not detect array bounds violations , non-terminating functions , or divisions by zero .
They will also not detect that your program does not conform to its specification ( assuming there is a spec , that is ! ) .
Static type systems have therefore been dismissed by some as not being very useful .
The argument goes that since such type systems can only detect simple errors , whereas unit tests provide more extensive coverage , why bother with static types at all ?
We believe that these arguments miss the point .
Although a static type system certainly cannot replace unit testing , it can reduce the number of unit tests needed by taking care of some properties that would otherwise need to be tested .
Likewise , unit testing can not replace static typing .
After all , as Edsger Dijkstra said , testing can only prove the presence of errors , never their absence .
So the guarantees that static typing gives may be simple , but they are real guarantees of a form no amount of testing can deliver .
Safe refactorings .
A static type system provides a safety net that lets you make changes to a codebase with a high degree of confidence .
Consider for instance a refactoring that adds an additional parameter to a method .
In a statically typed language you can do the change , re-compile your system and simply fix all lines that cause a type error .
Once you have finished with this , you are sure to have found all places that needed to be changed .
The same holds for many other simple refactorings like changing a method name , or moving methods from one class to another .
In all cases a static type check will provide enough assurance that the new system works just like the old one .
Documentation .
Static types are program documentation that is checked by the compiler for correctness .
Unlike a normal comment , a type annotation can never be out of date ( at least not if the source file that contains it has recently passed a compiler ) .
Furthermore , compilers and integrated development environments can make use of type annotations to provide better context help .
For instance , an integrated development environment can display all the members available for a selection by determining the static type of the expression on which the selection is made and looking up all members of that type .
\bigskip
oindent
Even though static types are generally useful for program documentation , they can sometimes be annoying when they clutter the program .
Typically , useful documentation is what readers of a program cannot easily derive themselves .
In a method definition like
def f(x : String ) = ...
f
String
val x : HashMap [ Int , String ] = new HashMap [ Int , String ] ( )
x
HashMap
Int
String
it ’s useful to know that ’s argument should be a .
On the other hand , at least one of the two annotations in the following example is annoying : Clearly , it should be enough to say just once thatis awiths as keys ands as values ; there is no need to repeat the same phrase twice .
Scala has a very sophisticated type inference system that lets you omit almost all type information that ’s usually considered as annoying .
In the example above , the following two less annoying alternatives would work as well .
val x = new HashMap [ Int , String ] ( ) val x : Map [ Int , String ] = new HashMap ()
Scala ’s roots
Type inference in Scala can go quite far .
In fact , it ’s not uncommon for user code to have no explicit types at all .
Therefore , Scala programs often look a bit like programs written in a dynamically typed scripting language .
This holds particularly for client application code , which glues together pre-written library components .
It ’s less true for the library components themselves , because these often employ fairly sophisticated types to allow flexible usage patterns .
This is only natural .
After all , the type signatures of the members that make up the interface of a re-usable component should be explicitly given , because they constitute an essential part of the contract between the component and its clients .
Scala ’s design has been influenced by many programming languages and ideas in programming language research .
In fact , only a few features of Scala are genuinely new ; most have been already applied in some form in other languages .
Scala ’s innovations come primarily from how its constructs are put together .
In this section , we list the main influences on Scala ’s design .
The list cannot be exhaustive — there are simply too many smart ideas around in programming language design to enumerate them all here .
At the surface level , Scala adopts a large part of the syntax of Java and C\# , which in turn borrowed most of their syntactic conventions from C and C ++.
Expressions , statements and blocks are mostly as in Java , as is the syntax of classes , packages and imports .
12 Besides syntax , Scala adopts other elements of Java , such as its basic types , its class libraries , and its execution model .
Scala also owes much to other languages .
Its uniform object model was pioneered by Smalltalk and taken up subsequently by Ruby .
Its idea of universal nesting ( almost every construct in Scala can be nested inside any other construct ) is also present in Algol , Simula , and , more recently in Beta and gbeta .
Its uniform access principle for method invocation and field selection comes from Eiffel .
Its approach to functional programming is quite similar in spirit to the ML family of languages , which has SML , OCaml , and F\# as prominent members .
Many higher - order functions in Scala ’s standard library are also present in ML or Haskell .
Scala ’s implicit parameters were motivated by Haskell ’s type classes ; they achieve analogous results in a more classical object - oriented setting .
Scala ’s actor - based concurrency library was heavily inspired by Erlang .
Scala is not the first language to emphasize scalability and extensibility .
The historic root of extensible languages that can span different application areas is Peter Landin ’s 1966 paper “ The Next 700 Programming Languages .
” 13 ( The language described in this paper , Iswim , stands beside Lisp as one of the pioneering functional languages . )
The specific idea of treating an infix operator as a function can be traced back to Iswim and Smalltalk .
Another important idea is to permit a function literal ( or block ) as a parameter , which enables libraries to define control structures .
Again , this goes back to Iswim and Smalltalk .
Smalltalk and Lisp have both a flexible syntax that has been applied extensively for building embedded domain - specific languages .
C++ is another scalable language that can be adapted and extended through operator overloading and its template system ; compared to Scala it is built on a lower - level , more systems - oriented core .
Scala is also not the first language to integrate functional and object - oriented programming , although it probably goes furthest in this direction .
Other languages that have integrated some elements of functional programming into OOP include Ruby , Smalltalk , and Python .
On the Java platform , Pizza , Nice , and Multi -Java have all extended a Java - like core with functional ideas .
There are also primarily functional languages that have acquired an object system ; examples are OCaml , F\# , and PLT - Scheme .
Scala has also contributed some innovations to the field of programming languages .
For instance , its abstract types provide a more object - oriented alternative to generic types , its traits allow for flexible component assembly , and its extractors provide a representation - independent way to do pattern matching .
These innovations have been presented in papers at programming language conferences in recent years .

Conclusion
In this chapter , we gave you a glimpse of what Scala is and how it might help you in your programming .
To be sure , Scala is not a silver bullet that will magically make you more productive .
To advance , you will need to apply Scala artfully , and that will require some learning and practice .
If you ’re coming to Scala from Java , the most challenging aspects of learning Scala may involve Scala ’s type system ( which is richer than Java ’s ) and its support for functional programming .
The goal of this book is to guide you gently up Scala ’s learning curve , one step at a time .
We think you ’ll find it a rewarding intellectual experience that will expand your horizons and make you think differently about program design .
Hopefully , you will also gain pleasure and inspiration from programming in Scala .

12 . The major deviation from Java concerns the syntax for type annotations — it ’s “ variable : Type ” instead of “ Type variable ” in Java .
Scala ’s postfix type syntax resembles Pascal , Modula - 2 , or Eiffel .
The main reason for this deviation has to do with type inference , which often lets you omit the type of a variable or the return type of a method .
Using the “ variable : Type ” syntax this is easy — just leave out the colon and the type .
But in C - style “ Type variable ” syntax you cannot simply leave off the type — there would be no marker to start the definition anymore .
You ’d need some alternative keyword to be a placeholder for a missing type ( C# 3.0 , which does some type inference , uses var for this purpose ) .
Such an alternative keyword feels more ad - hoc and less regular than Scala ’s approach .

How To Protect Yourself From A Banking Collapse
This article has been penned for us by Stuart Langridge and whilst we hope that it will not come true , understanding how to prepare seems to be very appropriate .
March 2008 - Just a few years ago , the notion of a banking collapse , credit crunch or liquidity crisis was laughable to almost everyone .
Yet here we are in early 2008 with the problems of Northern Rock in the UK , Bear Stearns in the US and a crisis of confidence between everyone else .
This financial crisis has made it easy for speculators to trade on this fear - as the wild swings in UK banking stocks have recently demonstrated .
As the continues to drag down the rest of the housing market and economy , it looks like it is just a matter of time before a big bank with millions of customers goes down .
Just last week the UK 's largest buy - to - let lender ( a very significant piece of the mortgage market ) , Paragon Mortgages , announced redundancies because it has been unable to write any new business of late .
If rumours are to be believed , an American lender - Thornburg - is on the verge of collapse .
Clearly , this is n't a good place to be !
The last thing that this mini-report is meant to do is frighten people into irrational action .
However , there is an obvious need for families to carry out some clear headed thinking and planning .
We should all be asking , " What if things really do get bad and impact me ? "
There are several simple steps which virtually any family should be able to take to help them ride through a storm of a bank run .
Firstly though , lets take a peek at what may happen ...
The first real issue will be panic .
If a major bank collapses , customers will be in a state of shock .
Never mind that they have been reading about this in their daily newspaper for months , it will still be a shock .
In our modern world , we are actually very disconnected to the things upon which we survive .
Very few of us grow our own food or would know how to .
Most of us have less than one week of food in the kitchen cupboard , which means that if there is a sudden lack of money , people will instantly descend on supermarkets to panic buy .
But with what ?
If banks go under , will credit and debit cards still work ?
In mid 2007 I was at the family home in Gloucestershire , England , when heavy rains and flooding hit .
Luckily , we were not flooded - but the local water pumping station was .
With barely any notice , the taps ran dry .
As may be imagined , supermarkets were packed with people trying to buy mineral water .
But oddly , they were panic buying all sorts of other products .
Gloucestershire had run out of Evian , but people were buying dozens of loaves of bread , milk in huge quantities , fruit and veg and other short life products .
To me , it all seemed rather odd .
There was no milk shortage , but the panic buying very nearly caused one !
Just think what might happen if there was a banking collapse and money shortage .
Any spare cash would be spent on anything a family may need in the coming days and weeks .
That means bare shelves in every shop in every town and city .
There would almost certainly be people without food .
Most likely , these people would be city based where the constant availability of goods means that they do not plan far in advance .
There would also be people who are unable to travel .
A petrol shortage would be guaranteed as people filled their tanks to ensure that they can get to and from their place of work .
But for those that did not or could not ' fill up ' ?
Many staff would not be able to get to or from their place of work and business would be hampered .
In the most extreme of circumstances , this may all lead to looting and violence .
The aged will be very vulnerable and will need extra help from families and neighbours .
In the short - term , governments will not be able to cope with the massive requirements they face .
As days pass , supplies will be more orderly and the situation will stabilise .
During previous disasters , governments have been able to focus resources and man-power to help communities .
Could they do this for an entire nation ?
For the majority of us , money in the bank is actually insured .
The bank will have insurance plans in place and most governments guarantee deposits .
However , these guarantees usually have an upper limit .
This is important if the majority of your net worth is held in one account .
It might be a wise idea to spread a little of it around to other banks and accounts in amounts that will be guaranteed .
The problem with banking guarantees is that it can take some time to rescue deposits from a collapsed institution .
In real terms , this would mean that whilst the money itself might be ' safe ' you may not have access to it for some time - and it will almost certainly not be earning any interest after a collapse .
From the perspective of stock investments ( information here ) - since that is what this site is about - most fund based products should be safe .
Even funds invested through a bank owned fund manager are usually held by a separate company , called a custodian , to protect against this eventuality .
Of course the underlying value of the assets would almost certainly be hit , and probably hit hard .
Selling assets at a time like this would be bordering on the ridiculous .
In the midst of a panic , prices offered for stocks in the market will be dismal at best .
If an individual is forced out of the market by a sudden panic and cash shortage as is being described here , it is hard to believe that they should have been investing at all !
The only sale that might be justified would be in the specific bank that is collapsing - though the prices will probably be in free - fall .
It is also worth pointing out that any sales made now would need to be transacted through a bank account .
This would probably mean a delay in accessing the money , which would not really help in a cash crunch situation .
However , for those with access to cash on deposit , the midst of a panic can be a great time to pick up a bargain or two .
For those bottom fishers or value investors looking to the long term , a banking crisis would be a fabulous opportunity to create future riches .
It is probably redundant to say this , but this would not be a time to purchase banking assets .
Instead , it would be a great time to find other companies whose price has been slashed in the market chaos for no real reason .

The 5 Best Items To Have During A Banking Crisis
Since this article was written , there was , of course , a banking crisis .
While most normal depositors are not impacted when an investment bank crashes , Lehman Brothers made a huge dent in the financial system .
The Eurozone
In Europe , the financial crisis helped the eurozone crisis to move into a higher gear , which lead to bank instability and rescues in Spain , Greece , Cyprus and Italy .
While the impact was mostly contained at the time , the impact on the financial health of the continent of Europe will last for decades .
Both businesses and individuals in Cyprus faced a sobering lesson when all account balances above 100,000 euros were effectively confiscated .
It ought to be added though , that there were signs that Cyprus was in deep trouble many months before the actual events took place .
In fact , the bailout Cyprus received was essentially postponed until after a general election campaign .
For those watching , the warning signs were in place and there was an opportunity to make other arrangements over a period of several months .
It was for this reason that it took several weeks after the bailout before the true scale of the problem was known .
While news reports and politicians were discussing the island as a haven for dirty Russian money , the reality was that whatever dirty Russian money there may have been had had chance to be moved to somewhere safer .
Thus , the banks actually held far less capital than they realised .
It pays to keep a watchful eye on the location of your money and should you need to make alternative arrangements , do not hesitate to do so .
Banking is a business built on confidence and should it be lost , it is very difficult to rebuild .

CHINA is in a frightening mood .
The sight of thousands of Chinese people waving xenophobic fists suggests that a country on its way to becoming a superpower may turn out to be a more dangerous force than optimists had hoped .
But it is n't just foreigners who should be worried by these scenes : the Chinese government , which has encouraged this outburst of nationalism , should also be afraid .
For three decades , having shed communism in all but the name of its ruling party , China 's government has justified its monopolistic hold on power through economic advance .
Many Chinese enjoy a prosperity undreamt of by their forefathers .
For them , though , it is no longer enough to be reminded of the grim austerity of their parents ' childhoods .
They need new aspirations .
The government 's solution is to promise them that China will be restored to its rightful place at the centre of world affairs .
Hence the pride at winning the Olympics , and the fury at the embarrassing protests during the torch relay .
But the appeal to nationalism is a double - edged sword : while it provides a useful outlet for domestic discontents ( see article ) , it could easily turn on the government itself .
A million mutinies
The torch relay has galvanised protests about all manner of alleged Chinese crimes : in Tibet , in China 's broader human - rights record , in its cosy relations with repellent regimes .
And these in turn have drawn counter - protests from thousands of expatriate Chinese , from Chinese within the country and on the internet .
Chinese rage has focused on the alleged “ anti- China ” bias of the Western press , which is accused of ignoring violence by Tibetans in the unrest in March .
From this starting - point China 's defenders have gone on to denounce the entire edifice of Western liberal democracy as a sham .
Using its tenets to criticise China is , they claim , sheer hypocrisy .
They cite further evidence of double standards : having exported its dirtiest industries to China , the West wants the country to curb its carbon emissions , potentially impeding its growth and depriving newly well - off Chinese of their right to a motor car .
And as the presidential election campaign in America progresses , more China - bashing can be expected , with protectionism disguised as noble fury at “ coddling dictators ” .
China 's rage is out of all proportion to the alleged offences .
It reflects a fear that a resentful , threatened West is determined to thwart China 's rise .
The Olympics have become a symbol of China 's right to the respect it is due .
Protests , criticism and boycott threats are seen as part of a broader refusal to accept and accommodate China .
There is no doubt genuine fury in China at these offences ; yet the impression the response gives of a people united behind the government is an illusion .
China , like India , is a land of a million mutinies now .
Legions of farmers are angry that their land has been swallowed up for building by greedy local officials .
People everywhere are aghast at the poisoning of China 's air , rivers and lakes in the race for growth .
Hardworking , honest citizens chafe at corrupt officials who treat them with contempt and get rich quick .
And the party still makes an ass of the law and a mockery of justice .
Herein lies the danger for the government .
Popular anger , once roused , can easily switch targets .
This weekend China will be commemorating an event seen as pivotal in its long revolution — the protests on May 4th 1919 against the humiliation of China by the Versailles treaty ( which bequeathed German “ concessions ” in China to Japan ) .
The Communist Party had roots in that movement .
Now , as then , protests at perceived slights against China 's dignity could turn against a government accused of not doing enough to safeguard it .
Remember the ides of May
Western businessmen and policymakers are pulled in opposite directions by Chinese anger .
As the sponsors of the Olympics have learned to their cost , while consumer - and shareholder - activists in the West demand they take a stand against perceived Chinese abuses , in China itself firms ' partners and customers are all too ready to take offence .
Western policymakers also face a difficult balancing act .
They need to recognise that China has come a long way very quickly , and offers its citizens new opportunities and even new freedoms , though these are still far short of what would constitute democracy .
Yet that does not mean they should pander to China 's pride .
Western leaders have a duty to raise concerns about human rights , Tibet and other “ sensitive ” subjects .
They do not need to resign themselves to ineffectiveness : up to a point , pressure works : China has been modestly helpful over Myanmar , North Korea and Sudan .
It has even agreed to reopen talks with the Dalai Lama 's representatives .
This has happened because of , not despite , criticism from abroad .
Pessimists fear that if China faces too much such pressure , hardliners within the ruling elite will triumph over the “ moderates ” in charge now .
But even if they did , it is hard to see how they could end the 30 - year - old process of opening up and turn China in on itself .
This unprecedented phenomenon , of the rapid integration into the world of its most populous country , seems irreversible .
There are things that could be done to make it easier to manage — including reform of the architecture of the global institutions that reflect a 60 - year - old world order .
But the world and China have to learn to live with each other .
For China , that means learning to respect foreigners ' rights to engage it even on its “ internal affairs ” .
A more measured response to such criticism is necessary not only to China 's great - power ambitions , but also to its internal stability ; for while the government may distract Chinese people from their domestic discontents by breathing fire at foreigners , such anger , once roused , can run out of control .
In the end , China 's leaders will have to deal with those frustrations head - on , by tackling the pollution , the corruption and the human - rights abuses that contribute to the country 's dangerous mood .
The Chinese people will demand it .

Here 's a nice review of the new book Punk House , which documents the squats and other punk dwellings the authors found on a cross-country trip .
I crashed on a lot of sofas in houses that looked like these , and even held the lease on one at one point …
Author and musician Timothy Findlen , along with photographer Abby Banks , spent three months driving cross-country to visit and photograph sixty - five punk houses –communal , low - rent houses typically crammed full of punks , squatters , and artists .
The end result is PUNK HOUSE , a collection of 300 full color photos and three short essays .
PUNK HOUSE documents a journey that most of us will have never taken ; it shows us homes that most of us have never seen ; it gives a small taste of a way of living most of us have never lived , and it does so in an easy yet successful way .
Banks ' digital snapshots are assembled by location , and are mainly colorful details of the punk houses , the communal punks that live in them , and the masses of oddball junk that decorate them .
The photos range from disgusting ( the bathroom at Casa de Otto comes to mind –is that blood or hair dye ? ) to the artistic ( is this a junk pile of sticks or is it considered sculpture ? ) .
A group of radical artists who panicked viewers of a Czech TV station by sneaking a nuclear mushroom cloud into its weather report are to be put on trial , prosecutors confirmed yesterday .
Six members of the Ztohoven collective , whose aims include " penetrating public space " , are to appear in court this month charged with spreading false information .
They could face three years each in jail .
The artists sent shock waves through the Czech Republic in June last year by splicing footage of the atomic explosion into a live panoramic shot of the Krkonose mountains , in north - east Bohemia .
The fake blast prompted panicked calls to the switchboard of the TV channel CT2 , with some viewers fearing that a nuclear war had begun while others suggested there had been a gas explosion .
The impact of the broadcast was compared to Orson Welles '
War of the Worlds radio broadcast of 1938 , in which listeners were led to believe that Martians were invading Earth .
Listeners who took it to be a news broadcast panicked , and several suffered heart attacks .
In the Czech broadcast viewers saw their screens obscured by a flash of bright light after which an orange fiery mushroom cloud ascended on the horizon .
Ztohoven said the aim of its project , which it called Media Reality , was not to harm , but to illustrate how the media manipulates reality .
In a statement it said : " We are neither a terrorist organisation nor a political group .
Our aim is not to intimidate society or manipulate it , which is something we witness on a daily basis both in the real world and that created by the media .
On June 17 2007 , [ we ] attacked the space of TV broadcasting , distorting it , questioning its truthfulness and its credibility . "
The group added that they hoped their action would " remind the media of their duty to bring out the truth " .
But Martin Krafl , spokesman for the TV channel , called the hijack irresponsible .
" The fake broadcast was really very inadvisable and could have provoked panic among a wide group of people , " he said .
Ztohoven , which in Czech means variously " out of it " and " a hundred shits " , has made a name for itself with a series of other artistic happenings , such as its attempts to cover up a neon heart which had been placed on top of Prague castle to mark the end of Vaclav Havel 's presidency in 2003 .
It also covered up hundreds of street lamps and neon signs in Prague to protest against the unchecked proliferation of advertisements in the post - communist Czech Republic .
Ztohoven 's fake broadcast secured mainstream recognition for the first time last month , when it was awarded the Czech National Gallery 's newly established £ 9,000 young artists ' competition .

What is the time complexity of quicksort ?
The answer that first pops up in my head is O ( N logN ) .
That answer is only partly right : the worst case is in fact O ( N2 ) .
However , since very few inputs take anywhere that long , a reasonable quicksort implementation will almost never encounter the quadratic case in real life .
I came across a very cool paper that describes how to easily defeat just about any quicksort implementation .
The paper describes a simple comparer that decides ordering of elements lazily as the sort executes , and arranges the order so that the sort takes quadratic time .
This works even if the quicksort is randomized !
Furthermore , if the quicksort is deterministic ( not randomized ) , this algorithm also reveals the input which reliably triggers quadratic behavior for this particular quicksort implementation .
The trick takes a dozen of code , works with nearly any quicksort routine , and only uses the quicksort via its interface !
How cool is that ?
Here is a C# implementation of this idea :
class QuicksortKiller : IComparer < int > { Dictionary < int , int > keys = new Dictionary < int , int >( ) ; int candidate = 0 ; public int Compare ( int x , int y ) { if ( !keys.ContainsKey(x ) && !keys.ContainsKey(y ) ) { if ( x == candidate ) keys [ x ] = keys .
Count ; else keys [y ] = keys .
Count ; } if ( !keys.ContainsKey(x ) ) { candidate = x ; return 1 ; } if ( !keys.ContainsKey(y ) ) { candidate = y ; return - 1 ; } return keys [ x ] - keys[y ] ; } }
This trick works well when applied to the .
Net Array .
Sort ( ) method .
The following chart displays the number of Compare ( ) calls forced by QuicksortKiller when ran on an array of some size , as well as the number of Compare ( ) calls that made by Array .
Sort on a randomly - ordered sequence of the same length :
This chart clearly shows that the QuicksortKiller comparer triggers the quadratic behavior in Array .
Sort .
How does it work ?
QuicksortKiller ’s trick is to ensure that the pivot will compare low against nearly all remaining elements .
But , how can we detect which element is the pivot ?
We know quicksort will take the pivot and compare it against all other elements .
So , initially we consider all elements to be unsorted .
The paper refers to them as " gas " .
When we compare two gas elements , we arbitrarily choose one of them , and freeze it to a value larger than any previously frozen values .
We remember the other element as the pivot candidate .
If the candidate is used in the next comparison with a gas element , we will make sure to freeze the pivot candidate , rather than the other element .
That way , the pivot will be frozen within two comparisons against other elements .
Constructing a " Bad " Array
If the quicksort implementation is deterministic , and always takes the same steps on the same input , it is easy to generate an array that reliably triggers the quadratic behavior .
The MakeBadArray method constructs an array that triggers the quadratic - time behavior of Array .
Sort ( ) :
static int [ ]
MakeBadArray ( int length ) { int [ ] arr = Enumerable .
Range ( 0 , length ) .
ToArray ( ) ; Array .
Sort ( arr , new QuicksortKiller ( ) ) ; int [ ] ret = new int [ length ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++) { ret [ arr [ i ] ] = i ; } return ret ; }
How to defeat the Quicksort killer ?
As the original paper explains , the adversary comparer works if the quicksort implementation checks an O ( 1 ) number of elements as pivot candidates .
But , quicksort implementation that check more than O ( 1 ) elements are possible .
For example , the quicksort might choose the median element as the pivot at each step , thus always geting a perfect split of the input sequence into two halves .
Median can be found deterministically in O ( N ) running time , and so the total running time is always O ( N logN ) .
The median - based quicksort is rarely used in practice because it tends to have a larger constant than other quicksort implementations .
Another solution is to use a regular quicksort algorithm , and degrade to another sorting algorithm if quicksort is not working out .
For example , if we reached a recursive depth of 10 , and the size of our partition has not reduced by at least a half , we can just ditch quicksort and sort the partition using heapsort .

Congressman Dennis Kucinich has won the Virginia Democratic Party 's online presidential primary straw poll .
Candidates in the poll included the six Democrats who have qualified to appear on the primary ballot in Virginia on February 12 .
The party 's website said from the start and continues to say that the straw poll voting closed at midnight on December 23rd .
In reality , it is still possible to vote and to change the totals .
Since the 23rd , the numbers have increased very slightly , though not enough to alter the results .
Presumably , this is because most voters are unaware that the voting is still open .
Kucinich supporters , fearing some secret plot to flood the election with votes for another candidate , have been collecting screen shots of the results each day from the website and attempting unsuccessfully to get party officials to explain why the voting is still open .
Here are the results as of December 25th , as shown in the graphic below :
Dennis Kucinich 30 %
Hillary Rodham Clinton 27 %
Barack Obama 14 %
John R. Edwards 12 %
Bill Richardson 9 %
Joe Biden 9 %

Review of Francis R. Nicosia , The Third Reich and the Palestine Question .
Austin : University of Texas Press , 1985 .
From New German Critique , Number 42 , Fall 1987 , 176-180 .
A fascinating look at history ’s two most famous national socialist movements and their coincidence of interests .
The editor told Murray it was the best essay he'd seen on the subject , but he saw it only after more than a dozen other editors rejected it .
It lives on here .
I provided the title to this previously untitled review .
Anthony Flood February 20 , 2007 The Zionist - Nazi Connection Hugh Murray
Many readers will be shocked by the contents of this well - researched book , for it holds many surprises .
Georg Kareski , Revisionist Zionist , interviewed in Dr. Goebbels ’ newspaper , endorsed the Nazi ’s racist Nuremberg law of 1935 ( p. 56 ) .
Kurt Blumenfeld , chairman of the main German Zionist group , the ZVfD ( Zionistische Vereinigung für Deutschland ) , noted in April 1933 , shortly after Hitler came to power , “ . . . there exists today a unique opportunity to win over the Jews of Germany for the Zionist idea . ”
A few months later , the ZVfD sent a memorandum to Hitler :
Zionism believes that the rebirth of the national life of a people , which is now occurring in Germany through its emphasis on its Christian and national character , must also come about among the Jewish people .
For the Jewish people , too , national origin , religion , common destiny and a sense of its uniqueness must be of decisive importance to its existence .
This demands the elimination of the egotistical individualism of the liberal era , and its replacement with a sense of community and collective responsibility .
( p. 42 )
Not only did Zionists share a völkisch ideology with the Nazis , they received aid from the Gestapo .
Dr. Hans Friendenthal , a former chairman of the ZVfD acknowledged in a 1957 interview : “ The Gestapo did everything in those days to promote emigration , particularly to Palestine .
We often received their help when we required anything from other authorities regarding preparations for emigration .
This position remained constant and uniform the entire time , until the year 1938 ” ( p. 57 ) .
The most glaring example of Nazi-Zionist cooperation was the Haavara Transfer Agreement , whereby emigrating Jews could receive some of their blocked German assets in the form of German imports to the Middle East .
This agreement continued with minor alteration from 1933 until December 1939 .
There were other examples of cooperation .
Within Germany , the authorities favored Zionist Jewish organizations as opposed to the assimilationist Jewish groups : Zionists could publish , propagandize , wear uniforms , and display the blue and white flag which one day would be that of Israel ( but Jews in Germany could not display the German flag ) .
Zionists conducted retraining schools throughout Germany so Jews could learn the skills necessary for resettlement in Palestine .
While most Jews had difficulty getting passports to enter Germany , Zionists working with the retraining centers were given priority .
German Zionists were encouraged to attend World Zionist Congresses and did so throughout the 1930s .
Apparently , the Gestapo even gave weapons to the Hagana in 1937 for use against the Arabs in Palestine .
What did the Nazis get in return ?
In 1933 , Hitler wanted to get the Jews out of Germany .
By 1939 , he wanted them out of a Europe that Germany would dominate .
Most of Germany ’s 600,000 Jews were assimilationist in 1932 .
Some thought Hitler would not last ; others , that “ it would not be too bad . ”
Still others , even if they wanted to emigrate , preferred nearby European countries where they may have had relatives .
The United States had a narrow quota discouraging immigration .
Because of Germany ’s poor economy , even during the Weimar era , legislation restricted the amount of money that a departing émigré could take .
In the depression - ridden 1930s , few nations wanted boatloads of immigrants ; fewer wanted Jews shorn of assets .
Yet , Hitler wanted the Jews out of Germany , and one outlet was Palestine , where Britain had promised to provide a Jewish Homeland in the 1917 Balfour Declaration .
The Haavara Agreement allowed emigrating German Jews to retain some of their assets , thereby encouraging them to go to Palestine .
The Nazis subsidized German exports to the Middle East with the blocked German - Jewish funds .
Beginning in 1933 there was a world - wide attempt to boycott German goods because of its racist and oppressive policies .
Jewish groups , unions , and Left - wing organizations supported the boycott .
But simultaneously , German goods were entering Palestine and being sold through a Zionist concern .
When the issue of boycott arose at World Zionist Congresses of the 1930s , the German delegates opposed it , and the Zionist Congresses rejected it .
Among the observers at the 1937 Zionist Congress was Adolf Eichmann .
Thus , in working to rid Germany of its Jews and get them to Palestine , the Nazis and the Zionists frequently had common interests and worked together .
Interestingly , the German Consul in Jerusalem , Heinrich Wolff , was an ardent Zionist whose wife was Jewish .
He believed Zionism was a way to reconcile Nazis and Jews .
By the mid 1930s , he was dismissed from his post .
The Nazi-Zionist connection was debated in Germany as a consequence of the Arab uprisings in Palestine beginning in 1936 .
The Nazis had rejected earlier Arab requests for support because of Nazi racial contempt for the Semitic Arabs , and because Hitler did not want to disrupt his moves for an alliance with Britain .
Hitler would not interfere with the British Empire , and , he hoped , Britain would not interfere with Germany ’s drive in Europe .
By 1937 , there were elements in Germany who sought to pester Britain by encouraging the Arabs ; and they sought to scrap the Haavara Agreement linking German exports to Zionists in the Middle East .
Most important , these Germans were worried by the recommendations of the Peel Commission of 1937 — a proposal for separate Arab and Jewish states in Palestine .
Most Nazis believed an independent Jewish state would be hostile to Germany and a seat of the international Jewish conspiracy , similar to the Vatican or Moscow .
But despite these arguments , Hitler was unwilling to alter his basic policy .
As he declared in Mein Kampf , he was unwilling to link the fate of Germany to racially inferior “ oppressed nations , ” like the Arabs .
And he was convinced a racially pure Germany would be a stronger Germany .
In 1937 , alarm that Jewish emigration was declining ( in part because of fighting in Palestine and also because of the German Prosperity bought on by the Nazis ) , brought proposals to unite emigration in one department , but the basic policy continued and was reaffirmed by Hitler in January 1938 .
Indeed , in February 1938 Hider empowered a leader of the ZVfD to negotiate in London with the British regarding more Jews entering Palestine .
At the end of 1937 , there were still 350,000 Jews left in Germany and on April 1 , 1938 some 40,000 Jewish enterprises .
Hitler sought a Jew - free Germany .
Numbers of refugees were growing , and President Roosevelt called for a conference which met at Evian , France , in July 1938 .
However , most nations , even the U.S. , were unwilling to increase their quotas , and some sought to reduce the number of Jews that could enter their territories .
Meanwhile , Germany annexed Austria , and suddenly had many more Jews to dispose of .
A new implementation of an old policy began when Adolf Eichmann of the SS entered Vienna .
In effect , Jewish property was confiscated , and Jews were quickly issued papers for departure to other countries .
Sometimes the papers were false .
Meanwhile , the British had acceded to Arab demands and reduced the number of Jewish immigrants permitted to enter Palestine .
But the SS , in conjunction with Zionists , was deporting Jews to Palestine both legally and illegally .
In November 1938 , Kristallnacht shattered the Jewish community remaining in Germany .
Eichmann and the SS helped Zionists to gain release from jail and restore their organizations so they could get Jews to Palestine .
Nicosia tells a fascinating story .
Tragedy and blood is hidden between the lines , but it is there .
He does not allow the present Palestine question to intrude in his story of the 1930s .
The reader does not know if he is a Zionist , or favors the P.L.O. , and such objectivity is major asset in a work like this .
Nicosia could have included more , especially on the Reich ’s policy during the war .
What happened to the pro-Axis Iraqi government ?
What happened to the 2,000 Palestine Germans during the war ?
What did the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem do ?
If by 1948 the Hagana got 100,000 illegal Jews to Palestine , how many of them came during the war ?
With collaboration of the Reich ?
The book is silent on this .
Despite his tide , Nicosia ’s book really ends with the war ’s beginning in 1939 .
The charts at the end of the book are interesting , but one is in German , and a short chronology of pertinent events is lacking .
Though there is a chart on legal immigration of Jews into Palestine , it would have been an interesting contrast to note countries of destination other than Palestine .
I detect only one serious error in the book , when the author asserts that “ Germany could not have a decisive impact on the level of Jewish immigration to Palestine .
. . ” ( p. 127 ) .
But of course , Germany did have such an impact in the 1930s with its persecution which thereby promoted immigration in Palestine , and in the 1940s with its extermination of potential immigrants .
The book notes that the anti-Semitic governments of Poland and Rumania also encouraged Zionism in the 1930s .
Apparently , Poland trained the militant Revisionist Zionist Irgun and supplied it with weapons .
Nicosia discusses the Madagascan , Ecuadorian , and other proposals current in the late 1930s for the resettlement to Europe ’s Jews .
The “ final solution ” is not detailed here , but one can see it as a logical conclusion to Hitler ’s racism , Nazi expansion , and war , which blocked his desire to expel Jews from Europe .
Reading Nicosia ’s work , one questions how the Zionists could have collaborated with the Nazis , praised the Nuremberg laws , seen Hitler as an opportunity , and rejected the boycott of Nazi -Germany .
But the other equally important question also arises : how could they not have ?
The Nazi-Zionist collaboration legally brought 50,000 Jews out of Germany to Palestine in the 1930s with assets worth more than 100,000,000 RM .
Many of the emigrants had been retrained in Germany for a new life in the Middle East , and many would have been killed by the Nazis in the 1940s , had there been no Nazi - Zionist connection in the 1930s .
The Zionists saved more than 50,000 Jews by getting them out of Europe .
Had they fled Germany in 1933 to Austria , Czechoslovakia , France , etc. , they would not have gone far enough to be saved .
The Left attacked the Zionists for refusing to boycott Germany and generally for collaborating with the Nazis .
But how many Jews did the Left save ?
How many did the U.S.A .?
One can view the problem in another light .
The Nazis sought to “ purify ” Germany by eliminating many elements .
Jews had Zionism as an alternative — and by the mid 1930s most young German Jews were Zionists .
But there was no gay Zion .
There was no Jehovah ’s Witness Zion .
There was no gypsy Zion .
When the Nazis sought to destroy them , these minorities may have been at a disadvantage because they had no equivalent to the Zionist movement .
There was a Communist Zion , but the Communist movement was assimilationist .
The Soviet Party did not encourage German party members to flee to the USSR .
“ After Hitler , us , ” the German Party boasted .
Yet , despite the partial truth of that boast , how many German Communists survived the Reich to repeat the toast in East Germany ?
Booker T. Washington urged his followers to “ cast down your bucket where you are . ”
He was willing to accept inferior status to build a base in the homeland .
But the Nazis rejected Jews in Germany both as equals and as inferiors .
Hitler wanted them out of Germany and a German - dominated Europe .
Only the Zionists shared his desire to rid Europe of its Jews .
There was cooperation between the two movements , and consequent bitterness between Zionist and the Left - wing Jews , the assimilationist Jews , the pro-boycott Jews .
But who saved more Jews ?
According to the Left , Zionists were racists , and had collaborated with Hitler .
In Nicosia ’s book , this is documented .
It is unpleasant .
Yet it may have been the most effective way of saving Jewish lives .
Many Zionists may not like certain features of the book .
Yet , after reading it , one can only reflect that it is fortunate that some German Jews did choose the Zionist alternative .
Indeed , perhaps more would have survived had they been aligned with Zionism .
Hitler declared that to remove the Jews from Germany , he would cooperate even with the Devil ( p. 22 ) .
To save some Jews in this removal , the Zionists were just as willing to cooperate with the Devil .
The Left condemns the Zionists , even though at another stage the Left was also willing to cooperate .
The Zionists can point to a limited success in saving lives of at least 50,000 potential victims .
The Left was often just as heroic ( perhaps more so ) as the Zionists .
Yet , how many Jews did the Left save ?
Perhaps use of a multiplicity of alternatives , often contradictory , is the best way to ensure survival .
Palestine is still a burning issue .
There is something to support all sides in Nicosia ’s book .
But more , there is something for all to reflect upon .

Earlier this year , California found all sorts of problems with e-voting machines used in the state .
Now , Ohio , home to some of the more controversial stories surrounding presidential elections , has also found serious flaws in every e-voting machine used in the state .
It 's the usual stuff that has been pointed out for years : it was easy to pick locks on the machines , introduce fake votes , and load up dangerous unauthorized software onto the machines .
Not much new there -- just another confirmation .
What 's much more interesting is the reaction of the firms involved .
First up is " Premier Election Solution , " who you probably would recognize better under its old name : Diebold .
The company changed its name a few months ago , hoping people would no longer associate Premier with all of the ridiculously bad history associated with Diebold .
A Premier official said that all of the problems noted in the report have been fixed in its new machines .
While that 's a better response than Diebold 's typical response of trashing any researcher who points out a flaw or cracking jokes about the flaws , it 's one of the few times we 've ever seen Diebold / Premier admit that older machines actually did have significant flaws .
Of course , the few times that 's happened in the past , it 's always come with the same sort of " but everything is fixed now ! " clause .
And ... every time a Diebold / Premier representative says something along those lines , it 's only a matter of months until new flaws are announced .
So , given Diebold 's history , it 's pretty difficult to take the company 's word that all the flaws have now been fixed .
Even worse , though , is the response of ES&S , who has become even more Diebold - like in its responses to various problems found in its machines .
On the Ohio report , ES&S responded : " We can also tell you that our 35 years in the field of elections has demonstrated that Election Systems and Software voting technology is accurate , reliable and secure . "
Note that this does n't actually respond to any of the specific criticisms in the report .
As for that history , let 's take you back to a few of ES&S 's greatest hits : this is the company that was caught providing uncertified software to California , while also failing to disclose foreign manufacturing partners ( as required by federal law ) .
It 's also the company responsible for the well - known case in Florida where thousands of votes went missing and the election in Texas where votes were counted three times .
And , of course , let 's not forget the internal memos at ES&S which showed the company knew about problems with its software , while publicly stating that the machines were perfectly fine .
So , sorry , ES&S , you can try to pretend those things did n't happen , but the history you point to hardly shows that your machines are " accurate , reliable and secure . "
It shows a company that will say anything to avoid admitting that its machines have problems .

Are you a truck driver by any chance ?
Well , if you are , the likelihood of you not knowing what a truck weigh station is slim .
However , whomever you are , you might find this interesting to learn about .
In premise , a truck weight station is a government - mandated “ pitstop ” which requires trucks to stop and become subject to inspection .
In this article , we will cover what happens at a truck station , among other things .
If that sounds interesting to you , keep reading .
Why Do Truck Weigh Stations Exist ?
Most states in the United States require commercial vehicles and trucks that have an assumed weight of over 10 thousand pounds to stop at weight stations on their driver ’s route .
In premise , a loaded vehicle cannot weigh more than 80000 pounds as mandated by federal law .
Exceptions can be granted in some cases , especially if the load cannot be separated into smaller subsets .
But these exceptions will immediately expire upon delivery of the “ load ” .
Overloaded trucks serve as a hazard to US highways , both to other motorists and the drivers themselves .
Even under the best conditions , a truck that weighs a lot is hard to control .
Safe operation is difficult and becomes practically impossible in unfavorable conditions .
Excess weight will always increase pressure on the wheels , thus increasing the likelihood of a slideout .
Overweight vehicles are also more prone to being rolled over , as well as lengths the stopping distance , which increases the risk of collision .
What Occurs At A Truck Weigh Station ?
As a truck driver goes along the interstate , they must look out for any signs that might indicate a weight station .
The signs will provide enough information on whether or not the station is open .
If it is not , a truck driver is not required to stop .
However , if it is open , a certain speed limit must be retained upon the approach .
When they see that the weigh station is open , they must exit the highway and enter the scale location .
Most weigh truck stations have a rolling scale , in which the truck simply glides over the area .
However , some stations require the truck to stop .
Learn more about weighbridge systems here .
Once the truck has been weighed and verified to be under load , the truck is granted passage to exit the station , thus allowing them to proceed back on route .
Upon arrival , there are sometimes other trucks , therefore the process can be quite extensive .
A truck driver must always observe the speed limit and follow instructions .
Failure to do so can result in unnecessary inconvenience for all entities involved .
Inspection
In some cases , at a weigh station , an inspection of the logbook and equipment might occur .
If this process uncovers faulty or missing gear , a detailed inspection will be scheduled .
Any concerns with the logbook will be addressed as well .
However , if all is in order , the process should not take long at all .
For the premise of keeping the log precise , the employees will enter your DOT number and assess your safety rating .
A truck can be inspected for a variety of reasons .
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or DOT officers can conduct a thorough review of equipment to find issues , such as :
Faulty kingpins
Hose leaks Cracks in rims Broken springs Malfunctioning brakes Fuel leaks Tire tread Flat tires Mounted fuel tanks
And much more .
Any violation can result in the truck being listed out of service , which is a great concern .
If the entities declare your truck to be in that state , the truck will no longer be operated and towed away until repairs have been made .
A trucker will also have to sign an MCS63 form to verify these repairs .
Log Book Inspection
As mentioned earlier , the logbook might be subject to inspection as well .
The logbook can be checked by an officer to ensure that the driver is not in violation of hours - of - service , as well as keeping their daily log .
Some of the regulations are , but not limited to :
10 consecutive hour breaks after 11 hours on the road
No longer than 60 hours in any seven consecutive days of work
No longer than 70 hours in any eight consecutive days of work A maximum of 11 hours one the road per each 14 hour period
Changes are constantly being made to the logbook , and nowadays , the electronic logging device is made use of .
The ELD requires the trucker to keep their logbook in compliance with FMCSA and HOS regulations .
Some of the fines can go up to $ 1000 each .
However , any severe concerns raised might result in an internal inspection of your route , among other aspects of your driving .
And that ’s something no truck driver wishes for , so keep your routine maintained .
Weighed Right
Now that you know what happens at a truck weigh station , you are well on your way to ensure that if you are a truck driver you do everything right .
As mentioned earlier , as long as you follow the guidelines , keep your logbook and equipment in check , as well as make any necessary repairs at the first notice of them , you will avoid all hassles and inconveniences of travel .
However , in some areas , regular inspection of random trucks is a common occurrence , so do n’t think you ’ve done something wrong .
You are most likely aware of routes that require these degrees of caution .
Stay safe and good riding .

US Air Force purge : Growing tensions within a militarized state
By Bill Van Auken
7 June 2008
The sudden sacking of both the senior civilian and military commanders of the US Air Force Thursday is symptomatic of the growing tensions within an American government dominated by militarism and torn by divisions over what strategy Washington should pursue to defend its global interests .
The forced resignations of Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne and chief of staff Gen. Michael “ Buzz ” Moseley were ostensibly triggered by what Defense Secretary Robert Gates called “ a chain of failures ” in the Air Force ’s handling of US nuclear weapons .
The top - level firings followed the completion of a report on a strange incident in which four Air Force ballistic missile fuses — crucial components of nuclear weapons — were shipped to Taiwan in 2006 .
The Pentagon attributed the shipment to a mistake in which the nosecone fuse assemblies , which trigger intercontinental ballistic missiles as they approach their target , were sent instead of battery packs intended for use in Taiwanese military helicopters .
According to the official story , this supposed mix - up , which provoked heated protests from China , went undetected for 17 months , until the Taiwanese military alerted Washington last March .
The controversy followed the even more disturbing incident in August 2007 , in which an Air Force B - 52 flew the breadth of the US with six nuclear - tipped cruise missiles fixed to its wings .
As far as it is known , the flight marked the first time that an American bomber had taken to the air armed with nuclear weapons since the height of the Cold War more than 40 years ago .
The armed B - 52 ’s flight from Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana was also declared a “ mistake . ”
While the final report on the incident remains classified , it is far from clear how the warheads , which are electronically monitored and must go through multiple checks before being removed from their bunkers and placed on the wing of an aircraft , could have been mistakenly mounted on the plane .
Given the context of the incident , which transpired amid reports of planning within the Bush administration for an attack on Iran , including possible use of nuclear weapons , the perfunctory statement from the Air Force that the transfer was an “ error ” and that “ the munitions were safe , secure and under military control at all times ” hardly allayed concerns .
Taken together , the claims of innocent errors as the explanation for sensitive nuclear devices being sent to one of the tensest areas of the globe and a nuclear armed flight in the midst of mounting war threats strain credulity .
Both incidents strongly suggest that much more is taking place behind the scenes in the US military and state apparatus than the American people are being told .
Meanwhile , a security exercise conducted last month at the Minot Air Force Base simulating an attack on nuclear weapons storage areas found a gross lack of security , which was blamed on a failure of leadership .
At Thursday ’s Pentagon news conference , Gates described the shipment of fuses to Taiwan as “ a significant failure to ensure the security of sensitive military components . ”
He continued : “ More troubling , it depicts a pattern of poor performance that was highlighted to us following last year ’s incident involving the improper [ transfer ] of nuclear weapons between Minot Air Force Base and Barksdale Air Force Base . ”
Gates claimed that the decision to remove the two men was “ based entirely ” on a report prepared by Navy Admiral Kirkland Donald , director of naval nuclear propulsion , on the Air Force handling of nuclear munitions .
The defense secretary said that probe revealed a “ gradual erosion of nuclear standards and a lack of effective oversight by Air Force leadership . ”
While no doubt the incidents raised grave questions , the manner in which the two officials were forced to resign evinces a level of urgency that suggests that far more was involved than the release of an investigator ’s report .
Both Wynne and Moseley were attending an Air Force leadership summit at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio .
Moseley was hastily summoned to Washington Thursday for a meeting with Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and asked to resign .
Later that same day , Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England was sent to Wright - Patterson to find Wynne and demand his resignation as well .
It should also be noted that the shakeup at the top of the Air Force is being carried out with the Bush administration facing barely seven months more in office , after which those replacing Wynne and Moseley will almost certainly themselves be replaced as well .
Within the Pentagon , the tensions building up between Gates and the top Air Force officials have been recognized for over a year .
Their sources extend well beyond the two nuclear weapons “ mistakes . ”
Gates has been increasingly open in his criticisms of the Air Force on other matters .
Speaking on May 13 in Colorado at a seminar organized by the Heritage Foundation , the right - wing think tank , Gates said that the military was plagued by what he called “ next - War - itis — the propensity of much of the defense establishment to be in favor of what might be needed in a future conflict . ”
He demanded that all planning and procurements be subordinated to the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The remark was widely seen as directed particularly at the Air Force .
Speaking in April at the Air War College in Alabama , where the Air Force ’s trains its senior officers , Gates complained bitterly about the failure of the military to provide necessary resources for the Iraq war .
“ I ’ve been wrestling for months to get more intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance assets into the theater , ” said defense secretary .
“ Because people were stuck in old ways of doing business , it ’s been like pulling teeth . ”
Gates was referring in particular to what he viewed as the Air Force command ’s dragging its feet on the deployment of greater numbers of Predator UAVs ( unmanned aerial vehicles ) , the armed flying drones used to detect and attack those resisting the US occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Senior Air Force officials have reportedly balked at turning the UAVs over to the Army and have insisted that they be operated by trained pilots .
They also apparently objected to the back - to - back deployments of UAV crews .
More fundamental are the divergences over Gates ’s insistence that the full resources of the military be subordinated to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in particular , and , more generally , to the preparation to fight similar colonial - style wars of repression and occupation in other parts of the world .
Others in the military brass , particularly in the Air Force and the Navy , resist this conception , and point to the potential for new major wars with rising potential challengers such as China , which has begun to modernize its own air force , navy and ballistic missile system .
Underlying their position are powerful institutional and financial interests .
The Air Force has continued to publicly press for the rebuilding of its fleet of some 5,000 tactical warplanes .
It has demanded additional funding both to build a new F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter , which will not be in full production for several more years , as well as to obtain additional F - 22 Raptors , beyond the 183 it has been authorized to buy from Lockheed Martin .
The F - 35 program is projected to cost some $ 300 billion , while the F - 22s cost approximately $ 175 million each .
Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee in April that he opposed increased production of the F - 22s .
“ The reality is that we are fighting two wars , in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” he said , “ and the F - 22 has not performed a mission in either theater . ”
Despite the secretary ’s statements , senior Air Force officers staged a virtual mutiny , continuing to press Congress for additional funding to acquire more F - 22s .
Perhaps not coincidentally , the resigning air force secretary , Wynne , was recruited to the Pentagon by the Bush administration in 2001 after a 30 - year career in the aerospace industry , where he had headed the space divisions of both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin , maker of the F - 22 and America ’s number one military contractor .
The purge at the top of the Air Force was clearly seen as having substantial financial implications .
“ This ca n’t be good for any of us , ” a Lockheed Martin official close to the F - 22 program told Aviation Weekly .
“ I was completely surprised and nobody I know knew anything about it beforehand , ” the official is quoted as saying .
It is now nearly half a century since the Republican President Dwight Eisenhower urged the American people to “ guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex . ”
The ever - closer relations between America ’s expanding military and a financially powerful arms industry , he warned had the “ potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power . ”
The threat indicated by Eisenhower in his farewell speech of 1961 has mushroomed into something far beyond anything the World War II general could ever have imagined .
The Air Force alone now disposes of a budget of close to $ 130 billion , while military spending as a whole - including the successive “ emergency ” funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the nuclear weapons appropriations for the Energy Department - is fast approaching one trillion dollars a year .
US generals and admirals who serve as regional commanders now act as American pro-consuls , not only in Iraq and Afghanistan , but in many other parts of the world , where they wield far greater power than any ambassador or other civilian representative of the US government .
Meanwhile , an officer corps that in a previous period generally avoided partisan politics has become highly politicized , influenced not only by the Republican Party , but increasingly by the Christian right .
Finally , in pursuit of its strategy of global militarism , the Bush administration has sought to portray the military as entitled to virtual veto power over the elected government , insisting that it is the commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan - hand - picked supporters of the administration ’s policies — who must decide the course of the wars .
Under such a government , a sudden shakeup within the top ranks of the military like this week ’s unprecedented simultaneous removal of a service ’s civilian secretary and uniformed chief — or for that matter the forced resignation of Central Command head Admiral William Fallon in March — raises a number of disturbing possibilities .
Was there more to the unauthorized flight of a nuclear - armed bomber last August than the government dares reveal to the American people ?
Are the Air Force chiefs being sacked in preparation for using America ’s airpower in another criminal war of aggression , potentially against Iran , under conditions in which the Pentagon ’s uniformed command is already deeply dissatisfied with the over - extension of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Had the near mutiny over military procurements , which apparently enjoyed the backing of powerful financial interests , gone further than has been revealed ?
Were they forced out to avoid a more open challenge to the civilian control of the military ?
The answers to these and other crucial questions remained hidden behind a veil of “ national security . ”
Clearly , however , under conditions of a protracted decay of basic institutions of bourgeois democracy in America , the ever - increasing power of the military poses the most fundamental threat to the basic democratic rights of American working people .
Queensland researchers say they have made a major breakthrough in renewable energy technology .
Professor Max Lu from the University of Queensland says they have been able to grow titanium oxide crystals , which could be used in solar power cells and water purification and recycling devices .
He says the material is cheap and easy to produce and it will make solar energy more cost - effective .
" The promise of such a crystal is , because it 's such a high - reactivity surface that we 're creating , they will enable the boosting of efficiency in terms of solar energy conversion to electricity , " he said .
" In other words , if this can be made into a solar cell it is going to be much more efficient . "
He says the technology will make solar power more cost - effective , but concedes that it is up to 10 years away from being commercially available .
" This has shown great promise .
The prospect of this in the area of renewable energy is huge , " he said .
Myanmar has been hit devastated by Cyclone Nargis and tens of thousands are dead , tens of thousands more require food and medical aid .
The Myanmar regime is accused of blocking and delaying aid to its people .
The Myanmar regime is not a regime that I will defend .
It is a militaristic clique that has seized power and rules by force .
Nevertheless , much the same can be said about the US regime .
Unlike the US regime , however , the Myanmar regime , basically , confines its perfidy to within its own borders .
Of course , whenever humans are in trouble , a responsible government will see to it that those humans are attended to , fed , and cared for .
The Myanmar government is accused by western governments and western media of negligence and worse towards its own citizens .
UK prime minister Gordon Brown declared : “ It is being made into a man -made catastrophe by the negligence , the neglect and the inhuman treatment of the Burmese people by a regime that is failing to act and to allow the international community to do what it wants to do . ”
“ Man - made catastrophe . ”
Is n’t that what the UK engineered in Iraq as junior partner ( poodle ) to the US ?
Over a million excess Iraqi civilian mortalities estimated since March 2003 ( and there is no reason to ignore the US - UK supported UN sanctions that killed another million or so Iraqi civilians after 1991 ) .
That is genocide , and genocides are always man-made .
Brown added , “ The responsibility lies with the Burmese regime and they must be held accountable . ”
Fine , and to be fair and honest , at the same time , Brown and erstwhile prime minister Tony Blair must be held accountable for their role in the murderous carnage in Iraq .
If being accountable is to have any meaning , then Britain must , at long last , also be judged and do penance for its crimes , among others , in the Chagos archipelago , on the Indian subcontinent , against the Indigenous peoples in the western hemisphere and Oceania , throughout the Middle East , particularly its complicity in wiping of Palestine off the map .
The Plank Stuck in the Western Eye
The Europeans are calling for a forced intervention , and some US members of the House of Representatives are imploring president George Bush to intervene in Myanmar .
The Europeans , US , and Canada are complicit with Zionists in the starvation of Palestinians .
This is in addition to demolishing homes , carrying out assassinations , withholding money transfers , destroying vital utilities , etc. in Gaza , and yet they are calling for an intervention elsewhere .
French Ambassador Jean - Maurice Ripert called for immediate action in Myanmar : “ We are shifting from a situation of non-assistance to people in need to a situation that could lead to a true crime against humanity if we go on like that . ”
One might wonder why the British and French “ leaders ” wail and moan about disaster - stricken Myanmar but are silent about disaster - stricken New Orleans .
Almost three years after Hurricane Katrina struck the coast of Louisiana , people in New Orleans are waiting on assistance .
The 43 US representatives calling for intervention in Myanmar are apparently unaware of the tardy US response to the victims of Katrina or that the US regime rejected aid from certain countries , such as Cuba .
Venezuela , which contributed generously to the victims of Katrina , was reportedly rebuffed initially by the Bush administration .
An excuse proffered by a senior State Department official , according to the Washington Post , was that “ unsolicited offers can be ‘ counterproductive . ’ ”
And , where are the voices of British and French government figures about the genocide Israel perpetrates against Palestinians ?
Obviously , these western government figures are selectively speaking out on man-made catstrophes and crimes against humanity .
Corporate Media Deluge on Myanmar vs. Silence on Palestine
A sampling of corporate media headlines reveals an animus toward the Myanmar government :
“ Aid stymied off Myanmar shores and borders , ” International Herald Tribune
“ Myanmar Neighbors Seek Ways To Press Country on Cyclone Aid , ” Wall Street Journal
“ International Pressure on Myanmar Junta Is Building , ” New York Times
“ Diplomats tour cyclone zone , but Myanmar still refuses aid , ” Euronews.net
That the corporate media would go into a frenzy over Myanmar while ignoring the man-made catastrophes in Palestine and in Iraq is telling .
In the case of Myanmar , the western corporate media is behaving as it should : criticizing a non-democratic regime and , supposedly , putting the interests of the Myanmarese people front and center .
But one must ask : why is this same media falling over itself to celebrate 60 years in power by Jewish segregationists who contrived and meted out a catastrophe ( al - Nakba ) to the Palestinians ?
Why has this same media remained so quiescent over the travails that still bedevil the citizenry of New Orleans ?
Why does the same media collaborate in the ultimate international crime of aggression - occupation against Iraq ?
The contrasting response to cyclone - ravaged Myanmar with other contemporary disasters — whether man-made or acts of nature — scathingly exposes the nasty double standards of western governments and their corporate media .
If you ’ve ever been sat at your desk , hard at work , trying to finish your report in time for that very important meeting with the Managing Director ; you ’ll know just how annoying it is to have the wacky office comedian come striding up to you in his Homer Simpson tie , wanting to play his new collection of stupid cell phone ringtones .
Welcome to the dark and murky world of Office Etiquette .
I actually made a big etiquette faux pas at my new employer just this week .
I was well - groomed , and I was polite , pleasant and smiling as I greeted my new co-workers .
But as I sat down after making myself a cup of tea , I could n’t help but notice that everyone in the office was looking at me like I ’d just murdered their cat .
I ’d committed a cardinal office sin : never , ever make a drink just for yourself .
So how do you know what the politics of your office are ?
Well , like the many different cultures and societies of other countries and continents , it varies from office to office .
In England you could be hung , drawn and quartered for not making a round of tea for your colleagues .
In Russia however , they ’d be more upset if you forgot to slip a drop of vodka into their brew .
For this very reason , we ’ve created The Ultimate Office Etiquette Guide so that you never again make the mistake of taking a stapler without first asking for permission !
General Office Etiquette
While different offices have different policies , there are a few universal truths about etiquette that you need to be aware of at all times .
Ask before you borrow anything .
There ’s nothing worse than being branded the office thief because your stash of ‘ borrowed ’ rulers is discovered by the cleaning lady .
Wash your mugs after you ’ve used them .
If you expect the cleaners to wash up for you , you ’re going to be in for a big surprise .
You might find your mug covered in mold and thick , congealed milk floating around the bottom .
Clean it yourself .
Any release of bodily gases is highly frowned upon .
Farting may have been okay back in High School , but you wo n’t be taken seriously if you perform a rendition of Flight Of The Bumble Bee through your ass .
Do n’t fall asleep at your desk .
And if you do , make sure you ’re at a desk that faces away from everyone else and you do n’t snore .
Open doors for your colleagues .
You wo n’t do yourself any favors by letting the door close on the geeky guy from I.T while he ’s carrying a computer tower and monitor into the office .
Smoking and Vaping .
If you smoke cigarettes or vape e juice , it is important to be mindful of your coworkers .
Both vaping and smoking should be done outside .
Even if company policy allows you to vape at your desk ( rare ) , it is always best to ask for your coworkers permission .
Colleague Relationships
It ’s important to always be respectful of your colleagues and avoid burning your bridges with them .
You never know when you may rely on their help to get you out of a tricky jam .
Here are a few things you should be aware of :
There ’s nothing more annoying that a ringing phone that goes unanswered .
If you do n’t want to answer your phone put it on silent or divert calls to your answerphone .
Also , keep your cell phone on vibrate because if I hear another rendition of the Crazy Frog ring tone , I will kill someone .
Office politics is unavoidable .
Do n’t let people undermine you or draw you into arguments .
Let your achievements do the talking for you and make sure that the right people are aware of what you have accomplished without you needing to brag about it .
If you ’re going to take lunch at your desk , keep it simple .
A sandwich is best .
Do n’t go bringing in a homemade spicy chicken and pasta dish that ’s going to stink up the office and annoy people .
On the lunch subject , make sure you do n’t disturb people with work - related problems when they ’re on their lunch .
They wo n’t thank you for it and you ’ll be repaid in kind at a later date .
Always offer to make tea and coffee for your colleagues .
If you do n’t chip in and help out with drink rounds and buying in the milk , you may find that your “ World ’s Best Guy ” mug mysteriously disappears , never to be seen again .
You ’ll also be seen as the cheapskate who wo n’t stump up for a bottle of milk .
Evil eyes and anonymous hate e-mail will surely ensue .
If you really must have sex with the insanely hot girl in Accounts ; be a gentleman .
If you love her and leave her , you better believe the office will be rife with talk about your lack of stamina and ‘ pinky ’ sized penis .
You ’ll look unprofessional to your bosses and , worse still , when an even hotter girl joins the Sales team , she ’ll know about your indiscretions almost immediately and you ’ll never have a chance with her .
Verbal Communication
The way you communicate with fellow employees is very important to your career .
Get it wrong and you ’ll be cast out into the abyss and moved to the office in the basement with no windows or heating .
Here ’s what you need to know about verbal office etiquette .
Although you may hate the idea of being formal , it is a necessity in the workplace .
You ’ll be speaking to people you ’ve never met before , customers , other departments and so on .
Answering the phone , “ Yo , ‘ sup homie ? ” just is n’t going to cut it in the business world .
If someone gives you their name , remember it .
Especially if you ’re in a role where clients regularly come to the office .
Using their name to address them throughout the meeting makes it more personalized and makes them feel more relaxed and willing to engage in conversation with you .
Leave the bad habits at home .
Do n’t swear and do n’t chew gum when speaking to someone .
Even over the phone .
They can hear it and it is annoying .
Make sure you listen when people are speaking to you .
Looking around and wondering what time you ’re meeting the guys in the bar later while your boss briefs you on a new campaign is poor form and when you ca n’t remember what he ’s said , you ’ll look incompetent and unprofessional .
Over time you can reduce the formality , but for an initial meeting play it safe and keep conversation solely on work matters .
You do n’t want to be telling the I.T. Manager about the bedroom antics of the hot girl in Accounts .
End your meeting with a hearty handshake , thank them for their time and exchange business cards if necessary .
Outside the office
Office etiquette extends beyond the walls of your workplace and into any venue that involves work .
This is where it gets tricky because , as they say , you should never mix business with pleasure .
Apparently .
If you ’ve got a business lunch , then get there on time .
Leave early if you need to but do not be late because it is n’t a lunch per s? , it ’s a meeting in an informal location .
Turn your phone off during any business lunch you go to .
Nobody wants to look inconsiderate while taking a call during an important meeting .
Keep your greeting short and sweet with the aforementioned handshake .
Proper business meeting etiquette allows for a few minutes of small talk but keep it simple .
The weather , the latest football results and so on .
If you invited your guest to the lunch , you ’re the one who should be paying for the meal .
You can of course discuss splitting the bill when arranging the meeting but do n’t leave it till the bill arrives as some people see this as a sign of professional weakness .
Do n’t forget to tip the restaurant staff .
When networking at business conferences you should make the first move to approach people wherever possible .
Remember that first impressions count so dress to impress and keep the conversation formal .
You can build your business contacts by networking with the speakers at conferences .
Do your research and find out who is speaking and what they are about .
This will give you some good topics to discuss with them if you get the chance .
Set yourself a target to meet during a conference .
Say , five new contacts through networking .
Using the amazing etiquette tips you ’ve learnt so far , it should be easy .
Do n’t get too drunk at the office party !
How many people have lost respect , pay rises and even their job from drunken antics over the years .
Keep your alcohol consumption in moderation and avoid fornicating with the boss ’ wife wherever possible .
Do n’t moan and complain about the lack of direction in the business while enjoying a cocktail with the girl from Accounts .
It will inevitably get back to someone senior and you ’ll be the guy who cleans the toilets for the next 30 years .
On top of these tips , you ’ll need to be aware of the following as well :
There is always a ‘ mother ’ figure in the office who will sort out birthdays , collections and the office milk fund .
When she asks for a donation to Jeff in Marketing who is leaving for pastures new , do n’t make the mistake of thinking the donation is voluntary .
If you do n’t put a bit of money in there you can forget about ever getting a collection yourself and you will be branded as the office Scrooge for the rest of your professional career .
Most offices have some sort of Friday ‘ ritual ’ .
One office I worked in had a dress - down Friday where everyone came in jeans and t- shirt .
The first time someone told me , I thought it was a hazing thing and so turned up on the Friday suited and booted as usual .
Imagine my surprise when I saw the MD waltz into the office wearing a Nike tracksuit with matching sweatbands .
Find out if your office has a Friday ritual so you do n’t look a fool like I did .
( Or was it the MD that looked the fool ? )
Office etiquette is basically about communicating with people in a professional and formal environment .
When it comes down to it , it ’s about making the right impression and every office has a different environment and structure .
If you have any thoughts and ideas on office etiquette , tips and tricks for business meetings or not getting too drunk at the Christmas party then leave a comment for everyone else to learn from .
This guide will only become truly Ultimate when the community of readers have put across their thoughts .

The environmental movement has never been short on noble goals .
Preserving wild spaces , cleaning up the oceans , protecting watersheds , neutralizing acid rain , saving endangered species — all laudable .
But today , one ecological problem outweighs all others : global warming .
Restoring the Everglades , protecting the Headwaters redwoods , or saving the Illinois mud turtle wo n't matter if climate change plunges the planet into chaos .
It 's high time for greens to unite around the urgent need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
Just one problem .
Winning the war on global warming requires slaughtering some of environmentalism 's sacred cows .
We can afford to ignore neither the carbon - free electricity supplied by nuclear energy nor the transformational potential of genetic engineering .
We need to take advantage of the energy efficiencies offered by urban density .
We must accept that the world 's fastest - growing economies wo n't forgo a higher standard of living in the name of climate science — and that , on the way up , countries like India and China might actually help devise the solutions the planet so desperately needs .
Some will reject this approach as dangerously single - minded :
The environment is threatened on many fronts , and all of them need attention .
So argues Alex Steffen .
That may be true , but global warming threatens to overwhelm any progress made on other issues .
The planet is already heating up , and the point of no return may be only decades away .
So combating greenhouse gases must be our top priority , even if that means embracing the unthinkable .
Here , then , are 10 tenets of the new environmental apostasy .

Email address validation is a quixotic affair that 's sure to end with you sporting a false sense of achievement and your users in tears .
Many " better mousetrap " regular - expression - based validation system on the web today are overly strict and reject perfectly valid email addresses .
Beyond regular expressions and other string - based techniques , your options are to check the DNS server ( but DNS lookups can fail on occasion ) and vrfy the SMTP server ( but many SMTP servers turn this off to stop email harvesters ) .
Ultimately , you can actually send an email to the address and see if there are any bounces .
Or , we could just not bother .
That , at least , is the approach that the Google App Engine SDK currently takes .
Both the google.appengine.ext.db.EmailPropery ( ) and the google.appengine.api.mail.is_email_valid( ) functions only check that a non-empty string instance is passed .
The problem with that is that you really do n't want your good friends asdfhdsjkj and asdfghdsj to make regular camio appearances in your lovely database .
It feels to me that the best approach is to accept that we can't truly validate email addresses and instead perform some light validation that does n't provide false positives while blocking the most obviously non-validating addresses .
This seems to be the approach taken by the validation regular expression in Django ( email_re in django.core.validators ) .
Phil Haack has a good article about all this from last year this titled I Knew How To Validate An Email Address Until I Read
The RFC in which he quotes several unlikely - looking yet valid email addresses from RFC 3696 ( Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names ) including such gems like !def!xyz%abc@example.com .
I ran the whole list through Django 's validator and they all passed .
All this to say that I 'm using the Django email validator in my Google App Engine apps and it appears to be working well .

Snarky , but basically correct :
3. Male Family Members and Friends ( Especially if they are drunk and you are young foreign born . )
It ’s the strange man we fear — the footsteps in the dark — the unlocked back door .
The correct part of the constant American crime fantasy is that it is usually a man hunting us .
Approximately 90 % of all murders are committed males .
But stop worrying so much about strangers you do n’t know and think about the strangers you know .
Too often , we invite our predators in and offer them a drink .
The leading cause of death for black women from 18 - 45 is domestic violence .
The New York Health Department found that lovers committed 60 % of all murders of women .
Young foreign - born women were 87 % more likely to be killed by a lover than a stranger .
Females are much more likely to be victimized by someone they know .
Strangers committed about 14 % of all murders in 2002 while a family member or an acquaintance committed 43 % .
Family members commit two - thirds of murders of children under five .
Two - thirds of violent crimes committed by acquaintances involved alcohol .
Think about that at your next dinner party .
3. People of Your Own So- called Race
An extension of our narcissism is the belief that people who are like us are sane .
But it ’s the people who are most like us who are mostly likely to kill us .
Blacks murdered more than 90 % black murder victims .
White criminals murdered more than 80 % of white murder victims .
I ’m not saying strangers are safer than the people we know ; I ’m just saying they might be .
I want to rip those stupid glasses of his face and jump up and down on them like I 'm having a temper tantrum .
Is that mean or just uncalled for ?
It ’s sleazy as hell for one candidate to attack the other ’s wife .
But it ’s even weirder for him to use his own scandal - ridden wife to do it .
I mean , with all due respect , what moral authority does Cindy McCain have to start throwing stones at Mrs. Obama ?
Only one candidate ’s wife is a drug addict who actually stole drugs from poor children in order to feed her addiction .
And that candidate is not Barack Obama .
It ’s John McCain .
People who live in glass pill boxes should n’t cast stones .
Oh , and not kidding about Cindy McCain being a drug addict and stealing drugs from children .
The non-partisan Web site , Snopes.com , had this to say about Mrs. McCain ’s illicit drug addiction :
In 1989 , following two back surgeries , Cindy McCain became addicted to the painkillers Vicodin and Percocet .
To keep up with her daily need of 10 to 15 pills , she used other people ’s names for prescriptions and stole drugs from the American Voluntary Medical Team , a mobile surgical unit she ’d begun in 1988 to provide emergency medical services around the world .
A 1993 DEA audit of the amount of painkillers her charity had obtained quickly uncovered her thefts .
She avoided prosecution for those crimes through an agreement with the Justice Department in which she submitted to drug testing , paid a fine , performed community service in a soup kitchen , and joined Narcotics Anonymous .
She also closed her medical charity
Patriots do n’t steal drugs from children .
What should we do about climate change ?
The question is an ethical one .
Science , including the science of economics , can help discover the causes and effects of climate change .
It can also help work out what we can do about climate change .
But what we should do is an ethical question .
Fishing in the stream of consciousness , researchers now can detect our intentions and predict our choices before we are aware of them ourselves .
The brain , they have found , appears to make up its mind 10 seconds before we become conscious of a decision -- an eternity at the speed of thought .
Their findings challenge conventional notions of choice .

BEFORE Vladimir Nabokov , the author of “ Lolita , ” “ Pale Fire , ” “ Speak , Memory ” and other masterworks , died in Lausanne , Switzerland , in July 1977 , he had been hard at work on another novel .
The previous December , he told The New York Times that the “ not quite finished manuscript ” was called “ The Original of Laura , ” that it had already been “ completed in my mind ” and that during a recent hospital stay , “ in my diurnal delirium , ” he had “ kept reading it aloud to a small dream audience in a walled garden . ”
Shortly afterward , Nabokov ’s editor at McGraw - Hill revealed that the author was about to do the actual writing , in pencil on 3 - by - 5 - inch index cards ( Nabokov never worked with a typewriter ) .
Then , in words parroted by the editor , Nabokov would “ deal himself a novel . ”
Nabokov , however , was able to build only part of the complete deck  138 index cards , with many erasures and much emendation  before falling ill for the last time .
Known as an artistic perfectionist and a literary purist , he left behind instructions that the cards were to be destroyed .
But neither his wife , Véra , nor his son , Dmitri , now nearly 74 , could bring themselves to carry out Nabokov ’s injunction .
Since Véra ’s death in 1991 , Dmitri  who was also a translator of his father ’s early work and is now his literary executor  had by some accounts been wrestling mightily with the question of whether to follow his father ’s wishes and consign the cards to the flames , or to preserve the manuscript for posterity .
The last work of a modern master , however fragmentary , is a matter of public interest and scholarly importance .
The nuances of “ Laura ” and her fate have been hotly debated on bookish Web sites and elsewhere , with Tom Stoppard , for example , calling for the matches and John Banville urging clemency in The Times of London .
Now , Dmitri Nabokov has announced that “ Laura ” will indeed be published , and suggests in a Q. and A. conducted by e-mail with the Week in Review that , in fact , her peril has been exaggerated .

It ’s been three decades since your father ’s death .
Why did it take you so long to decide the fate of “ Laura , ” and how did you come to your final decision ?
How difficult has it been ?
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Sunday he believes his state will shake off its housing troubles by next year .
" We just have to wait until we grow our way out of the situation , and I think by next year , we will grow out of it , " Schwarzenegger said in an interview on NBC News program " Meet the Press . "
Schwarzenegger said he was shocked by the speed of the subprime mortgage crisis that froze financial markets last summer and has yet to clear up .
He said the turmoil erupted shortly after economists had assured him that the California economy and the national economy would stay on a strong growth path .
" I am as amazed as everyone else about how quickly it came , " Schwarzenegger said .
California has seen its state revenue shrink as the housing crisis has deepened and foreclosures have risen .
Schwarzenegger said that California has a diversified economy with many different sectors -- entertainment , high - tech and bio -tech -- with which to weather the storm .
But the Republican governor was reluctant to put too much blame on the housing or mortgage industries .
" There were big mistakes made by borrowers and big mistakes made by lenders .
I think everyone was on such a roll ... that people started speculating , " he said .
" And of course what happened , the housing market was like the dot - com bubble , there was a housing bubble and finally the whole thing collapsed . "
A new report by Chapman University said that the two biggest drags on the California economy were the mortgage and construction industries , which were also the first to feel the housing market 's downfall .
Five of the top 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure rates in the country are located in the state .
Interview : Tuhabonye 's remarkable Olympic quest By Julian Shea
Tuhabonye still bears the scars of his ordeal " There was no way to escape .
People were waiting outside - if someone tried to jump out , they would attack them with machetes . "
Of the 36,000 runners lining up in Sunday 's London Marathon , 33 - year - old Burundian Olympic hopeful Gilbert Tuhabonye has perhaps the most remarkable story .
In 1993 , Tuhabonye , then 19 , was looking forward to graduating from his high school in Kibimba and taking up an athletics scholarship at Tulane University in America .
But one October day , Tuhabonye and 100 of his fellow Tutsis were captured by rival Hutus , herded into a petrol station and set on fire .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They were doing everything they could to make sure everybody in the building died , " says Tuhabonye .
He was the sole survivor of the massacre as he smashed a window , climbed out and ran for his life .
Eventually he found safety in a hospital and began the slow recovery process .
Miraculously , less than 18 months after having the flesh burnt off his right shin down to the bone , Tuhabonye was running again , competing at the 1995 World Student Games in Japan .
The following year , as one of Burundi 's most promising young talents , he was selected to go to an International Olympic Committee training camp for athletes from developing nations .
It was the greatest moment of my life .
If I can let someone who tried to kill me go free , I can do anything - it inspired me . "
Gilbert Tuhabonye
There , in a gesture of greater symbolism than the organisers could possibly have imagined , Tuhabonye carried the torch for the Atlanta Olympics on the relay through the streets of Birmingham , Alabama , the birthplace of the civil rights movement .
" That fire had been burning me , but now I had it in my hand - it was amazing , " he said .
" They told us to go slowly , but I did n't listen to what they said - I was running so fast .
It was an unbelievable feeling . "
In 1996 , Tuhabonye came face to face with one of the people who tried to kill him .
" He collapsed at my feet , begging forgiveness , " he said .
" Here was the guy who was in charge of putting everybody in that building .
Some of my friends were approaching , and I knew that if I did n't let him go , they would kill him .
So I said ' Go , get out of here . '
He could n't believe it .
" As I watched him go , it was the greatest moment of my life .
" If I can let someone who tried to kill me go free , I can do anything - it inspired me . "
Now settled in Austin , Texas , Tuhabonye has become something of an inspiration himself to hundreds of runners who are part of his running club , Gilbert 's Gazelles .
And coaching them led to the former middle distance runner stepping up to marathon running .
Tuhabonye now runs a thriving running club in Austin , Texas " In 2001 I was coaching a lot of people at distance running .
I 'd run with them for two hours or so , and it was pretty easy .
" One day I did 30 km on 5:10 mile pace , so I thought , ' Maybe I should do a marathon ' .
" In my first race I ran just over five minutes a mile pace until 23 miles , but failed to drink any water and so had to walk the last three miles .
But it gave me hope that I could be a marathon runner . "
Going into the London Marathon , Tuhabonye 's personal best is two hours 22 minutes and seven seconds .
That is four minutes outside the ' B ' standard qualifying time for the Olympics and seven minutes off the ' A ' standard .
" If I could get to Beijing it would be a tremendous message about forgiveness , " he says .
" I 've moved away from the past and forgiven the people who tried to kill me .
For the world to be a better place , we have to leave the past behind and move on . "

Welcome to part six of our eight - part Guide to Guerrilla Marketing .
In our journey through the captivating world of guerrilla marketing , we ’ve seen some interesting sights .
The birth of the concept , its evolution , the big corporations that play the guerrilla game , the viral nature of some campaigns , and gmarketing for social causes have all caught our attention as we stroll along Advertising Street .
Coming up on your left is a peculiar little place .
It ’s a squat building with the windows blacked out .
A security guard stands sentry over the single entrance and regards passers - by suspiciously .
This , friends , is where new guerrilla marketing methods are cooked up and shipped out hot and fresh to you , the unwitting consumer .
The details of what goes on in there are tightly guarded , but we ’ve got a key .
One of the main advantages of guerrilla marketing is that it ’s unexpected .
It catches us off guard and causes an emotional response : laughter , shock or sadness are great sellers .
It ’s easy to see why marketers would rather you did n’t know just how they ’re using guerrilla marketing to their advantage .
If you know their secrets , you may just stop responding .
It probably does n’t come as a surprise that marketers are a clever bunch .
They are well versed in the principles of human psychology that make us want to buy what they ’re selling .
Anyone who has ever taken a marketing class will probably recognize the psychological principles used to sell us things : reciprocity , authority , consistency / commitment , social proof / acceptance , and scarcity / urgency .
And in the methods we ’ll explain below , you can find each and every one of those principles .
In this installment of our guerrilla marketing series we will take a closer look at some unusually interesting types including ambient marketing , presence marketing , grassroots marketing , wild posting , undercover marketing and astroturfing .
We took a look at viral marketing back in part four of this series .
This is a highly visible form of guerrilla marketing these days .
A viral campaign ca n’t be planned or predicted , but it is dearly hoped for by marketers .
A successful viral campaign uses existing communication networks ( you tell two friends , they each tell two friends , and so on ) , does n’t require much in terms of resources , and has the potential to be unstoppable .
If you ’re giving something away , even better .
Remember Gmail invites ?
They were somewhat difficult to get at first , so everyone wanted one .
Ambient marketing allows a business to create brand recognition without necessarily pushing their products .
One excellent example is the Dancing Grass Vans of London .
Owned by renegade smoothie makers ( and brilliant marketers )
Innocent , the vans are covered in real , growing grass and can often be seen around the city making deliveries and drawing stares .
Because they serve a real purpose ( delivering smoothies ) , the vans do n’t look like advertisements .
But do you forget the name of a company with grass - covered vans ?
Never .
Leading up to the release of the Simpsons Movie , 7 - 11 transformed some of their stores to look just like Kwik - E - Marts , complete with weird Springfield - type products .
This ambient marketing campaign was ridiculously effective .
Presence marketing is along the same lines as ambient marketing .
It ’s about making the business name recognizable and familiar and always there .
You know that saying , “ out of sight , out of mind ? ”
It goes double for products that do n’t maintain a constant presence .
This can be achieved through product placements in movies and TV shows , stalls at local festivals and markets , regular Twitter updates , or whatever else makes that product name visible daily .
Small businesses and entrepreneurs with modest marketing budgets often find that presence marketing delivers an excellent return for their investment .
All they really have to do is be visible .
Grassroots marketing is gaining popularity like – well , like a grass fire .
A grassroots campaign can take on many forms , but for the most part it is about winning customers one - by - one rather than on a very large scale .
Some grassroots campaigns have elements of presence marketing ( like posting on message boards relevant to your business ) or viral marketing ( like the above user - generated Sony ad ) .
A successful grassroots campaign is all about building relationships and emphasizing the personal connection , not about broadcasting your message and hoping potential customers are listening .
Wild postings may seem old - fashioned , but they are still wildly popular with indie bands and products that want to portray that indie image .
Have you ever walked down a city street and seen a wall plastered with multiple copies of a poster for a movie , concert , or alcoholic beverage ?
Those would be wild postings , and part of their effectiveness lies in the way that they can make us believe we ’re witnessing something momentous .
Most of us would love to have a poster from the wild posting days of the Beatles , right ?
So you ’d better grab that Smirnoff Ice poster now while you can , right ?
Would you rather have your advertising handed to you ?
Tissue - pack advertising was made popular in Japan , but today it ’s spreading to infiltrate the rest of the world .
Knowing that advertising fliers were almost never accepted , much less read , Japanese businesses began to hand out pocket packs of tissues with ads on them .
This simple but ingenious marketing method works because , well , who would turn down free stuff ?
Because the giveaway is a useful item , it stays close to the target consumer until it ’s been used up .
These days , you ’d be hard pressed to find pocket packs of tissues in Japanese shops because they are so readily available for free .
Undercover marketing , also known as buzz marketing , is said to be one of the more devious ways of marketing to the masses .
Remember the “ buy me a drink ” girls from part two of this series ?
These lovely young vixens were being paid to create a buzz around a certain beverage without ever letting you in on their dirty little secret : they were being paid to be so friendly .
Undercover marketing / buzz marketing is all about selling something to someone who has no idea they ’ve just witnessed a sales pitch .
Astroturfing is widely considered to be the slimiest of all guerrilla marketing practices .
It involves creating an artificial buzz about a product or company , and it ’s mighty risky in the information age .
Postings are created in online forums , singing the praises of a certain product or service – but they are n’t made by the public .
They ’re made by shills , or people associated with the company who are paid to express a positive opinion .
Astroturfing is rampant online in forums and blogs ( actually “ flogs , ” or fake blogs ) , but you can still see the odd IRL astroturfer wandering department stores , lobbying Congress , and writing letters to newspaper editors .
Alternative marketing is referenced consistently by marketers , but it is by nature challenging to define .
It may be best defined as publicity that looks like it is completely removed from the company itself .
For example , when Paris Hilton ’s Sidekick was hacked , sales of Sidekicks jumped overnight .
While T - Mobile probably ( maybe ? ) had nothing to do with that publicity , it was excellent marketing for them .
In fact , it has been suggested more than once that the whole event was an orchestrated publicity stunt .
Alternative marketing takes a good deal of imagination and a healthy dose of luck to pull off .
If the public finds out that they ’ve been duped , it will spell disaster for the campaign .
Experiential marketing is increasingly embraced by all types of companies and brands today .
It ’s becoming easier for us to tune out and ignore advertisements today , so experiential marketing aims to give you an experience rather than send you a one - way message .
Experiential marketing lets you interact with the product and associate your immediate emotional responses with that brand .
The Charmin Pottypalooza bathrooms at state fairs and the semi-permanent ones ( now gone ) in New York City are an unprecedented example of effective experiential marketing .
How many of these methods have you seen just this week ?
With new concepts being rolled out all the time , it ’s not always easy to spot when you ’ve been targeted .

What would Easter be without a religious spat or two ?
No one knows , because there has n't been an Easter in living memory that has n't flushed out some point of religious disgruntlement or another .
Yesterday , betting shops opened on Good Friday for the first time since the Government reformed the gambling laws last year .
Tomorrow Cardinal Keith O'Brien will use his Easter Sunday sermon to attack the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill .
Christians were n't actually being forced into the thousands of establishments that were accepting lines .
But non-Christians who decided either to offer , or to take advantage , of the service are being accused of showing a lack of respect for the Son of God and His Suffering .
This , in a diverse and secular society , seems just a tiny bit bossy and proscriptive .
In my book , it comes under the category described recently by the Archbishop of Canterbury as a " vexatious appeal to religious scruple " .
I have some sympathy with the argument of the Church of England , which suggests that the proliferation of commercial activities on national holidays erodes traditions that " help create a rhythm for the nation 's life " .
But the plain fact is that the Christian calendar still dictates the rhythm of the nation 's life to a massive degree , especially when compared to the waning influence of the church in other public spheres .
Attempts by the religious establishment to enact some kind of three - line whip on people who are tolerant of the fact that their leisure time follows a pattern laid down by a belief system they do not adhere to are pushing matters too far .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It 's all especially irritating when religious adherents are so huffy when they are asked to submit to a three - line whip themselves .
A number of Labour MPs have decided , like the Cardinal , that Easter is the perfect time to complain .
Their beef is about Gordon Brown 's refusal to offer a free vote on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill , which contains a number of proposals that are contrary to the teachings of the Catholic church .
Labour MPs including cabinet members Ruth Kelly , Paul Murphy and Des Browne are said to be unhappy , both about the clauses that remove discrimination against lesbians seeking IVF , and those that loosen some restrictions around the creation of embryos for scientific or medical purposes .
They are not being obliged to vote in favour of these legislative moves , and are perfectly at liberty to exercise their religious objections by not voting at all .
That does n't appear to be good enough for them , though .
They wish to parade how much more important their Catholic beliefs are to them than their parliamentary duties .
Only a hazy belief in the sanctity of embryonic life or a crystal - clear belief in the sanctity of homophobia could possibly be considered as genuine objections to this legislation .
Even the clause that removes the obligation of IVF clinics to " consider a child 's right to have a father " is a red herring , as all people conceived using donors have the right now to know who their father is .
None of this should have a place in the Labour Party ( or the Lib Dems , for that matter , who are expected to offer a free vote , like the Conservatives ) .
Yet even though there is no purely rational and non-discriminatory argument against this legislation , some Labour MPs are said to be considering resignation over the Bill .
Good .
If they cannot reach a reasonable accommodation between being a public member of a socially progressive party , and also a private member of a socially conservative church , then that would certainly be the best way in which to express with clarity where their primary loyalties lie .
Good sense and common consensus decrees that whatever one 's private beliefs , one must live under the rule of law .
It is , therefore , extremely important that the rule of law is not distorted by those who consider their religious beliefs to be of greater importance than their democratic obligations as law - makers .
No Christian is being made to bet over Easter , to collude in the creation of a " saviour sibling " , or to set up a lesbian home .
All that is being asked is that Christians refrain from attempting to impose their own religious prejudices on others .
I do n't in the least want people to be persecuted for their spiritual beliefs .
Nor do I want people to be persecuted for their rejection of them .
If certain Labour parliamentarians showed any understanding of the fact that this is the only civilised way in which pluralist societies can thrive , then there would be no need for a three - line whip at all .
It is a pity that there is .
Let down by women who carp about other women
If the crass behaviour of anyone has ever prompted the assertion that he has " let down all men " , then I 'm afraid I 've forgotten it , and them .
So I wasy nonplussed by widespread claims this week that Heather Mills has " let down all women " .
I 'm not entirely sure that Ms Mills has even let down all one - legged , emotionally unstable , former wives of members of the Beatles , so I have to say that I cannot agree .
The argument goes that in being such a greedy little gold - digger , Mills has put men off marriage even more than ever .
( Greed , after all , is an exclusively female trait , unknown to anyone except hedge - fund managers , MPs , MEPs , users of Sainsbury 's cash machines , people on incapacity benefit , non-doms , tax exiles , sub - prime mortgage brokers and a few other isolated exceptions . )
Since all women want nothing more than to snare a reluctant life partner who will look after her for ever no matter what , Mills has damaged all women 's chances of doing so .
Grrr .
The Daily Mail 's Amanda Platell , on Radio Five Live , went as far as to declare that she has received copious correspondence from mothers who were desperately worried that their sons might fall into the clutches of women like Heather , and busily counselled them to " be careful " .
One cannot help thinking that Heather , cannot have let down these women , who have no doubt been doing their best all their lives to assure their sons that females are nothing but trouble , except for their mums , of course .
If I believed it was possible for individuals to " let down all women " , I 'd be tempted to suggest that the damage is being done by those ladies who choose to portray Heather as anything except the total one - off that she is .
And who'd want to marry a man who imagined that Heather might be a typical woman anyway ?
Frankly , the charidee avenger might have done a few love - sick housewives - in - waiting a favour .
Personally , I can't begin to imagine how anyone brings up a family without the benefit of wedlock .
Just this week , my six - year - old threw up copiously in the bath , and I had no alternative but to retrieve what seemed like half - a- pound of semi- masticated bread and cheese from the plug - hole .
" Look at this – Bath - O - Vom , " I yelled cheerily to my husband , as he tried to sneak past the bathroom door .
" Do remember to wash your hands when you 've finished that , " he offered as he passed quickly on .
Who could put a price on such wise counsel , and such splendid support ?
* Only a few weeks ago , the spectacle of the US Democratic nominations seemed to most interested spectators like an exhilarating roller - coaster ride .
It has settled instead into a stomach - churning journey along a lost highway , as the two contenders bicker among themselves in the back of the car , oblivious to the fact that the Republicans are driving .
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , pictured , are squandering time and money on their personal tussle , and doing their best to undermine each other .
Meanwhile , their real rival , John McCain , amasses his war chest , plans for the election that really matters , and looks on with satisfaction as his divided opponents do his dirty work for him .
Any hope that Clinton and Obama might stand on a double ticket grows less credible by the day .
Modest and selfless as these two implacable contenders for the leadership of the world 's most powerful nation might claim to be , neither of them is at all minded to put their party and their country before their personal ambitions , and decide to settle for what is surely a not inconsiderable consolation prize .
I 'm not a great admirer of Clinton , and I also understand that the age of chivalry is dead .
But I cannot help thinking that Obama has many more years ahead of him , as far as his presidential ambitions are concerned , while Clinton 's in the last - chance saloon .
Logic dictates that Obama has much more to gain , in the long run , from a graceful step backwards .
It 's an audaciously hopeful person indeed who thinks the next US presidency , whoever lands it , is going to be a picnic anyway .
* Easy Living magazine features in its next issue a portrait of a naked Amy Winehouse , pictured , promoting breast cancer care .
I can't think of a single other person I 'd be more likely to turn to for health tips .
They say the unexamined life is not worth living , but some celebrity endorsements take the old adage a wee bit too far .
Congress of the United States
Washington , D.C. 20515
June 6 , 2008
The Honorable Michael Mukasey
Attorney General of the United States
U.S. Department of Justice
950 Pennsylvania Ave. , NW
Washington , DC 20530
Dear Mr. Attorney General :
We are writing to request that you appoint a special counsel to investigate whether the Bush Administration ’s policies regarding the Interrogation of detainees have violated federal criminal laws .
There is mounting evidence that the Bush Administration has sanctioned enhanced interrogation techniques against detainees under the control of the United States that warrant an investigation .
Congress is already aware of the pattern of abuse against detainees under the control of the United States and the Bush Administration .
In 2004 , prisoners being held at Abu Ghraib prison were subjected to abuse , sexual exploitation , and torture .
At the Guantanamo Bay Detention facility prisoners have been held indefinitely , subjected to sleep deprivation , and drugged against their will .
An independent investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross documented several instances of acts of torture against detainees , including soaking a prisoner ’s hand in alcohol and lighting it on fire , subjecting a prisoner to sexual abuse , and forcing a prisoner to eat a baseball .
In October 2005 , the New York Times reported that three detainees were killed during interrogations in Afghanistan and Iraq by CIA agents or CIA contractors .
We believe that these events alone warrant action , but within the last month additional information has surfaced that suggests the fact that not only did top Administration officials meet in the White House and approve the use of enhanced techniques including waterboarding against detainees , but that President Bush was aware of , and approved of the meetings taking place .
This information indicates that the Bush Administration may have systematically implemented , from the top down , detainee interrogation policies that constitute torture or otherwise violate the law .
We believe that these serious and significant revelations warrant an immediate investigation to determine whether actions taken by the President , his Cabinet , and other Administration officials are in violation of the War Crimes Act ( 18 U.S.C. 2441 ) , the Anti-Torture Act ( 18 U.S.C. 2340-2340A ) , and other U.S. and international laws .
Despite the seriousness of the evidence , the Justice Department has brought prosecution against only one civilian for an interrogation - related crime .
Given that record , we believe that it is necessary to appoint a special counsel to insure that a thorough and impartial investigation occurs , and that the prosecution of anyone who violated federal criminal statutes prohibiting torture and abuse is pursued if warranted by the facts .
Again , we strongly urge you to act in a timely manner to appoint a special counsel .
We look forward to hearing from you in response to our request .
Sincerely ,

woman : " Dilbert , when you come over tonight , wear your toolbelt . "
Dilbert says , " Because it 's sexy ? " woman : " That would be between you and the squirrel that keeps chewing the cable from my satellite dish . "
From the BLS : Employment Situation Summary
The unemployment rate rose from 5.0 to 5.5 percent in May , and nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down ( - 49,000 ) , the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today .
In May , employment continued to fall in construction , manufacturing , retail trade , and temporary help services , while health care continued to add jobs .
Click on graph for larger image .
The first graph shows the unemployment rate and the year - over - year change in employment vs. recessions .
Unemployment jumped sharply and the rise in unemployment , from a cycle low of 4.4 % to 5.5 % , is a strong recession indicator .
Also concerning is the YoY change in employment is close to zero ( the economy has added only 236 thousand jobs in the last year ) , also suggesting a recession .
Note the current recession indicated on the graph is " probable " , and is not official .
The second graph shows residential construction employment .
Note : graph does n't start at zero to better show the change .
Residential construction employment declined 25,100 in May , and including revisions to previous months , is down 494 thousand , or about 14.3 % , from the peak in February 2006 .
( compared to housing starts off over 50 % ) .
This is the fifth straight month of job losses .
This is a weak report , and the jump in unemployment strongly suggests a recession .
Hillary Clinton may have scored a solid win over Barack Obama in California 's presidential primary on Feb.
5 ( as she frequently likes to remind folks these days ) , but a new L.A. Times / KTLA poll finds he would fare better than she in the battle with John McCain for the state in November ( a result the Clinton camp wo n't be touting ) .
Obama led McCain in the poll , 47 - 40 % ; in a Clinton matchup with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , she got 43 % , he held steady at 40 % .
One reason for pause for Democrats -- the margins for both of their candidates fall within the survey 's error margin of plus - or - minus 4 percentage points ( though in Obama 's case , just barely ) .
Times reporter Cathleen Decker , in a detailed analysis of the poll , notes that McCain benefits from stronger support from Latinos in California than George W. Bush got in the 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns .
But , as Decker also writes , McCain may be disappointed if he 's looking for a boost to his prospects in California from Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The new poll , conducted Tuesday and Wednesday , found the GOP governor 's approval rating among registered voters in the state has taken a big hit over just a few months .
It stood at 60 % in January ; now it 's at 43 % .
Some background :
The last Republican to win the state in a White House race was George H.W. Bush in 1988 ; he defeated Michael Dukakis , 51 % - 48 % .
Bill Clinton won it in 1992 with 46 % ; Bush got 33 % and Ross Perot 21 % .
Clinton triumphed handily again in 1996 , with 51 % of the vote to Bob Dole 's 38 % .
In 2000 , Al Gore beat George W. Bush , 53 % - 42 % .
And four years ago , John Kerry kept the state securely in the Democratic column , getting 54 % of the vote to Bush 's 44 % .

There are several kinds of Washington memoirs : “ I Reveal the Honest Truth , ” a kiss - up - and - tell designed to settle scores ( nod to honesty optional ) .
“ I Was There at the Start , ” designed to make the author appear to be the linchpin of history .
And , most tedious : “ I Knew It Was a Terrible Mistake , but I Did n’t Mention It Until I Got a Book Contract . ”
Scott McClellan ’s memoir is the latest entry in the latter genre .
Among his far - too - late admissions , President Bush ’s former spokesman reveals that he knew the war in Iraq was “ a serious strategic blunder , ” but the White House decided the best course was “ to turn away from candor and honesty . ”
This is the same Scott McClellan who presumably had a big role in creating the White House ’s communications strategy and joined in the “ culture of deception ” with such zeal that we lost count of the times he ridiculed critics of the war and questioned their patriotism .
Mr. McClellan also knew that the White House ’s handling of Hurricane Katrina was a disaster .
No doubt he misspoke when he sneeringly accused those who questioned the administration ’s serial failures of playing a partisan “ blame game . ”

This is why we need to make sure that we give our children the very best in life whether we had it for ourselves or not .

In the first Superman movie , supervillain Lex Luthor plans to trigger a massive , California - detaching earthquake by detonating a couple of nuclear weapons in the San Andreas Fault .
Crazy Lex !
That scheme never would have worked , geologists will tell you .
But , if he'd been serious about creating an earthquake , there are ways he could have actually done it .
He would just have to inject some liquid ( as some carbon - sequestration schemes propose ) deep into the Earth 's crust , or bore a few hundred thousand tons of coal out of a mountain .
" In the past , people never thought that human activity could have such a big impact , but it can , " said Christian Klose , a geohazards researcher at Columbia 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory .
It turns out , actually , that the human production of earthquakes is hardly supervillain - worthy .
It 's downright commonplace : Klose estimates that 25 percent of Britain 's recorded seismic events were caused by people .
Most of these human - caused quakes are tiny , registering less than four on geologist 's seismic scales .
These window - rattlers do n't occur along natural faults , and would n't have happened without human activity – like mining tons of coal or potash .
They occur when a mine 's roof collapses , for example , as in the Crandall Canyon collapse in Utah that killed a half - dozen miners last year .
But some human actions can trigger much larger quakes along natural fault lines .
That 's because humans , with the aid of our massive machines , can sling enough mass around to shift the pattern of stresses in the
Earth 's crust .
Faults that might not have caused an earthquake for a million years can suddenly be pushed to failure , as Klose argues occurred during Australia 's only fatal earthquake in 1989 .
After the jump , we present the top five ways to create an earthquake .
With all due respect to Lex , and supervillains like him , you wo n't find nuclear explosions on the list .
It turns out that if you want to make an anthroquake , shifting mass is far more effective than delivering a momentary blast .
__1 . Build a Dam : __Water is heavier than air , so when the valley behind a dam is filled , the crust underneath the water experiences a massive change in stress load .
For example , the Hoover Dam area experienced hundreds of quakes as Lake Mead filled .
University of Alaska seismologist Larry Gedney explained , " Since [ the dam ] reached its peak of 475 feet in 1939 , the level of seismicity has fluctuated in direct response to water level .
None of the shocks has been particularly damaging – the largest was about magnitude 5 – but the area had no record of being seismically active . "
Other examples of dam - caused quakes abound and Klose 's research indicates that about one - third of human - caused earthquakes came from reservoir construction .
This science has raised fears that the recent earthquake in China was caused by the filling of the Three Gorges Dam reservoir , although no conclusive evidence has been presented .
__Inject Liquid Into the Ground : __In 1961 , the Army decided that the best way to dispose of toxic waste from napalm production ( among other things ) was to drill a 12,000 - foot - deep well in the Rocky Mountains and inject the bad stuff down it into the crust of the Earth .
From 1962 to 1966 , the Army deposited 165 million gallons of toxic waste into this hole in the Earth .
Unfortunately , the injections probably triggered earthquakes in the region , and the Army shut the operation down .
As seismologist Dave Wolny explained , " If you are doing deep well injection , you are altering the stress on the underlying rocks and at some point , the stress will be relieved by generating an earthquake . "
Columbia 's
Klose fears that carbon dioxide sequestration , in which compressed CO2 captured from coal plants would be injected into underground deposits , could generate earthquakes too , and worse they 'll be near heavily populated regions .
" Unfortunately , coal - fired power plants are closer to cities , " said Klose .
__Mine a Lot of Coal : __Coal provides more than half the electricity in the United States and an even greater percentage in China .
That means there are a lot of coal mines working overtime to pull the fossilized fuel out of the Earth .
In total , miners pulled 6,195 million metric tons of coal out of the Earth in 2006 alone .
And coal mines often have to pump water out along with the coal , sometimes extracting dozens of times as much water as coal .
Add it up and you have a huge change in the mass of a region , and huge mass changes refigure the earthquake stresses of an area , sometimes increasing the chance of an earthquake and other times lowering it .
Klose 's work suggests that more than 50 percent of the human - triggered earthquakes recorded came from mining operations .
__Drill a Gusher Dry : __Three of the largest human - caused quakes occurred near a natural - gas field in Uzbekistan , the Gazli .
The combination of liquid extraction and injection changed the tectonic action in the field .
The biggest of the trio registered as a 7.3 .
According to a major analysis ( .pdf ) by Russian scientists , " Few will deny that there is a relationship between hydrocarbon recovery and seismic activity , but exactly how strong a relationship exists has yet to be determined . "
They caution that in regions where tectonic activity is already high , extracting oil and natural gas could trigger strong quakes .
Create the World 's Biggest Building : Back in 2005 , a geologist claimed that the world 's then - tallest building , the Taipei 101 , which weighs in at more than 700,000 metric tons , was triggering earthquakes in a long - dormant fault in Taiwan .
Klose doubts that the building actually did so , but said that it was n't outside the realm of possibility for a building to create an earthquake .
The weight of the building , however , would have to be much greater than the Taipei 101's , and even much larger than the Burj Dubai , currently still under construction but already the world 's tallest building .
Perhaps , then , this leaves some space for a supervillain to secretly construct the world 's heaviest structure in the wilds of San Bernardino , slowly but surely adding strain to California 's jumpy fault system in what Geoff Manaugh of the architectural speculation site , Bldgblog , calls " tectonic warfare . "
But , thankfully , probably not .

Those flowers with long and thin stems proved to be the most attractive to insects and produced the most seeds .
The scientists concluded their swaying motions made them most visible among others .
There are practical limits , however .
Those flowers with terribly long stems moved too much to allow insects to make a stable landing and so were generally avoided .
Similarly , the flowers with shorter stems were less visited since they were hard to differentiate from the crowd .

Senator Ted Kennedy is putting forward a brave face following his recent surgery but the sad reality remains .
Even with successful surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy treatment , gliomas — a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that strikes approximately 10,000 Americans annually — tragically claim the lives of 75 percent of its victims within two years and virtually all within five years .
But what if there was an alternative treatment for gliomas that could selectively target the cancer while leaving healthy cells intact ?
And what if federal bureaucrats were aware of this treatment , but deliberately withheld this information from the public ?
Sadly , the questions posed above are not entirely hypothetical .
Let me explain .
In 2007 , I reviewed over 150 published preclinical and clinical studies assessing the therapeutic potential of marijuana and several of its active compounds , known as cannabinoids .
I summarized these numerous studies in a book , now in its third edition , entitled Emerging Clinical Applications for Cannabis and Cannabinoids : A Review of the Scientific Literature .
( NORML Foundation , 2008 )
One chapter in this book , which summarized the findings of more than 30 separate trials and literature reviews , was dedicated to the use of cannabinoids as potential anti-cancer agents , particularly in the treatment of gliomas .
Not familiar with this scientific research ?
Your government is .
In fact , the first experiment documenting pot ’s potent anti-cancer effects took place in 1974 at the Medical College of Virginia at the behest federal bureaucrats .
The results of that study , reported in an Aug. 18 , 1974 , Washington Post newspaper feature , were that marijuana ’s primary psychoactive component , THC , “ slowed the growth of lung cancers , breast cancers and a virus - induced leukemia in laboratory mice , and prolonged their lives by as much as 36 percent . ”
Despite these favorable preliminary findings ( eventually published the following year in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute ) , U.S. government officials refused to authorize any follow - up research until conducting a similar — though secret — preclinical trial in the mid-1990s .
That study , conducted by the U.S. National Toxicology Program to the tune of $ 2 million , concluded that mice and rats administered high doses of THC over long periods had greater protection against malignant tumors than untreated controls .
However , rather than publicize their findings , the U.S. government shelved the results , which only became public after a draft copy of its findings were leaked to the medical journal AIDS Treatment News , which in turn forwarded the story to the national media .
In the years since the completion of the National Toxicology trial , the U.S. government has yet to authorize a single additional study examining the drug ’s potential anti-cancer properties .
( Federal permission is necessary in order to conduct clinical research on marijuana because of its illegal status as a schedule I controlled substance . )
Fortunately , in the past 10 years scientists overseas have generously picked up where U.S. researchers so abruptly left off , reporting that cannabinoids can halt the spread of numerous cancer cells — including prostate cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , and brain cancer .
( An excellent paper summarizing much of this research , “ Cannabinoids for Cancer Treatment : Progress and Promise , ” appears in the January 2008 edition of the journal Cancer Research . )
A 2006 patient trial published in the British Journal of Cancer even reported that the intracranial administration of THC was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation in humans with advanced glioblastoma .
Writing earlier this year in the scientific journal Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics , Italian researchers reiterated , “ ( C ) annabinoids have displayed a great potency in reducing glioma tumor growth .
( They ) appear to be selective antitumoral agents as they kill glioma cells without affecting the viability of nontransformed counterparts . ”
Not one mainstream media outlet reported their findings .
Perhaps now they ’ll pay better attention .
What possible advancements in the treatment of cancer may have been achieved over the past 34 years had U.S. government officials chosen to advance — rather than suppress — clinical research into the anti-cancer effects of cannabis ?
It ’s a shame we have to speculate ; it ’s even more tragic that the families of Senator Kennedy and thousands of others must suffer while we do .

One of the most often mentioned concerns at the KDE booth at LinuxTag was the question if Plasma would force the user to have a black panel .
While we did have a second machine showing another theme to resolve all doubts it showed that not all users now yet the power of Plasma theming .
KDE is well known for the possibilities to configure it just like you want .
And Plasma is no exclusion of this rule .
Instead , the theming is well documented and there are already many user themes available at kde -look.org .
However , the shots shown below were made with the KDE 4.1 development version , and not all Plasma themes were created or tested for that version .
Please keep this in mind and be tolerant regarding smaller issues .
Additionally , I picked almost all themes which were offered via the GetHotNewStuff dialog , so there are themes of all types of quality .
But the gallery does indeed give quite a good impression of how flexible Plasma theming really is : it does n’t matter if you want to include reflections , different colors , decorated borders or different backgrounds – everything is possible .
Update :
I forgot to stress that the shots were made using KDE4 Daily in VirtualBox – there was no way to enable funky effects like transparency .
Some themes do not look like they should because they are made with such composition effects in mind .
So keep that in mind when judging my screen shots of themes like Glassified !
Some of XP Vehicles´ designs in development .
The company hopes to have a prototype of the inflatable electric car by the end of the year , with production in 2010 at the earliest .
It 's hard to say what the most intriguing thing about XP Vehicles ' inflatable car is .
Maybe it's that the car can travel for up to 2,500 miles on a single electric charge ( the distance across the US is roughly 3,000 miles ) .
Or maybe it 's the fact that you buy the car online , it gets shipped to you in two cardboard boxes , and the estimated assembly time is less than two hours .
Perhaps it's that the car is made out of " airbags " - the same polymer materials used to cushion NASA 's rovers when they landed on Mars .
Then again , it could be the company 's claim that you can drive the car off a cliff without serious injury , and that it will float in a flood or tsunami .
Together , these features characterize the Whisper , XP Vehicles ' solution to the oil crisis .
The company does n't expect the car to be in production until 2010 at the earliest , but when it is , it will hopefully be an extremely affordable $ 10,000 or less .
XP Vehicles envisions four body styles , along with a special low - priced model for the Southeast Asian market .
As the San Francisco - based start - up explains on its Web site , the miracle behind the 2,500 - mile range is a " hot - swap XPack Multi - Core Battery / Fuel Cell power plant " invented by the founders of XP Vehicles .
Or , without the hot - swap technology , the car can travel up to 300 miles on a single charge , thanks to its light weight .
XP Vehicles hopes to have a prototype developed by the end of the year , and will begin working on built - to - order vehicles for its OEM partners only .
Later , it plans to sell to dealers , who will assemble the vehicle before selling to consumers .
In the future , individuals may also order online , pick out their desired features as if customizing a PC , and receive the car by a common carrier .
Options will include iPod mounts , 20 colors , trim , decals , roof / no roof , car covers , solar mounts , stereos , integrated pumps , home connections , GPS , battery clubs , alarms , and more .
Two adults with a high school education should be able to unpack and inflate the car in less than two hours , according to the company .
And , if you don´t have enough room in the garage , some models even fold up after assembly for storage .
Other models " can change bodies " ( details on that are sparse ) .
Different models of the car will be made of various polymers , carbon fiber , and / or other strong , ultra - light - weight materials - the same stuff that protected the Mars rovers ´ sensitive electronics as they fell and bounced along the planet´s surface .
XP
Vehicles claims that the car will be one of the safest on the road for drivers , passengers , and pedestrians .
" Research shows that the metal in your car is the largest cause of death and injury , " the company explains on its Web site .
" The shrapnel , body compression immobility , lung compression , dismemberment and other serious results of a crash are most often caused by the inflexibility of metal and the permanent deformation of the body of the metal car around or into your body .
Hence the need for , and name of , the Jaws of Life . "
For another thing , the car won´t " blow off the road , " due to a special ballast and aerodynamic design features which make the car very stable .
An inflatable car might even provide additional safety measures in certain circumstances , such as if someone were to accidentally drive it off a cliff - although the company says that it´s not intended for this use .
If you ´re concerned that an inflatable car may be too tempting for a tire - slashing juvenile delinquent , XP Vehicles says that their car bodies are actually pretty difficult to pierce .
The cars have multiple chambers , so a single slice wouldn´t pop it like a balloon - " somebody would really have to go at it " to cause major damage , the company says .
And , in the case of vandalism , you can repair it yourself .
Whether it´s legal to drive an inflatable car on the road will depend on local ordinances , which dealers or individual buyers will be responsible for knowing .
But , as XP Vehicles estimates a $ 200 billion market for alternative energy vehicles , changes in regulations seem inevitable .
XP Vehicles is not releasing specific vehicle data until an official launch , which will be announced after the company receives various safety certification papers .

Teenager who falsely claimed her boyfriend raped her after he kissed another girl faces jail
Gemma Capon falsely accused her boyfriend Graham Tysoe of rape
A teenage girl who falsely accused her ex-boyfriend of rape after hearing that he had kissed another girl now faces jail .
Gemma Capon , 19 , claimed that her former fiance Graham Tysoe , 20 , forced his way into her home and attacked her after their five month relationship ended .
She told police he pushed her down on the sofa in the living room of the home they once shared and sexually assaulted her .
The next day officers arrested the bartender at the pub where he was working and he was held for questioning for almost 24 hours .
But he was later released after police confronted Capon about discrepancies in her story and she admitted that she had lied .
Now the teenager has been warned she could face up to a six month jail sentence for wasting police time .
The couple met through the internet last year after attending the same primary school .
They got engaged earlier this year and moved in together to a flat in Shoebury , Essex .
But Capon threw him out of the flat in April after she was told that her fiance had kissed another girl .
Mr Tysoe said : ' We were engaged , I gave her a ring .
Graham Tysoe was arrested but was released after police confronted Capon about discrepancies in her story and she admitted that she had lied
' But the break up was quite dramatic .
I went out with my mates one night and someone said they had a video of me kissing someone else but nothing happened .
' There was no video but Gemma would n't believe me .
' I was in love with her once .
When it finished I was sad but I thought we would meet occasionally and say , ' hi ' .
' I had n't seen her and three months down the line I got this . '
Capon told police that the attack took place on June 4 this year , but police discovered that Mr Tysoe had been at a friend 's house at the time .
She also claimed that a mutual friend of the former couple had been present during the attack , but it later emerged that he had an alibi .
Gemma Capon , pictured with friends from her MySpace page , claimed that former fiance Graham forced his way into her home and attacked her after their five month relationship ended
This week Capon pleaded pleading guilty to wasting police time at Southend Magistrates Court .
The court heard that officers spent 136 hours investigating the false claims .
Chair of the bench Christopher Catchpole , warned Capon that she may be sent to prison when she is sentenced next month .
Capon showed no remorse in court , but on her webpage she recently posted a new motto : ' Never create hassle , it only comes back to bite you . '
The blonde - haired teenager who lists acting amongst her interests , also said she was looking for friends and possibly a new partner .
Speaking after the case , Mr Tysoe said the ordeal had left him unable to trust women .
The former pupil at King Edmund School in Rochester said : ' I was arrested at work in front of colleagues and customers .
It was awful .
' They said my ex-girlfriend had accused me .
' I just thought , 'oh god , no , this ca n't be happening ' . "
' My colleagues and family know me and knew I could n't have done anything like this .
' I was hurt that she could do this to me .
' I have no idea why she did it , it must have been some twisted attempt at revenge .
' She is a fantasist .
I would love to see her in jail .
' I do n't understand why anyone would do something like this .
It has affected me at work and in myself .
' I 'm less confident and I do n't trust women anymore . '
His mother Sharon added : ' Women who do this sort of thing are so vindictive it makes my blood boil .
' It 's nasty and they do n't realise what they put the accused through . '

Why rolling office chairs do not make good substitutes for stepping stools .
Prisoners were too comfortable to want to escape , Mr Travis said Inmates are so comfortable in jail that they do not want to escape , a prison officer union leader says .
Glyn Travis of the Prison Officers Association says inmates are happy to stay inside because they can get hold of drugs , mobile phones and even sex .
He said a dealer regularly broke into a Yorkshire prison by using a ladder to enter cell windows - but no inmate used the ladder as a means of escape .
The Prison Service said the prisoners were never in a position to escape .
' Serious crisis '
Mr Travis said the authorities only became aware of the security breaches at low - security category C Everthorpe prison , near Brough , East Yorkshire , in January .
" The prisoners did n't take this opportunity because we believe life is so cushy within the prison system , " he said .
Mr Travis said there had been similar incidents in other prisons and he knew of cases of prostitutes entering open jails to service clients .
During the incident , at no time were prisoners out of their cells or able to access any other areas of the prison
Prison Service
He added ; " We have got no - go areas in certain prisons because prisoners have got complete control .
There is not sufficient staff , there is no interaction between staff .
" We have got a serious crisis in our prisons today . "
Mr Travis blamed a shortage of prison officers and relaxed regimes , where prisoners enjoyed satellite television and video game consoles .
He said that efficiency savings had reduced staff levels and the supervision of prisoners .
" Drugs are coming into prisons at a rate that 's so dramatic that drugs in prison are actually cheaper than on the outside , " he added .
Extra fencing A spokesman for the Prison Service said : " During the incident , at no time were prisoners out of their cells or able to access any other areas of the prison .
" Immediate action was taken with extra fencing , the removal of trees , extra CCTV cameras , and the transfer of the offender involved to another establishment . "
Juliet Lyon , director of the Prison Reform Trust , said prison officer numbers had failed to keep pace with the increase in inmates .
" As our overcrowded jails turn into warehouses , staff are being pushed into acting as turnkeys .
The punishment of the court is loss of liberty - harsh regimes do not lead to rehabilitation or a reduction in reoffending
Ministry of Justice spokesman " There is far too little useful work in prison , but the idea that jails are cushy is blown away by the appalling levels of suicide and self - harm . "
In 2007 , 92 prisoners committed suicide , compared with 67 the previous year , according to government figures .
And there were 23,420 incidents of self - harm in 2006 in prisons in England and Wales , figures obtained by the Prison Reform Trust show .
Conservative leader David Cameron said there needed to be a " big change " in Britain 's prisons .
" We live in a topsy - turvy world where we 've now got people trying to break into prison to sell drugs , " he said .
" Prison should be a place where you are put to work , where you make reparations to your victims and payback money to society and reform your character before you get out .
" We 're a long way from that and we need a really big change in our prisons . "
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said prison conditions were appropriate .
" The punishment of the court is loss of liberty - harsh regimes do not lead to rehabilitation or a reduction in reoffending , " he said .

Inhaling carbon nanotubes could be as harmful as breathing in asbestos , and its use should be regulated lest it lead to the same cancer and breathing problems that prompted a ban on the use of asbestos as insulation in buildings , according a new study posted online today by Nature Nanotechnology .
During the study , led by the Queen 's Medical Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh / MRC Center for Inflammation Research ( CIR ) in Scotland , scientists observed that long , thin carbon nanotubes look and behave like asbestos fibers , which have been shown to cause mesothelioma , a deadly cancer of the membrane lining the body 's internal organs ( in particular the lungs ) that can take 30 to 40 years to appear following exposure .
Asbestos fibers are especially harmful , because they are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs yet too long for the body 's immune system to destroy .
The researchers reached their conclusions after they exposed lab mice to needle - thin nanotubes :
The inside lining of the animals ' body cavities became inflamed and formed lesions .
Carbon nanotubes are generally made from sheets of graphite no thicker than an atom — about a nanometer , or one billionth of a meter wide — and formed into cylinders , with the diameter varying from a few nanometers up to tens of nanometers .
( They can be hundreds or even thousands of nanometers long . )
There is a greater concern about " multiwalled " nanotubes consisting of several reinforced cylinders , because they are able to retain their pointy shapes better than thinner nanotubes .
Scientists have been noting the similarities between carbon nanotubes and asbestos for the past few years , says study co-author Andrew Maynard , chief science advisor for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars 's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies , based in Washington , D.C. Maynard , who has been researching and warning of the potential health and environmental risks of carbon nanotubes since 2003 , says that there has been no coordinated effort to date to analyze the findings of carbon nanotube toxicity studies .
He notes that technology companies have not found that the risks of using carbon nanotubes outweigh the benefits — they are excellent conductors of electricity .
Carbon nanotubes can also be used to reinforce polymers to create very strong plastics .
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor researchers are scaling the strength of nanosheets and a nanoscale polymer resembling white glue .
Visually , it looks like a brick wall , in which clay nanosheet " bricks " are held together by water - soluble polyvinyl alcohol " mortar " .
The result , according to the researchers , is a composite plastic that is light and transparent but as strong as steel .
IBM has identified carbon nanotubes as important for studying electrical and optical phenomena on the nanometer scale , and the company has high hopes for the technology .
Carbon nanotubes show promise as building blocks for computer chips that are " smaller , faster and lower power " than those made of silicon , Phaedon Avouris , an IBM fellow and lead researcher on the company 's carbon nanotube efforts , wrote in the March 2007 issue of Physics World .
" One of the most exciting developments in carbon nanotube research is the recent discovery that nanotubes can emit light , " he added .
" That finding opens the door to circuits in which standard copper interconnects are replaced by optical waveguides made from nanotubes — allowing the possibility of fully integrated optoelectronic circuits . "
Nanotubes are likewise being developed for use in new drugs , energy - efficient batteries , electronics and other products under the assumption that they are no more dangerous than graphite .
But some scientists and environmentalists like Maynard caution that they harbor hidden dangers .
Compounding this concern is the prediction that the market for carbon nanotubes will grow from $ 6 million in 2004 to more than $ 1 billion by 2014 , according to studies by a number of firms , including the Freedonia Group .
A 2006 report from Lux Research projected that nanoscale technologies will be used in $ 2.6 trillion worth of manufactured goods by the year 2014 .
The Edinburgh CIR study , which will also appear in the June issue of Nature Nanotechnology , was very specific , looking only at nanotubes that emulated fiber behavior and their potential to cause a certain type of cancer ; other types of nanotubes could affect the body differently — for better or worse , researchers say .
Maynard and his colleagues focused their attention specifically on the hypothesis that long , thin carbon nanotubes could have the same impact as similarly shaped asbestos fibers .
" If you get these things into the lungs , " he says , " they form scarlike tissue , and the body sees them like a scaffolding , building new cells over them and thickening the walls of the lungs . "
The study is not intended to keep nanotechnology from developing further but rather to flag potential dangers of nanotubes in places at manufacturing and disposal sites , the researchers wrote in their paper .
" There is an immediate need to examine how carbon nanotubes are being used and see if there 's any chance that [ people ] are being exposed to dangerous materials , " Maynard says , adding that no one paid attention to the dangers of asbestos until it was too late for a lot of people .
Police dash cam .
Jan 27/08 : Raw video supplied by the S.C. Department of Public safety .
In this incident from January 2008 , a trooper uses a taser to bring an uncooperative woman under control during a traffic stop .
Newly released videos from the S.C. Highway Patrol show state troopers physically abusing motorists and engaging in other misconduct ?
but also portray troopers performing courageously in gun battles and car chases .
The State newspaper on Friday obtained dashboard videos , internal affairs reports and other documents related to 18 incidents from 2003 through last year under the S.C. Freedom of Information Act .
The S.C. Department of Public Safety also provided dozens of pages of documents ?
though no videos ?
in 10 other pending or closed matters .
Several dramatic videos in which troopers were exonerated depict them returning fire at suspects who fired at them first , or shooting out the tires of a suspect ?s car to end a chase .
In several cases , troopers were found to have acted within department policy ?
and to have saved lives .
But the newspaper ?s review of the material ?
all of which has been turned over to a special Senate panel investigating the Highway Patrol ?
also found that :?
Troopers ?
discipline ranged from letters of reprimand to firing in eight cases caught on videos , and exoneration in seven others .
In three incidents caught on video , outcomes were unknown or pending .?
Questions were raised in separate , unrelated cases not captured on tape , about the actions of two state lawmakers .?
Three troopers were arrested on misconduct charges ?
one was charged with kicking a handcuffed teenager after a high - speed chase , and two others were accused of stealing money from mainly Hispanic motorists .
The trooper charged with assaulting the teenager told The State on Friday that he was suffering from stress stemming from an earlier shooting in which he had been cleared .?
In three cases , troopers were disciplined for altering tapes or deliberately not recording their misdeeds .?
We had no idea it was this much out of control , ? said Rep. Leon Howard , D - Richland , chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus .
?
This thing is much wider and broader than what we had anticipated .?
A spokesman said Gov. Mark Sanford couldn?t comment on specifics on the latest videos because his office is still reviewing them .?
By and large , all the men and women of the state Highway Patrol are doing a great job every day , ?
Joel Sawyer said .
?
The troopers who are doing their job want those who aren?t doing their job dealt with .?
White House admits pre-war e-mails not archived Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 6 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The White House does not have archival copies of e-mails exchanged between administration officials during the weeks leading up to President Bush 's decision to invade Iraq nor for the first two months of the war there , according to a just - released filing concerning millions of e-mails alleged to have gone missing or been deleted .
" A White House declaration filed late last night ... makes the stunning admission that the White House failed to preserve ANY backup tapes for the period March 1 , 2003 through May 22 , 2003 , a period of time during which the U.S. went to war in Iraq , " says a release from Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington , a watchdog group suing for public records concerning the disappearance of internal White House e-mails .
Without computer backup tapes from this critical pre-Iraq war period , future researchers may be deprived a vital resource as the delve into the inner workings of the Bush administration as it decided to invade a country that had not attacked the United States and possessed no weapons of mass destruction .
" The harm is that we 've lost a huge piece of history , " says Anne Weismann , a lawyer for CREW .
Weismann estimated the total number of missing White House e-mails at " 10 million - plus . "
Investigations into the missing White House e-mails already have shown that e-mails from Vice President Dick Cheney 's office were not archived on critical dates during the Justice Department 's investigation of the outing of former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson .
The White House already has said it also does not have backup tapes for those dates , Sept. 30 , 2003 , through Oct. 6 , 2003 .
" I 'm sure there are other holes , " Weismann told RAW STORY Tuesday .
" We just ca n't get in to have the kind of forensic review that needs to be done " of what the White House has .
E-mails were missing from internal servers on a total of 473 days , according to documents released by the House Oversight Committee , including dates around when Saddam Hussein was captured and during a court battle surrounding Cheney 's energy task force .
CREW is joined by the National Security Archive , an open - government group at in its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the White House Office of Administration , which maintains internal computer systems and archives .
The White House filing revealed it had 483 backup tapes from May 23 , 2003 to Sept. 29 , 2003 .
CREW has posted the court documents here .

Eight Americans of south Asian and Middle Eastern descent who were repeatedly detained at the border for questioning will be able to learn if they are actually on the government 's terrorist watch list , a federal court in Illinois ruled last week , marking the first time that citizens have been able to learn whether they have been added to a sprawling and error - prone list used for screening at borders and traffic stops .
The government invoked the powerful state secrets privilege in the case , arguing that letting the plaintiffs know if they are or are n't on the list would harm national security since that could alert them to the fact they have been under government scrutiny .
But since the government admits it has stopped the six men and two women more than 35 times , federal Magistrate Judge Sidney Schenkier of the United States Northern Illinois District Court dismissed that argument .
Instead he found that the government " failed to establish that , under all the circumstances of this case , disclosure of that information would create a reasonable danger of jeopardizing national security . "
The plaintiffs , most of whom are Muslim , filed suit ( .pdf ) against the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI in June 2005 .
They say none of them have any links to terrorism , but are continually stopped and questioned due to faulty watch lists .
They charge government agents have unjustly restrained , confined and questioned them , sometimes for more than four hours , because some have been unfairly put on a watch list , while others say they are continually misidentified as someone on the list .
The court 's rebuff ( .pdf ) of the government 's use of the state secrets privilege is highly unusual , as courts are rarely willing to challenge the executive branch on mattes of national security .
Experts call the state secrets privilege the " nuclear option , " and the Bush administration has used it widely to dismiss cases challenging its warrantless wiretapping program and the CIA 's use of secret overseas prisons .
The lawsuit is also notable since it breaks new legal ground in regards to the government 's terrorist watch list , which lacks any mechanism for citizens to challenge their placement on the list .
Government audits have repeatedly criticized the operation of the list , which has inadvertantly snagged high - powered nuns , senators , children and government employees with security clearances .
The Terrorist Screening Center , which runs the list , says it has been pruning the list and removing errant entries , even as the list grows by an estimated 20,000 names a month .
While the TSC says the majority of the names on the list are foreigners , most of the people compared against the list are Americans , who are checked against the list when they are stopped for a traffic violation , enter or leave the country or fly domestically .
Additionally , the judge ruled that the state secrets privilege against disclosing sources and methods does apply to FBI investigative files and terrorism information in its TIDES database , but that the government should show those documents to the judge in secret , so the judge can decide what portions of those files can be safely released .
The potential class - action lawsuit accuses the government of violating Americans ' Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights by exaggerating the risks of persons it puts on the list and not having robust ways of dealing with name mismatches .
That , the plaintiffs allege , led government agents to unconstitutionally detain the men and their families for hours and conduct illegal pat down searches .
In one case , Customs agents stopped Dr. Khalid Bhatti , a gastroenterologist who has been a U.S. citizen since 1979 , searched him on the hood of his car , in front of his wife and daughter - in - law .
Agents then handcuffed him , led him away for questioning and examined his cellphone and Palm Pilot .
For its part , the government admits nearly all of the secondary screenings occured – including 11 stops of Oussama Jammal .
They also admit that sometimes agents handuffed the plaintiffs , including handcuffing one plaintiff to a chair during questioning .
But the government denies ( . pdf ) that any of the stops were " unjustified , " or that its 800,000 name - long watch list is overbroad or negligently administered .
Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller declined to comment on the ruling .
He also declined to indicate if the government planned to appeal the decision , though that is highly likely .
The plaintiffs are asking the court to force the government to change how it handles name mismatches , how Americans are described on the list , and reasonable policies for family members and children that have to wait for a parent to be released from questioning by government agents .

I am one of the lucky ones .
I may be about a hundred times more enthusiastic and rah rah about getting out of debt than my spouse , but he is fully on board with the process and basically goes along with whatever I come up .
He participates and gives his opinions when asked , and his end aim is the same as mine – to get out of debt as quickly as possible in a manner that does n’t create new debt along the way .
But not every person is as lucky as I am .
When the lightbulb goes on and your brain makes the commitment to debt reduction , sometimes your spouse or the rest of your family is n’t quite as on board as you are .
So what to do if you want to get serious about debt reduction but no one else does ?
This question was posed to me in the comments of Free Money Finance ’s March Madness contest where Snowflaking : A Primer ultimately won .
Here are three measures you can take to encourage a reluctant spouse or other family member to make debt reduction a priority .
Get Them Invested .
There was a process that your brain went through to get you excited and motivated to reduce your debt – repeat that process .
Show your family what you experienced to get you to the point you are today .
Give them updates and progress – even if you can only snowflake a few dollars a week , show them what a difference that can make over time .
Make a chart or a graph depicting the changes that can happen through small steps like choosing to eat a home twice more a week , choosing to bring your lunch from home every day , or choosing to have that movie night in instead of out .
I love the snowball chart here that you can depict different scenarios .
It has been an invaluable tool in my debt reduction planning .
Create Excitement .
People love games .
Turn debt reduction into a game , a challenge , and a competition .
How many things can you do in a week to save money and have it available for debt reduction ?
Can you shave $ 3 off your last grocery bill ?
Phrase everything like a game against yourself .
Make debt reduction FUN .
Because truly , it can be .
Do n’t focus on the negative – keep it a competition to do better and go further .
Explore the Big Picture .
What is debt holding you back from ?
How much money to you pay to debt each month ?
Each year ?
What other dreams do you have that debt is holding you back from ?
Put things in dollars and cents – this is what we could do if we did n’t have debt .
This is the dream we can reach .
This is where we can go .
For me , the idea that we ’ve paid almost $ 15,000 to debt this past year is pretty sobering .
Imagine your life with $ 15,000 ( or whatever amount ) more a year that is YOURS to decide what to do with .
The key , to me , is to focus on the positive .
Focus not on what you give up , but what you can gain .
If all else fails , offer to have a trial run .
If you can get your foot in the door and put these tips to use in creating excitement and exploring what could be – you may be able to sway opinion to your side .

British Airways warned last night that the disruption that has plagued Heathrow 's Terminal Five could run through this week as it emerged that 15,000 bags have yet to be returned to their owners .
This figure is three times higher than BA had originally admitted to .
Following three days of cancellations which saw more than 150 flights grounded and thousands of passengers disrupted , the airline , which has exclusive use of T5 , said that a further 37 flights would not take off today .
An airline spokesman warned that further problems could not be ruled out : ' If we get cancellation levels down to the thirties on Monday , we are heading in the right direction .
But it 's still early days and it's not clear whether we will be able to operate a full schedule . '
BA now also faces the ignominy of having to cancel plans to move the 170 long - haul flights it operates daily from Terminal Four to Terminal Five on 30 April .
' There is a question of whether we will proceed , ' the spokesman said .
Ruth Kelly , the Transport Secretary , held talks yesterday with both BA and BAA , the company that operates T5 , as she sought assurances the problems would be resolved quickly .
' While the problems at Terminal Five are for them to resolve , I have made clear that the government stands ready to assist where appropriate , ' Kelly said .
' Everything possible must be done to deliver a better service for passengers who are still facing disruption and delays . '
The government has no direct powers to intervene , but the failures at T5 have been embarrassing for ministers .
Even before the latest debacle they had been heavily lobbied by the business community over Heathrow 's failings , which senior City figures say are jeopardising London 's reputation as a place to do business .
Gwyneth Dunwoody , Labour chair of the Commons Transport Select Committee , which backs plans for a break - up of BAA , announced an inquiry into last week 's events and signalled she would summon the heads of BA and BAA .
' It was a disaster , ' she said .
' We need to find out what went wrong and make sure it is put right . '
Yesterday passengers continued to vent their anger .
Charles Thomas , 64 , a wheelchair user , told of arriving in the morning to find that the lift did not work , leaving him to negotiate escalators with the help of his wife and an embarrassed porter .
Thomas and his wife , Linda , travelling from Newcastle to join the QE2 in Los Angeles , had arrived at the airport at 7 am and were settling in for a long wait before their next flight was due to take off just after 3 pm .
' You expect something better from British Airways because you 're certainly paying for it , but they would n't even make any lounge facility available to my husband , who has major health problems and could do with recuperating before we embark on our 12 - hour flight , ' Mrs Thomas said .
' The attitude of the supervisor we spoke to was completely rude .
Hell will freeze over before we fly with British Airways again . '

A pay dispute between Qantas and its engineers has led to more aircraft flying with " allowable defects , " minor technical problems with which planes are allowed to fly for a limited time .
The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association ( ALAEA ) said before the current round of overtime bans by engineers , there were 750 allowable defects among Qantas ' 130 - strong fleet of aircraft .
" Over a three - week period that 's risen to 1810 , which is more than double , which is , I guess .
going to continue heading north unless ( Qantas ) come to the table next week with something and we can reach a solution , " ALAEA federal secretary Steve Purvinas said today .
A meme is developing is that support for Obama is all emotion , fantasy , hysteria , etc .
There 's no question that the emotions behind Obama are powerful .
And any fool can see why .
His oratory does what oratory should .
He is the greatest public speaker in American life since Reagan .
And the shame and demoralization of the Bush - Cheney years - when we launched a war with reckless indifference to planning it , when we tortured prisoners and called it " enhanced interrogation " , when we saw a government rendered so utterly useless that a hurricane made the US look like the third world , when conservatives added $ 32 trillion to the debt of the next generation , when a president made sophomoric jokes about not finding weapons of mass destruction he leveraged American global credibility on ... if you do n't feel emotions in wanting to put this disgrace of an administration behind us , then you are not being rational .
But the strongest case for Obama is not emotional ; it is as coolly rational as he is .
I tried to express it in my " Goodbye To All That " essay .
On the most critical issues we face - Iraq , the war against Jihadism , healthcare , and the economy - he makes more sense as a president than Clinton .
And when you watch the knee - jerk opposition to him , I think it is actually more emotional and less rational than the support for him .
Fear is more emotional than hope .
Pentagon Report Reveals Multiple
Blasts in Oklahoma City Bombing According to the March 20 , 1996 issue of Strategic Investment newsletter , a classified Pentagon study confirms that the Oklahoma bombing was caused by more than one bomb .
A classified report prepared by two independent Pentagon experts has concluded that the destruction of the federal building in Oklahoma City in April 1995 was caused by five separate bombs .
The two experts reached the same conclusion for the same technical reasons .
Sources close to the Pentagon study are reported to have said that Timothy McVeigh did play a role in the bombing but peripherally , as a " useful idiot . "
We reported in Freedom Network News at the time that seismograph readouts at the University of Oklahoma indicated more than one blast impulse .
Independent ordnance experts , including a Navy Commander , unanimously agreed that a car - bomb with low intensity fertilizer explosives could not have inflicted such extensive damage to the building and that it was highly likely that high - intensity explosives had been wired directly to the columns .
Our suspicion then as now is that it was an " inside job . "
But by whom is the mystery .
Strategic Investment reports that the multiple bombings had a Middle Eastern " signature . "
Others find the whole business to be extremely fishy because of the fact that no ATF or FBI agents were in their offices at the time of the blast [ about 9:05 a.m. ]  and that evidence pertaining to both Waco and Mena had been stored there .

America 's Reichstag Fire
The Oklahoma City bombing was America 's equivalent of the 1933 Reichstag Fire .
A fire destroyed the Reichstag Building on February 27 , 1933 .
Hitler blamed the fire on the Communists .
The fire symbolically destroyed the only remaining institution capable of placing reins on Hitler 's grab for dictatorial power .
Although the case is still somewhat disputed , the fire was very likely instigated by the Nazis and blamed on a Dutch Communist who had committed arson , Marinus van der Lubbe .
There was no sign whatsoever of a revolution , but van der Lubbe gave the Nazis the excuse they needed and the pretext for new emergency measures [ the Ermächtigungsgesetz , enacted on 1933 - 03 - 24 ] .

The First Steps Leading to the " Final Solution " [ link expired ]
Timothy McVeigh is America 's version of Marinus van der Lubbe ( who was tried by the Nazis , found guilty and executed ) .
On 1995 - 04 - 23 , only four days after the bombing , with public outrage still at its height , President Clinton signed into law the so - called Counter - Terrorism Bill .
Future historians may write :
Several bombs destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19 , 1995 .
President Clinton blamed the bombing on domestic right - wing terrorists .
The bombing destroyed the records of the 1993 massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco , Texas , and also records relating to Mena .
Although the case is still somewhat disputed , the bombing was very likely instigated by a secret criminal organization parasitic upon the U.S. government and blamed on a member of a right - wing militia , Timothy McVeigh , who was known to be sympathetic to violent resistance to the federal government .
There was no sign whatsoever of a revolution , but McVeigh gave the U.S. government the excuse it needed and the pretext for new emergency measures , the Counter - Terrorism Bill .
Again from The First Steps Leading to the " Final Solution :
Hitler induced a confused and frightened Hindenburg to sign a decree euphemistically called , ' For the Protection of the People and State , ' suspending all of the basic rights of citizens and imposing the death sentence for arson , sabotage , resistance to the decree , and disturbances to public order .
Arrests could be made on suspicion , and people could be sentenced to prison without trial or the right of counsel .
The suspension was never lifted throughout the entire period of Nazi rule , and the decree of February 28th destroyed fundamental guarantees under the Weimar democracy .
This sounds a lot like the powers given to the FBI after September 11 , 2001 , under the " emergency anti-terrorist legislation " that was hastily enacted in October .
In April 1996 Vincent Miller wrote of the Counter Terrorism Bill of 1995 :
As we warned last year in the Freedom Network News and in Jim Elwoods 's " Dictatorship at Your Doorstep " pamphlet , this is a dangerous piece of legislation  the equivalent of Hitler 's " Enabling Acts " , in our opinion .
Among other things , the act provides for secret trials , deportation of resident aliens without due process , and seizure of assets of any individual or organization that an increasingly more criminal government may arbitrarily declare " terrorist " .
There is no provision for appeal or return of siezed assets .

Did McVeigh really die ?
But might McVeigh have agreed to go quietly to his " execution " ( which he officially requested in December 2000 ) provided he was assured that he would not actually die , but just be presented in the media as having died , later to be given a new identity in some South American country , thereby allowing the U.S. government to insist that the case is closed and nothing more is to be learnt ?
At least one eyewitness of the " execution " ( Susan Carlson , reporter for WLS - AM Radio , Chicago ) claims that McVeigh was still breathing when he was declared dead .
A judge 's order to have the execution video taped was overruled by another judge .
And McVeigh 's body was supposedly cremated soon after the alleged execution , so can't be exhumed .

That was an investigative fiasco  given that there is no way an ammonium nitrate - fuel oil ( ' ANFO ' ) bomb could have blown away a third of the structure .

On April 28 , a California jury found Hans Reiser guilty of first - degree murder .
There has been a lot of speculation in the press , both before and after the conviction , on what the loss of Mr. Reiser will mean for the Linux community .
Much of that speculation , it seems , lacks an understanding of what Mr. Reiser 's role in the community really was .
Your editor will take no position on whether his conviction was correct or just .
But there are things to be said about what this conviction will mean .
Hans Reiser was , of course , the designer ( and , to an extent , implementer ) of the reiserfs filesystem .
When it was merged , reiserfs had the distinction of being the first journaling filesystem for Linux which was intended for general use ; it also offered good performance in some situations , especially those involving lots of small files .
Reiserfs saw a significant amount of use and was adopted by a handful of distributors .
There are , doubtless , quite a few reiserfs deployments still operating out there .
Mr. Reiser 's role in reiserfs development and maintenance ended some years ago , though .
He stopped work on it when reiser4 development started , and even opposed the incorporation of improvements done by others .
Reiserfs continues to be maintained independently of its creator , though there is not much interest in adding features to it at this point .
Reiserfs is nearing the end of its run , and nothing which happened this week has changed that situation in any way .
There is more concern about what will happen with Reiser4 , Mr. Reiser 's next generation filesystem .
Many reports have suggested that current events spell the end for this project , but it is worth taking a look at the longer history .
Reiser4 is not exactly new ; it was first posted in 2002 .
Mr. Reiser made an unsuccessful effort to get it merged for the 2.6.0 kernel , and frequently thereafter .
He blamed commercial interests and politics for his failure in this regard , but the real situation is more straightforward than that .
Reiser4 tried to do a number of things very differently from other filesystems .
It included some very non-POSIX semantics which raised red flags within the development community .
There was a multipurpose reiser4 ( ) system call which implemented a wide range of features and included an in - kernel interpreter for a special language .
There was a low - level plugin mechanism which raised concerns ( not all justified ) about varying on - disk formats and proprietary formats .
Reiser4 did many things at the filesystem level that others thought should be done at the virtual filesystem level instead .
The " files as directories " feature , beyond striking people as strange , opened up a wide range of trivial deadlock scenarios .
In summary , this code was nowhere near ready for inclusion into the mainline kernel .
Kernel development projects which are done in isolation often encounter this kind of surprise when they are finally posted to the development community .
Over the next few years work on reiser4 continued .
Many of the problems were solved by simply removing most of the features which made reiser4 unique , turning it into just another filesystem .
Once you have just another filesystem , attention will turn to performance ; in this case , many people found that they got benchmark results which differed from those posted by Mr. Reiser .
Community interest in this filesystem fell over time , and the development rate fell as well .
There was still work happening to prepare reiser4 for the mainline kernel when Mr. Reiser was arrested , but it was moving slowly .
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to the inclusion of reiser4 , though , was the confrontational approach taken toward the rest of the community .
When developers pointed out problems with reiser4 , Mr. Reiser had a tendency to question their motives rather than pay attention to what they were saying .
His interactions with the community were characterized by statements like :
What makes you think kernel developers have a deep understanding of the value of connectivity in the OS ?
They do n't .
The average kernel developer is not particularly bright .
A number of developers reached a point where they simply chose not to engage with him any more .
By rejecting the development community , Mr. Reiser remained forever an outsider to it .
And that is why the practical effect of Mr. Reiser 's conviction on the community will be relatively small , at least in the short term .
As brilliant as he is , his effectiveness was limited by his disregard for the rest of the community and his certainty of always being right .
He could have accomplished much more with a different approach .
That said , his loss is unfortunate .
He did prove able , over a number of years , to raise funds for Linux filesystem work , and the community benefited from that work .
Some of the reiser4 developers are still interested in working on that code , and they still submit patches .
But now nobody is paying them to do that work , which puts the whole enterprise in danger .
There are limits to how long reiser4 development can be carried forward as a labor of love .
The biggest loss , though , is elsewhere .
More than anybody else , Mr. Reiser put a lot of thought into what our systems should look like in the future .
He saw capable filesystems as the way to make our systems far more powerful than they are now .
In a world where the filesystem was the only namespace of any significance on the system , all objects would be equal and the number of potential connections between them would explode .
His long - term goal was not ( just ) better benchmarks ; it was to create a filesystem which could serve as this all - encompassing namespace .
It was a radical idea , and , perhaps , impractical .
But our future comes from ideas like that .
After a few relatively quiet years , there is now a flurry of activity around Linux filesystems .
The challenges in this area are large , but we have many highly capable developers working on the problem and there can be no real doubt that Linux filesystems will continue to be among the best available anywhere .
But that development community has lost a voice which , for all its faults , had some unique and innovative things to say , and we are all poorer for it .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict , speaking a day after a California court ruled in favor of same - sex marriage , firmly restated on Friday the Roman Catholic Church ’s position that only unions between a man and a woman are moral .
Slideshow ( 12 images )
Benedict made no mention of the California decision in his speech to family groups from throughout Europe , but stressed the Church ’s position several times .
“ The union of love , based on matrimony between a man and a woman , which makes up the family , represents a good for all society that can not be substituted by , confused with , or compared to other types of unions , ” he said .
The pope also spoke of the inalienable rights of the traditional family , “ founded on matrimony between a man and a woman , to be the natural cradle of human life ” .
On Thursday , the California Supreme Court overturned a ban on same - sex marriages in a major victory for gay rights advocates that will allow homosexual couples to marry in the most populous U.S. state .
Last year , Italy ’s powerful Catholic Church successfully campaigned against a law proposed by the previous centre - left government that would have given more rights to gay and unmarried couples .
The Roman Catholic Church teaches that homosexuality is not sinful but homosexual acts are , and is opposed to gays being allowed to adopt children .
The California court found laws limiting marriage to heterosexual couples are at odds with rights guaranteed by the state ’s constitution .
U.S. President George W. Bush , who is opposed to gay marriage , prayed “ for the family ” with the pope at the White House last month during the pontiff ’s visit there .
Last year , Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco , the head of the Italian Bishops Conference , made headlines with comments that critics said equated homosexuality with incest and pedophilia .
After he made the comments -- which Bagnasco said were misunderstood -- graffiti reading “ Shame ” and “ Watch Out Bagnasco ” appeared on the door of the cathedral in northern Genoa , where Bagnasco is archbishop .
The pope , who backed Bagnasco , will visit Genoa his weekend .
Opponents of gay marriage in the United States vowed to contest the ruling with a state - wide ballot measure for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriages .

In this ~9 - minute video , Daniel Floyd , a professor at Savannah College of Art and Design , convincingly advances the theory that the major problem with sex in video - games is that there is n't enough sex in video games — that video - games ' failure to come to grips with sex as part of the artistic message and aesthetic in games ( in addition to the hypersexualized juvenile Lara Croft / Duke Nukem stuff ) , it can't convincingly argue that games are an actual artistic medium that deserves to be considered on the same terms as painting , literature , sculpture , film , and other media that often feature sexual material .

The Science Behind Human - induced Climate Change
Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are higher today than at any time in at least the past 650,000 years .
They are about 35 % higher than before the industrial revolution , and this increase is caused by human activities , primarily the burning of fossil fuels .
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas , as are methane , nitrous oxide , water vapor , and a host of other trace gases .
They occur naturally in the atmosphere .
Greenhouse gases act like a blanket for infrared radiation , retaining radiative energy near the surface that would otherwise escape directly to space .
An increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and of other greenhouse gases augments the natural greenhouse effect ; it increases the radiative energy available to Earth ’s surface and to the lower atmosphere .
Unless compensated for by other processes , the increase in radiative energy available to the surface and the lower atmosphere leads to warming .
This we know .
How do we know it ?
How do we know carbon dioxide concentrations have increased ?
The concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in atmospheric samples have been measured continuously since the late 1950s .
Since then , carbon dioxide concentrations have increased steadily from about 315 parts per million ( ppm , or molecules of carbon dioxide per million molecules of dry air ) in the late 1950s to about 385 ppm now , with small spatial variations away from major sources of emissions .
For the more distant past , we can measure atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases in bubbles of ancient air preserved in ice ( e.g. , in Greenland and Antarctica ) .
Ice core records currently go back 650,000 years ; over this period we know that carbon dioxide concentrations have never been higher than they are now .
Before the industrial revolution , they were about 280 ppm , and they have varied naturally between about 180 ppm during ice ages and 300 ppm during warm periods ( Fig. 1 ) .
Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide have likewise increased since the industrial revolution ( Fig. 2 ) and , for methane , are higher now than they have been in the 650,000 years before the industrial revolution .
How do we know the increase in carbon dioxide
concentrations is caused by human activities ?
There are several lines of evidence .
We know approximately how much carbon dioxide is emitted as a result of human activities .
Adding up the human sources of carbon dioxide — primarily from fossil fuel burning , cement production , and land use changes ( e.g. , deforestation ) — one finds that only about half the carbon dioxide emitted as a result of human activities has led to an increase in atmospheric concentrations .
The other half of the emitted carbon dioxide has been taken up by oceans and the biosphere — where and how exactly is not completely understood : there is a “ missing carbon sink . ”
Human activities thus can account for the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations .
Changes in the isotopic composition of carbon dioxide show that the carbon in the added carbon dioxide derives largely from plant materials , that is , from processes such as burning of biomass or fossil fuels , which are derived from fossil plant materials .
Minute changes in the atmospheric concentration of oxygen show that the added carbon dioxide derives from burning of the plant materials .
And concentrations of carbon dioxide in the ocean have increased along with the atmospheric concentrations , showing that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations cannot be a result of release from the oceans .
All lines of evidence taken together make it unambiguous that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is human induced and is primarily a result of fossil fuel burning .
( Similar reasoning can be evoked for other greenhouse gases , but for some of those , such as methane and nitrous oxide , their sources are not as clear as those of carbon dioxide . )
How can such a minute amount of carbon dioxide
affect Earth ’s radiative energy balance ?
Concentrations of carbon dioxide are measured in parts per million , those of methane and nitrous oxide in parts per billion .
These are trace constituents of the atmosphere .
Together with water vapor , they account for less than 1 % of the volume of the atmosphere .
And yet they are crucially important for Earth ’s climate .
Earth ’s surface is heated by absorption of solar ( shortwave ) radiation ; it emits infrared ( longwave ) radiation , which would escape almost directly to space if it were not for water vapor and the other greenhouse gases .
Nitrogen and oxygen , which account for about 99 % of the volume of the atmosphere , are essentially transparent to infrared radiation .
But greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions .
Some of the infrared radiation that would otherwise directly escape to space is emitted back toward the surface .
Without this natural greenhouse effect , primarily owing to water vapor and carbon dioxide , Earth ’s mean surface temperature would be a freezing - 1 °F , instead of the habitable 59 °F we currently enjoy .
Despite their small amounts , then , the greenhouse gases strongly affect Earth ’s temperature .
Increasing their concentration augments the natural greenhouse effect .
How do increases in greenhouse gas concentrations
lead to surface temperature increases ?
Increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases increases the atmosphere ’s “ optical thickness ” for infrared radiation , which means that more of the radiation that eventually does escape to space comes from higher levels in the atmosphere .
The mean temperature at the level from which the infrared radiation effectively escapes to space ( the emission level ) is determined by the total amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth .
The same amount of energy Earth receives as solar radiation , in a steady state , must be returned as infrared radiation ; the energy of radiation depends on the temperature at which it is emitted and thus determines the mean temperature at the emission level .
For Earth , this temperature is - 1 °F — the mean temperature of the surface if the atmosphere would not absorb infrared radiation .
Now , increasing greenhouse gas concentrations implies raising the emission level at which , in the mean , this temperature is attained .
If the temperature decreases between the surface and this level and its rate of decrease with height does not change substantially , then the surface temperature must increase as the emission level is raised .
This is the greenhouse effect .
It is also the reason that clear summer nights in deserts , under a dry atmosphere , are colder than cloudy summer nights on the U.S. east coast , under a relatively moist atmosphere ( Figs. 4 and 5 ) .
In fact , Earth surface temperatures have increased by about 1.3 °F over the past century ( Fig. 3 ) .
The temperature increase has been particularly pronounced in the past 20 years ( for an illustration , see the animations of temperature changes ) .
The scientific consensus about the cause of the recent warming was summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) in 2007 : “ Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations …
The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean , together with ice mass loss , support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing , and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone . ”
The IPCC conclusions rely on climate simulations with computer models ( Fig. 6 ) .
Based on spectroscopic measurements of the optical properties of greenhouse gases , we can calculate relatively accurately the impact increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases have on Earth ’s radiative energy balance .
For example , the radiative forcing owing to increases in the concentrations of carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide in the industrial era is about 2.3
Watts per square meter .
( This is the change in radiative energy fluxes in the lower troposphere before temperatures have adjusted . )
We need computer models to translate changes in the radiative energy balance into changes in temperature and other climate variables because feedbacks in the climate system render the climate response to changes in the atmospheric composition complex , and because other human emissions ( smog ) also affect climate in complex ways .
For example , as the surface and lower atmosphere warm in response to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations , the atmospheric concentration of water vapor near the surface increases as well .
That this has to happen is well established on the basis of the energy balance of the surface and relations between evaporation rates and the relative humidity of the atmosphere ( it is not directly , as is sometimes stated , a consequence of higher evaporation rates ) .
Water vapor , however , is a greenhouse gas in itself , and so it amplifies the temperature response to increases in carbon dioxide concentrations and leads to greater surface warming than would occur in the absence of water vapor feedback .
Other feedbacks that must be taken into account in simulating the climate response to changes in atmospheric composition involve , for example , changes in cloud cover , dynamical changes that affect the rate at which temperature decreases with height and hence affect the strength of the greenhouse effect , and surface changes ( e.g. , loss of sea ice ) .
Current climate models , with Newton ’s laws of motion and the laws of thermodynamics and radiative transfer at their core , take such processes into account .
They are able to reproduce , for example , Earth ’s seasonal cycle if all such processes are taken into account but not , for example , if water vapor feedback is neglected .
The IPCC ’s conclusion is based on the fact that these models can only match the observed climate record of the past 50 years if they take human - induced changes in atmospheric composition into account .
They fail to match the observed record if they only model natural variability , which may include , for example , climate responses to fluctuations in solar radiation ( Fig. 7 ) .
Climate feedbacks are the central source of scientific ( as opposed to socio- economic ) uncertainty in climate projections .
The dominant source of uncertainty are cloud feedbacks , which are incompletely understood .
The area covered by low stratus clouds may increase or decrease as the climate warms .
Because stratus clouds are low , they do not have a strong greenhouse effect ( the strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the temperature difference between the surface and the level from which infrared radiation is emitted , and this is small for low clouds ) ; however , they reflect sunlight , and so exert a cooling effect on the surface , as anyone knows who has been near southern California ’s coast on an overcast spring morning .
If their area coverage increases as greenhouse gas concentrations increase , the surface temperature response will be muted ; if their area coverage decreases , the surface temperature response will be amplified .
It is currently unclear how these clouds respond to climate change , and climate models simulate widely varying responses .
Other major uncertainties include the effects of aerosols ( smog ) on clouds and the radiative balance and , on timescales longer than a few decades , the response of ice sheets to changes in temperature .
Uncertainties notwithstanding , it is clear that increases in greenhouse gas concentrations , in the global mean , will lead to warming .
Although climate models differ in the amount of warming they project , in its spatial distribution , and in other more detailed aspects of the climate response , all climate models that can reproduce observed characteristics such as the seasonal cycle project warming in response to the increases in greenhouse gas concentrations that are expected in the coming decades as a result of continued burning of fossil fuels and other human activities such as tropical deforestation .
The projected consequences of the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases have been widely publicized .
Global - mean surface temperatures are likely to increase by 2.0 to 11.5 °F by the year 2100 , with the uncertainty range reflecting scientific uncertainties ( primarily about clouds ) as well as socio-economic uncertainties ( primarily about the rate of emission of greenhouse gases over the 21st century ) .
Land areas are projected to warm faster than ocean areas .
The risk of summer droughts in mid-continental regions is likely to increase .
Sea level is projected to rise , both by thermal expansion of the warming oceans and by melting of land ice .
Less widely publicized but important for policy considerations are projected very long - term climate changes , of which some already now are unavoidable .
Even if we were able to keep the atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration fixed at its present level — this would require an immediate and unrealistically drastic reduction in emissions — the Earth surface would likely warm by another 0.9 – 2.5 °F over the next centuries .
The oceans with their large thermal and dynamic inertia provide a buffer that delays the response of the surface climate to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations .
The oceans will continue to warm over about 500 years .
Their waters will expand as they warm , causing sea level rise .
Ice sheets are thought to respond over timescales of centuries , though this is challenged by recent data from Greenland and Antarctica , which show evidence of a more rapid , though possibly transient , response .
Their full contribution to sea level rise will take centuries to manifest .
Studies of climate change abatement policies typically end in the year 2100 and thus do not take into account that most of the sea level rise due to the emission of greenhouse gases in the next 100 years will occur decades and centuries later .
Sea level is projected to rise 0.2 –0.6 meters by the year 2100 , primarily as a result of thermal expansion of the oceans ; however , it may eventually reach values up to several meters higher than today when the disintegration of glaciers and ice sheets contributes more strongly to sea level rise .
( A sea level rise of 4 meters would submerge much of southern Florida . )
Certainties and Uncertainties
While there are uncertainties in climate projections , it is important to realize that the climate projections are based on sound scientific principles , such as the laws of thermodynamics and radiative transfer , with measurements of optical properties of gases .
The record of past climate changes that can be inferred , for example , with geochemical methods from ice cores and ocean sediment cores , provides tantalizing hints of large climate changes that occurred over Earth ’s history , and it poses challenges to our understanding of climate ( for example , there is no complete and commonly accepted explanation for the cycle of ice ages and warm periods ) .
However , climate models are not empirical , based on correlations in such records , but incorporate our best understanding of the physical , chemical , and biological processes being modeled .
Hence , evidence that temperature changes precede changes in carbon dioxide concentrations in some climate changes on the timescales of ice ages , for example , only shows that temperature changes can affect the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations , which in turn feed back on temperature changes .
Such evidence does not invalidate the laws of thermodynamics and radiative transfer , or the conclusion that the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the past decades is human induced .

Now tights are cool as M&S launches high - tech , air - conditioned pantyhose
It is one of the great dilemmas of summer .
Should one wear tights and overheat , or go bare - legged and risk blinding the world with a pair of shimmering white shins ?
Now textile experts say they have come up the perfect solution - pantyhose with an inbuilt cooling system .
The tights are particularly sheer , which adds flattering colour to the legs while keeping a bare look .
And they have no seams on the toe so that they can be worn with sandals .
Air conditioned : Marks &Spencer ' bare ' tights with new cooling finish
But their secret weapon is a revolutionary Japanese yarn which contains millions of tiny bubbles full of cooling ingredients .
Throughout the day these capsules are broken down through friction and their contents are released on to the skin .
The active ingredients are camomile , aloe vera and marine alga .
Camomile is often used for its soothing properties while aloe vera and marine algae are commonly used to cool irritated and sunburnt skin .
The effect of the Bare Cooling tights lasts for up to ten washes although the first three wears are considered the most effective , according to Marks & Spencer , which is selling the product .
The store would not reveal exactly how the bubbles are added , but said they are put in as part of the dyeing process .
It added that the stockings are stronger than they look .
Despite having a sheer seven - denier appearance , the yarn used is actually 15 denier .
The Bare Cooling tights , which cost £ 4 , were introduced in April 2007 and are one of the store 's best - selling items .
They work on the same principle as the M&S Spa Legcare range , which launched last summer .
Spa Legcare tights are claimed to tone a woman 's thighs , shrinking the circumference within five days .
The microbubbles in those stockings contain aloe vera to smooth skin as well as marine plant extracts and ginkgo biloba which ' slim and tone the skin , proven to help stimulate microcirculation , increase blood flow and aid detoxification ' .
Soozie Jenkinson , head of lingerie design said : ' At M&S we constantly look to bring new and exciting developments to the hosiery market and our Bare Cooling range is the perfect summer dressing solution .
' Giving a bare leg look whilst keeping the wearer cool and comfortable , the range is proving extremely popular with our customers and is one of our current best sellers . '
Overall , the high street retailer sells more than 27 million tights per year .

I do n’t think they cover this in the literature .
The plan is the biggest ever initiative to inject liquidity into the banking sector A plan to loan billions of pounds to British banks is needed to stop the UK 's financial crisis worsening , the chancellor has said .
Alistair Darling added that without the Bank of England 's intervention there was " every chance " the situation would get worse .
Mr Darling confirmed a scheme to lend banks money to help them operate during the credit squeeze .
But he insisted that the loans would have to be paid back .
The BBC understands that the Bank will announce the plans to swap about £ 50bn worth of government bonds for British banks ' mortgages .
Business editor Robert Peston said it would be the biggest ever special initiative by the British monetary authorities to supply liquidity to the British banking system .
' Essential step '
The move would help ease the funding problems which many banks face , opening up the mortgage market to benefit householders and would - be buyers , Mr Darling said .
The sooner there is more openness and transparency the more chance there is of getting ourselves back to the stability and normality that we need
Chancellor Alistair Darling
Bank £ 50 bn mortgage rescue plan " What it will do is effectively lend banks money to unfreeze the situation we have got at the moment .
" We believe this will be an essential step in trying to get the financial markets stabilised and that in turn will help the mortgage markets too .
" If this does not happen then there 's every chance the situation will get worse . "
And likening the situation to a dose of food poisoning , he said that some aspects of the credit crisis " just need to work their way through the system " .
Mr Darling denied that the scheme was a bail - out for the banks .
" The Bank of England will be lending the money , so it 's got to be repaid , and we will take securities in return for it , " he said .
But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable expressed concern that the government was offering the banks too good a deal .
" We cannot have a situation where the banks are able to privatise their profits and nationalise their losses , " he said .
" Since the mortgages from the banks are of inferior quality and higher risk than the government bonds which they are replacing , the implication must be that taxpayers are shouldering the risks and losses of the banks .
" We need urgent reassurances from the Government that the exchange is taking place on a discounted basis so that the banks and not taxpayers carry any losses . "
' Reveal exposure '
Banks are increasingly unwilling to lend to one another because of uncertainty over the exposure which they have to the US sub - prime mortgage market .
The banks have been asking for longer term finance from the Bank of England to fill their funding gap following the collapse of the market for mortgage - backed securities last August .
The disappearance of this market deprived banks of tens of billions of pounds of finance for mortgage lending and is one of the main reasons why the cost of mortgages for many homeowners has been rising , even though the Bank of England has been cutting its base lending rate .
Mr Darling said it was important that the banks began to reveal the extent of their losses as a result of exposure to the sub - prime market - as well as how they were going to rebuild capital .
Britain 's second largest bank , Royal Bank of Scotland , is to ask shareholders for about £ 10bn of extra cash to improve its financial position .
Other institutions were likely to follow suit , the chancellor said .
" The sooner there is more openness and transparency and banks understand the extent of what happened to them since last summer , the more chance there is of getting ourselves back to the stability and normality that we need , " he said .
The chancellor will announce full details of the plan tomorrow .
The BBC understands that the government bonds would have a maturity of up to a year , but would be rolled over for up to three years .
These would meet banks ' demands for longer term loans , while escaping being accounted for in the national debt .

What are these ?
Can exercise make you think better ?
In some cases , yes .
Here 's what works best .
Aerobic Training
Do n't cut that PE class !
In 2006 , Arthur Kramer of the University of Illinois used MRIs to prove that aerobic exercise builds gray and white matter in the brains of older adults .
Later studies found that more aerobically fit grade - schoolers also perform better on cognitive tests .
__Impact on intelligence : __ Strong
__Lifting Weights __
When weight lifters talk about getting huge , they are n't referring to their hippocampus .
Researchers have found only the most tenuous link between heavy resistance training and improved cognitive function .
Got that , meathead ?

Yoga
When facing a stressful situation or even a scary email , people often hold their breath .
Yoga can break that habit .
Under pressure , " most people breathe incorrectly , " says Frank Lawlis , a fellow of the American Psychological Association and author of The IQ Answer .
The result : more stress and less oxygen to your brain .
" So the first thing that goes is your memory . "

Stock markets in Europe and Asia fell today after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke appeared to hint that inflationary pressures will prevent another cut in US interest rates .
China 's main stock market , the Shanghai composite index , tumbled by almost 8 % today , continuing its sharp decline since last November .
Hong Kong 's Hang
Seng index shed over 4 % as some Asian investors took fright , with Tokyo's Nikkei falling 1.1 % .
Europe 's markets shared in the negative sentiment , with the FTSE down 1.15 % at one stage .
It closed down 50 points at 5,827.3 .
France 's CAC index was down 0.8 % , and the German DAX was 0.7 % lower .
Asian traders said that the sharp declines were primarily caused by a speech given by Bernanke , in which he pledged to fight inflationary pressures .
Speaking in Massachusetts last night , he said the odds of a substantial economic downturn had receded and that policy makers must ensure that higher commodity prices are not passed on to consumers .
Bernanke 's vow that the Fed would " strongly resist an erosion of longer - term inflation expectations " was taken as a warning that US interest rates will not be cut again .
Last week , European central bank president Jean - Claude Trichet hinted that eurozone rates could be raised later in the summer .
Shares on Wall Street also fell when trading began this afternoon , but by 6 pm the Dow Jones industrial average was up 41 points at 12 , 321 .
Banks were among the big fallers in Asia , and in London , following Lehman Brothers ' first ever loss yesterday .
The Shanghai composite index , which closed at 3,073 points , is 50 % lower than its peak last October when it reached 6,124 .
That was the climax of a bull market that began in 2005 , when private investors began pouring money into shares .
Some of the falls were also due to the markets such as Shanghai , Hong Kong and Sydney – which were closed on Monday - catching up with earlier losses on Wall Street and London .
Paths to wealth through common stocks
by Philip Fisher Paths to Wealth through Common Stocks contains one original concept after another , each designed to greatly improve the results of those who self - manage their investments — while helping those who rely on professional investment advice select the right advisor for their needs .
In this book Fisher analyzes how worthwhile profits have been and will continue to be made through common stock ownership , and revealing why his method can increase profits while reducing risk .
Many of the ideas found here may depart from conventional investment wisdom , but the impressive results produced by these concepts — which are still relevant in today ’s market environment — will quickly remind you why Philip Fisher is considered one of the greatest investment minds of our time .
I posted about Philip Gourevitch 's and Erroll Morris 's superb and disturbing recent piece on Abu Ghraib here .
What it shows once again is how Abu Ghraib was never , ever an exception .
It was permitted , enabled , authorized and pre-meditated by Bush , Cheney , Yoo , Rumsfeld , Miller , and Addington , among many others .
The techniques testified to correspond with chilling accuracy to techniques authorized by the president , for which we now have overwhelming evidence .
Scott Horton reminds us what exactly some of the techniques were :
Enforced nudity .
This technique is adopted for purposes of degrading and humiliating the prisoner , heightening his senses of vulnerability , weakness and shame .
Enforced nudity also enhances other techniques , particularly hypothermia .
Starvation .
As Davis notes , when the prisoner is entitled to an MRE , he would be given one component only of the MRE .
The entire MRE constitutes a reasonable food ration which is properly balanced .
Giving only one part of it reflects a decision to starve the prisoner .
Stress Positions .
Perhaps the oldest and best established torture technique , widely used by the Inquisition in Europe , was the strapado .
Hands would be fastened behind the back and the victim would be hoisted , causing severe stress to joints , frequent dislocation , and severe and sustained pain .
The strapado would invariably get its victim to confess to anything , very quickly .
During World War II , this same technique was widely adopted and used by the Germans , who called it Pfahlbinden .
In the English of the Bush Administration , this technique is called a “ stress position , ” and it was widely used at Abu Ghraib .
Hypothermia .
Shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution , the Soviet secret police pioneered a very simple technique that had the advantage of leaving the victim ’s body unbruised or bloodied , but whose physiological effects were equally if not more effective than direct beatings .
In its mildest form , the victim was left with thin clothing in a cell with temperatures hovering just above freezing .
A day of such treatment was generally enough to produce physical collapse .
The Bush Administration , of course , not having the benefits of a Siberian winter , turns to far cruder and more brutal techniques , which Davis describes .
The prisoner is stripped naked , dunked in a bath of ice water , and a window is left open to insure exposure .
For President Bush , these techniques are a part of the “ Program . ”
More generally in the American media , you ’ll hear these things referred to as “ highly coercive techniques . ”
But they have a proper name , which is “ torture . ”
Their use is a serious crime under international law , and under U.S. law .
And that stubborn fact has driven much of the Bush Administration ’s bizarre machinations relating to the Convention .
One day this president and vice - president will be prosecuted for war crimes .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Sales of Spam rise as consumers trim food costs Associated Press
Published : Wednesday May 28 , 2008

Love it , hate it or laugh at it  at least it 's inexpensive .
Sales of Spam  that much maligned meat  are rising as consumers are turning more to lunch meats and other lower - cost foods to extend their already stretched food budgets .
What was once cheeky , silly and the subject of a musical ( as Monty Python mocked the meat in a can ) , is now back on the table as people turn to the once - snubbed meat as costs rise , analysts say .
Food prices are increasing faster than they 've risen since 1990 , at 4 percent in the U.S. last year , according to the Agriculture Department .
Many staples are rising even faster , with white bread up 13 percent last year , bacon up 7 percent and peanut butter up 9 percent .
There 's no sign of a slowdown .
Food inflation is running at an annualized rate of 6.1 percent as of April , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The price of Spam is up too , with the average 12 oz .
can costing about $ 2.62 .
That 's an increase of 17 cents , or nearly 7 percent , from the same time last year .
But it 's not stopping sales , as the pork meat in a can seems like a good alternative to consumers .
Kimberly Quan , a stay - at - home mom of three who lives just outside San Francisco , has been feeding her family more Spam in the last six months as she tries to make her food budget go further .
She cooks meals like Spam fried rice and Spam sandwiches two or three times a month , up from once a month previously .
Pulling Spam from the shelf prevents last - minute grocery store trips and overspending , said Quan , 38 , of Pleasanton , Calif .
" It 's canned meat and it's in the cupboard and if everything else is gone from the fridge , it 's there , " she said .
Spam 's maker , Hormel Foods Corp. , reported last week that it saw strong sales of Spam in the second quarter , helping push up its profits 14 percent .
According to sales information coming from Hormel , provided by The Nielsen Co. , Spam sales were up 10.6 percent in the 12 - week period ending May 3 , compared to last year .
In the last 24 weeks , sales were up nearly 9 percent .
The Austin , Minn . - based company , also known for the Jennie - O Turkey Store , has embarked on its first national advertising campaign for the 71 - year - old brand in several years .
They 've credited the sales increase to that , along with new products like individually packaged " Spam Singles " slices .
Also helping sales , executives said in an earnings conference call , was the fact that people looking to save money are skipping restaurant meals and eating more at home .
Spam sales are reaching across all spectrums , young and old and rich and poor , said Swen Neufeldt , Hormel 's group product manager for the area that includes Spam .
Many of the eaters are new to Spam , which was created in 1937 and gained fame as the meat that fed Allied troops during World War II .
" We have significantly increased our household penetration , " Neufeldt said .
" I think it 's a lot of folks that are coming into the brand perhaps for the first time and coming back to the brand . "
Hormel began its national advertising campaign , including print and television , for Spam in January .
Neufeldt said such campaigns are planned in advance and it was n't tied to perceived weakness in the economy .
Consumers are quick to realize that meats like Spam and other processed foods can be substituted for costlier cuts as a way of controlling costs , said Marcia Mogelonsky , senior research analyst with Mintel International in Chicago .
These products have protein and decent nutritional value , and they provide some variety to consumers who may be bored because they 're eating more at home , she said .
" They might not have Spam at every single meal , but they might supplement a couple of meals , " she said .
Consumers are also using more coupons and paying more attention to sales , doing anything they can to save money , she said .
You may be able to cut back on your driving due to high gas prices , but you 're not going to stop eating because of high food prices , she said .
Quan just bought a couple more cans of Spam on sale and some ramen , the instant noodle dish long a staple on college campuses .
Her food and gas budgets are together , so she 's had to cut back on food spending while the cost of gas increases .
Her favorite Spam meal ?
Spam and macaroni and cheese .
She does n't skimp on nutrition , though .
Quan serves her husband and three children  ranging in age from 4 to 11  organic vegetables like salads , broccoli and carrots .
" It balances out , " she said .
Other companies are seeing similar boosts in their lunch meats .
Kraft Foods Inc. reported last month that subsidiary Oscar Mayer , which makes hot dogs , bacon and cold cuts , saw double - digit revenue growth in the previous quarter in its Deli Fresh cold cuts .
The company , based in Madison , Wis. , has recently introduced new products including family sized deli-meat packs and deli carved , which offers thicker slices of meat .
April Smith has been changing the way she feeds her family in Broken Arrow , Okla . , to keep up with rising costs .
This summer the 33 - year - old administrative assistant will feed her two boys , ages 11 and 8 , more ramen for lunch .
Normally they eat the noodle soup on Saturdays , but since ramen costs about a dime per pack , they 'll get it twice a week .
Smith says she 'll throw in some leftover frozen vegetables to make it more nutritious .
" Since it 's cheap and easy , I figure why not let them eat it twice a week instead of once a week , " Smith said .
In recent years , there ’s been a resurgence of interest in placebos .
Not the kind that are used to minimize bias in clinical trials , but the kind that doctors knowingly give to patients .
In a recent survey of more than 200 doctors practicing in academic medical centers , 45 % reported that they had given placebos to patients in the course of providing clinical care .
Nearly all the physicians surveyed agreed with the statement that “ placebos have therapeutic effects , ” and the condition for which they believed placebos offered the most psychological and physiological benefit was pain .
They endorsed a variety of suggested definitions for placebo substances : half agreed with the statement that placebos are interventions “ that are not expected to have an effect through a known physiologic mechanism . ”
The primary reasons physicians used placebos were to calm patients ( 18 % of the time ) and as supplemental treatment ( also 18 % of the time ) .
One of the particularly noteworthy things about this study is that 92 % of the doctors believed that the mechanism of action of the placebo was psychological .
They were n’t giving the placebos to anxious patients simply to shut them up ; they were invoking a mechanism of healing — the mind - body connection — that they believed in , even though they could n’t specifically identify how it operated .
This is a sea change from “ old school ” thinking about how placebos fit into clinical practice .
In a 1979 study , a majority of academic physicians reported believing that the use of placebos helped expose patients who were “ faking ” their symptoms .
In contrast , 80 % of the doctors in the more recent survey disagreed with the notion that placebos can be used to identify symptoms that have a psychogenic origin .
All good news so far , but there ’s more .
Only 4 % of the physicians told the patient that the substance they were receiving was a placebo .
Most used vague statements like , “ This may help and wo n’t hurt ” or “ It ’s medicine with no specific effect . ”
Just over 10 % of the doctors in the survey believed that the use of placebos should be categorically prohibited on ethical grounds .
I try to imagine how my internist , who I respect immensely , would respond .
Would he use a ruse to invoke the healing power of my mind ?
He ’s seen me through a number of minor crises over the last 15 years , and I ca n’t imagine a circumstance under which this would n’t feel like a betrayal .
Is it just me ?
Are there circumstances under which you ’d be glad to have your doctor deceive you if it made you feel better ?

Yesterday , my pal Jess Hemerly happened upon Idlewild Books , a new travel bookstore in Manhattan with a terrific organizational scheme .
It shelves guidebooks with travel literature related to that place .
" So the Ireland section has a bunch of Ireland - related travel guides plus Ulysses and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , " Jess says .
I found a Publishers Weekly article about the opening of IdleWild six weeks ago :
" I was in a chain bookstore and realized I would have to go to five different sections to get what I needed–a travel guide , a map , a language book , a novel , " ( owner David Del Vecchio ) noted .
" At Idlewild , everything will be shelved by country , and in the case of the United States , by state –that way people will be able to browse according to the place of their interest . "
Del Vecchio emphasized that he believes literature about a country –be it a novel or a political biography–can be just as useful as a guidebook .
His product mix will be at least 40 % armchair travel titles : " Guidebooks you really can buy almost anywhere , " he explained , " but books on politics and culture are often much harder to find .
Our section on Turkey might have guides , maps , a history of the Blue Mosque , a biography of Ataturk , and novels by Pamuk and others . "
Graham Greene 's novels wo n't be shelved in the U.K. section , said Del Vecchio , but in Cuba and Mexico , where the books are set .

Do Retardeds Go to Heaven ?
Listen to Pastor 's Bible Based Message About the Fate of Retarded Folks
Dear Pastor ,
My older sister , Becky , is a retarded .
She is 12 - years old and she has been hooked up to a mashine in her bedroom since she was too years old .
She can't talk none except for moans and grunts and she 's blind and her face is squished up like a pancake .
My dad says she 's a moongloid , and that I should n't call her a retarded .
But all my friends who I charge 25 cents to peek in her window say she is definitely a retarded .
My parents read the Bible to her while they feed her with a tube .
Sometimes she spits up stuff onto my mom and dad , and me - and once she threw up on the Bible .
My dad says she has a demon in her that makes her that way , but the doctor said it is because my mom was 53 - years old when she had her , and God do n’t like for old hags to have no sex .
Do retardeds like my sister , Becky , go to heaven ?
Benjaman Goodman
Age 9
Dear Benny ,
The Bible is pretty clear about who gets to spend eternity with Jesus in Heaven , and who gets to roast eternally with Satan in Hell .
I 'm afraid I can only speculate that since God tells us in the book of Jeremiah 1:5 that He knows us before
He even forms us in the womb , that your sister , Becky , must have really done something to tick off the Lord before she was born .
As I always say , it is not for us to question how the Lord gets his kicks , but basically , unless your retarded , deaf , dumb and blind sister finds some way of understanding that Jesus died for her sins , and she miraculously finds the cognitive ability to accept
Him as her personal savior , she is going to roast in Hell along with all the Catholics , child molesters , fornicators and mass murderers , not to mention the aborted and miscarried fetuses , who were also never able to comprehend Jesus and must therefore be tortured for eternity .
I 'm very sorry , Benny , but its the Lord 's will .
If it makes you feel any better , your sister is n't alone .
Just read Brother Harry 's sermon , " Chances Are , You and your Family Will Wind up in Hell , " if you need some comfort .

It is possible to become so inured to being told what to do , and how to do it , and who to do it with — to become so accustomed to being told what we can say , what we may publicly believe , what we must seem to think , how we must manage our affairs — that we cease to notice just how regimented we are .
We are there .
We now accept that very nearly everything whatsoever is the proper domain of government .
Why ?
For example , if I want to let people bring their dogs into my restaurant , why is it the business of government ?
It used to be , and may still be , that in rural England people regularly brought the pooch into the local pub .
It was nice .
Country people know dogs and like them .
Why is it the government ’s concern ?
Frightened minor people will nervously wring damp fingers and say , but oh my goodness , it ’s an issue of public health .
In the first place , it is n’t .
Generations grew up with dogs in the house , with whom children regularly played and occasionally slept .
The recorded death rate has thus far been subliminal .
Give me a quick list of five kids you remember who died of dog poisoning .
In the second place , whose business is it ?
If I want to risk my life by sharing a bar with a golden retriever , why is it not my risk to take ?
If you do n’t want to come to my restaurant because a Border collie upsets you , then … do n’t come .
How hard is that ?
Find another restaurant .
There are lots .
If there are n’t , carry a box lunch .
It ’s my restaurant , not yours .
If nobody comes to my place because of dog - distress , then I will go out of business .
That ’s my problem .
It is not the government ’s concern .
Incidentally , I much prefer dogs to drab officious little warts in governmental offices .
I have lived with dogs , and found them preferable to bureaucrats on grounds of civility , intelligence , and unintrusiveness .
Further , some of them could be trained to make change .
What about smoking ?
Why is it the government ’s business ?
If I want to let people smoke in my bar , it ’s my affair .
People who do n’t like it can , once again , go somewhere else .
I do n’t say this truculently .
Customers have every right not to patronize establishments that they find disagreeable .
If they do n’t like the smoke , or the music , or the food , or my ugly mug , that thing in front with the hinges on it is available .
A " door , " we call it .
I do n’t go to places I do n’t like , and do n’t expect anyone else to .
Why is any of this of concern to the government ?
To any government ?
Why must we be eternally diapered by tiresome prisses in power ?
For that matter , why does the government have any business telling motorcyclists to wear helmets ?
The usual , and stupid , answer is that if I fall off and gork myself , the public will have to pay to maintain me on life - support forever .
No .
In the first place , that ’s what insurance is for ; in the second , the same argument supports making drivers of cars wear helmets , pay for full roll - cages , wear Nomex suits , and drive at five miles an hour .
In fact I do n’t smoke , and I did wear a helmet , and it saved my life in a wreck .
My choice , my consequence .
Your helmet is not my business .
Or vice versa .
Why is the government involved in the schools ?
If the public schools worked , an argument could be made for them :
If children do n’t learn to read , they are more likely to end up on the public nipple , which is everybody ’s business .
In fact , if the schools worked , you would n’t have to make an argument for them .
In the fifties and early sixties , they did work .
They taught the educable to read , did a reasonable job of preparing the bright for college , and did very little else .
Which was exactly right .
Today they do n’t work — endlessly , badly , overwhelmingly , highly documentably do n’t work .
They do n’t work because they are chiefly a means of imposing social agendas for powerful lobbies and of hiding the failures of the swing vote in presidential elections .
Note that government is the cause of the failure .
It is government in one form or another that mandates the hiring of low - grade ( read certified ) teachers , insists on hiring according to color instead of competence , forbids the firing of the demonstrably useless , and mandates the purchase of terrible texts .
Government requires teaching to the level of the dullest - witted .
Government also prevents the establishment of good schools in competition with itself .
Do n’t think so ?
Try to start a school and run it as you wish .
For this we pay taxes ?
For that matter , why does the government interfere in the drug trade ?
When I was on the police beat in Washington a buddy of mine in the DEA estimated that ninety - five percent of drugs shipped to the United States successfully entered the country .
That is , the government intercepts drugs roughly as well as it schools children .
The difference is that we know how to teach kids , but just do n’t do it .
Nobody knows how to stop the influx of drugs .
In the Twenties the government tried to stop the sale of hooch .
It did n’t work because the public wanted hooch .
The same is true of drugs .
People want them .
That ’s why they buy them .
( A patented Fred Insight , forty - weight .
You could lube bearings with it . )
Further , anybody who wants drugs can get them .
So why do we spend vast sums and put up with intrusion by a government that pretends to try to do what everyone in the business knows it can’t ?
I do not say these things from some evangelical libertarian hostility to all things governmental .
When government does something well , I say let it .
You want to put little crawly prongy things on Mars to look for water and weird worms or half - eaten sandwiches discarded by space aliens ?
( I do , actually . )
NASA does it well .
The gadgets are there .
They crawl .
They ’re prongy .
You want to bring back the public schools of 1950 ?
Good .
They worked .
I ’ll vote for you .
Today , what the government ought to do , it does badly , and what it ought not do at all , it does too well — such as snoop , control , meddle , and impose the ways of the unwashed on everyone .
And it ’s going to get worse .
Much worse .
The Best of Fred Reed
ATHLETES in the ancient Olympics competed in the buff , on the grounds ( among other things ) that clothes were a hindrance to performance .
Modern technology , however , has changed that .
In some sports , notably swimming , the right attire can be an enormous boon .
Take Speedo's LZR swimsuit , which was introduced in February .
Fully 38 of the 42 world swimming records that have been broken since then have fallen to swimmers wearing LZRs .
Indeed , some of those records have been claimed by less - than - notable racers , suggesting that the difference lies in the apparel , not the athlete .
To make the LZR , four innovations had to come together .
The first is the fabric .
The new suit is cut from a densely woven nylon - elastane material that compresses the wearer 's body into a hydrodynamic shape but is extremely light .
Moreover , there are no sewn seams .
Instead , the suit is bonded by ultrasonic welding .
Seams act as speed bumps in the water .
Ultrasonic welding removes 6 % of the drag that would otherwise occur , according to Jason Rance , the head of Aqualab , Speedo 's research and development centre in Nottingham , Britain .
Compared with Speedo's previous suit , which was used by numerous gold medallists in the 2004 Olympic games , the new material has half the weight yet triple the power to compress the body .
Second , the suit has what Speedo calls an “ internal core stabiliser ” — like a corset that holds the swimmer 's form .
As a swimmer tires , his hips hang lower in the water , creating drag .
By compressing his torso , the LZR not only lets him go faster , because it maintains a tubular shape , but also allows him to swim longer with less effort .
In tests , swimmers wearing the LZR consumed 5 % less oxygen for a given level of performance than those wearing normal swimsuits did .
The third innovation , a further drag - reduction measure , is that polyurethane panels have been placed in spots on the suit .
This reduces drag by another 24 % compared with the previous Speedo model .
Fourth , the LZR was designed using a three - dimensional pattern rather than a two - dimensional one .
It thus hugs a swimmer 's body like a second skin ; indeed , when it is not being worn , it does not lie flat but has a shape to it .
The results are a suit that costs $ 600 and takes 20 minutes to squeeze into , and a widespread belief among swimmers competing in the Beijing Olympics this summer that they will have to wear one or fail .
The director of the American team , Mark Schubert , for example , thinks the LZR improves performance by as much as 2 % — a huge leap considering that tenths of a second may mark the difference between first and fourth place .
Arena , a rival swimsuit maker , called the situation “ unprecedented ” and , initially , lobbied for a review of the garment rules in an open letter to the sport 's governing body , FINA ( the Fédération Internationale de Natation ) .
Another maker , TYR Sport , has launched another type of suit altogether .
It is suing Speedo 's parent company , Warnaco Swimwear , Mr Schubert ( for more or less insisting that members of his team wear the LZR ) and others on antitrust grounds .
The LZR is thus being referred to by some people as high - tech doping on a hanger .
Speedo's success is partly due to a subtle rule “ clarification ” made by FINA in April .
It was this which confirmed that polyurethane areas can be incorporated into racing swimsuits .
Other manufacturers complain it is unfair that a revision with sweeping implications took place a few months before the Olympics .
Still , they are rushing to bring forward rival products .
On June 4th FINA approved new suits by Arena , Adidas and Mizuno , so Speedo 's technological lead may not last .
In technology as in sport , records are simply there to be broken .
Microsoft - Miguel - Novell tag team extraordinaire
A reader contacted us regarding a serious problem .
He said that he “ pointed out on a forum that .NET had died on the vine and that when .NET projects run out of time and money people turn back to Java to get the task finished .
That appears to have got the Microsoft fans going with this one . ”
To conclude , he added : “ .NET really does seem to have died on the vine , but Microsoft boosters see the value of tainting as many FOSS projects with software patents as possible . ”
This reader is not alone .
have a look at this new analysis of the direction of GNOME :
When such an important project as GNOME obviously lacks a direction , has a poor governance and a missing leadership , how can I trust it not to get more and more Mono - encumbered ?
Some people object that there are very few Mono - based applications in GNOME ( mainly Tomboy and F - Spot ) , however they are always advertised with each and every GNOME release ! *
Let ’s now take a historical look of how some guy wanted to screw GNOME since 2002 ( Red Hat , were you sleeping those days ? ) :
* 2002-02-01 : Gnome to be based on .NET – de Icaza .
« ” I ’d like to see Gnome applications written in .NET in version 4.0 – no , version 3.0 .
But Gnome 4.0 should be based on . NET , ” he told us . » * 2002-06-01 : Mono and GNOME .
The long reply .
( Miguel de Icaza ) .
« As you might realize by now , GNOME 4 is not planned , it is not possible to know what is in there .
So my comments on GNOME 4 only reflect the fact that I personally believe that people will see that Mono is an interesting platform to write new applications . » * 2002-06 -04 : one more message from de Icaza : « I was not trying to force Mono on anyone .
The only reason why I thought that GNOME would move to Mono on the long term is because our goals are aligned . [...]
But the real reason is that .NET ( and hence Mono ) was designed to be an evolutionary path for applications . [...]
For example , it would be silly to rewrite Gnumeric or StarOffice with C# , that would be a complete waste of time .
But one really useful feature for Gnumeric would be to have its VB interpreter running on Mono . » *
If the KDE flock is going with KDE4 , why should we assume there is n’t a similar bunch of GNOME sheep to go with Miguel de Icaza ’s Mono ?
Miguel de Icaza is currently the Vice President of Developer Platform at Novell Inc .
That ’s the company somebody chose to write a thesis about : Managing Firm - Sponsored Open Source Communities .
That ’s a company for the future .
And Miguel is a smart guy .
So it ’s very likely that GNOME 3.0 or 4.0 will indeed be Mono - based .
And no , tiny bugs in Gedit wo n’t get fixed in the meantime .
It ’s not “ sexy ” , you know .
As the first comment states ( and to an extent demonstrates too ) , it ’s an eye opener to some .
People were brainwashed by the likes of Slashdot — essentially pushed to the point of believing Miguel was an open source hero .
Well , by Microsoft 's definition of it , maybe he is .
Shortly afterward there was a less restrained outburst , especially at the sight of Moonlight 's legal implications , which we warned about all along ( since the project ’s inception and even a couple of days ago ) .
Mono , The Road To Hell : Final Proof [...]
This is a Microsoft - branded piece of shit .
Now , if there are still Linux users still loving Mono , and still believing they have anything in common with FREEDOM & Open Source , they ’re idiots like hell .
Proofs of MALA FIDE from Microsoft ’s part : 1 . NOBODY interested in a good - faith patent protection would restrict the protection to the downstream recipients of a UNIQUE source — but this is what Microsoft is doing !
2 . NOBODY interested in a good - faith patent protection would restrict the protection to the UNMODIFIED AND USED “ AS INTENDED ” ( “ for the intended purpose ” ) for an OPEN - SOURCE project — but this is what Microsoft is doing !
3 . NOBODY interested in a good - faith patent protection would restrict the protection in any ways .
Simply imposing restrictions means WHATEVER FALLS OUTSIDE THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS IS SUBJECT TO FEAR , UNCERTAINTY AND DOUBT !
Yes , this is Microsoft .
Yes , this covenant is ONLY and ONLY for the benefit of Novell ’s SLED and SLES , and for the benefit of openSUSE .
This is for people to ONLY consider openSUSE as a “ safe ” Linux way to use Moonlight and Mono , and therefore to increase the penetration of SLED / SLES as “ the ” Linux for the Enterprise .
This is the abjection of the Microsoft - Novell fascist conspiracy .
Will somebody .
Anybody .
Somewhere .
Please stop Novell and Miguel already .
I ’m sure that the typical Microsoft / Novell boosters / apologists will continue to attack this Web site and do gymnastics in logic to deny all of this .
That ’s pointless .
In fact , this item will be closed to comments .
As another reminder of the ' political ' corruption that 's striving to phase in software patents everywhere , here are some news picks ( mostly from Digital Majority ) :
The following bit is about applying a taxation mechanism to patents .
The hope is to hinder abuse / misuse of the system .
Merpel adds , as for patent renewal fees , their adjustment will presumably affect the behaviour of the small fry far more than that of the big battalions — but it ’s not the tiddlers that create the thickets and do the trolling , is it ?
That all sounds good in theory , but …
Patent Reform
Act “ dead in the water , ” eh ?
So says the following article , which merely repeats what we already know : the system is too corrupt to repair itself ( exhorting against the corruption would be a cyclic thing ) .
It seems hopeless , unless the system totally collapses and people take it to the streets .
The efficacy of the patent system is not equivalent across all industries , and appears to be particularly ineffective in software , said a panel at the Computers , Freedom , and Privacy conference held at Yale University last week . [...]
A lot of unpatented prior art , which does not make it into considerations at the patent and trademark office , said Berger , could add to this problem .
She added that EFF is working with open source company Mozilla to crease a wiki - style platform of prior art in software they hope can be eventually used by patent examiners .
Efforts have failed so far in terms of patent reform , she said , citing the status of the Patent Reform Act as “ dead in the water ” in the US Congress for the time being , and asking what people interested in technology policy might do about this problem .
More debates on software patents in the UK :
Patent attorneys , lawyers , judges and businesses have often had trouble determining exactly what inventions are and are not eligible for patent protection , particularly where the invention involves software .
A 2006 ruling in the Court of Appeal was designed to settle the issue by clarifying the rules that patent examiners and judges should apply to assess whether inventions are for patentable subject matter . [...]
“ The election to solicit pre-pay clientele is unarguably a ‘ business method ’ , ” wrote Judge Fysh .
“ The consequence in ‘ computer terms ’ forms no part of the invention ; it is done with appropriate software .
Moreover , even if it did form part of the invention , it would therefore only involve the construction of appropriate computer programs and would also be excluded from patentability . ”
Lots of the gory details are here .
[ via Digital Majority ]
Bear in mind that the likes of Finjan ( London - base , sponsored by Microsoft ) are already doing what they can to totally ruin the UK as well .
Last but not least , lookie here !
Look who ’s back .
Commissioner McCreevy [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] talks about harmonisation , but one that revolves around legal destruction , not peace and harmony .
Ministers will discuss a progress report on this issue prepared by the Slovenian Presidency .
Commissioner McCreevy will encourage Member States to continue to work constructively in this process .
For interesting information about patents and Linux in the Halloween memo , see this document .
Mono ’s greatest and most vocal among defenders would tell us to just “ shut us and code . ”
Those Mono defenders who ‘ know better ’ blindly accept the abuse of GNOME by Novell and Miguel .
After all , who needs to ever bother with all that tiresome ‘ politics ’ , right ?
Well … █

Santa Monica , California ( TGW ) - The Pacific Ferris
Wheel at the Santa Monica Pier in California , the world ’s first and only solar powered ferris wheel , has been taken apart and outfitted with LED lights .
A total of 160,000 of the energy efficient lights were used on the $ 1.5 million , 90 foot ride , which can support 800 passengers per hour .
The solar panels will still be used .
The old wheel was sold on eBay for $ 130,000 .

Obama is the free trader free traders have been waiting for
THAT might be overstating things a bit , but as
Salon
's Andrew Leonard
points out
, all the tea leaf reading during the NAFTA debates failed to note what presdential candidate Barack Obama had to say about globalisation in his book
The Audacity of Hope
We can try to slow globalization , but we can't stop it .
The U.S. economy is now so integrated with the rest of the world , and digital commerce so widespread , that it 's hard to even imagine , much less enforce , an effective regime of protectionism .
A tariff on imported steel may give temporary relief to U.S. steel producers , but it will make every U.S. manufacturer that uses steel in its products less competitive on the world market ...
I told the President that I believed in the benefits of trade ...
But I said that resistance to CAFTA had less to do with the specifics of the agreement and more to do with the growing insecurities of the American worker .
Unless we found strategies to allay those fears , and sent a strong signal to American workers that the federal government was on their side , protectionist sentiment would only grow ...
I ended up voting against CAFTA ...
My vote gave me no satisfaction , but I felt it was the only way to register a protest against what I considered to be the White House 's inattention to the losers from free trade .
This blogger feels at least somewhat vindicated , having
written
An optimist might say , however , that in building a class - based coalition , Mr Obama will create the conditions necessary to strengthen the social safety net .
And some might then say -- Dani Rodrik , perhaps -- that by insuring workers against the buffeting winds of trade , Mr Obama will have secured the ability to expand globalisation without strong domestic opposition .
One hesitates to project hopes on a candidate to this extent , but it seems possible .
not long ago :
It is interesting that Mr Obama mentions concern about the losers from trade informing his vote against CAFTA .
My inbox this morning contained a link to
this new discussion paper
We first show that trade liberalization under CAFTA has a positive effect on growth , employment and poverty [ in Honduras ] but the effect is small .
What really matters for Honduras is the assembly ( maquila ) industry .
CAFTA liberalized the rules of origin for imports into this industry .
That raises the growth rate of output by 1.4 % and reduces poverty by 11 % in 2020 relative to what it would otherwise have been .
Increasing capital formation through an increase in foreign investment in response to CAFTA has an even larger impact on growth , employment and poverty .
from the International Food Policy Research Institute .
The abstract reads in part :
The stakes are high for the world 's poor .
Another reason to believe that economists may wish to adopt a tolerant stance toward flexibility in the language used to discuss expanded trade .
Openness should be the goal , not rhetorical purity .
The race between the presidential election candidates in the United States is close .
George Bush ’s policies in his first term mainly benefited the rich but surprisingly he is most popular in the poorest states , which were former union and Democrat strong holds .
Some of the most down - at - heel homes in the remotest villages of West Virginia sport posters for George Bush and Dick Cheney , although their occupants surely do not expect to gain from any further reductions in capital gains tax .
We see a lot of “ We support our troops ” signs .
We meet a brother and sister in the state capital , Charleston , who will vote Republican for “ religious reasons ” ; yet the brother is a schoolteacher and he has no health insurance .
West Virginia is coal - mining country .
Mines with their pithead gear are still a common sight among the hills and rivers , served by winding roads and railways .
Free trade is not popular here .
Nor are environmentalists , who are suspected of endangering the few remaining jobs in industry that relocations and pit closures have spared .
And the issue of gun control plays into the hands of the most reactionary candidates .
In early November schools close on the day that the deer - hunting season opens .
Several thousand animals are slaughtered in just a few hours but , we are told : “ They ’re as common as pigeons round here . ”
The two presidential candidates have already visited West Virginia half a dozen times since January , both are well briefed on local concerns : faith , patriotism , mining and guns .
And they will be back again .
On 2 November the state , which is even poorer than Louisiana or Mississippi , will vote for five out of 538 Electors who will in turn choose the next president .
But given the uncertainty as to the outcome in this part of the Appalachians , West Virginia is one of a dozen states on which candidates are concentrating .
West Virginia is a stronghold of the United Mine Workers of America and has a long history of social unrest .

The report accuses police of opening fire on protesters Police in Mozambique have been accused of killing and torturing people with near total impunity .
The human rights group Amnesty International has published a report saying the Mozambique police appear to think they have a licence to kill .
The group says officials have responded to rising crime rates with often lethal force , but that they almost never face criminal proceedings .
Police in the southern African nation denied rogue police went unpunished .
Maputo city police spokesman Arnaldo Chefu admitted the existence of some unlawful police officers in the country 's service , who involve themselves in criminal activities , including torture and killing , sometimes of innocent civilians .
He said they faced up to 24 years in jail if convicted .
Changes needed Amnesty 's report was published just a day after Mozambique 's League for Human Rights said the country 's human rights situation had deteriorated in 2008 .
" Police in Mozambique seem to think they have a licence to kill and the weak police accountability system allows for this , " said Michelle Kagari , deputy director of Amnesty 's Africa Programme , in the report , entitled " Licence to Kill " .
" In almost all cases of human rights violations by police - including unlawful killings - no investigation into the case and no disciplinary action against those responsible has been undertaken , nor has any police officer been prosecuted . "
Amnesty 's report highlights individual cases including that of Abrantes Afonso Penicela .
Before he died , in August last year , he told his family how he had been left for dead by members of the police .
Mr Penicela said five of them arrived at his home .
He said he was grabbed and bundled into a car .
He was given a toxic injection , driven to a secluded area and beaten up until he fainted .
He said he was then shot in the back of the neck and set on fire .
The police left him there , but he survived and managed to crawl to a nearby road .
Here he was found by local people who took him to a nearby hospital .
There he told his story to his family before dying from his injuries .
No police officer has been arrested over Mr Penicela 's death .
In February , police opened fire on a group of people protesting in the capital Maputo about increased transport fares , Amnesty 's report says .
Three people were killed and around 30 injured in the incident .
Amnesty has recommended urgent changes to police codes to bring them into line with international standards .

What are these ?
With only two weeks left in the House of Commons calendar until the summer recess ( technically the House could sit for an additional two weeks but few expect that to happen ) , Industry Minister Jim Prentice is likely to introduce his new copyright bill next week or during the first week of June .
While Prentice continues to claim that he is actively working on a bill that meets the needs of creators and consumers , the talk in Ottawa is that the bill is done .
The DMCA provisions that generated so much opposition last December are still there as Prentice is seemingly unwilling to take a stand against the U.S. pressure by siding with Canadian business , consumers , and education groups .
How will Prentice attempt to sell the Canadian DMCA ?
Word is that the six months since the initial bill was shelved has yielded some changes , most notably reforms such as the legalization of time shifting ( ie. recording television shows with a VCR / PVR ) and possibly device shifting ( ie. transfer a song from a store bought CD to an iPod ) .
Neither of these provisions come close to meeting the concerns of the many groups that have spoken out on copyright over the past six months .
Moreover , the Prentice Canadian DMCA is still likely to render Canadians infringers where they seek to use these new exceptions in the digital realm .
For example , last week there were reports that NBC inserted copy - controls into some of their television programming that rendered Windows Vista Media Center users unable to record television shows .
Under the Prentice plan , users that seek to circumvent the digital lock to record the television show ( as he will claim they can ) will still violate the law .
The same is true for copy - controlled CDs – try circumventing the copy - controls to shift the music onto your iPod and you 're violating the law even with a device - shifting provision .
If the exceptions are undermined by the Canadian DMCA provisions , why is Prentice throwing them in ?
The answer is pretty clear .
Prentice hopes that the media coverage will focus on these new " modernizing " provisions that he will claim benefit consumers , rather than on the DMCA - style anti-circumvention provisions that will lock down consumer products , harm research and security , raise privacy concerns , and create a restrictive new legal environment .
With the bill seemingly only days away , now is the time to again tell Prentice and your local MP that Canadians will not be so easily deceived .
Countries such as New Zealand and Israel have recently enacted legislation with far more balance than what Prentice has in mind .
It only takes a few seconds to send an email to Prentice , the Prime Minister , and your local MP , letting them know that Canadians wo n't be deceived by a Canadian DMCA and that Canadian copyright reform should reflect fair copyright principles ( and after you click send , print out the email and drop it in the mail without a stamp to House of Commons , Ottawa , ON , K1A0A6 ) .

Free Market Man
April 7 , 2008
Last month , the House amended the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) to expand the government ’s ability to monitor our private communications .
This measure , if it becomes law , will result in more warrantless government surveillance of innocent American citizens .
Though some opponents claimed that the only controversial part of this legislation was its grant of immunity to telecommunications companies , there is much more to be wary of in the bill .
In the House version , Title II , Section 801 , extends immunity from prosecution of civil legal action to people and companies including any provider of an electronic communication service , any provider of a remote computing service , “ any other communication service provider who has access to wire or electronic communications , ” any “ parent , subsidiary , affiliate , successor , or assignee ” of such company , any “ officer , employee , or agent ” of any such company , and any “ landlord , custodian , or other person who may be authorized or required to furnish assistance . ”
The Senate version goes even further by granting retroactive immunity to such entities that may have broken the law in the past .
The new FISA bill allows the federal government to compel many more types of companies and individuals to grant the government access to our communications without a warrant .
The provisions in the legislation designed to protect Americans from warrantless surveillance are full of loopholes and ambiguities .
There is no blanket prohibition against listening in on all American citizens without a warrant .
We have been told that this power to listen in on communications is legal and only targets terrorists .
But if what these companies are being compelled to do is legal , why is it necessary to grant them immunity ?
If what they did in the past was legal and proper , why is it necessary to grant them retroactive immunity ?
In communist East Germany , one in every 100 citizens was an informer for the dreaded secret police , the Stasi .
They either volunteered or were compelled by their government to spy on their customers , their neighbors , their families , and their friends .
When we think of the evil of totalitarianism , such networks of state spies are usually what comes to mind .
Yet , with modern technology , what once took tens of thousands of informants can now be achieved by a few companies being coerced by the government to allow it to listen in to our communications .
This surveillance is un-American .
We should remember that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer was brought down by a provision of the PATRIOT
Act that required enhanced bank monitoring of certain types of financial transactions .
Yet we were told that the PATRIOT
Act was needed to catch terrorists , not philanderers .
The extraordinary power the government has granted itself to look into our private lives can be used for many purposes unrelated to fighting terrorism .
We can even see how expanded federal government surveillance power might be used to do away with political rivals .
The Fourth Amendment to our Constitution requires the government to have a warrant when it wishes to look into the private affairs of individuals .
If we are to remain a free society we must defend our rights against any governmental attempt to undermine or bypass the Constitution .

Kansas ( TGW ) – The Democratic governor of Kansas vetoed Republican legislation that would have allowed a coal fired power plant to expand and emit 11 million more tons of greenhouse gases per year .
The bill would have allowed Sunflower Electric Power Corp to add two 700 - megawatt units at a facility in western Kansas .
The Kansas Health and Environment Secretary turned down the plant last year because of environmental concerns .
The bill sought to overturn the ruling .
The governor , Kathleen Sebelius , also issued an executive order creating an energy and environmental policy advisory group make recommendations to the governor on how to reduce Kansas ' greenhouse gas emissions .

Les ventes de logements neufs ont chuté de près de 28 % en France au premier trimestre et le stock de logements en vente continue d'augmenter .
La chute des ventes a atteint un niveau record , a annoncé mardi le ministère de l'Ecologie , de l'Energie , du Développement durable et de l'Aménagement du territoire .
Au premier trimestre , 26.700 logements ont été vendus , soit 28 % de moins que lors des trois premiers mois de 2007 quand le volume des ventes avait culminé ( + 12,9 % ) , a précisé le ministère .
Sur un an , le recul des ventes est notable dans 18 des 22 régions de France métropolitaine , et atteint un niveau spectaculaire en Lorraine et en Auvergne où la baisse des ventes est supérieure à 68 % .
Recul des mises en vente
Le nombre de logements mis en vente a également chuté de presque 30 % .
Au cours des trois premiers mois de 2008 , 28.800 logements ont été mis en vente , soit 28,3 % de moins qu'au premier trimestre 2007 et 19,3 % de moins qu'au quatrième trimestre .
Les mises en vente de logements en immeubles collectifs ont reculé de 29,3 % et celles de maisons de 21,0 % par rapport au premier trimestre 2007 , selon le ministère .
Du deuxième trimestre 2007 au premier trimestre 2008 , ce sont 136.600 logements neufs qui ont été mis sur le marché , soit 11,6 % de moins que sur les 12 mois précédents .
Pour les propriétaires qui souhaitent vendre , la commercialisation des biens immobiliers est plus difficile .
Le délai moyen d'écoulement des stocks de logements neufs ( 1 ) est désormais de 12 mois .

Billboards are a different story .
For the most part , they are still a relic of old - world media , and the best guesses about viewership numbers come from foot traffic counts or highway reports , neither of which guarantees that the people passing by were really looking at the billboard , or that they were the ones sought out .
Now , some entrepreneurs have introduced technology to solve that problem .
They are equipping billboards with tiny cameras that gather details about passers - by -- their gender , approximate age , and how long they looked at the billboard .
These details are transmitted to a central database .
Behind the technology are small start - ups that say they are not storing actual images of the passers - by , so privacy should not be a concern .
The cameras , they say , use software to determine that a person is standing in front of a billboard , then analyze facial features ( like cheekbone height and the distance between the nose and the chin ) to judge the person 's gender and age .
So far the companies are not using race as a parameter , but they say that they can and will soon .
The goal , these companies say , is to tailor a digital display to the person standing in front of it -- to show one advertisement to a middle - aged white woman , for example , and a different one to a teenage Asian boy .
" Everything we do is completely anonymous , " said Paolo Prandoni , the founder and chief scientific officer of Quividi , a 2 - year - old company based in Paris that is gearing up billboards in the United States and abroad .
Quividi and its competitors use small digital billboards , which tend to play short videos as advertisements , to reach certain audiences .
Over Memorial Day weekend , a Quividi camera was installed on a billboard on Eighth Avenue near Columbus Circle in Manhattan that was playing a trailer for " The Andromeda Strain , " a miniseries on the cable channel A&E .
" I did n't see that at all , to be honest , " said Sam Cocks , a 26 - year - old lawyer , when the camera was pointed out to him by a reporter .
" That 's disturbing .
I would say it 's arguably an invasion of one 's privacy . "
Organized privacy groups agree , though so far the practice of monitoring billboards is too new and minimal to have drawn much opposition .
But , where cameras are used to look for terrorists , as well as in Lower Manhattan , where there is a similar initiative .
-- Paolo Prandoni , chief scientific officer , Quividi " Everything we do is completely anonymous . "
Although surveillance cameras have become commonplace in banks , stores , and office buildings , their presence takes on a different meaning when they are meant to sell products rather than fight crime .
So while the billboard technology may solve a problem for advertisers , it may also stumble over issues of public acceptance .
" I guess one would expect that if you go into a closed store , it 's very likely you'd be under surveillance , but out here on the street ? "
Cocks asked .
At the least , he said , there should be a sign alerting people to the camera and its purpose .
Quividi's technology has been used in Ikea stores in Europe and McDonald 's restaurants in Singapore , but it has just come to the United States .
Another Quividi billboard is in a Philadelphia commuter station with an advertisement for the Philadelphia Soul , an indoor football team .
Both Quividi- equipped boards were installed by Motomedia , a London - based company that converts retail and street space into advertisements .
" I think a big part of why it 's accepted is that people do n't know about it , " said Lee Tien , senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a civil liberties group .
" You could make them conspicuous , " he said of video cameras .
" But nobody really wants to do that because the more people know about it , the more it may freak them out or they may attempt to avoid it . "
And the issue gets thornier : the companies that make these systems , like Quividi and TruMedia Technologies , say that with a slight technological addition , they could easily store pictures of people who look at their cameras .
The companies say they do not plan to do this , but Mr. Tien said he thought their intentions were beside the point .
The companies are not currently storing video images , but they could if compelled by something like a court order , he said .
For now , " there 's nothing you could go back to and look at , " said George E. Murphy , the chief executive of TruMedia who was previously a marketing executive at DaimlerChrysler .
" All it needs to do is look at the audience , process what it sees , and convert that to digital fields that we upload to our servers . "
-- Lee Tien , senior staff attorney , Electronic Frontier Foundation " I think a big part of why it 's accepted is that people do n't know about it . "
TruMedia 's technology is an offshoot of surveillance work for the Israeli government .
The company , whose slogan is " Every Face Counts , " is testing the cameras in about 30 locations nationwide .
One TruMedia client is Adspace Networks , which runs a network of digital screens in shopping malls and is testing the system at malls in Chesterfield , Mo. , Winston - Salem , N.C. , and Monroeville , Pa. Adspace 's screens show a mix of content , like the top retail deals at the mall that day , and advertisements for DVDs , movies , or consumer products .
Within advertising circles , these camera systems are seen as a welcome answer to the longstanding problem of how to measure the effectiveness of billboards , and how to figure out what audience is seeing them .
On television , Nielsen ratings help marketers determine where and when commercials should run , for example .
As for signs on highways , marketers tend to use traffic figures from the Transportation Department ; for pedestrian billboards , they might hire someone to stand nearby and count people as they walk by .
Internet 's effects on measuring audience
The Internet , though , where publishers and media agencies can track people 's clicks for advertising purposes , has raised the bar on measurement .
Now , it is prodding billboards into the 21st century .
" Digital has really changed the landscape in the sort of accuracy we can get in terms of who 's looking at our creative , " Guy Slattery , senior vice president for marketing for A&E , said of Internet advertising .
With Quividi , Slattery said , he hoped to get similar information from what advertisers refer to as the out - of - home market .
" We 're always interested in getting accurate data on the audience we 're reaching , " he said , " and for out - of - home , this promises to give a level of accuracy we 're not used to seeing in this medium . "
Industry groups are scrambling to provide their own improved ways of measuring out - of - home advertising .
An outdoor advertising association , the Traffic Audit Bureau , and a digital billboard and sign association , the Out - of - Home Video Advertising Association , are both devising more specific measurement standards that they plan to release by the fall .
Even without cameras , digital billboards encounter criticism .
In cities like Indianapolis and Pittsburgh , outdoor advertising companies face opposition from groups that call their signs unsightly , distracting to drivers and a waste of energy .
There is a dispute over whether digital billboards play a role in highway accidents , and a national study on the subject is expected to be completed this fall by a unit of the Transportation Research Board .
The board is part of a private nonprofit institution , the National Research Council .
Meanwhile , privacy concerns about cameras are growing .
In Britain , which has an estimated 4.2 million closed - circuit television cameras -- one for every 14 people -- the matter has become a hot political issue , with some legislators proposing tight restrictions on the use and distribution of the footage .
Reactions to the A&E billboard in Manhattan were mixed .
" I do n't want to be in the marketing , " said Antwann Thomas , 17 , a high school junior , after being told about the camera .
" I guess it 's kind of creepy .
I would n't feel safe looking at it . "
But other passers - by shrugged .
" Someone down the street can watch you looking at it -- why not a camera ? " asked Nathan Lichon , 25 , a Navy officer .
Walter Peters , 39 , a truck driver for a dairy , said : " You could be recorded on the street , you could be recorded in a drugstore , whatever .
It does n't matter to me .
There 's cameras everywhere . "

Two Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives have introduced a bill that would subject broadband providers to antitrust violations if they block or slow Internet traffic .
Representative John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , has sponsored the Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act along with Representative Zoe Lofgren , a Democrat from the Silicon Valley area of California .
The legislation requires Internet service providers to interconnect with the facilities of other network providers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis .
It also requires them to operate their networks in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner so that all content , applications and services are treated the same and have an equal opportunity to reach consumers .
Any ISPs that do not follow these net neutrality rules would be subject to antitrust enforcement .
The legislation , introduced Thursday , earned praised from some consumer and online rights groups .
Large broadband and mobile phone service providers have begun to discriminate against some content , with Comcast saying it has slowed some customer access to the BitTorrent peer - to - peer protocol during times of network congestion , they say .
Other broadband providers have talked about managing their networks or asking some popular Web sites to pay more for fast service , net neutrality advocates have said .
" The bill squarely addresses the issue of the enormous market power of the telephone and cable companies as the providers of 98 percent of the broadband service in the country , " said Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge .
" The bill restores the principle of nondiscrimination that allowed the Internet to flourish in the dial - up era , making certain that the same freedom and innovation will flourish in the broadband era without burdensome regulation . "
But broadband providers and some congressional Republicans have argued that net neutrality legislation is n't necessary .
The broadband market is becoming more competitive and net neutrality regulations could hamper investment in broadband networks , some Republicans said during a hearing this week .
Competition is happened at " all levels of the Internet , " Representative Fred Upton , a Michigan Republican , said this week .
" Our hands - off policy is working . "
Conyers and Lofgren were cosponsors of a similar bill introduced in 2006 , when Republicans held a majority in the House .
With significant Republican opposition , the 2006 bill died , but Democrats were elected to the majority late that year .
" Americans have come to expect the Internet to be open to everyone , " Conyers said in a statement .
" The Internet was designed without centralized control , without gatekeepers for content and services .
If we allow companies with monopoly or duopoly power to control how the Internet operates , network providers could have the power to choose what content is available . "

This can get a bit tricky , but once you get the hang of it , can be done fast enough .
First , some technical notes :
In order to get higher voltage , you need to connect two cells in series .
This means that the negative part of the first connects to the positive part of the second .
As you continue to add more cells in series , you will get a higher voltage from side to side on your solar strip .
This is all good , but if your cells are small - ish , they wo n't generate much amperage .
So even if you have a high voltage , you probably wo n't be able to give it any load ( probably will hardly light an LED ) .
In order to get higher amperage through the circuit , you need to connect cells in parallel ( positive side to positive side , negative side to negative side ) .
When you do this , make sure the positive and negative leads ( copper mesh in this case ) do n't short themselves out .
I found that the best way to connect between two cells was to use hot glue and some conductive mesh .
The mesh is good since it allows light to come through it , and we all love glue guns .
So all you need to do is glue the mesh onto the solar cell surface .
Its always better to have a longer strip of mesh on the surface , with a big enough shared surface space between the two .
Always check with a multimeter that there is connectivity , and that there is voltage coming through .
Its a bummer later to try and figure out where the problem is .
Saudi Arabia rebuffs Bush on oil production Associated Press
Published : Friday May 16 , 2008
|
Print This Email This The White House said Friday that Saudi Arabia 's leaders are making clear they see no reason to increase oil production until customers demand it .
President Bush was in the oil - rich country to appeal to King Abdullah for greater production to help halt rising gas prices in the United States .
But his national security adviser , Stephen Hadley , said Saudi officials stuck to their position that they already are meeting demand .
Hadley told reporters , " What they 're saying to us is ... Saudi Arabia does not have customers that are making requests for oil that they are not able to satisfy . "
When Bush met Abdullah in mid-January , the president also asked Saudi Arabia to raise production to ease high prices at the pump .
But he got a chilly response to that plea .
The kingdom said it would increase production only when the market justified it , and that production levels appeared normal .
Oil prices climbed to a new high Friday , above $ 127 a barrel .
At the pump , gas prices rose to a national average of $ 3.78 per gallon , according to a survey of stations by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service .
Out of public view When Air Force
One landed in the Saudi capital , the president got a red carpet welcome on the tarmac and was warmly greeted by Saudi leaders as a military band played the U.S. national anthem , slightly off - key .
Bush was spending the day with Abdullah at his horse farm outside Riyadh , talking mostly out of public view over three tea services and two meals .
The White House says the president 's visit is intended , in part , to celebrate 75 years of formal U.S. - Saudi relations .
It will mark the conclusion of several agreements , laying out intentions to cooperate on nuclear energy , infrastructure protection and nonproliferation .
But the rising price of oil overshadowed the talks .
Bush acknowledges that raising output is difficult because the demand for oil  particularly from China and India  is stretching supplies .
Besides , any production hike might not lower prices that much .
Some economists say those prices are being driven up by increased demand , not slowed production .
When Bush first ran for president in 2000 , he criticized the Clinton administration for high fuel prices and said the president must " jawbone " oil producing nations and persuade them to drop rates .
At that time , oil was nearing $ 28 a barrel .
Bush 's visit to Saudi Arabia , which has the world 's largest supply of oil , comes two days after Congress voted to temporarily halt daily shipments of 70,000 barrels of oil to the nation 's emergency reserve .
Bush has refused to stop pouring oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , saying the stockpile was meant for emergencies and that halting the shipments would have little or no impact on gasoline or crude oil prices .
It 's a move that Democrats have sought for the past year to increase supply and apply downward pressure on prices .
With an eye to the November election , the Senate sent the measure to the president Wednesday night without a single GOP objection .
The White House has indicated that Bush will sign the reserve measure .
Also , as Bush prepared to leave Washington , Senate Democrats introduced a resolution that would block $ 1.4 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia unless Riyadh agrees to increase its oil production by 1 million barrels per day .
The Democrats said they introduced the measure to coincide with Bush 's trip to send a message to Saudi Arabia that it should pump more oil to reduce the cost of gas for Americans .
High energy costs are a major drain on the U.S. economy , which is experiencing a slowdown that some think is already a recession .
Oil prices are nearly $ 125 a barrel and gasoline threatens to go to $ 4 a gallon this summer .
' Good manners ' Anthony Cordesman , a security analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said Abdullah may produce something " simply because it 's good manners , " but nothing that would have a significant effect .
" U.S. influence over OPEC and Gulf oil production is diminished , " he said .
" It 's not clear what the incentive is to Saudi Arabia .
We can't deliver on ( Mideast ) peace .
We can't deliver on arms transfers .
We can't deliver on the Iraq that Saudi Arabia wants .
We are raising problems in terms of Iran .
And the reality is the market is n't being driven by us ; it 's being driven by China , by India , by rising Asian demand . "
Jon Alterman , director of the CSIS ' Middle East program , said the Saudis , with a public that does n't like Bush and a ruling monarchy with growing interests elsewhere , are not likely " to put themselves out to help this president . "
" The Saudis do n't have an alternative to keeping the U.S. in its corner , but their reliance on the United States , their confidence in the United States is extremely shaken , " Alterman said .
Besides wanting to discuss oil , Bush is paying his second visit to Abdullah this year  on top of a stop by Vice President Dick Cheney in Saudi Arabia in March  to talk about his goal of achieving an Israeli - Palestinian peace deal before he leaves office .
Saudi Arabia 's immense power in the region means that its backing of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and any concessions he will have to make is key .
The Saudi -American relationship began in the 1940s with a simple bargain : Saudi Arabia offered oil in return for U.S. protection .
The United States became the kingdom's biggest trading partner and the Saudis became the biggest buyers of U.S. weapons .
Many Saudis sent their children to American schools .
But over the years , issues arose .
Saudis , like other Arabs , feel Washington leans unfairly to Israel 's side in the dispute with the Palestinians .
And Saudi-U.S. ties took their hardest hit after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , in which 15 the 19 airline hijackers were Saudis .
Americans blamed Saudis for allowing the religious extremism that gave rise to the hijackers .
Though anti-terror cooperation has been relatively strong since , Saudis still smart from what they feel are unfair accusations .

your
You may have memories of running after fireflies with hands outstretched on a warm summer evening .
You may have even watched some discovery channel documentary on the mysteries of the deep sea and marveled at those ' glowing ' organisms featured .
Chances are however , you probably have n't heard too much about the plethora of other bioluminescent creatures inhabiting this planet .
Bioluminescence ( literally meaning living light ) occurs within many living organisms , although , most are relegated to the deep sea .
This chemical reaction involves the oxidation of Luciferin ( just a name for a class of biological light emitting pigments ) .
While related , the name does n't come from any devilish origins , but rather the latin ' lucifer ' meaning " light bringer " .
Depending on the organism , the light can be used for camouflage , attraction , or even communication among bacteria to name a few .
Some of the more notable organisms that bioluminesce include fireflies , glow worms , bacteria , a plethora of marine life , and even mushrooms .
( Here 's a favorite video of mine from planet earth on the glow worm http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBIEmjaoE5w)
Today however , we 'll focus on a particular light emitting alga known as Pyrocystis fusiformis .
These dinoflagellates typically do not occur in high enough concentrations among marine algae to produce a very noticeable glow .
However , when the conditions are right ( excess nutrients , enough sun , etc ) an algal bloom can occur and populations explode .
Chances are you 've heard of this phenomenon before which ( albeit not involving this particular organism ) is also known as a Red Tide .
Here 's a video of one such concentration in a bay in australia .
They are simply throwing water into the bay as the algae only luminesce when disturbed .
A popular theory is that the light is used to attract predators of the grazers of dinoflagellates .
Case et al. ( 1995 ) demonstrated that the feeding rate of squid of mysids in the dark increases significantly when bioluminescent dinoflagellates are present .
There is even a bay in Puerto Rico full of the stuff which people can kayak in .
http://www.biobay.com/
With a little luck and a LOT of patience , you can grow your own bioluminscent algae at home .

Shenzhen is located across the river from Hong Kong .
The city was mainland China ’s first economically free zone in what turned out to be a successful experiment .
They are now building a new terminal at the Bao’an International Airport .
The terminal will have a double skin canopy that will let patterned natural light into the space , thus reducing energy consumption .
The inner skin of the roof will be made of a fine net that will allows diffused sunlight to come in creating a pleasant indoor atmosphere .
The pictures of what this airport will look like are stunning , to say the least .
See the gallery after the break .
What I want to know is , what precautions has the Shenzhen airport taken to withstand any / all of the many typhoons that unleash their fury on the city .
My wife lived in Shenzhen for some 10 years and she tells me stories of when the rain is so hard and the puddles so deep , she took her swimming fins with her when she went to work some mornings .
Or , was it her row boats oars ?
Seriously .
I wonder how this double skin ( Goretex ? ) airport will do against serious inclement weather .
Does anybody know ?
Check out the pictures gallery :

RIO DE JANEIRO  Farmers in Argentina began cutting off grain exports on Thursday after the breakdown of talks to resolve a conflict over government agricultural policies .
Farmers north of Buenos Aires in Gualeguaychú , a hot spot during crippling strikes in March , once again blocked major roads used by trucks to take corn , wheat and soybeans to other South American countries .
In Córdoba , Entre Ríos and Santa Fe Provinces , farmers also gathered on roads to prevent trucks from passing .
Alfredo de Ángeli , a leader in the Argentine Agrarian Federation , said the protests would continue until next Thursday .
But unlike during the 21 - day strike in March , which caused widespread food shortages and crippled exports , farm leaders have vowed that this time they will not block food deliveries to Argentine citizens .
“ We will only stop grains and international exports , ” Mr. de Ángeli said in a television interview .
The protests threatened to exacerbate global food shortages and to damage Argentina ’s economy , which relies on agriculture for more than half its export earnings .
Argentina is the world ’s second largest corn exporter and third largest soybean supplier .
Capitol Briefing , Ben Pershing —
The House voted today by a comfortable margin to refer 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush to the Judiciary Committee , as the measure ’s chief sponsor vowed to bring the issue up again if the panel does not agree to hold hearings .
On a 251 - 166 vote , the chamber elected to refer Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’s ( D - Ohio ) resolution to the Judiciary panel .
All 227 Democrats present voted in favor of the referral , along with 24 Republicans — a big boost from the four GOP lawmakers who voted for referral of charges against Vice President Cheney back in November .
Democratic leaders have made clear that they want no further action on impeachment this year , but Kucinich said after the vote that doing nothing was not an option .
“ Leadership wants to bury it , but this is one resolution that will be coming back from the dead , ” Kucinich told Capitol Briefing .
“ Thirty days from now , if there is no action , I will be bringing the resolution up again , and I wo n’t be the only one reading it . ”
Judiciary Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) has not commented on whether he plans to hold hearings , and Kucinich said he would meet with Conyers this week to present him with documentation for his charges against Bush .
But if there is no further action , Kucinich said , “ We ’ll come back and many of us will be reading this [ on the House floor ] , and we ’ll come back with 60 articles , not 35 . ”
Some Democrats agree with Kucinich that there should be hearings , but do n’t necessarily believe the House should actually impeach Bush .
“ In my district , people have asked me many times why we have n’t impeached President Bush , because they felt some of the things that he has done far outweighs what Clinton was impeached for , ” said Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - Md. ) .
Cummings said he ’d like to see Judiciary hold impeachment hearings , because “ there are a lot of questions out there and I think a lot of those questions need to be answered before [ Bush ] leaves office . ”
But Cummings does n’t think the House should take the process all the way to the end , as it did with Clinton .
“ The time we spend impeaching the president would be better spent doing productive things for the country , ” he said .
On the GOP side , some of the 166 lawmakers who voted against referral today did so because they wanted to simply table the resolution , while others actually wanted to have an immediate , full floor debate so they could try to paint Democrats as partisan extremists .
“ In my personal opinion , we should have had a debate , ” said Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( R - Ga. ) , who called the entire impeachment movement “ just political posturing . ”
Imagine awaking in the middle of the night to find your partner trying to make love to you - while they are sound asleep .
" Sleep sex " is a term coined by US scientists to describe the phenomenon , which can cause people to commit sexual acts on themselves or their partners - while asleep .
The condition can range in severity from disruptive moaning to unwanted , and sometimes violent , sexual advances to their partner .
But no matter how serious their night - time behaviour , patients did not remember what they had done the next morning .
The Stanford scientists , whose research is published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine , believe the condition is caused by a sleep disorder combined with emotional problems .

When it comes to our water supplies we are trusting the wrong people and that trust will hurt us in ways we will regret .
The waters , the rivers of life are precious to those who value life .
(1) To certain others , they are just things to throw trash into , to pollute , and to make money off of at the expense of destroying the environment .
Life is just unthinkable without water , for we can not be separated from water and live .
Water is so important that its pollution and poisoning has a direct impact on our health and even on the quality and effect of our minds and feelings .
We are the element water and we have reservoirs , ponds , rivers and seas of fluids within us .
The flow of blood , the lymphatic system with its fluid movement , endocrine fluidity , urinary fluidity , the fluidity represented by perspiration , saliva , tears , sexual secretions , and lactation are all influenced by water .
Clean water is absolutely essential for healthy living .
An Adequate supply of fresh and clean drinking water is a basic need for all human beings on the earth , yet hundreds of millions of people worldwide are deprived of this .
When you add the fact that most drinking water from public systems are laced with toxic chemicals then we begin to see that its not hundreds of millions who have a problem with water but billions .
Even bottled water has its problems .
(2) We thus need to take so much care when it comes to the water we drink .
'If the world 's water was contained in 100 liters or 26 gallons , then what is readily available to us would amount to one - half teaspoon . ' - Dr. Sang HwangIf there were no water there would be no world as we know it so pollution of our water or the deliberate injection of hazardous chemicals like fluoride and chloramines into it is nothing less than devastating to our biological existence over time .
When approaching a topic as big and as important as water we have to have some sense of reverence for there is something sacred , almost sacramental in the very fabric of water .
Thus water holds the potential to change our world , to change us .
It holds the power of life and death and the most dominant influence over our health .
In the Midwest today there is a serious drought that drives farmers and everyone else to think about water more than anything else .
Next to our breath there is nothing more important than water .
The connection between water and disease was n't established until a scant 100 years ago and the connection between water and human consciousness has still to be discovered .
Observant physicians noted early on that not all diseases were transmitted through contact between individuals .
The two greatest epidemics of the 19th century -- yellow fever and Asiatic cholera showed evidence that some factor other than direct contact with disease victims was necessary to spread the disease .
Typhus and waterborne typhoid fever raged through urban areas , proving to be one of history 's most virulent killers .
Cholera could wipe out its victims in as little as 12 hours .
Cholera is a disease that can take a man suddenly down in good health at daybreak and kill him by nightfall .
Water is well capable of being the harbinger of death and disease so it is best to know and understand the water we drink and bathe in .
In developing countries , four - fifths of all the illnesses are caused by waterborne diseases , with diarrhea being the leading cause of childhood death .
Medically we are still in the Stone Age when it comes to our understanding of water .
Public health officials seem to deliberately choose to remain blind to ever present dangers of all the chemicals finding their way into the public water supplies probably because they are deeply associated with an industry and a medical paradigm that uses toxic chemicals in the form of drugs that are , as we shall see below , also polluting our waters .
Water pollution is caused by human activities : 1 ) By point sources i.e. , factories , sewage treatment plants , underground mines , oil wells , oil tankers and pesticides from agriculture .
2 ) Non-point sources include mercury in the air , acid deposition from the air , traffic , pollutants that are spread through rivers .
3 ) Chemicals deliberately put in the water like fluoride and chloramines .
Water reminds us of the need to live simply and close to the ground but the lesson has been lost on modern man who has not really comprehended his total dependence and vulnerability to water issues .
The CIA considers global water scarcity " a significant issue in security , " said John Gannon , a former CIA assistant director and former chairman of the National Intelligence Council .
Even as we continue to take water for granted , things are getting critical as water levels in many aquifers around the world are dropping , in some places by several meters a year .
(3) In recent measurements , in Waukesha near Chicago for instance , the water level had dropped about 600 feet with the greatest loss being over the last 20 years .
Professor Liu Yonggong , of China Agricultural University in Beijing , indicated that the water table beneath much of the North China Plain , a region that produces some 40 percent of China 's grain , has fallen an average of 1 .
5 meters per year over the last five years .
" Future competition for water seems likely to take place largely in world grain markets . "
- Lester R. Brown , President of the Earth Policy InstituteAn unexpectedly abrupt decline in the supply of water for China 's farmers poses a rising threat to world food security .
China depends on irrigated land to produce 70 percent of the grain for its huge population of 1.2 billion people , but it is drawing more and more of that water to supply the needs of its fast - growing cities and industries .
As rivers run dry ( 4 ) and aquifers are depleted , the emerging water shortages could sharply raise the country 's demand for grain imports , pushing the world 's total import needs beyond exportable supplies .
Since 1950 , the population of China has grown by nearly 700 million , a staggering increase .
Since 1950 , the global renewable freshwater supply per person has fallen 58 percent as world population has swelled from 2.5 billion to 6 billion .
With finite and diminishing water supplies the human race is like a fast moving car about to collide with a solid wall of water scarcity , which is not being helped at all by the global warming effect and the weather changes it is bringing throughout much of the world .
The Yellow River water in China is now loaded with heavy metals and other toxins that make it unfit even for irrigation , much less for human consumption , along much of its route .
None of the proposed solutions to the water crisis -- importing water , water conservation , expanded use of desalination of seawater or developing genetically modified crops that use less water -- will be " sufficient to substantially change the outlook for water shortages in 2015 , " according to Global Trends 2015 , a report by the intelligence council .
Agriculture accounts for two - thirds of water use worldwide and 80 percent to 90 percent in many developing countries .
Some of this is already coming home to Californians who , as of New Year 's Day 2002 , have had three of their eight water pumps on the Colorado River shut down by federal order .
Now , much less water is churning down the 242 - mile aqueduct toward coastal Southern California , where 17 million people rely on snow - melt from the Rocky Mountains for washing dishes , flushing toilets and watering lawns .
This is a pivotal moment in the contentious history of water in the arid West and in many other places around the world .
We are just at the beginning of a problem that has no way of going away .
' The frog does not drink up the pond in which he lives . '
- American Indian ProverbReferences : 1 . Oceans contain 97 per cent of our planet 's water but it is too salty for drinking , irrigation or industrial use .
Only 3 per cent of earth 's total water is considered fresh water .
About 2.997 per cent of this fresh water is trapped in polar ice caps and deep within earth 's surface which is too costly to extract .
Thus only .003 per cent of earth 's total available water by volume is available for human use .
The global picture of water is not pretty with some 1.1 billion people still lacking access to improved drinking water sources and some 2.4 billion to adequate sanitation .
2 .
In March of 1999 , the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) released a report called " Bottled Water , Pure Drink or Pure Hype ? "
NRDC 's report points out that as much as 40 % of all bottled water comes from a city water system , just like tap water .
Federal regulations that govern bottled water only require it to be as good as tap water , not better .
There are no assurances , regulations or requirements that bottled water be any higher in quality than tap water .
3. Iran .
The water table is falling by 2.8 meters annually in the agriculturally rich Chenaran Plain in northeastern Iran .
That , coupled with the cumulative effect of a three - year drought , has driven people out of the region , generating a swelling flow of water refugees .
4. Egypt .
Egypt is entirely dependent for its water on the Nile River , which is now reduced to a trickle as it enters the Mediterranean .
Neither Egypt , Ethiopia , nor Sudan can increase its take from the Nile except at the expense of the other two countries .
Populations in these three countries is projected to climb to 264 million in 2025 from 167 million today .
A quarter - century ago , with more and more of its water being pumped out for the country 's multiplying needs , the Yellow River began to falter .
In 1972 , the water level fell so low that for the first time in China 's long history it dried up before reaching the sea .
It failed on 15 days that year , and intermittently over the next decade or so .
Since 1985 , it has run dry each year , with the dry period becoming progressively longer .
In 1996 , it was dry for 133 days .
In 1997 , a year exacerbated by drought , it failed to reach the sea for 226 days .
For long stretches , it did not even reach Shandong Province , the last province it flows through en route to the sea .
Shandong , the source of one - fifth of China 's corn and one - seventh of its wheat , depends on the Yellow River for half of its irrigation water .

As research has moved away from the realm of universities and into the private sector , more physicians are being paid by drug companies to enroll and monitor patients during clinical trials .
Private corporations have been the largest sponsors of pharmaceutical research in both Canada and the United Sates in the last twenty years .
Research Ethics Boards ( REB ’s ) exist to protect the safety of research subjects .
However , they provide guidelines only , and often guidelines are ambiguous .
REB ’s may be private entities , and thus may be vulnerable to pressure .
Some of the concerns raised in regards to physician remuneration question whether physicians can maintain objectivity .
Physicians may not fully disclose all potential risk factors to patients if it is in their financial interest to recruit subjects for a trial .
Another concern is the potential for breech of confidentiality .
A breech could occur if physicians actively search for likely candidates for a drug trial by accessing charts of patients who are not theirs .
Physicians may also be tempted to enroll patients in a trial who do not meet the criteria for selection , or patients who are “ on the cusp . ”
Patients may also feel some pressure to agree to enroll in a study strictly because of the nature of the physician - patient relationship .
Patients place great trust in their doctors , but they may be afraid that refusing to take part in a study may cause their doctor to have negative feelings towards them .
They may agree to take part simply to keep their doctor “ happy . ”
Another concern is that financial inducements may hamper physician ’s decision - making .
For example , a doctor who was being rewarded financially for every patient who completed the study might be inclined to keep a patient in the study even if they suffered untoward symptoms .
There are internationally developed guidelines that are meant to provide guidelines in clinical research ; some examples are the Helsinki Declaration , International Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects , and Good Clinical Practice for Trials on Pharmaceutical Products ( World Health Organization ) .
What are some considerations that can mitigate some of the aforementioned conflicts of interest ?
Above all , patients should be made aware of any potential conflict of interest and also have the right to know exactly how the physicians are being rewarded by the drug company .
Additionally , patient confidentiality should be protected as much as possible and patients should be made aware of how information about them may be shared .
In this way , physicians can participate in research trials without compromising patient trust and safety .

McCain fails to vote on defeated equal pay for women Senate bill RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday April 23 , 2008
|
Print This Email This NEW ORLEANS  Republican Sen. John McCain , campaigning through poverty - stricken cities and towns , said Wednesday he opposed a Senate bill that sought equal pay for women because it would lead to more lawsuits .
The bill was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 56 - 42 .
The Senate had scheduled a late Wednesday vote on the measure , which would have made it easier for women to sue their employers for pay discrimination .
Both Democratic presidential candidates , Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , left the campaign trail and returned to Washington to vote for the bill .
McCain skipped the vote to campaign in New Orleans .
" I am all in favor of pay equity for women , but this kind of legislation , as is typical of what 's being proposed by my friends on the other side of the aisle , opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems , " the expected GOP presidential nominee told reporters .
" This is government playing a much , much greater role in the business of a private enterprise system . "
The bill would have overturned a Supreme Court decision limiting how long workers can wait before suing for pay discrimination .
It was named for Lilly Ledbetter , a supervisor at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. 's plant in Gadsden , Ala. , who sued for pay discrimination just before retiring after a 19 - year career there .
By the time she retired , Ledbetter made $ 6,500 less than the lowest - paid male supervisor and claimed earlier decisions by supervisors kept her from making more .
The Supreme Court voted 5 - 4 last May 29 to throw out her complaint , saying she had waited too long to sue .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) released a statement blasting Senate Republicans following the defeat of the bill .
" By obstructing a vote on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , Senate Republicans have thwarted efforts to restore balance in the law and allow victims of wage discrimination to seek justice in the courts .
In so doing , they have again stopped necessary progress for all Americans , " read the statement , in part .
Democrats criticized McCain for opposing the bill .
" At a time when American families are struggling to keep their homes and jobs while paying more for everything from gasoline to groceries , how on Earth would anyone who thinks they can lead our country also think it 's acceptable to oppose equal pay for America 's mothers , wives and daughters ? "
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Karen Finney said .
McCain stated his opposition to the bill as he campaigned in rural eastern Kentucky , where poverty is worse among women than men .
The Arizona senator said he was familiar with the disparity but that there are better ways to help women find better paying jobs .
" They need the education and training , particularly since more and more women are heads of their households , as much or more than anybody else , " McCain said .
" And it 's hard for them to leave their families when they do n't have somebody to take care of them .
" It 's a vicious cycle that 's affecting women , particularly in a part of the country like this , where mining is the mainstay ; traditionally , women have not gone into that line of work , to say the least , " McCain said .
McCain chose to visit the tiny hamlet of Inez , Ky. , because it is where President Lyndon B. Johnson declared war on poverty .
But McCain , contradicting President Bush by acknowledging the U.S. is presently in a recession , said Johnson 's poverty programs had failed .
" I would n't be back here today if government had fulfilled the promise that Lyndon Johnson made 44 years ago , " he said .
In recent weeks , McCain has proposed a series of tax breaks for corporations , government - backed refinancing for struggling homeowners and a summer holiday from gas taxes .
He proposed another new program Wednesday : a tax write - off for companies that provide high - speed Internet access for underserved , low - income communities .

Alaska Independence Movement
There are many potential Kosovos in the international community – a great number of these within the United States of America itself , where the Lakota people claim their right to a huge swathe of territory across the north of the country , the peoples of Aztlan in the south proclaim their right to independence and today , the Alaska Independence Movement presents its case in PRAVDA .

I 've got no use for America or her damned institutions . "
Joe Vogler
An Interview submitted by Lynette Clark , Chairman , Alaskan Independence Party
1 . What can you tell us about any new strategies or ideas developed at the recent Alaska Independence Party convention ?
Yes , AIP members voted to support taking the Statehood case their founder , Joe Vogler , had prepared , and present same , to the United Nations for full International review .
2 . Is there any progress on organizing a vote about secession ?
At this point , some progress .
The AIP leadership realizes more education of Alaska 's population regarding this slice of Alaskan History is necessary and have committed to that effort .
When the vote occurs , an informed public is necessary .
3 . I doubt very many US citizens know the particulars regarding what happened when Alaska was made a state .
Would you tell the readers how Alaskans were denied a vote on secession in the past ?
It says on your website : " voting was corrupt and residents were not given the proper choice between statehood , commonwealth status , or complete separation - something they say has been granted to other U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico . "
The rights of Alaskans , as the residents of a Non-Self Governing Territory , were protected by many UN General Assembly Resolutions .
The U.S Government was under obligation to assure that “ the right of people and nations to Self - Determination is exercised . ”
People of Alaska were never given a chance to exercise their right to cast the most important vote in their life .
Native Alaskans were not allowed to vote because most of them could not read or write in English , and while the rest of Alaskan population was trying to make a sense of what was happening to them , the U.S. Government encouraged the 41,000 U.S. Military Personnel and 36,000 of age their dependents “ to help Alaskans ” and vote “ yes ” on statehood .
With 40,000 votes for the statehood and 8,000 votes against it is not difficult to see how this “ voting was corrupt ” .
Alaska was no different from other colonies , as Algerians did not see themselves as a part of France , or as Libyans did not see themselves as a part of Italy , most Alaskans did not see themselves as a part of U.S.A .
Within the frames of International Law and established political practices of that time it would be natural for Alaskans to vote for Independence and not remain “ a colonial warehouse of natural resources to fuel the factories of the United States . ”
4 . How you do think the recent declaration of the Lakota Nation by the Lakota tribe might affect your plan to be placed on the list of " non-self governing territories " ?
While the colonies in South America , Asia and Africa attained their freedom , people and tribes in North America are still struggling for Independence .
But times are changing and people who had suffered the injustice by the North American colonial masters are making their voice heard .
Considering the past American history we do not expect a quick and easy solution coming from Washington DC , and this is why we are prepared to use non-violent means to achieve our goals - to request an International Inquiry as to the illegal “ statehood vote ” of August 26 , 1958 and a free vote for Alaskans to determine their own future .
5 . Can you explain exactly what is a non-self governing territory and how this will lead to independence ?
The colonized territories previously claimed by UN Signatory Nations and lately being supervised by UN Member - State , had been given a legal status as Trusts or as Non–Self - Governing Territories .
Since native population did not have the necessary political and administrative institutions in place to govern the land , the colonizing powers or trusties had to provide the services to local population .
In due time , as the local population progresses itself into a functional society , demonstrating ability of self - governance , the Trusties were obligated to assure the people would decide on their own form of government .
AIP would expect , and United Nation rules mandate , the U.S. Government to facilitate the vote as :
1 ) Remain a Territory .
2 ) Become a separate and Independent Nation .
3 ) Accept Commonwealth status .
4 ) Become a State
The U.S. Government did not act in good faith and thus steered the whole process in one direction only – to retain Alaska as a part of the Union .
6 . What exactly do you envision as a result of self - determination ?
And what role is the US constitution in this self - determination ?
What about federal taxation , the military and such ?
The people of Alaska are " masters in their own house " and entitled to decide on their own future .
Considering the availability of our natural resources and unique character of Alaskans , complete Independence would be the best logical outcome .
We have a great respect for U.S. Constitution , most Alaskans see it as divinely inspired document and would like to keep as the Law of the Land .
AIP would oppose any oppressive form of taxation and all the expenditures would be legislated locally in correlation with the Nation ’s revenues .
7 . Do you foresee conducting relations with other countries independently ?
As stated in Burlington Declaration , a document adopted during 2006 First North America Secessionist Convention : “ Nations once independent should engage in peace , commerce , good will and honest friendship with all nations . ”
We are prepared to keep good working relations with U.S. , while developing strong commercial ties with our neighbors : Canada , Russia , Japan and China .
Commerce and Free Trade is one of the hallmarks of a sovereign Nation .
8 . What reaction have you had from the two major parties and their leaders ?
They often attempt to marginalize or ignore us .
However , they also often appeal to our members for support .
Overall , however , AIP is widely respected and our history is well known .
9 . Can you elaborate on the reference made to a " certain political elite " ?
For example ... " During 2nd North American Secessionist Convention in 2007 the following truths have been agreed upon : ( excerpt )
2 . The privileges , monopolies , and powers that private corporations have won from government threaten everyone 's health , prosperity , and liberty , and have already killed American self , government by the people .
3 . The power of corporations endangers liberty as much as government power , especially when they are combined as in the American Empire .
Today American politicians in Washington DC , instead of representing the interest of American people , are promoting the interests of greedy International Corporations .
This is why we believe the power must rest in the hands of the people and not with corrupt Washington DC “ elite . "
10 .
Can you familiarize our readers with the international laws you are relying upon to pursue your claims ?
General Assembly Resolution 637 , 16 December , 1952 , ( VII ) , considering the Right of people ’s for self - Determination and a basic Human Right makes it clear : “ 3 . The States Members of the United Nations responsible for the administration of Non-Self - Governing and Trust Territories shall take the practical steps , pending the realization of the right of self - determination and in preparation thereof , to ensure the direct participation of the indigenous populations in the legislative and executive organs of government of those territories , and to prepare them for complete self - government or independence ” .
The U.S. Government completely neglected its responsibilities to the people of Alaska , which UN considered to be a Non-Self - Governing Territory , and did nothing to inform Alaskans about their Rights under that resolution .
By allowing the U.S. Military Personnel and their of age dependents to vote on Alaska statehood on August 26 , 1958 , the U.S. Government forced its will on Alaskans .
We believe that all these actions of the U.S. Government make the “ statehood vote ” of 1958 illegal and Alaska should retain the status of Non-Self - Governing Territory .
11 . As you have presented your case to the UN , have you had any response as of yet from them or the international community ?
Just when Mr. Vogler had letter in hand confirming UN sponsor contact , he was kidnapped and murdered .
We start again .
12 . Can you expand upon the official statement which alluded to the United States and the theft of natural resources in Alaska ?
The AIP founder Mr. Joseph E. Vogler , described the situation the best : “ An Alaskan economy ( except for oil and government employment , financed by oil royalties and taxes ) is practically non-existent .
We are not allowed to process our oil before exporting it to the United States , and as mentioned before , they have the audacity to openly state that , ‘ the production of Alaska 's resources will create a great many jobs in other states , where they will be taken for manufacture and distribution . ’
Alaska is nothing more than a colonial warehouse of natural resources to fuel the factories of the United States ” .
Today the situation remains pretty much the same .
13 .
What will become of US military assets or bases located in Alaska ?
As an Independent Nation , and , with the understanding of the strategic location of Alaska , it would serve Alaskan interests to maintain a U.S. presence .
The military have been good neighbors .
However , as a sovereign nation , Alaska could broker the leasing of the land and air space reserved for military installations and set the requirements for environmental responsibility in the use of that land .
We would also insist that all environmental damage as a result of past military activities be comprehensibly addressed and remedied .
14 .
What reaction if any have you had from the US government about secession plans ?
None .
Which leads one to believe either AIP is correct , or we 're all under surveillance !

For the past three years , the European Union has been operating the world 's largest emissions trading system and the first system to limit and to trade carbon dioxide emissions .
An MIT analysis of this initial " trial " phase finds that — despite its hasty adoption and somewhat rocky beginning — the European Union cap - and - trade system has operated well and has had little or no negative impact on the overall EU economy .
The MIT results provide both encouragement and guidance to policy makers working to design a carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) - trading scheme for the United States and for the world .
" This important public policy experiment is not perfect , but it is far more than any other nation or set of nations has done to control greenhouse gas emissions — and it works surprisingly well , " said A. Denny Ellerman , senior lecturer in the MIT Sloan School of Management , who performed the analysis with Paul L. Joskow , the Elizabeth and James Killian Professor in the Department of Economics .
The cap - and - trade approach to controlling emissions is hardly unprecedented .
For years , the US has operated highly successful cap - and - trade systems for emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides .
Based on a national emissions cap , facilities that emit those pollutants receive a limited number of emissions permits , or " allowances , " for a given period .
Facilities that emit more than their allowed limit must buy allowances from facilities that emit less .
Markets for trading allowances operate smoothly , and — in response to the strong economic incentive — facilities have reduced their emissions significantly .
Despite such success , setting up a US cap - and - trade system for CO 2 emissions has proved challenging .
Carbon emissions are so central to energy consumption that the idea of imposing a policy to limit them raises serious concerns .
Could putting a price on carbon emissions lead to serious economic effects ?
Might the outcome be the equivalent of energy rationing ?
How would the initial allocation of allowances work ?
And would a straight carbon tax be preferable after all ?
Such questions loom large as the US Congress debates the merits of several climate - change bills containing proposed CO 2 cap - and - trade systems .
To help address those questions and move the debate forward , Ellerman and Joskow performed an in - depth study of the development , structure , and performance of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) to date .
In 2000 , leaders in the EU realized that they would not be able to meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol , which take effect in 2008 , without taking action .
Previous attempts to impose a carbon tax had failed , so — despite their earlier opposition to the cap - and - trade approach — they set up the first phase of their EU trading system covering 2005 to 2007 .
Their goal was not so much to achieve significant emissions reductions in these years as it was to get the system up and running by the beginning of the first Kyoto period .
Today , the EU ETS is far larger than either of the US programs .
It covers 11,000 installations while the US sulfur dioxide program covers only 3,000 , and the value of the allowances is about $ 80 billion as opposed to $ 4 billion .
Perhaps most striking , the EU ETS operates internationally .
Allowances are traded by facilities in 27 independent nations that form a loose federal union and differ widely in per capita income , market experience , institutional background , and other features .
As the EU moves into the second phase of its ETS , what are some of the lessons to be learned ?
First , the European experience shows that the economic effects — in a macro economic sense — have not been large .
" No one talks about under - performance in Europe since 2005 because of the carbon price , " Ellerman said .
" Changes have occurred in certain industries , but the notion that the carbon price would wreck the overall economy is clearly disproved for the European system , which for a long time had a high price compared to what was expected . "
Even though reducing emissions was not the primary focus of the three - year trial , carbon reductions were in fact achieved , with minimal macroeconomic impact .
A second lesson is that permitting " banking and borrowing " will make a cap - and - trade system work more efficiently .
Within the three - year period of the EU ETS , facilities can bank ( save some of this year 's allowance for use next year ) or borrow ( use some of next year 's allowances now and not have them available next year ) .
During the first three years , many facilities took advantage of the opportunity to trade across time .
But they always produced the necessary allowances within the required time period .
Concerns that facilities would postpone their obligations indefinitely have proved unwarranted .
" We 've seen no abuses of borrowing within the system at all , " said Ellerman .
A third lesson is the importance of having accurate data and good communications both to ensure a smooth - running market and to achieve the desired reduction in emissions .
When the EU system was established , data on actual emissions — installation by installation — were not available , so facilities received allowances based on their estimated emissions .
As a result , no one was quite sure how restrictive the cap would turn out to be .
That uncertainty pushed up prices — until April 2006 , when the first verified emissions reports came in .
Actual emissions were far lower than expected , allowances were plentiful , and the carbon price fell by half within a week ( see the figure ) .
Communication of information among the market participants has improved , and prices for allowances bought ahead for use in 2008 have been far less erratic .
A fourth lesson is that the process of allocating emissions allowances is going to be contentious — and yet cap - and - trade is still the most politically feasible approach to controlling carbon emissions .
Some people have argued that the EU method of allocating free allowances to polluting facilities is morally wrong .
But an emissions - control policy is more likely to succeed if those most affected — the current polluters — are given some assets along with the liabilities they are being asked to assume .
" Part of the genius of these cap - and - trade systems is that you 're saying , ‘ Look , we 're going to make a deal .
You 're now going to have to submit a permit for every ton of emissions you make , but we 're going to give you most of the permits that you 'll need — and if you 're able to reduce your emissions , you 'll have permits to sell , ' " said Ellerman .
Perhaps the main message for policy makers is that everything does not have to be perfectly in place to start up .
When the EU ETS began , the overall EU cap had not been finally determined , registries for trading emissions were not established everywhere , and many available allowances — especially from Eastern Europe — could not come onto the market .
The volatility of prices during the first period reflects those imperfections .
" Obviously you 're better off having things all settled and worked out before it gets started , " said Ellerman .
" But that certainly was n't the case in Europe , and yet a transparent and widely accepted price for CO 2 emission allowances emerged rapidly , as did a functioning market and the infrastructure to support it . "
Moreover , a significant segment of European industry soon began to factor the price of CO 2 emissions allowances into their business decisions .
A NEW STUDY in the journal Neurology is being hailed as unassailable proof that marijuana is a valuable medicine .
It is a sad commentary on the state of modern medicine -- and US drug policy -- that we still need " proof " of something that medicine has known for 5,000 years .
The study , from the University of California at San Francisco , found smoked marijuana to be effective at relieving the extreme pain of a debilitating condition known as peripheral neuropathy .
It was a study of HIV patients , but a similar type of pain caused by damage to nerves afflicts people with many other illnesses including diabetes and multiple sclerosis .
Neuropathic pain is notoriously resistant to treatment with conventional pain drugs .
Even powerful and addictive narcotics like morphine and OxyContin often provide little relief .
This study leaves no doubt that marijuana can safely ease this type of pain .
As all marijuana research in the United States must be , the new study was conducted with government - supplied marijuana of notoriously poor quality .
So it probably underestimated the potential benefit .
This is all good news , but it should not be news at all .
In the 40 - odd years I have been studying the medicinal uses of marijuana , I have learned that the recorded history of this medicine goes back to ancient times and that in the 19th century it became a well - established Western medicine whose versatility and safety were unquestioned .
From 1840 to 1900 , American and European medical journals published over 100 papers on the therapeutic uses of marijuana , also known as cannabis .
Of course , our knowledge has advanced greatly over the years .
Scientists have identified over 60 unique constituents in marijuana , called cannabinoids , and we have learned much about how they work .
We have also learned that our own bodies produce similar chemicals , called endocannabinoids .
The mountain of accumulated anecdotal evidence that pointed the way to the present and other clinical studies also strongly suggests there are a number of other devastating disorders and symptoms for which marijuana has been used for centuries ; they deserve the same kind of careful , methodologically sound research .
While few such studies have so far been completed , all have lent weight to what medicine already knew but had largely forgotten or ignored : Marijuana is effective at relieving nausea and vomiting , spasticity , appetite loss , certain types of pain , and other debilitating symptoms .
And it is extraordinarily safe -- safer than most medicines prescribed every day .
If marijuana were a new discovery rather than a well - known substance carrying cultural and political baggage , it would be hailed as a wonder drug .
The pharmaceutical industry is scrambling to isolate cannabinoids and synthesize analogs , and to package them in non-smokable forms .
In time , companies will almost certainly come up with products and delivery systems that are more useful and less expensive than herbal marijuana .
However , the analogs they have produced so far are more expensive than herbal marijuana , and none has shown any improvement over the plant nature gave us to take orally or to smoke .
We live in an antismoking environment .
But as a method of delivering certain medicinal compounds , smoking marijuana has some real advantages :
The effect is almost instantaneous , allowing the patient , who after all is the best judge , to fine - tune his or her dose to get the needed relief without intoxication .
Smoked marijuana has never been demonstrated to have serious pulmonary consequences , but in any case the technology to inhale these cannabinoids without smoking marijuana already exists as vaporizers that allow for smoke - free inhalation .
Hopefully the UCSF study will add to the pressure on the US government to rethink its irrational ban on the medicinal use of marijuana -- and its destructive attacks on patients and caregivers in states that have chosen to allow such use .
Rather than admit they have been mistaken all these years , federal officials can cite " important new data " and start revamping outdated and destructive policies .
The new Congress could go far in establishing its bona fides as both reasonable and compassionate by immediately moving on this issue .
Such legislation would bring much - needed relief to millions of Americans suffering from cancer , AIDS , multiple sclerosis , arthritis , and other debilitating illnesses .

The housing slump has created another type of pain : the suffering of people who find themselves navigating a tight rental market after losing their home to foreclosure .
Hundreds of thousands of former homeowners have been scrambling to find a place to rent .
Yet rental properties are in short supply in many markets , pushing prices higher .
And some landlords are imposing tougher credit requirements on people who have gone through foreclosure .

Thousands of new wind turbines could be built across the UK as part of a £ 100bn investment in renewable energy that could create hundreds of thousands of new " green collar " jobs , Gordon Brown announced today .
The prime minister unveiled what he described as a " green revolution " and " the most dramatic change in energy policy since the advent of nuclear power " .
He wants to build up Britain 's clean power supply in order to reach the EU - imposed target of producing 15 % of the country 's energy from renewable sources by 2020 .
This will require £ 100bn of investment from the private sector , which the government will encourage with financial incentives due to be announced later by the business secretary , John Hutton .
In a speech to an energy summit at the Tate Modern art gallery in central London , Brown said that the North Sea , which has passed its peak in terms of oil and gas supplies , will be turned into " the equivalent for wind power of what the Gulf of Arabia is for oil " .
Wind turbines will also be built inland , but with sensitivity towards local communities .
Householders will be encouraged to reduce their bills through energy - saving incentives due to be announced later this summer , said Brown .
Within a decade he said he wanted every householder able to do so to fit loft or cavity wall insulation , install low - energy light bulbs , and use low - energy consumer goods .
The government will also shortly begin a new advertising campaign showing people what steps they can take to reduce their energy and fuel bills – steps such as turning appliances off rather than leaving them on standby , and fitting new shower heads .
In the autumn , said Brown , the government will consult on a new plan aimed at changing the way in which energy companies operate – encouraging them not to supply ever more units of electricity and gas , but to make profits from reducing , not increasing , demand .
" This is a green revolution in the making , " Brown said .
" It will be a tenfold increase on our current deployment of renewables , and a 300 % increase on our existing plans : the most dramatic change in our energy policy since the advent of nuclear power . "
He said it would mean that by 2020 renewables would account for over 30 % of electricity supply , 14 % cent of heat supply and up to 10 % cent of transport fuels .
Brown estimated that the renewables programme would generate around 160,000 jobs , and plans for new nuclear power stations around 100,000 , with many more created from energy - saving measures .
The prime minister also said that he was prepared to take on public opinion over green taxes , insisting that a low - carbon society would not emerge from a " business as usual " approach .
" It will require real leadership from government - being prepared to make hard decisions on planning or on tax for example , " he said .
" It will mean new kinds of consumer behaviour and lifestyles .
And it will demand creativity , innovation and entrepreneurialism throughout our economy and our society . "
The shadow business secretary , Alan Duncan , said that after a series of " painful and reluctant U - turns " , the government had come round to the Conservatives ' vision of a greener Britain .
He criticised Brown for launching a consultation on energy after a " decade of dithering " .
" Gordon Brown must now translate these words into action .
If we do n't grasp this opportunity now , we 'll still be playing catch - up in 20 years , " said Duncan .
The Liberal Democrats ' environment spokesman , Steve Webb , said that , with Britain near the bottom of the European renewables league table , he found it hard to believe Brown 's talk of a " green revolution " .
He said : " The fundamental problem is that Brown does n't do ' green ' .
He would rather urge oil producers to extract more oil than invest in technologies that will actually save CO2 emissions now .
" When the government has failed so lamentably to take a political lead in the last 11 years , why should we believe the coming years will be any different ? "
Greenpeace described the new strategy as " visionary " , but the environment group warned that ministers had promised much before and had so far failed to deliver .
John Sauven , the group 's executive director , said : " If the government actually means it this time , then Britain will become a better , safer and more prosperous country .
We could create jobs , reduce our dependence on foreign oil and use less gas , and in the long run our power bills will come down .
But it wo n't happen without real government action . "
Philip Wolfe , the executive director of the Renewable Energy Association , said : " Government have produced an energy strategy , not just an electricity strategy .
This shows a new maturity in approach , getting away from the soundbite policy - making of the past and looking carefully at the role of renewables in buildings , heat , and transport .
" The key missing factor is a greater sense of urgency .
We have only 12 years left and government still wants to use two of those talking about it . "
Martin Temple , the chairman of the Engineering Employers ' Federation , said : " Moving to a low - carbon economy will create significant business opportunities for the UK , but we will need to move quickly and decisively .
Businesses around the world are alive to the massive opportunities and a number of governments are making their exploitation a national priority . "

Hi , folks !
My name ’s Noel Silvia , and I ’m a Graphic Artist and part of the PlayStation Network team .
I ’m here today to walk you through how to make and install your own Themes for your PLAYSTATION 3 .
All you ’ll need are :
an image editing program ( MSPaint , Adobe PhotoShop , etc . )
the provided “ compiler ” program
a little time
Start by downloading the “ HowToMakePS3Themes.zip ” .zip file here and extracting it onto your computer .
In this zip are folders with the necessary files for each step of the process .
Step 1 : Create
Let ’s start at the very beginning .
In this folder , you ’ll find the images that make the XMB , its sub-icons , and the background wallpapers for HD and SD resolutions .
There is also a file called “ PS3 Theme_template.xml ” , but we ’ll come back to that a little later .
It ’s important that you do n’t change any of the file names in this folder .
If you do , it will cause problems later on .
Start by deciding which icon you ’d like to customize and open that image in your image editing program .
You can alter the image any way you ’d like ( change the color , skin the icon , add effects , etc. ) .
You can even replace the image completely with personal photos if you ’d like .
Just make sure not to change the Pixel Dimensions of the image ; so if the icon image is 140 x 140 pixels at the start , make sure it ’s the same size at the end .
When you are done with your new icon , overwrite the original image with your new custom image .
Make sure you save it as a “ PNG ” file , and not a JPG , BMP , GIF , or any other file type .
To create your background wallpaper , follow the same steps above , making sure to maintain the original Pixel Dimensions .
The only difference is that when you save your wallpaper image , you ’re going to save it as a “ JPG ” file , and not a “ PNG ” file like the icons .
Step 2 : Assemble
When you ’re done making your new icons , it ’s time to put the whole thing together and make the actual Theme file .
It helps to have two windows open for this part , one showing the contents of the “ Step 1 _Create ” folder , the other showing “ Step 2 _Assemble ” .
From the “ Step 1 _Create ” folder , click and drag the “ PS3 Theme_template.xml ” file and drop it onto the “ p3tcompiler.exe ” program found in the “ Step 2 _Assemble ” folder .
A new window should appear , showing the program working as it puts together your Theme .
If there are any errors , the program will stop at the error , letting you know which file is causing problems .
When it has finished assembling the pieces successfully , a “ ” message will appear , prompting you to press “ ENTER ” and close the program .
Step 3 : Install
Return to your “ Step 1 _Create folder .
You should see a bunch of new files in the folder .
The files with the “ GIM ” extension are special temp files .
They were created during assembly but can be deleted now .
You should also find a new file called “ PS3Theme_template.p3t ” .
This is your new Theme file .
Copy the file onto a detectable USB device or a one of the compatible memory sticks into the proper “ Theme ” folder ( \ PS3 \THEME )
Connect the device to your PS3 or insert the memory stick into the reader .
Under “ Settings ” , select “ Theme Settings ” , and then “ Theme ” .
At the very top , there is an “ Install ” option .
Once you ’ve installed your
Theme to your PS3 , your theme will now be selectable your “ Theme List ” .
… and that ’s how you make your own PS3 Themes !
For those of you that ’d like a little more customization , please read the “ Advanced Tips Guide ” in the included “ Step 4 ” folder with some extra info on how to :
change your
Theme ’s title
change your
Theme ’s preview art
change your
Theme ’s font
change your
Theme ’s color selection
change your
Theme ’s Author avatar
create a
Theme with random background images
I ’ll be back next time to show you how to make your own custom Themes for the PSP , but until then , have fun making your own PS3 Themes !
“ If you can imagine it , you can create it .
If you can dream it , you can become it . ”

ローカルサーバだとこのまま動きますが、GAEにアップロードするときには日本語で書かれたコメントを全部除去しないと動きませんでした。なんでだろ。
Yahoo!形態素解析サービスを使ってトークナイズしているため、GAEサーバよりタイムアウトで蹴られてしまう(GAEサーバ内のリクエスト処理が数秒以上かかると処理が強制中断されてしまう)んじゃないかと心配していましたが、あんまり心配ないようです。よかった。
ここでのお勉強のまとめ。
GAE 的なもの 日本語が入ったコード はGAE サーバ上では動かせない ?
UTF -8でアップロードしてもやっぱりダメ(2008-04-20追記:ウソです。こちら参照)。 urlfetchを使ってみた。 POSTするときのpayloadは、urlencode ( ) が必要。ヘッダを加える必要有り。
Python的なもの 文字コードよくわからん リスト内包を使ってみた map ( ) があればよくないかなあ。文法を増やしてまでサポートする必要あるかなあ。 ラムダ式を使ってみた 。
Ruby より書きやすいし使いやすそう。これはいいなあ。 インスタンスメソッドやインスタンス変数にアクセスするときにselfをつけるのにも慣れてきた。僕はJavaやC++で書くときにも明示的にthisを書く人なので、面倒だとも思わない。
IR的なもの Yahooの形態素検索サービス、いいなあ。解を品詞でフィルタできたりとか、そういうのも便利。
基本形も解として返してくれるので、インデックスを作るときには基本形もインデックスに入れたほうがいいだろう。
GAE のクエリでは解を最大1000個しか返してくれないので、全文検索の処理速度を上げても実はあんまり意味ない。処理速度が問題になるほど多くの文書を登録できない。
このプログラムを拡張していくなら、インデクサはプラグイン式にすべき。
形態素解析器をインデクサとして使う検索エンジンに共通の弱点だが、解析結果によってインデックスの作られ方が意図しないものになってしまう。ノーマライズやらquey
expansionやらしないと品質が低いまま。あんまりインデクサに手を入れられないのであれば、N-gramでインデックスを作ったほうが良い解が得られるだろう。GAE上で検索エンジン作るなら、形態素とN-gramを併用するんだろうな。
最後に、IIR本とIIR輪講会の資料はとても参考になりました。関係者の方に御礼申し上げます。
An independent environmental expert told a court in Ecuador that the oil company Chevron should pay $ 7 billion to $ 16 billion in compensation for environmental damage in the country .
In a report to the court , the expert , Richard Cabrera , who is a geologist , said the low end of the range represented the cost to remediate soils and pay for health care costs , a water system and infrastructure improvements .
The high end of the range was based on an “ unjust enrichment ” penalty .
The lawsuit , which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought in the early 1990s , contends that Texaco , which Chevron bought in 2001 , polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992 .
Chevron ’s general counsel , Charles James , disputed the findings of the report , saying the case had become a political issue in Ecuador .
Concept cars give automotive designers a chance to let their imaginations run wild , often with outlandish results .
But even by that measure , BMW has come up with something as strange as it is innovative – a shape - shifting car covered with fabric .
Instead of steel , aluminum or even carbon fiber , the GINA Light Visionary Model has a body of seamless fabric stretched over a movable metal frame that allows the driver to change its shape at will .
The car – which actually runs and drives – is a styling design headed straight for the [ BMW Museum in Munich ] ( javascript:if (!top.
pSpezial ) and so it will never see production , but building a practical car was n't the point .
Chris Bangle , head of design for BMW , says GINA allowed his team to " challenge existing principles and conventional processes . "
" It is in the nature of such visions that they do not necessarily claim to be suitable for series production , " company officials said in unveiling the car Tuesday .
" Rather , they are intended to steer creativity and research into new directions . "
Giving Bangle and his team that latitude to design so radical a car " helps to tap into formerly inconceivable , innovative potential " to push the boundaries of appearance and materials as well as functions and the manufacturing process , BMW says .
Bangle and is team actually built GINA – which stands for " Geometry and functions In ' N ' Adaptions " – six years ago , but BMW kept it under , er , wraps until Tuesday .
It 's built on the Z8 chassis and has a 4.4 - liter V8 and six - speed automatic transmission .
BMW says the fabric skin - polyurethane - coated Lycra - is resilient , durable and water resistant .
It 's stretched over an aluminum frame controlled by electric and hydraulic actuators that allow the owner to change the body shape .
Want a big spoiler on the back ?
Wider fenders ?
No problem .
" The drastic reinterpretation of familiar functionality and structure means that drivers have a completely new experience when they handle their car , " BMW says .
GINA has just four panels - the front hood , two sides and the rear deck .
The doors open in jack - knife fashion and are completely smooth when closed ; access to the engine is through a slit in the hood .
BMW says the shape of the body can be changed without slackening or damaging the fabric .
The fabric is opaque translucent so the taillights shine through , and small motors pull the fabric back to reveal the headlights .
The interior is equally innovative .
The steering wheel and gauges swing into place and the headrest rises from the seat once the driver is seated , making it easier to get in and out of the car .
BMW says GINA is built on a space frame that provides all the safety of a conventional car , but we suspect people - not to mention BMW 's lawyers and government regulators - would n't embrace fabric bodies .
Still , the company says GINA could influence the design of future Beemers .

" The Rudd Government has the bigger agenda , it 's got that mandate .
We have a much smaller agenda , but we have a qualified mandate , too , " he said .
" We went to the election with a whole range of policies , and some of those are going to be legislated .
" I 'm not here for a holiday ; I 'm not here to play shuttlecock . "
Senator Brown has an even bolder vision for the Greens .
" We 're not shy about saying our job is to replace the big parties in the long run , " he said .
The party would be " energetic and innovative " .
He wanted the Senate , whose traditional role is to review legislation passed by the House of Representatives , to become a " house of innovation " .
Senator Brown declared his party would play a radically different role to the Democrats .
" We 're not going to sit here waiting for the next bill to land on our desk to see if it 's got any mistakes in it , " he said .
" And we 're not here to adjudicate between the big parties .
It 's not about keeping the bastards honest .
We 're not a referee - we are on the field playing . "
One of Senator Brown 's first acts will be to seek to return to the Northern Territory and the ACT the right to pass laws to allow voluntary euthanasia , rights stripped away by the Howard government .
It overturned the Northern Territory 's voluntary euthanasia law in 1997 , and usurped the ACT 's right to pass similar legislation .
Senator Brown 's bill would restore those territories ' rights , and it would then be up to them if they wanted to pursue such legislation , he said .
He believed the bill would receive support in both houses in the new sittings .
The new Senate , with five Greens senators holding the balance of power with the South Australian independent Nick Xenophon and Family First 's Steve Fielding , will hold its first parliamentary sittings in late August .
The Greens will also introduce or amend laws to : * Restore the Racial Discrimination
Act , sidelined by former prime minister John Howard when he launched the Northern Territory intervention into indigenous communities .
* Impose a 25 cent levy on plastic bags and look at the possibility of national container legislation to curb the use of plastic bottles .
* Disallow the excise rise on so - called alcopops unless the Government pumps money into other anti-binge drinking measures .
* Allow " above the line " preferences in Senate elections to halt backroom preference deals .
" People themselves will decide where their preferences are going , " Senator Brown said .
The Greens would lobby " very hard " to pump billions of dollars into public education and increase pensions by between $ 30 and $ 100 a week , he said .
" I think that in the next budget next year , because of the Greens ' campaign , we will see a rise in the pension .
I 'll take any opportunity in the meantime to get a $ 30 - a- week lift in the single pension . "
What if you could make investments that result in healthy returns for you — and for the society around you ?
Investing is often seen as a selfish act — remember the famous “ Greed is good ” line in the film Wall Street ?
But in recent years , a new strategy for investing has emerged :
One that balances the needs of the investor with the health of our environment and society .
Does this sound like the kind of investment strategy you ’d like to pursue ?
If so , read on to learn all about ESG investment and ESG funds .
What Is ESG Investing ?
In ESG investing , the letters stand for Environmental , Social , and ( Corporate ) Governance .
“ Environmental ” is fairly self - explanatory .
It means that when investing , you look for companies that take steps to reduce their carbon footprint , rather than engaging in unfettered polluting .
“ Social ” applies to the way that a corporation in question handles issues like diversity and inclusion , and giving fair pay and benefits to every employee , from the lowest - ranked hire to the CEO .
Finally , “ Governance ” has to do with how a company is led .
Is there a full , diverse board of directors ?
Are there checks and balances on how many raises and bonuses that corporate executives receive ?
And is there general transparency around leadership decisions ?
If a company hits all three of these markers , then it is an excellent target for your ESG investing .
ESG Investing Is Profitable
Right now you might be thinking , “ Okay , ESG investing sounds like a noble pursuit — but I still need to make sure my investments are profitable . ”
Fortunately , ESG investing has proven itself as a viable investment strategy .
In 2018 , ESG investing grew to a $ 30 trillion market , and it ’s only expected to grow more from there .
And to better your returns , you can use a strategy called “ ESG integration . ”
That means you can incorporate ESG values into a broader investment strategy that also looks at things like annual returns and longterm growth potential .
Invest in ESG Funds
Do you want to get started with ESG investing , but are n’t sure where to start ?
If so , ESG funds might be the right option for you .
AN ESG fund is just like any other investment fund — but it ensures that every stock included in the fund will help better our environment , society , and / or corporate governance .
ESG
Investing are a great way to diversify your portfolio without compromising your values .
Ask your financial advisor about your ESG fund options to learn more .
Learn More About ESG Investing
Now that you ’ve gotten a primer about ESG investing , you may be itching to start investing in companies with strong environmental , social , and corporate governance values .
After all , we all have to share this one planet — so there ’s not much point to making a lot of money if you are n’t also helping to better our society .
Like any investment strategy , ESG investing is only as effective as you are educated .
So learn more about ESG investing — and investing in general — by reading the other helpful investment articles on our website .

Be a Part of Something You Believe In – This could be anything .
People may take an active role in their local city council , find refuge in religious faith , join a social club supporting causes they believe in , or find passion in their careers .
In each case the physiological outcome is the same .
They engage themselves in something they strongly believe in .
This engagement brings happiness and meaning into their lives .
Share Time with Friends and Family – A happy life is a life shared with friends and family .
The stronger the personal relationships are and the higher the frequency of interaction , the happier a person will be .
Reflect on the Good – Quite often people concentrate too much of their attention on negative outcomes and leave no time to positively reflect on their successes .
It ’s natural for a person to want to correct undesirable circumstances and focus closely on doing so , but there must be a healthy balance in the allocation of personal awareness .
It is important to mindfully reflect on the good while striving diligently to correct the bad .
A continuous general awareness of your daily successes can have a noticeably positive affect on your overall emotional happiness .
Exploit the Resources You DO Have Access To –
The average person is usually astonished when they see a physically handicap person show intense signs of emotional happiness .
How could someone in such a restricted physical state be so happy ?
The answer rests in how they use the resources they do have .
Stevie Wonder could n’t see , so he exploited his sense of hearing into a passion for music , and he now has 25 Grammy Awards to prove it .
Create Happy Endings Whenever Possible –
The power of endings is quite remarkable .
The end of any experience has a profound impact on a person ’s overall perception of the experience as a whole .
Think about reading a fairly well written , thought provoking novel .
Now imagine the ending totally sucks .
Even if the story was captivating up until the ending , would you still be happy recommending the novel to a friend ?
People always remember the ending .
If the ending is happy , the experience creates happiness .
Always tie loose ends , leave things on a good note , and create happy endings in your life whenever possible .
Use Personal Strengths to Get Things Done – Everyone possesses unique personal strengths .
We all have different talents and skill sets .
Emotional happiness comes naturally to those who use their strengths to get things done .
The state of completion always creates a sense of achievement .
If this achievement is based exclusively on your own personal ability to get the job done , the physiological rewards are priceless .
Savor the Natural Joy of Simple Pleasures – I ’ve said it before and I ’ll say it again , the best things in life are free .
They come in the form of simple pleasures and they appear right in front of you at various locations and arbitrary times .
They are governed by Mother Nature and situational circumstance and captured by mindful awareness .
It ’s all about taking a moment to notice the orange and pink sunset reflecting off the pond water as you hold hands with someone you love .
Noticing these moments and taking part in them regularly will bring unpredictable bursts of happiness into your life .

1- Google spends $ 72 million a year on employee meals
Link of the day - Who Is Shawn Casey ?
Is He For Real ?
Seventy - two million dollars a year -- that works out to about $ 7,530 per Googler ( a term Google uses to identify employees ) .
While the exact details vary depending on location ( the Google empire spans the globe ) , employees at Google 's California headquarters , aptly entitled the Googleplex , are welcome to at least two free meals a day from 11 different gourmet cafeterias .
As if that were n’t enough , another thing you did n’t know about Google is that in addition to the cafeterias , Google offers numerous snack bars that are chock - full of healthy morsels to munch on .
And that 's certainly not all .
Is your car in a bit of a rut ?
Not to worry ;
Google offers on - site car washes and oil changes .
The list of perks for working at Google is never - ending , making it no surprise that it 's considered the No. 1 place to work , offering : on - site haircuts , full athletic facilities , massage therapists , language classes , drop - off dry cleaning , day cares , and on - site doctors , just to name a few .
Oh , and if your dog is stuck at home and feeling a little lonely , just bring him to work -- Google does n't mind .
2- Google was originally called BackRub
100
3- Google loses $ 110 million a year through " I'm Feeling Lucky "
Like many other booming internet companies , Google has an interesting upbringing , one that is marked by a lowly beginning .
Google began as a research project in January 1996 by cofounder Larry Page , a 24 - year - old Ph.D. student at Standford University .
Page was soon joined by 23 - year - old Sergey Brin , another Ph.D. student , forming a duo that seemed destined for failure .
According to Google 's own corporate information , Brin and Page argued about every single topic they discussed .
This incessant arguing , however , may have been what spurred the duo to rethink web - searching and develop a novel strategy that ranked websites according to the number of backlinks ( i.e. , according to the number of web pages that linked back to a web page being searched ) , and not based on the number of times a specific search term appeared on a given web page , as was the norm .
Because of this unique strategy , another thing you did n't know about Google is that Page and Brin nicknamed the search engine BackRub .
Thankfully , in 1998 , Brin and Page dropped the sexually suggestive nickname , and came up with “ Google , ” a term originating from a common misspelling of the word " googol , " which refers to 10 The word “ google ” has become so common , it was entered into numerous dictionaries in 2006 , referring to the act of using the Google search engine to retrieve information via the internet .
There 's not much to see on Google 's main search page , and perhaps simplicity is one of the keys to Google 's success .
When searching Google , you are given two options : “ Google Search ” or “ I'm Feeling Lucky . ”
By clicking the former , you are given that familiar list of search results ; by clicking the latter , however , you are automatically redirected to the first search result , bypassing the search engine ’s results page .
Besides the fun factor , the idea behind the “ I'm Feeling Lucky ” feature is to provide the user with instant connection to the precise page they are searching for , thus saving them time that would normally be spent perusing endless search results .
Sounds harmless enough , right ?
Not so fast .
Because “ I'm Feeling Lucky ” bypasses all advertising , it is estimated that Google loses about $ 110 million per year in advertising - generated revenue .
So why in the world would any Fortune 500 company not patch such a gaping leak ?
" It 's possible to become too dry , too corporate , too much about making money .
I think what 's delightful about ' I'm Feeling Lucky ' is that it reminds you there are real people here , " Google Executive Marissa Mayer told Valleywag , an online tech - blog .
4- Google has a sense of humor
5- Google scans your e-mails
Google also offers full language support for Pig Latin , Klingon and even Elmer Fudd .
Anyone else still feeling lucky ?
Try typing , “ French military victories ” and clicking “ I'm Feeling Lucky . ”
Behold the result .
Some might remember the “ miserable failure ” fiasco when one typed those words and clicked “ I'm Feeling Lucky , ” and they were instantly connected to a biography of President George W. Bush on the White House website .
Now , before you jump to conclusions , this trick -- which no longer works -- was carried out by members of the online community through the art of “ Google bombing . ”
Google bombing works because of Google 's backlink search strategy .
Nothing in life is perfect -- or without controversy -- and Google is no exception .
Google scans your e-mails ( at Gmail ) through a process called “ content extraction . ”
All incoming and outgoing e-mail is scanned for specific keywords to target advertising to the user .
The process has brewed quite a storm of controversy , but Google has yet to back down on its stance .
Google has remained similarly headstrong about other criticisms ; in an attempt to remain partisan to local governments , Google removes or does not include information from its services in compliance with local laws .
Perhaps the most striking example of this is Google 's adherence to the internet censorship policies of China ( at Google.cn ) so as not to bring up search results supporting the independence movement of Tibet and Taiwan , or any other information perceived to be harmful to the People 's Republic of China .
Google Street has further been cited for breaching personal privacy .
The service provides high - resolution street - view photos from around the world and has , on numerous occasions , caught people committing questionable acts .
Moving from street to satellite , Google Earth has also come under fire from several Indian state governments about the security risks posed by the details from Google Earth 's satellite imaging .
When all is said and done , there are a lot of criticisms about Google and these few examples merely scratch the surface .
Um , Google does the searching -- anytime , and every time , you search for something on the internet .
It 's hard to think of another search engine ever supplanting our beloved Google , but it 's anyone 's guess as to how the internet will work in the future .
Maybe you 'll just have to think of something and it will appear .
Who knows ?
Try Googling it .

Earlier this month , the PC adventure game Limbo of the Lost came under heavy fire for apparently copying artwork from other games like The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion and Thief : Deadly Shadows .
When the initial story broke , the game 's US publisher issued a statement saying it had no idea about the improprieties , and that attempts to contact developer Majestic Studios had been unsuccessful as the team was on break after finishing up the game .
The developers apparently came back to work today , as a source connected to Majestic issued to GameSpot the following statement from the studio :
" In response to the shocking notification that some alleged unauthorized copyrighted materials submitted by sources external to the development team have been found within the PC game Limbo of the Lost , we ( the development team ) have given our consent and full cooperation to both publishers who are recalling all units from all territories immediately .
Please be assured that we do not condone in anyway the use of unauthorized copyrighted materials and if we had been made aware earlier , we would of course have ceased development of the product and rectified the issue prior to the publication process .
To the best of our knowledge no one at Majestic , [ European publisher ] G2 Games or [ North American publisher Tri Synergy , Inc. ] knew about this infringement and knowingly played any part in it .
We can only apologise to all regarding this issue , as a team we are shocked and mortified regarding these events and we continue to work with said publishers in order to rectify the issue .
Limbo of the Lost is a point - and - click adventure game in which players guide protagonist Captain Benjamin Spooner Briggs as he explores the realm of Limbo and The Keep of Lost Souls at its heart .
Dal Washington Post : “ La proposta di Hillary Clinton di abolire la tassa di 18,4 cenetesimi a gallone sulla benzina per quest ’estate è criticata dagli economisti i quali osservano che quest ’idea , avanzata inizialmente da John McCain , sarebbe controproducente .
Lo sgravio fiscale incentiverebbe i consumi in un periodo in cui l’offerta è scarsa .
Inoltre le compagnie petrolifere per le strozzature dell ’ offerta non ridurrebbero di altrettanto il prezzo alla pompa e aumenterebbero i loro margini di profitto ” .
C’è chi ( come il nostro columnist Paul Krugman ) continua a sostenere che Hillary Clinton , per quanto non particolarmente simpatica , sia più concreta , più di sinistra , meno demagogica del suo rivale Barack Obama .
Ecco un motivo di riflessione .
Con la promessa di tagliare l’accise sulla benzina in un colpo solo la Clinton ottiene tre risultati : 1 ) fa una promessa demagogica agli automobilisti americani , già oggi i più “ viziati ” del mondo per la bassa pressione fiscale sui carburanti ; 2 ) va a caccia di simpatie tra le compagnie petrolifere , come se non fossero già state abbastanza coccolate dalla famiglia Bush ; 3 ) si allinea per l’ennesima volta con McCain contro Obama ( quest ’ultimo ha condannato l’idea dello sgravio sulla benzina ) .
Se tanto ci dà tanto , l’America sotto la leadership di Hillary rischia di non offrire un luminoso esempio di lungimiranza a paesi come la Cina e l’India , ai quali noi occidentali continuiamo a predicare la necessità impellente di risparmiare energia e ridurre l’inquinamento .
In quanto agli europei , si preparino a una dura battaglia per il Kyoto 2 …
Browse column FRESNO , CA -- Writing a column on the military history of Tibet seemed like a good idea in the good old days , a week ago , before I started actually trying to research it .
I ’ve never , ever had a harder time finding decent info on a topic .
One reason is sheer shame ; the Brits , for instance , do n’t want anybody to know they invaded Tibet in 1904 and slaughtered a whole bunch of Tibetans for no reason except they were bored .
But some of the stuff on Tibetan military history is just so damn weird it made me feel like that scene in Ghostbusters where Rick Moranis gets possessed by some ancient demon and starts ranting : “ During the rectification of the Vuldronaii the Traveller came as a very large and moving Torb .
Then of course in the third reconciliation of the last of the Meketrex supplicants they chose a new form for him , that of a Sloar .
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar that day I can tell you . ”
I always liked that last bit , “ … I can tell you . ”
Gives that human touch , especially from a five - foot - nothing little dweeb like Moranis .
But let me tell you , that story about the Torb and the Shubs was light reading compared to what I ’ve been digging through to research medieval Tibetan military history .
Here ’s an example from Karl - Heinz Everding ’s lively little article , “ The Mongol States and their Struggle for Dominance over Tibet in the 13th century ” : “ … The troops of approximately ten myriarchies of Central Tibet ( Tib. dbus gtsang ) marched toward the [ Stod Hor — the Mongol army , I think — GB ] .
They met on the dpal mo dpal thang .
[ Oh , that thang ! — GB Sorry , could n’t resist . ]
The ten myriarchies of Tibetan troops defeated the many hundreds of thousands of Stod Hor troops .
As proof of having killed many thousand Hor , they cut off only the right ears [ of the dead ] and put them into many donkey loads ( Tib. ‘ drel khal ) .
Having made Gad du Rin chen and the Dgon pa dbon prisoner and having taking [ sic ] them along , the ears started stinking .
After they had exposed them to the sun on a cool plain , the stone enclosure where the [ smell ] disappeared , is today known as ‘ stone enclosure of the ears ’ ( Tib. Rna ba ’i lhas ) . ”
And that ’s one of the lighter bits .
If life has been too easy and fun for you lately , you ’re welcome to read the whole article in a volume with the catchy , original title of “ Tibet : Past and Present . ”
It ’s a funny thing about writing columns on war : some pretty insignificant conflicts have tons of stuff written about them , and others , big and important wars , get no press at all .
Like when I had to write about the Algerian civil wars , there was nothing any good about them anywhere .
Sometimes it ’s a language problem , like with Algeria , where anything that might be any use was in French or Arabic .
That was part of the problem reading up on Tibet , because I do n’t read Chinese and there ’s no translation program for Chinese that seems to work .
( If anybody knows of one , let me know . )
But there ’s a much bigger problem : Tibetans are steppe people , inland Asian people , which makes them alien to us Western sea-oriented cultures , just like Mongols are alien to us .
I found that out back when I was a huge fan of the Mongols — well , I still am , but I ’m content to worship the Khans from afar now ; back then I wanted to learn everything about them .
So I checked out a book called “ The Secret History of the Mongols , ” supposedly written by a tame scribe taking dictation from the Khans ’ family genealogist himself .
That book defeated me as one - sidedly as the British defeated the Tibetans in their 1904 .
That ’s right , by the way , the Brits invaded Tibet just a hundred - odd years ago , though nobody seems to remember .
I ’ll get to that later .
My point here is that after I read the “ Secret History of the Mongols ” I knew less than I did before .
Or maybe I just knew once and for all that much as I admire the Mongol warriors , I ’ll never really understand how they thought .

I ’m sure if you are considering installing solar panels , the most burning question on your mind is :
How much do solar panels cost , and how much profit and energy savings will I make ?
So
Here is the top UK guide which will cover answers to all those questions , and more .
Including real world quotes from actual contractors .
If you just want a quick outline , here are the main points :
Solar panels cost for your home on average £ 1500 to £ 8500 depending on power output , quality and size .
Solar panel costs are continuing to fall inline with Swanson law ( 20 % decline for every doubling of shipped volume ) .
This translates into a decline of 10 % a year since 1980 , and a 61 % drop from 2010 prices .
Solar savings can be increased by adding a battery storage system .
Which stores power generated during the middle of the day , when grid costs are highest .
For use in the evening when most energy is used .
Installing solar panels can give you a £ 120 per year + profit for a 4 kw system , along with a 50 % saving on your electric bill .
Government subsidies are fixed for 20 years , but you need to act quickly to take advantage .
Solar panes can take an average of 17 years to break even for a 5 kw system , and 23 years for a 3 kw system .

Solar Panel Costs for Home Use
It ’s tough to find accurate solar panel prices online , there are many reasons for this .
Every install can vary in time by as much as 70 % , every roof has a different pitch and access route which can speed up , or slow things down .
The type of panels , roof material and grid connection can also play a part .
However :
That ’s not good enough .
So we surveyed 11 local and national solar panel installers for prices , the most expensive and cheapest removed for accuracy and the remaining 9 were averaged to get the following price :
Example Quote
Job Spec 16 solar panels ( 4kW ) , inverter , installation , grid connection , 25 - year warranty .
No shading , SW facing roof in Oxford .
Price Highest Price £ 8100.00 Lowest Price £ 5950.00 Average Price £ 6334.00
You might be wondering :
What about prices for other sized systems ?
The good news is we have also obtained ball park prices for 1 – 4 kW home installations , and 10 – 100 kW commercial systems below .
Most residential or domestic solar panel arrays range between 1 and 4 kW , with some going up to 10kW .
These still vary in size depending on the brand and installation method , but the following includes average rates per system .
System Size Estimated Cost Estimated Output Tons of Co2 Saved Estimated First Year Returns Estimated Profit over 20 Years Roof Space Required 1 Kw £ 1,500 – £ 3,200 850 kWh 10 £ 70 £ 0 8sq m 2Kw £ 3,200 – £ 4,800 1,700 kWh 20 £ 90 £ 250 14 sq. m 3Kw £ 5,000 – £ 6,000 2,550 kWh 30 £ 100 £ 500 21 sq. m 4Kw £ 6,000 – £ 8,500 3,400 kWh 40 £ 120 £ 600 28 sq. m

Quick Considerations .
Why are Solar Panel Prices Going Down ?
The cost of solar panels is constantly going down .
In fact , data shows that prices have dropped nearly 45 % year over year since 2008 , for a total cost reduction of more than 70 % .
For example , in 2010 , a 4 kW array cost around £ 15,000 to install , and the current average in 2017 is right around £ 6,500 .
The same applies across all levels of solar , as prices have reduced dramatically in the industry .
This price reduction is mostly a result of advancing technology making it easier and more affordable to produce the semiconducting materials which absorb sunlight .
This also benefits buyers in the fact that technological advances are making modern solar panels more efficient at converting sunlight to PV power , resulting in lowered prices , and higher production .
Other factors contributing to reduced costs of solar panels include lowered VAT , lowered production costs , and larger companies , who can produce panels more affordably .
Government schemes , which provide incentives for people to purchase solar , also increase demand , which , in turn , lowers pricing .
International Renewable Energy , Renew Economy , and Deutsche Bank all predict that the cost of solar will continue to drop , by as much as 40 % in the next two years .
With a 40 % decrease in the cost of solar by the end of 2017 , solar will achieve grid parity in about 80 per cent of the world , including the UK , meaning that it is profitable or break even , even without government incentives like the FIT program .

Could Solar Power The Whole UK ?
This report notes that a 100 - mile - by - 100 - mile solar thermal installation in the American Southwest could meet the entire US energy needs .
With the UK using 10 x less energy , that would mean to power the whole nation only a 10 × 10 square mile would be required .
How Do I Make Money with Solar ?
You can earn money with solar in three ways .
You save money on your electric bill by replacing some of the energy you would otherwise purchase with solar PV .
The government also pays for solar power you use and do not use through the Feed in Tariff .
How much you earn depends on the FIT rate you qualify for , your grid sell back rate , and how much you save on your energy bills .
Back to top
How Much Can I Save with Solar Panels ?
Saving money is one of the main reasons that many people chose to install solar on their homes and businesses .
While not the main goal of using solar , it is something to consider .
Importantly , the exact rates will vary depending on your homes suitability for solar , the size of the array , weather you have chosen the best solar panels , and what you chose to do with the energy provided .
The following estimates are therefore just that , but do offer a good overview of what you could save .
One very important consideration is that earnings can change a great deal depending on which FIT rate you qualify for .
For example , the January 1st 87 % cut to the FIT rate affected earnings will a great deal , but you can still earn an average of a 4.8 % return on solar over 20 years .
Source Before Dec. 2015 After Jan 2016 Generation Tariff £ 468 £ 61 Export Tariff £ 79 £ 79 Electricity Bill Savings £ 126 £ 125 Total per year £ 673 £ 266
Electricity Bill – Saving money on your electricity bill is the easiest way to save using solar PV .
You generate solar power with your array , direct it into your home power system using an inverter to change it from DC to AC , and use it to run your lights , refrigerator , washing machine , etc .
One consideration is that with a standard grid tie in system with no power storage , you only provide your own power during the day .
This can save you around £ 126 per year with a 4 Kw system .
With a battery power storage system , you can save more by utilizing more power , but you will be spending more when you purchase the system .
FIT Rate – The FIT rate is the government incentive for using solar power .
You are paid for power that you generate and use , whether you sell it back to the grid or not .
This rate varies a great deal depending on your EPC rating , the size of your system , and when you sign up for the FIT rate .
The 2017 FIT rate in 2015 is around 4.39 p per kWh , which translates into £ 61 per year with a 3 - 4 kW system ( or about £ 404 per year including all deductions , and reduced electric usage ) .
Export Tariff –
You can also get paid for the energy that you sell back into the grid .
While rates are low , you can get around 4.85 pence per kWh as of 2017 , for an average annual earnings of £ 79 per year with a 4 kW system .
This rate is not expected to change , but may go up as the cost of electricity rises .
Back to top
What About with Reduced FIT Rates ?
Most homeowners will be looking at earnings of about 4.8 % over 20 years , although some panels might not break even until well after the 20 year mark .
However , with the falling costs of solar panels , the price of a 4Kw system only has to drop by some 14 per cent to achieve a break - even rate with no FIT program .
With predictions suggesting that solar panels could drop as much as 14 % by the end of 2017 , that ’s already highly likely .

Would you benefit from solar panels ?
Answer a few simple questions and find out !
What is the Likely Return on Investment for Installing Solar ?
Depending on when you install solar panels , you may see a large return , or a modest one .
The average return for a smaller install can be in the range of £ 2000 over 20 years .
With larger systems giving profits in the 10’s of the thousands .
It ’s really does depend on your location , insolation levels , type and size of panel , shading any other factors .
If you need an accurate figure , the best thing to do is book an appointment with a local company .

Is Solar Panel Financing a Good Idea ?
If you do n’t have money for installing a solar panel array on your own , you can get funding from a variety of places .
In some cases , you may qualify for government grants such as the Green Deal Financing and assistance , assistance from organizations , and much more .
Financing can be a great idea , because it allows you to purchase a system that you would n’t otherwise be able to afford .
However , you should pay close attention to interest rates to ensure that you are getting a good deal .
Back to top
Are Free Solar Panel Schemes Worth It ?
Free solar panel schemes are popular , and plentiful , and for good reason .
They offer ‘ free ’ solar panel installations to homes , allow them to use the solar , but keep all of the FIT generated earnings .
This will translate into an average of £ 125 saved per year for a 4 kW system , but no more .
These savings will go up as the cost of electricity and fuel raises .
You also wo n’t own the system , and will have to sell it with the house or home .
These systems are advantageous in that you do n’t have to spend anything to get it , and that you can save a small amount of money .
However , if FIT rates go up , you will not benefit from them .
However , if you do n’t have the capital to invest in a solar array but still want to help the environment , a free solar panel system may be a good option .
You can see if solar panels are still worth it in 2017 here .
Back to top
What Size Solar Panel Array Should I Get ?
The number of panels on your roof should depend on the available space on your roof , your energy needs , and your budget .
The more panels you install , the more quickly you can earn money back , because you generate more power .
However , most homes only have enough space for a 4 kW system , which is about 15 panels .
A 10Kw system is usually made up of 40 panels , and requires considerably more space .
If you do n’t know the number of square meters available on your roof , many solar panel installers will come out and offer a free inspection , with a recommendation for the number of panels .
You should also pay attention to the brand , because some panels are more efficient than others .
For example , a solar panel brand that is £ 500 more expensive may generate as much as 14 % more energy , which adds up considerably over time .
Back to top
Is My Roof Suitable for Solar Panels ?
The easiest way to find out if your roof is suitable for solar panels is to ask for an EPC inspection .
You are required to have an EPC inspection in order to qualify for the FIT rate , as the EPC rating determines which rate you qualify for .
Some solar panel installers will reimburse you for the cost , or provide it as a free service .
If you have a D rating or higher , then your roof is suitable for solar .
While a south facing roof has the highest potential for solar PV generation , you do not need one to generate power .
Instead , you want an unshaded roof that gets around 2 hours or more of direct sunlight per day .
East and west facing roofs produce about 15 % less power than a south facing roof .
Back to top
How Long do Solar Panels Last ?
Depending on the brand , solar panels might last anywhere from 25 to 50 years .
Most modern solar panels have generation guarantees of 80 - 90 % efficiency from factory efficiency at 25 years , meaning that they will continue to produce power after 25 years , but the rate will gradually decrease .
Find out more about solar panel efficiency .
For this reason , most PV installations , and most solar panels , have a warranty or guarantee of 25 years .

Solar Panels in Scotland
The same feed - in tariff applies in the Scotland as it does for England , however the government is far more aggressive and ambitious with it ’s adoption strategy .
Costs in Scotland are the same as across the UK .
Similar to Northern Ireland , Scotland is looking to get a lot of its power from offshore wind , as well as onshore wind power .
The country has also been a leader in wave and tidal energy , recently launching the world ’s largest tidal turbine , launching a couple of other wave energy devices in the past year , and leading in this alternative energy sector for years .
“ Scotland has unrivalled green energy resources and our new national target to generate 80 percent of electricity needs from renewables by 2020 will be exceeded by delivering current plans for solar panels , wind , wave and tidal generation , ” First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said .
“ I ’m confident that by 2025 we will produce at least 100 percent of our electricity needs from renewables alone , and together with other sources it will enable us to become a net exporter of clean , green energy . ”
Even with lower solar irradiance and average temperatures than say , the South West of England profits are still a very real possibility in all areas .

What are the Risks of Installing Solar ?
Installing solar panels is relatively low risk because with no moving parts , low cost of cleanup , and high life expectancy , they require very little maintenance .
While you should invest in cleaning your panels regularly , and you may have to replace your inverter every 5 - 10 years ( choosing an inverter with a 10 - year warranty reduces risks ) , there are no real risks associated with installing solar , unless you do the installation yourself , or the wiring is performed incorrectly .
Solar panels are an investment , but they do provide returns , in cash and for the environment in the form of reduced Co2 , reduced usage of non-renewable energy sources , and less consumption of resources .
This , in turn , benefits you as well as the earth , providing cleaner air , a healthier ecosystem , and in some cases , more money in your pocket .
At the least , you will reduce your energy bills for the foreseeable future , while doing something good for the environment .
The best way to make sure you are getting a good deal on your solar panels is to compare quotes to get the best rate .
This allows you to make your money back as quickly as possible , without having to choose lower quality panels .

Recently we posted an article announcing the production of a portable solar charger for airplane avionics .
At the end of that article we asked if you thought airplanes could one day be powered by solar .
Since then we discovered a whole slew of existing solar airplane concepts and projects that we thought we ’d share with you .
Click through the following links to visit the related websites .
At the bottom of this article you ’ll find another opportunity to vote your opinion and leave your comments about the feasibility of solar powered flight .
The Helios Prototype solar - electric flying wing was one of several remotely piloted aircraft , also known as uninhabited aerial vehicles or UAVs , that were developed as technology demonstrators under the now - concluded Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology ( ERAST ) project .
Prior to its loss in an in - flight mishap in June 2003 , the Helios Prototype set a world altitude record for propeller - driven aircraft of almost 97,000 feet .
Pathfinder was first developed for a now - cancelled classified government program in the early 1980 ’s to develop a high - altitude , long - endurance aircraft for surveillance purposes .
Known as the HALSOL ( for High - Altitude SOLar ) aircraft , its eight electric motors — later reduced to six — were first powered by batteries .
After that project was cancelled , the aircraft was placed in storage for 10 years before being resurrected for a brief program under the auspices of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization ( BMDO ) in 1993 .
With the addition of small solar arrays , five low - altitude checkout flights were flown under the BMDO program at NASA Dryden in the fall of 1993 and early 1994 on a combination of solar and battery power .
The Centurion is a lightweight , solar - powered , remotely piloted flying wing aircraft that is demonstrating the technology of applying solar power for long - duration , high - altitude flight .
It is considered to be a prototype technology demonstrator for a future fleet of solar - powered aircraft that could stay airborne for weeks or months on scientific sampling and imaging missions or while serving as telecommunications relay platforms .
Although it shares many of the design concepts of the Pathfinder , the Centurion has a wingspan of 206 feet , more than twice the 98 - foot span of the original Pathfinder and 70 - percent longer than the Pathfinder - Plus ’ 121 - foot span .
The “ Hy - Bird ” project plans to fly around the world with a 100 % clean electric airplane powered only by renewable energies : solar energy and hydrogen .
The goal is to design an airplane , which will use only renewable energies with no greenhouse gas emission , and , to decrease dramatically noise pollution , which airplanes do normally engender .
Indeed , photovoltaic cells affixed on the wing and on the horizontal tail will supply sufficient energy for the take off and for on - board power supply .
Besides , a fuel cell will fuel the aircraft for cruise flight .
An electric engine ( more silent than heat engines ) will propel Hy - Bird .

After four years of research , studies , calculations and simulations , the Solar Impulse project has entered a concrete phase with the construction of an initial prototype with a 61 - metre wingspan , referred to by its registration number “ HB - SIA ” .
Its mission is to verify the working hypotheses in practice and to validate the selected construction technologies and procedures .
If the results are conclusive , it could make a 36 - hour flight – the equivalent of a complete day - night - day cycle – in 2009 without any fuel .

Eric Raymond ’s dream of a solar powered airplane began in 1979 , when Larry Mauro demonstrated his solar powered ultralight glider , named SOLAR RISER .
Eric began construction of his design in late 1986 .
Progress was slow until 1988 , when support was found in Japan .
With the help of Sanyo and several other corporations the SUNSEEKER was test flown at the end on 1989 as a glider .
The motor and prop mechanism were not satisfactory , so an A.C. brushless motor and a folding prop were installed .
After many long test flights , a series of flights were initiated across the country .
During August of 1990 , The SUNSEEKER crossed the country in 21 flights , with 121 hours in the air .
The Sky - Sailor would be carried to Mars in a small aeroshell that would be attached to a carrier spacecraft .
Upon reaching the red planet , the aeroshell would be released for direct entry into the Martian atmosphere .
From this point , the operations could be decomposed in different phases .
It can cover a distance of ~ 1700 km during a 12 - hour period .
This allows the airplane to reach many different areas of interest .
The exploration mission will end when the airplane crashes normally due to the batteries life cycle and dust deposition on solar panels .
The SoLong is an electric - powered UAV ( unmanned aerial vehicle ) that collects solar energy from photo - voltaic arrays laminated into its wings .
It uses energy so efficiently that it can fly all night on energy it gathers from the sun during the day .
Remaining aloft for two nights is the milestone for sustainable flight .
One night is possible just by discharging the batteries , but two or more nights means that the plane has to fully recoup and store the energy used at night while flying in the sunlight the following day .
Once that is achieved , the cycle can repeat continually , and keep the plane airborne indefinitely .
Called the Zephyr , it ’s an aircraft that can fly continuously using nothing but solar power and “ low drag aerodynamics ” .
The combination of solar panels on the upper wing surface and rechargeable batteries allows Zephyr to be flown for many weeks and even months .
The first flight trial of the Zephyr were conducted recently by QinetiQ in White Sands Missile Range , New Mexico .
Two aircraft were flown for four and a half and six hours respectively , the maximum flight times permitted under range restrictions .
A Venus exploration aircraft , sized to fit in a small aeroshell for a “ Discovery ” class scientific mission , has been designed and analyzed at the NASA Glenn Research Center .
For an exploratory aircraft to remain continually illuminated by sunlight , it would have to be capable of sustained flight at or above the wind speed , about 95 m/ sec at the cloud - top level .
The analysis concluded that , at typical flight altitudes above the cloud layer ( 65 to 75 km above the surface ) , a small aircraft powered by solar energy could fly continuously in the atmosphere of Venus .
At this altitude , the atmospheric pressure is similar to pressure at terrestrial flight altitudes .
John Edwards said it ’s over and sent a signal to the Clinton campaign :
John Edwards , a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , cautioned Sunday that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton “ has to be really careful that she ’s not damaging our prospects ” by staying in the contest against Senator Barack Obama .
Jed has the video .
That ’s really wise advice .
But , Clinton ’s spokesman , Howard Wolfson , is still in a fighting mood , apparently .
Puffing his chest out on FOX today , Wolfson delivered some classic fifth grade school yard taunts :
But Howard Wolfson , a senior Clinton adviser , struck a feisty note on Fox , saying that if Mr. Obama wanted Mrs. Clinton out of the race , there was a simple way to ensure that : “ Beat her .
Beat her in West Virginia , beat her in Puerto Rico , beat her in Kentucky . ”
Mrs. Clinton , of New York , is favored in those coming contests ; Mr. Obama holds an edge in the others , in Oregon , Montana and South Dakota .
That would almost be funny if it was n’t so pathetic .
The Clinton campaign is rife with bullies who threw their weight around , yelling at people , screaming at people .
I experienced that twice myself early on , before I supported anyone and just wanted a Democrat who could win .
( And , trust me , I had very few interactions with Clinton staffers . )
There ’s nothing better than seeing the bullies get their butts kicked .
And , that ’s exactly what ’s happening now .
So , Clinton and her entire staff should heed the words of John Edwards .
The Clintons and their vaunted brain trust screwed up their own campaign .
They do n’t need to inflict their ruinous behavior on Obama and the rest of the Democrats anymore .
And while we ’re on the subject of Clinton campaign people , the best line of the day , did n’t come from anyone on the Sunday shows .
It came from Al Giordano :
( CNN ) --
The security firm Blackwater USA is starting to resume normal operations in Iraq after a hiatus sparked by concerns among Iraqi and U.S. government officials over its actions .
Blackwater USA contractors secure the site of a roadside bombing in Baghdad in July 2005 .
Tom Casey , a State Department spokesman , said on Friday that Blackwater and two other security firms that provide protection for U.S. diplomats in Iraq are resuming civilian convoys on a case - by - case basis .
All Blackwater USA operations in Iraq will be back to normal on Saturday , a highly placed industry source told CNN on Friday .
A deadly shooting incident on Sunday prompted the Iraqi government to bar the firm from operating .
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad has been prohibiting staff - member trips by land outside the Green Zone amid investigations into the incident .
The Iraqi government has said as many as 20 civilians were killed by gunfire from Blackwater USA contractors who were guarding a U.S. diplomatic convoy .
Iraqi officials dispute the U.S. claim that the guards were responding to an attack .
The Blackwater employees involved in the incident are still in Iraq , but those who fired weapons -- about a third of the guards -- were " standing down , " said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack .
Outside experts may be brought in to help review the " protective service details " in Baghdad , McCormack said .
Such details usually have 15 to 20 guards .
The " full , complete review " would look at rules of engagement and overall operations , with consultation with lawyers over what authority contractors operate under , he said .
Sunday 's shooting has created new tension between the U.S. and Iraqi governments .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice expressed regret about the incident in a phone call to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki and promised an open and transparent probe into what happened .
Watch heavily armed private contractors at work in Iraq »
" It is extremely important to recognize we are doing important work ( in Iraq ) .
We need protection for our diplomats and I am quite certain with good will we can resolve this , " Rice said .
The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday the creation of a joint commission to examine issues of security and safety in the aftermath of the shooting incident .
The commission , co-chaired by an American and an Iraqi with equal representation from both countries , will receive the results of the State Department investigation and the separate Iraqi investigation , Casey said .
The commission will look at the Sunday incident and the broader issue of " personal security details " and the use of private contractors to provide security in Iraq , he said .
The commission " is not an investigative body doing field forensics on this particular matter , " Casey said .
" The focus of this is to look not only at that incident but at the broader question ... and help us come up with joint recommendations . "
In describing the actions of the private guards for the State Department in Iraq , McCormack said that since January 2007 there have been 1,800 movements outside the Green Zone .
" It is only a small fraction , a very small fraction , that has involved the use of force , " he said .
Security duties of companies encompass certain geographic areas in Iraq : Blackwater guards State Department officials in the Baghdad region , Tricanopy operates in the south , and Dyncorp in the north .

All About Blackwater USA • Iraq War
One in eight U.S. high school biology teachers presents creationism or intelligent design in a positive light in the classroom , a new survey shows , despite a federal court 's recent ban against it .
And a quarter of the nation 's high school biology teachers say they devoted at least one or two classroom hours to the topics , with about half presenting it favorably and half presenting it as an invalid alternative .
Those results are part of a nationally representative , random sample of 939 teachers who filled out surveys between March 5 , 2007 , and May 1 , 2007 on questions concerning the teaching of evolution .
The figures have a 3 percent margin of error .
The research , funded by the National Science Foundation , also revealed that between 12 percent and 16 percent of the nation 's biology teachers are creationists , and about one in six of them have a " young Earth " orientation , which means they believe that human beings were created by God in their present form within the past 10,000 years .
Scientists , on the other hand , agree that humans evolved from a common primate ancestor in a process that stretches back tens of millions of years .
The theory of evolution on which this is based is one of the most well - supported theories in science .
By design
The highly publicized Dover ruling in 2005 banned the teaching of intelligent design in Pennsylvania public school science classes , and there have been many other legal victories at the state and local level for the teaching of evolution , but there is a disconnect between these rulings , science and what really happens in high school biology classes , said study leader Michael B. Berkman , a political scientist at Penn State University .
In the end , it is teachers , more than court cases , that determine what is presented in science class , the new research suggests .
" The status of evolution in the biology and life sciences curriculum remains highly problematic and threatened , " writes Berkman and his colleagues , including Eric Plutzer and Julianna Sandell Pacheco , both of Penn State , in a peer - reviewed essay on the survey in the latest issue of the journal PLoS Biology .
Berkman and Plutzer have a longstanding project that focuses on the responsiveness of school districts to public opinion .
" This issue [ the teaching of evolution ] is particularly interesting in that context because the public opinion on it is in many ways so far away from where the experts are , " Berkman told LiveScience .
For instance , about 38 percent of Americans would prefer that creationism be taught instead of evolution , according to a 2005 poll by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
Hottest button
Other details of the survey results :
- The majority of biology teachers spend between 3 and 15 hours on evolution , which the National Academy of Sciences considers to be the most important concept of biology .
- The majority of teachers spend no more than five hours on human evolution .
- Only 23 percent of teachers strongly agreed that evolution is the unifying theme for their biology or life sciences courses , though the majority of teachers see evolution as essential to high school biology .
- The more biology or life sciences classes taken in college by a teacher , the more evolution they taught .
" This is the hottest of the hot buttons , " Berkman said of the teaching of evolution .
Even the strongest legal ruling " still gives boards of education , school districts and especially teachers considerable leeway . "
Victory in the courts and state standards will not ensure that evolution is included in high school science classes , Berkman and his colleagues conclude .
A bigger impact would come by focusing on certification standards for high school biology teachers , such as requiring all teachers to complete a course in evolutionary biology .
Berkman said he did n't know if this was likely to happen , but he hopes the new research " captures the attention of people who make decisions on that , science educators as well as scientists . "
( Natural News ) Children taking stimulants as a treatment for attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are 20 percent more likely to visit a doctor with heart - related symptoms , according to a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Florida and published in the journalResearchers examined the records on 55,000 children between the ages of 3 and 20 who had undergone treatment for ADHD using central nervous system stimulants between 1994 and 2004 .
Their health profiles were compared with those of nearly two million other children in the Florida Medicaid database , making the current study the largest ever on the safety of ADHD drugs .
Children taking stimulants were 20 percent more likely than other children to visit the emergency room or doctor 's office with heart - related symptoms like a racing heartbeat .
The researchers did not find any difference in the rates of hospitalization or death from heart - related causes among children taking stimulants .
But other drugs in the methamphetamine class , to which ADHD drugs Ritalin and Adderall belong , have indeed been known to cause serious cardiac side effects .
In 2006 , the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended adding a black - box warning to ADHD drugs about cardiovascular risks .
This is the strongest warning that the FDA can place on a drug before pulling it from the market .
But the FDA 's Pediatric Advisory Committee urged against such a warning , saying that the cardiac side effects were not serious and could be easily managed by changing the size or timing of drug doses .
The University of Florida researchers noted that more than 25 percent of people who used stimulants in the study were also found to be taking antidepressants or antipsychotics , which have also been shown to affect the cardiovascular system .
They said that more research is needed into circumstances that might predispose children to heart trouble , and to determine if ADHD medications can exacerbate those problems .

Phoenix is on target to become the first spacecraft to land in the arctic regions of Mars , and perhaps provide us insight into the possibility of sustainability of life ( past , present and future ) on the red planet .
On the projected date of May 25th , the Phoenix spacecraft will be the first lander to set down in the northern arctic regions of our friendly neighbor planet , Mars and will be the f irst to be able to evaluate the polar icecaps .
The relatively low cost $ 325 million mission launched August 2007 and has traveled about 422 million miles ( 679 million km ) to reach Mars .
The projected time of landing is 7:53 p.m. EDT ( 2353 GMT ) on May 25th , 2008
Even after traveling 422 million miles , the last 7 minutes during its atmosphere entry and landing will be the most critical portion of the flight ’s success ( obviously )
Space.com and Nasa.gov has put out two videos that provides an excellent overview of the mission and landing .
Edit ( 05/25/08 ) : Successfully landed on Mars !

Our friend Jason has a beekeeping hobby .
Yesterday he invited us to come watch him " split the hive " and even though we were n't 100 % sure what that meant , we were pretty sure we'd get to see a beehive up close .
We could n't resist .
When we got there , he and the rest of the hive team ( his mom and a cool bee guru friend of theirs ) were all decked out in serious bee - garb which was a little off - putting .
We were told we'd be ok as long as we did n't wear black ( which for us is actually really hard , but we found some white shirts and were feeling pretty brave ) .
We got briefed that the way to survive being around a hive without protection is to wear white and move very slowly , and remain calm even when they come buzzing around you .
No sweat .
I set up the tripod and got within about 10 meters and started shooting away .
Evidently this " hive splitting " thing is a what beekeepers do when their hive has become overpopulated .
In the wild , bees will do all by themselves : A big group will just suddenly pack up and fly off together to set up a new hive someplace else ( this is what swarms are by the way ) .
The trick with doing it yourself is that you have to end up with a queen in both the new hive and the old hive .
I 'm not sure why , but apparently the current queen needs to stay with the original hive and a brand new queen can be introduced to the ' new ' hive .
But to make sure you are n't moving the queen , she has to be located .
And based on what we saw , that 's what 90 % of " splitting the hive " amounts to : a big queen hunt .
There are over 10 k bees in a hive and one queen and she 's not that different looking ( her ass is larger and a slightly different color ) .
The first step in finding her is to divide the original hive in half by putting a kind of queen - screen in there that everybody but the queen can slip through ( she ca n't fit on account of her huge ass ) .
Then you just see which side gets new eggs , and that 's the side with the queen .
Easy .
But when Jason and his teammates tried this they could n't find the eggs and had the hive open long enough that doubt was introduced — she may have split , been squished in all the handling , or something else .
So they had no choice but to go through the entire hive slowly and closely , trying to get a visual on her royal highness herself .
This was going to take a while and the bees were getting more and more furious with the whole thing .
The tone of their buzzing takes on a far more threatening pitch and gets louder .
More and more bees were coming over to try to scare me off but I had the secret weapon : do n't move & stay calm .
Still it was getting harder and harder to keep my heart rate under control ... the bees were being really aggressive .
Some got tangled in brenda's hair and that understandably drove her inside .
Perfect evening to have a shaved head :)
But my attitude did a 180 when a bee got stuck between my eyebrow and the eyepiece of my camera and it stung me like crazy .
Then another one swooped into my eye and got tangled in my lashes buzzing like crazy .
I lost it and shook them off violently .. staying calm and moving slow went right out the window .
I sprinted my ass off back to the safety of the house .
I 'd like to say that was the worst of it .
But later , when the queen was found and the hive splitting was a success , the bees were n't done being pissed off .
I was just standing there minding my own business and one mean bastard worker bee flew right directly into my right ear .
DEEP !
And it started trying to get deeper !
I completely lost my shit .
I started dancing all around making all kinds of girly noises .
My heart rate was probably 200 .
The buzzing was unbelievable , it sounded and felt like it was almost into my brain before I finally got a grip on the little shit and yanked him out and threw him .
Incredibly I did n't get stung .
My takeaways from the evening : Beehives are awesome .
It 's hard to find a queen .
Do n't go near a beehive when it 's being split without protection .
Having a bee in your ear is about the most terrifying thing that can happen to you .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Recent letters from the Justice Department to Congress state that U.S. intelligence agents working to prevent terror attacks can legally use interrogation techniques banned by international law , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
President George W. Bush issued an executive order last summer in which he said the CIA would observe international regulations regarding detainee treatment .
The letters indicate the Bush administration now contends these boundaries may be stretched in some interrogations .
A March 5 letter from the Justice Dept. to Congress makes clear the Bush administration has not defined which interrogation methods might violate the Geneva Convention ’s bans on “ outrages upon personal dignity , ” the Times said .
The letters were provided by the staff of Sen. Ron Wyden , an Oregon Democrat and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
The panel received classified briefings on the matter and Wyden requested further information , which yielded the letters , the Times said .
“ The fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack , rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse , would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act , ” wrote Brian Benczkowski , a deputy assistant attorney general , in one letter .
A senior Justice Department official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said of the classified information : “ I certainly do n’t want to suggest that if there ’s a good purpose you can head off and humiliate someone . ”
But , he said , “ the fact that you are doing something for a legitimate security purpose would be relevant ...
There are certainly things that can be insulting that would not raise to the level of an outrage on personal dignity . ”
The Geneva Conventions prohibit humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners .
Alright I will take the bait .
I am a sucker for a good troll . :-)
Alan Shimel , chief blogger for NAC provider StillSecure , came away from RSA pretty upbeat about the prospects for NAC .
His likening me to the Grinch refers to my frequent cries of protest that NAC is worthless .
I guess he is afraid that I will ruin the Christmas morning pay off that the NAC vendors hope for .
First the background : NAC of course was a concept invented by Cisco 's marketing department in 2003 to counter a problem caused by RPC Decom based worms such as MSBlaster .
Even organizations with great firewalls and desktop security were getting damaged by infected laptops brought into work .
The concept was simple : have the network inspect those laptops to see if they were properly configured with software updates and virus signature updates before letting them on the network .
That is Network Admission Control , and as Shimel points out it is rather hard to accomplish .
Most of the NAC players changed their approach and marketing so that " Admission Control " morphed to " Access Control " .
Do n't get me wrong , I have been a huge proponent of user access control ever since being exposed to Enterasys Networks ' concept of identity based networking .
You have to restrict an end user 's access to applications , data , and portions of the network to protect yourself against the insider threat .
Like Shimel at RSA I met with a bunch of so - called NAC vendors .
There was at least one there that was downright depressed .
You could tell they where the next LockDown .
I wo n't mention which vendor because I would hate to be accused of hurrying their demise .
I then met with the firm that my buddies at Gartner use as an example of NAC getting traction .
( Sorry Alan , it was not StillSecure . )
After spending a year in the UTM space which is already pushing $ 500 million / year by one measurement , it was like putting on magnifying spectacles to evaluate their business : 40 employees , a few tens of $ millions in revenue and a whole lot of excitement about the education market .
NAC was created to solve the problem of users bringing infected laptops on to the network .
And that is why there is no large market for NAC .
For every type of organization , other than higher -ed , technologies are already being deployed that solve the problem .
To wit : patch control , desktop protection , and internal network segmentation .
I am sorry Alan , NAC is not a viable business model for a vendor and for the enterprise it is added complexity and cost that reduces network access while doing nothing for enhanced security .
Not a security solution ?
How can I say that ?
Easy :
1. NAC does nothing to stop the malicious user with a clean computer from having their way with your network .
2 . A zero -day infection will infect properly configured machines with up - todate signatures .
3. NAC violates Stiennon 's first and only rule of network security " Thou shall not trust an end point to report its own state . "
Just as IP address and MAC addresses are spoofed regularly by hackers , machine state can be spoofed .
NAC is a great enforcement tool when you have a body of users that descend on your network every semester with out of date machines from multiple vendors , with multiple OS 's and you can deny them access until they are up to snuff .
That is the only place that model works .
And even at Universities I believe they will eventually figure out that it would be a lot simpler to manage network security effectively than to worry about desktop configuration all the time .
Put it this way : Can you secure your network without NAC ?
Yes .
Does NAC in anyway reduce your overall costs ?
No .
Does NAC tie you down to one vendor 's eco-system ?
Yes , if you go down the Cisco , Juniper , or Microsoft route .
Does NAC make you more secure ?
No .
Then why would you invest in NAC ?
Comic Book Guy of “ The Simpsons ” has been known to have a cardiac episode or two .
But an acquisition the Library of Congress just made might give his heart its “ worst episode ever . ”
( Apologies for borrowing the pun from that particular “ episode . ” )
“ Spider - senses ” all around the Library were set tingling when we learned that the Library had just acquired 24 pages of original 1962 drawings from “ Amazing Fantasy # 15 , ” which marked the first time the world ’s most famous web - slinger , Spider - Man , would appear in print anywhere .
The Spider - Man origin story in “ Amazing Fantasy ” was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko ; the pages are Ditko originals , complete with pencil erasures and white - out opaquing fluid .
The acquisition came to the Library within the past few weeks , thanks to an anonymous donor .
( News had already begun leaking out — where else — in the blogosphere . )
A couple of colleagues and I got the opportunity yesterday afternoon the see the pages in person .
( Do n’t worry , we made sure to keep our drool far away from the art . )
They do indeed appear to be in very good condition , especially considering their age .
The Library ’s Prints and Photographs Division ( P&P ) provided me with a scan of one of the pages and a detail section , which you ’ll see here at right .
( They are , in actuality , even a bit less yellow than the scans appear . )
I also snapped a few pictures as Helena Zinkham , acting chief of P&P , carefully splayed some of them out for us on a table .
In one of the shots of the very first page , you get a clear sense of some of the areas where white - out was applied .
The “ SPIDER - MAN ” title balloon in the banner is literally stuck onto the page .
People who are more familiar with Amazing Fantasy # 15 than I are probably not surprised by this fact , but I got a good chuckle from the disclaimer that appeared at the top of the first page ( pictured at left ) .
It almost seems to be begging skeptical readers to give Spider - Man a chance , completely unaware of the phenomenon that was about to be unleashed on the world .
The excessively exclamatory paragraph reads : “ Like costume heroes ?
Confidentially , we in the comic mag business refer to them as ‘ long underwear characters ’!
And , as you know , they ’re a dime a dozen !
But , we think you may find our SPIDERMAN just a bit … different ! ”
Most sentient beings are already aware that Marvel ’s Spider - Man is one of the most popular superheroes ever , spawning several comic - book series , graphic novels , television series , video games , toys , a blockbuster movie franchise , and adding phrases to our popular lexicon such as “ true believers ” and “ your friendly neighborhood ( fill - in - the - blank ) . ”
The pages will be digitized within the next few weeks , although access to the images will likely be restricted to on - site use at the Library ( copyright restrictions and such ) .
The pages themselves are available to researchers with a valid reader - identification card by appointment only .
Our full news release can be found here .
I never try to guess where an editor will place a story , but I hear a rumor that J. Jonah Jameson will be giving this front - page treatment .
The offer is proving popular - sales have quadrupled so far A car dealership in the United States is offering a free handgun with every vehicle sold .
Max Motors in Butler , Missouri , says sales have quadrupled since the start of the offer .
Customers can choose between a gun or a $ 250 ( £ 125 ) petrol card , but most so far have chosen the gun .
Owner Mark Muller said : " We 're just damn glad to live in a free country where you can have a gun if you want to . "
The dealership sells new and old vehicles , including General Motors and Ford cars and trucks , and its logo shows a cowboy holding a pistol .
It has sold more than 30 cars and trucks in the past three days , an increase which the owners put down to their promotional offer .
Inspiration from Obama Mr Muller said that every buyer so far " except one guy from Canada and one old guy " chose the gun , rather than the gas card .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He recommends a Kel - Tec .380 pistol , which he describes as " a nice little handgun that fits in your pocket " .
He added that the promotion was inspired by recent comments from one of the Democratic nominees for the presidential election , saying : " We did it because of Barack Obama .
" He said all those people in the Midwest , you 've got to have compassion for them because they 're clinging to their guns and their Bibles .
I found that quite offensive .
We all go to church on Sunday and we all carry guns . "
The website advertisement for the offer , which continues until the end of the month , mentions that an approved background check on gun ownership is required .

THIS past Halloween , 18 - year - old Nikki Catsouras was killed in a car crash .
A few days later , Catsouras ’ teenage cousin – answering a text message – flipped open her cellphone and was confronted with a picture of the mortally wounded Nikki , who suffered massive head trauma and lost most of her face and head , at the scene .
While Catsouras was still being mourned , more pictures from the scene were anonymously posted on the dead girl ’s formerly benign MySpace page , and they are now – without the family ’s consent , which is not needed – being used in at least one criminal - law class at a local community college .
( Police admitted on Tuesday that an officer leaked the pictures ; the family has filed a $ 20 million lawsuit . )
“ It ’s evil , ” says Lesli Catsouras , Nikki ’s mother .
“ It ’s evil , and this was done maliciously , as a joke , and it has devastated our lives completely .
People should know that this can happen to them . ”
The Catsouras family – Lesli , 41 , her husband , Christos and their three daughters – no longer go online or use e-mail .
Their 15 - year - old dropped a class because it required using the Internet for research .
Their lawyer , Tyler Offenhauser , says there is little in the way of legal recourse : “ The Internet is growing in leaps and bounds , ” he says .
“ The law is not . ”
And yet a 28 - year - old Upper West Side graduate of Harvard Law School – who has yet to take the bar – has been surprisingly effective .
As the founder of the 2 - month - old ReputationDefender , Michael Fertik , a self - described fighter for “ truth , justice and the American freakin’ way , ” has , since his hiring by the Catsouras family , managed to remove the photos from some 300 Web sites ( as of press time , they were still up on about 100 others ) .
How ?
Fertik – who charges $ 9 - $ 15 a month for what he calls “ destroys ” – uses a searchbot to find any and all mentions of a client .
Then he writes letters to the operators of each site , politely and firmly requesting that the content be removed .
If that fails , Fertik issues another letter ( “ we can escalate the language ” ) and , if that fails , they refer clients to a lawyer .
“ There is no silver bullet , ” he says .
“ If there was , I ’d be a billionaire already .
But you need someone to advocate . ”
Among Fertik ’s other clients : Ronen Sergev , who was arrested for calling Priceline.com 215 times in a row , demanding a refund – and whose efforts to remove all links of said incident from the Web have sparked a mini-controversy regarding his Wikipedia entry , which no longer references his arrest , and which some suspect has been tampered with by ReputationDefender .
Fertik denies any involvement in the repeatedly edited Wikipedia entry ; he says he would never consider it , both for ethical and commercial considerations :
“ We understand the blogger community , and they will jump all over you if you try to edit Wikipedia , ” he says .
“ People are really suffering , ” adds Fertik .
To wit : “ I have a client in D.C. ; after a breakup , his ex posted pictures of him in sexual positions – fun , S&M play photos .
That ’s what they were into .
And they ’re up there , and you can see his face , his genitals . ”
He pauses .
“ I will work until the cows come home to make sure those pictures come down , because no one has the right to do that to anyone else . ”
Yet there are some who worry that despite ReputationDefender ’s above - board tactics , asking someone to remove content that another finds offensive is a form of censorship .
“ Today it starts as a polite request , and tomorrow the Internet police will be telling you what you can and cannot publish , ” wrote one poster on Consumerist.com , where the case of Reputation - Defender vs. the Internet has been an ongoing story of interest .
“ The tone was polite , but I found the message – Please help us censor the Internet – offensive , ” wrote another .
“ We have a civic responsibility not to attack anything from the press , ” says Fertik .
That said , he thinks there is room for debate : ” ‘ I heard this story about person X – what a douchebag , ’ – a post like that is a different argument , ” he says .
“ Now , the answer could be that we just need to have a higher level of tolerance .
But this is so outside the human experience that we ’ve seen to date .
Would you do something like this to your own friend ?
Or your family ? ”
“ Frankly , this is a great idea , ” says William Bierce , a New York City - based lawyer who specializes in computer law and information technology .
“ The paucity , the retardedness , of Internet law – it is way , way behind the Internet , ” he says .
“ There ’s a penumbra of conflicting rights between freedom of the press and the constitutional right to privacy – but the legal issue you ’re addressing here is so far behind the times because it has n’t had the kind of debate identity theft has . ”
( Identity theft , he says , was finally addressed by Congress due to its effect on the economy ; this debate and its ramifications are far more esoteric and difficult to quantify . )
In the meantime , the beleaguered and online - averse can seek recourse through Reputation - Defender , which will take on anyone ’s cause unless they are , as Fertik says , “ a child rapist , a child pornographer or work in human resources . ”
Plus , Fertik himself now feels a special affinity with his clientele , given the adverse reaction in the online community to his company ’s involvement in the Priceline debacle : “ My company ’s name is now irrevocably smeared by a blogger who claims we tried to take something down from Wikipedia , ” he says .
“ And there ’s no way to remedy it . ”

Now is an excellent time to be working in the field of computer graphics .
Over the past five years , GPU technology has advanced in astounding ways , and at an explosive pace .
The rendering rate , as measured in pixels per second , has been approximately doubling every six months during those five years .
A factor of two is certainly exciting enough , but more exciting is the wonder of compounding .
Five years represents the doubling of performance ten times — that 's two to the tenth power , a factor of one thousand !
Not only has performance increased , but also the quality of computation and the flexibility of graphics programming have steadily improved during that same time .
Five years ago , PCs and computer workstations had graphics accelerators , not graphics processing units ( GPUs ) .
The implication was that a graphics accelerator does simply that : it accelerates graphics .
Furthermore , the word accelerator implied that the computer would perform exactly the same rendering operations as before , only faster .
As graphics accelerators were replaced by GPUs , we abandoned the old concept of graphics acceleration .
We advanced to graphics processing , embracing the idea of processors that enable new graphics algorithms and effects .
We have entered the era of programmable GPUs .
The graphics hardware pipeline , which had not previously changed significantly in twenty years , was broken down to its component , hard - wired elements and rebuilt out of programmable , parallel - pipelined processors .
In a hard - wired pipeline , triangle vertices are transformed and lit , triangles are rasterized , and pixels are shaded with diffuse lighting , specular exponentiation , fog blending , and frame - buffer blending .
In a programmable pipeline , each of these operations is abstracted to its component memory accesses and mathematical operations .
A programmer can still write a program that calculates the same results as a hard - wired pipeline ( and in fact , such a program is often the first one a student programmer writes for a programmable processor ! ) , but the opportunity presented is so much greater than this .
The first effects of fast , programmable GPUs are subtle .
Previously difficult graphics problems become much more tractable through the application of one thousand - fold performance increases .
Offline rendering techniques become more practical for interactive applications .
Historically , brute force has been a popular algorithmic approach ; simply casting a graphics problem in a way that it can run on a GPU is an unsubtle application of brute force — it works , but it leaves opportunity on the table .
Beyond that , algorithm development gets more interesting .
Graphics programmers can now experiment with new algorithms and techniques that would not have been practical on a slower , single - threaded serial processor such as a CPU .
The parallel - stream - processing nature of the GPU , coupled with flexibility and programmability , allows new algorithms to be developed and invites experimentation .
Any computationally demanding problem — not just graphics — that can take advantage of large - scale parallelism , larger memory bandwidth , and geometric performance growth is a good candidate for GPU implementation .
As an industry , we 're still learning which problems will benefit most from GPU solutions .
The true beneficiaries of the programmable GPU revolution are the computer graphics algorithm designer , the researcher , the application developer , and ultimately the end user or consumer — the gamer , the moviegoer , and so on .
GPU Gems is a timely book , as the GPU programming field is young and vibrant , and many developers are reinventing the same techniques again and again .
This volume contains straightforward applications of known techniques to a structure more amenable to GPU execution , as well as innovative new algorithms and effects that were not previously possible .
At this time in the history of GPU programming , many problems remain unsolved and many challenges remain unmet .
Consequently , this first volume of GPU Gems is a compendium of approaches and examples of work carried out so far , rather than a cookbook of completed effects to be plugged into applications .
This collection will allow programmers to benefit from the exciting progress already made , and it will enable tomorrow 's developers to stand on the shoulders of giants , the pioneers of programming GPUs .
It 's up to you to take the next steps of innovation !

New Jersey is a state that distinguishes itself in so many ways .
One example of New Jersey 's unique charm may come as a surprise to visiting motorists , however , when they discover that it 's illegal to pump your own gas in the Garden State .
Until quite recently , New Jersey was n't the only state that did n't allow motorists to pump their own gas .
For years , Oregon drivers had to sit in their cars as well , waiting for an attendant to fill ‘ er up .
However , effective January 1 , 2016 , Oregonians in rural counties are allowed to dispense their own gasoline at night .
The measure was designed to keep motorists from getting stranded in remote areas after gas station staff had gone home for the night — a very real problem in the state ’s sprawling terrain .
But let ’s get back to New Jersey , a state that has made it illegal for people to pump their own gas .
Why is this the case ?
Enacted in 1949 , the Retail Gasoline Dispensing Safety Act and Regulations banned drivers from pumping their own gas in New Jersey , and the rules are still in effect .
Like so many laws , the statute claims the ban is for drivers ’ own good :
Because of the fire hazards directly associated with dispensing fuel , it is in the public interest that gasoline station operators have the control needed over that activity to ensure compliance with appropriate safety procedures , including turning off vehicle engines and refraining from smoking while fuel is dispensed .
But the government version may not be the whole story .
The passage of the Act was motivated by something a little less pure than safety : money .
In the 1940s , when self - service was unheard of in most of the country , a gas station owner named Irving Reingold offered lower prices to customers willing to pump their own gas .
The gimmick was wildly popular and soon became a threat to competing gas stations .
According to Bergen County 's The Record , " rival station owners reacted by persuading state lawmakers to outlaw self - serve , " and the state legislature made Reingold 's tactics illegal .
As more and more states around the country began to offer self - serve gas stations in the 1970s and ' 80s , New Jersey stayed put .
Nowadays , some politicians will even refer to the matter as a source of state identity and pride .
In a 2011 radio interview , Governor Chris Christie said , " People in New Jersey love the idea that they ’ve got somebody to pump their gas , " adding , " I do n’t see that changing . "
In 2015 , New Jersey General Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon introduced a bill that would lift the ban .
“ I am offended by people that argue that New Jerseyans are mentally incapable of pumping their own gas without setting themselves on fire , " O'Scanlon said in a press statement .
O'Scanlon made one semi-concession to the old law , recommending that stations hang signs on gas pumps reminding people to turn off their engines .
The recommended text seemed to mirror the assemblyman ’s exasperation : “ Do not , UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , set yourself on fire ! ! ”
Despite this helpful suggestion , O’Scanlon ’s bill was not to be , as State Senate President Stephen Sweeney blocked the vote .
" I will oppose any attempt to rescind the law that has effectively served the best interests of the state 's motorists for decades , " Sweeney said in a press statement .
" As long as I am Senate President , the ban on self - serve will stay in place . "
" We 've been doing it the right way in New Jersey , ” Sweeney concluded .
“ We should not change . "
Have you got a Big Question you 'd like us to answer ?
If so , let us know by emailing us at bigquestions@mentalfloss.com .
Playing the original Psi-Ops was great : solid graphics , many cool ways to use your mental powers to torture and kill the enemy soldiers , and a solid sense of humor .
I 'm not sure how well it did in terms of sales , but whenever I bump into anyone who has played the title , they have nothing but positive words for it .
If you 've missed it the first time , FilePlanet is offering an ad- supported download of the game - free for the PC .
The terrible thing is that the game ends on a frackin ' cliffhanger , and back in 2006 it was pretty much confirmed that there would n't be a sequel .
Ever the optimist , I brought it up when I interviewed Jason Kaehler , the art director for Stranglehold , when I found out he had also worked on Psi-Ops .
His answer does n't give much hope .
" In some ways , Stranglehold is really the next iteration of Psi-Ops .
We 're the same team under Brian Eddy 's direction and have brought a lot of the ' sandbox ' gameplay directly into Stranglehold , " he told Ars .
I 'm going to start crying .
Here is one of the ways you can deal some death in the game .
Use your powers to take over the mind of an enemy soldier , take control of his sniper rifle , and force him to kill his friends .
Then simply make him walk off his watchtower , as he screams in terror .
When his body dies , your mind snaps back into your own body , and you can now walk the level unmolested .
It only gets better from there .
If you 've never played the game , grab a game pad , and get to downloading .
The game is ad - supported , but that 's a small price to pay for such a solid experience .
Maybe if we make enough noise , Midway will rethink its decision and give us a sequel .
I 'm going to go shake some pots and pans .
The big tech / business news of the day is Yahoo ’s stock “ plunge ” following the withdrawl of Microsoft ’s takeover offer .
I ’m sure plunge headlines sell newspapers and all , but the more long - term story is more interesting .
On Jan 31 , the day before Microsoft offered $ 31 / share for Yahoo , YHOO was at $ 19.18 / share ( market cap : $ 26.4 billion ) and MSFT was at $ 32.60 / share ( market cap : $ 303.6 billion ) .
At the close of trading today , YHOO closed at $ 24.37 / share ( market cap : $ 33.5 billion ) and MSFT was at $ 29.08 / share ( market cap : $ 270.8 billion ) .
In other words , the Microsoft offer increased the value of Yahoo !
Inc. by more than $ 7 billion and decreased the value of Microsoft Corporation by almost $ 33 billion .
In still other words , in attempting to take Yahoo by force , they let an amount equal to Yahoo slip through their fingers .
Why is n’t anyone writing about Yahoo ’s amazing stock gains and Microsoft ’s plunge ?
Catholic Church offers therapy to ' cure ' gays in Poland
The sixth - ever International Day Against Homophobia is held May 17 , but many homosexuals in Poland will not celebrate it .
The Catholic Church has created rehabilitation centers in Poland to rehabilitate gay people and " get them back on the right path . "
The Odwaga Center uses therapy , prayer and chastity to teach its patients to resist their homosexual impulses .
Men at the center are taught to play football and women are taught to cook .
 When you want a candy for example , you can resist and have it later , " said Lena Wojdan , a psychologist at the center .
" And you can trade it for a piece of chocolate . 
But gay associations said that such psychological treatment can be dangerous for the patients ' mental health .
The therapists tell them that it will pass and when it does n't , they feel much more depressed , said Marta Abramowicz of Campaign Against Homophobia .
" I know many cases when people after that committed suicide , " she said .
Several public leaders in the European Union have recently been criticized for discriminating against gay people .
A gay American man voiced outrage against Poland 's President Lech Kaczynski for using a video of his marriage to another man to publicly denounce an EU proposal for gay rights .
A survey published last year showed that more than half of all Poles view homosexuality as a sin .

It was supposed to have been a model of urban renewal -- a mix of housing and classy stores to replace a decaying 20 - acre shopping center at the foot of the affluent Baldwin Hills .
Instead , more than a year after the project was to be completed , Santa Barbara Plaza is a collection of dead or dying businesses surrounding a vast parking lot with weeds pushing through large cracks .
Most of the housing was never built ; none of the retailers ever came .
The largely middle - class , African American area is stuck with a mostly deserted commercial slum .
Los Angeles leaders gambled on a check - bouncing , politically connected developer to shepherd the project .
And after $ 15 million in government subsidies and more than $ 30 million in private investment , taxpayers -- and the community -- have lost .
“ It ’s disgraceful , ” said Karen Ceasar , secretary for the neighborhood council at a recent meeting packed with angry residents .
She accused elected officials of a “ failure to care . ”
Advertisement
For years , officials had eyed the half - century - old plaza , near Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards , for redevelopment .
Then - Mayor James K . Hahn called what was expected to be a $ 170 - million project the top redevelopment priority of his administration .
At first , the city pinned its hopes on basketball legend - turned - businessman Earvin “ Magic ” Johnson , but he was unable to interest retailers in the site , city records show .
Christopher Hammond , a successful developer of low - income housing and a prolific political fundraiser , stepped into the breach .
Hammond impressed officials and residents with ambitious plans for a sprawling retail center , which later were modified to include a gated residential community , condominiums and apartments for low - income seniors .
As an African American , he was seen as a potential pioneer in a city with few black developers heading up big - league projects .
His proposal was endorsed by councilmen from the area : first Mark Ridley - Thomas , who is now a state senator , and then his council successor , Bernard C. Parks .
Both are now candidates for county supervisor .
Advertisement
But if the city was impressed with Hammond ’s vision , officials also had reason to question his ability to realize it .
Along with his accomplishments , he had serious financial troubles that emerged as the project worked its way through rounds of government approvals beginning in 2000 .
In June 2004 , a few months before the project was slated for final approval , the Los Angeles Times , citing records and interviews , reported that Hammond or his companies had bounced checks in three dozen instances from 1999 through 2003 , for a total of more than $ 200,000 .
Although he was effective in raising campaign funds from other people , nearly two dozen of his or his companies ’ contribution checks to Hahn and 10 to current or former City Council members had bounced .
He was in default on mortgages on both of his houses , in Malibu and Los Feliz .
His principal company ’s landlord had moved to evict it from its offices for failure to pay rent .
Three times , Hammond had agreed to settle lawsuits over bad debts , only to bounce the settlement checks .
And even his initial good - faith deposit check to the city for the Santa Barbara Plaza project was no good .
Advertisement
Despite a last - minute warning from City Controller Laura Chick about Hammond ’s troubled finances , Hahn and the council approved his continued stewardship .
Chick said recently that elected officials should have pulled the plug then .
“ The city had an opportunity to stand up and say , ‘ This is not the way we do business anymore , ’ and they blew it , ” she said .
Now , neighbors say the plaza has become a crime magnet and a danger to children .
They want the city at least to fence off the blight .
Advertisement
“ What we see . . . is no longer tolerable , ” said Lark Galloway - Gilliam , the neighborhood council president , at the recent meeting .
Hammond did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
To date , little of the plan approved by the city has materialized , according to city and property records , lawsuits and interviews with those involved :
* New stores , the original impetus for the redevelopment , are nowhere on the horizon .
Neither Hammond nor his firms ever closed the deals on the land on which he promised to build them .
His retail development partner , LNR Western Properties Inc. , walked away in 2006 , city records show .
No replacement has been found .
Advertisement
* Housing for low - income seniors , which was supposed to have been finished in 2004 , is only partly built .
After an $ 8.5 - million investment by the federal government for the purchase of land and other preliminary costs , a Hammond - led firm managed to erect just one of three planned buildings , and even that one is partly covered in scaffolding .
Work stalled after the main contractor , S.C. Anderson Inc. , walked off the job in September , saying in a lawsuit that it had not been paid .
In the last year , the state treasurer ’s office rescinded a promise to provide $ 17 million more in federal subsidies , saying it was fed up with delays .
* Hundreds of units of market - rate homes and condominiums remain on the drawing board .
By early 2003 , documents show , an associate of Hammond ’s had signed agreements to buy the properties Hammond needed , but Hammond did not come up with the money until 2005 .
That was a costly delay .
By the time a firm he managed was able to buy the land , with the help of $ 7 million in city subsidies and $ 30 million borrowed from 200 private investors , prices for commercial real estate in Los Angeles had shot up an average of 40 % .
And Hammond ’s firm paid an even higher appreciation rate .
Advertisement
Since then , investors have sued Hammond and two firms he led , alleging that they are in default and now owe $ 42 million , including penalties and interest .
Hammond and the companies have filed a general denial of the allegations .
Hammond and his companies have not yet demolished the dilapidated storefronts they borrowed money to buy .
A few tenants are still struggling to run businesses in a shopping center that looks as if it is closed .
Some are still waiting for long - promised relocation payments , according to records and interviews .
Besides failing to check the credit of Hammond and his companies -- which would have revealed federal tax liens , among other things -- the city has not kept close watch over some of the public funds it has provided him , records and interviews show .
When a Hammond - led firm acquired the parcels for the senior housing , the city did not have the properties independently appraised , as is typically required , before handing out federal funds to pay for them .
When the appraisals were finally done a month after the transactions had closed , they showed that the government had paid about $ 400,000 more than market value for two lots .
In sometimes complicated deals , the money went from the government to a Hammond - led firm , which used it to pay other Hammond - led firms , according to interviews and property and business ownership records .
Advertisement
City officials could not explain why appraisals were delayed or why the government paid much more than market value for the properties .
They said their files were missing .
“ It ’s unacceptable , ” acknowledged Kiara Harris , spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency .
“ As a taxpayer , I would be upset .
But just because we do n’t know does n’t mean there is n’t a reasonable explanation . ”
Federal officials would not comment on the case .
Advertisement
Others say they have been left in the lurch as well :
Jeff Lee , Hammond ’s partner in the market - rate housing portion of the project , is suing Hammond for repayment of a $ 2 - million loan secured by a mortgage on a Hammond family home .
In the pending suit , Lee alleges that Hammond forged Lee ’s signature to an agreement subordinating Lee ’s mortgage to the mortgage of someone else .
In an e-mail to one of Lee ’s partners contained in the court file and attributed to Hammond , Hammond acknowledged he “ should have let [ Lee ] know we executed a new subordination for him . ”
Through an attorney , Lee told The Times that Hammond took city subsidies and used them to pay others without Lee ’s consent .
Advertisement
Bert Adams , the associate who helped Hammond assemble the land for the project , has also sued him for failure to pay $ 1.9 million under a 2003 agreement they reached to settle their affairs .
One selling point for Hammond as orchestrator of the Santa Barbara Plaza project had been some prior commercial development experience with a shopping center in South Los Angeles : the Home Depot - anchored Chesterfield Square at Slauson and Western avenues .
But last year , allegations turned up in a lawsuit over a separate business dispute that called even this achievement into question .
In a 2002 letter in the court file , Hammond ’s partner on Chesterfield Square , Gerald Katell , wrote to Hammond to complain that Hammond was doing practically no work and had misappropriated funds .
The next year , Katell foreclosed on Hammond ’s share of the project , saying Hammond had stolen $ 325,000 from an escrow account and bounced a check to pay it back , according to a separate letter by Katell .
The court file contains another letter , allegedly from Hammond , in which he admits bouncing the check .

In a recent interview , former Mayor Hahn said these problems came as a surprise to him .
“ As far as I knew he had success at Chesterfield Square , ” he said .
“ Obviously , hindsight ’s always 20 - 20 , ” Hahn said .
At the time that he endorsed Hammond ’s involvement in the transformation of Santa Barbara Plaza , he said , he had thought that , “ given the right partner , ” Hammond could make it a success .
In fact , Hammond initially had a local celebrity partner : former National Football League wide receiver Joseph Keyshawn Johnson , who grew up in the area .
Johnson was present at the 2003 groundbreaking with Hahn but lost patience with the project ’s slow place and dropped out around 2005 , his agent said in an interview .
He had also invested in Chesterfield Square .
Last year , Johnson sued Hammond and two of his companies , saying the developer owed him nearly $ 1 million .
Ridley - Thomas , who left the council after he was elected to the state Legislature in 2002 , had invited Hammond , among other developers , to pursue the project in the first place .
But in a recent interview , he said he did not know then that Hammond had serious financial problems .
Any problems emerged after “ my direct responsibility ended , ” he said .
Advertisement
“ I knew him as a performer in getting projects done , ” Ridley - Thomas said .
Parks , who succeeded Ridley - Thomas on the City Council in 2003 , said : “ I did n’t pick the developer .
. . .
He was part of the project when I came into office .
I backed the project . ”
It may take a new developer , a major influx of private capital , or both , to get the rest of the Santa Barbara Plaza project off the ground , said Cecilia Estolano , the redevelopment agency ’s chief executive since 2006 .
The city should step in to purchase at least some of the land necessary for retail development , she said , so it could be in a position to offer it to a new developer at a discount .
Advertisement
That could prove expensive .
At Estolano ’s request , the City Council approved the redevelopment agency ’s purchase of two Santa Barbara Plaza properties for $ 5 million .
Hammond had a deal years ago to purchase those same properties for $ 1.5 million but never came up with the money .

Surprising graphene

( click to enlarge )
Graphene is the two - dimensional crystalline form of carbon : a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons , like a sheet of chicken wire with an atom at each nexus .
As free - standing objects , such two - dimensional crystals were believed impossible to create -- even to exist -- until physicists at the University of Manchester actually made graphene in 2004 .
Now researchers at the Department of Energy 's Advanced Light Source ( ALS ) , from DOE 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California at San Diego ( UCSD ) , have measured the extraordinary properties of graphene with an accuracy never before achieved .
The results confirm many of the strangest features of the unusual material but also reveal significant departures from theoretical predictions .
And they point the way to novel practical applications , such as tunable optical modulators for communications and other nanoscale electronics .
The studies were performed by Zhiqiang Li , an ALS Doctoral Fellow from Dimitri Basov 's laboratory at UCSD , working with colleagues at Columbia University in New York and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Florida , and with Berkeley Lab's Michael Martin , who manages the Fourier Transform Infrared beamline 1.4.4 at the ALS .
The researchers report their findings in the June issue of the journal Nature Physics .
Graphene 's promising electronic properties
The familiar pencil - lead form of carbon , graphite , consists of layers of carbon atoms tightly bonded in the plane but only loosely bonded between planes ; because the layers move easily over one another , graphite is a good lubricant .
In fact these graphite layers are graphene , although they had never been observed in isolation before 2004 .
Once demonstrated , research immediately took off , inspired by the material 's unexpected electronic properties .
Experiments continue unabated .
" Graphene 's unusual electronic properties arise from the fact that the carbon atom has four electrons , three of which are tied up in bonding with its neighbors , " says Li . " But the unbound fourth electrons are in orbitals extending vertically above and below the plane , and the hybridization of these spreads across the whole graphene sheet . "
As a crystal , two - dimensional graphene is quite dissimilar from three - dimensional materials such as silicon .
In semiconductors and other materials , charge carriers ( electrons and oppositely charged " holes " ) interact with the periodic field of the atomic lattice to form quasiparticles ( excitations that act like actual particles ) .
But quasiparticles in graphene do not look anything like an ordinary semiconductor's .
The energy of quasiparticles in a solid depends on their momentum , a relationship described by energy bands .
In a typical 3 - D semiconductor , the energy bands are " parabolic " -- a graph of the lower , filled valence band resembles a stalagmite , more or less flat on top , while the upper , empty conduction band is its opposite , a stalactite , more or less flat on the bottom ; between them is the open band gap , representing the amount of energy it takes to boost an electron from the valence band to the conduction band .
Unlike in ordinary semiconductors , however , graphs of the valence band and the conduction band in graphene are smooth - sided cones that meet at a point , called the Dirac point .
These plot the energy - momentum relationships of quasiparticles behaving as if they were massless electrons , so - called Dirac fermions , which travel at a constant speed -- a small but noteworthy fraction of the speed of light .
One interesting consequence of this unique band structure is that the electrons in graphene are " sort of free , " Li says .
Unlike electrons in other materials , the electrons in graphene move ballistically -- without collisions -- over great distances , even at room temperature .
As a result , the ability of the electrons in graphene to conduct electrical current is 10 to 100 times greater than those in a normal semiconductor like silicon at room temperature .
This makes graphene a very promising candidate for future electronic applications .
Says Li , " By applying a gate voltage to graphene which has been integrated in a gated device , one can continually control the carrier density by varying the voltage , and thus the conductivity . "
It 's this phenomenon that gives rise to graphene 's practical promise .
An unusual experiment
Because graphene is tricky to make and even trickier to handle , most experiments have been performed not on free - standing monolayers but on two types of graphene samples : exfoliated graphene , deposited on a silicon - oxide / silicon substrate , and epitaxial graphene , a layer of carbon atoms chemically deposited ( and chemically bonded to ) a substrate of silicon carbide .
" Epitaxial graphene and exfoliated graphene are very distinct , " says Li. Much of the synchrotron experimental work on epitaxial graphene has employed ARPES , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy .
" In our work , we investigated exfoliated graphene by employing infrared spectromicroscopy . "
Li explains that infrared measurements can probe the dynamical properties of quasiparticles over a wide energy range , and therefore can provide some of the most interesting information about the electronic properties of a material , " such as electron lifetime and interactions between electrons , " he says .
" Such measurements have not been performed on exfoliated graphene before , because it is extremely difficult to measure the absorption of light in a single monolayer of graphene . "
To accurately measure how graphene 's infrared absorption responds to varying the gate voltages , the researchers first needed samples of exfoliated graphene attached to electrodes .
They used flakes of single - atomic - layer graphene 50 micrometers ( millionths of a meter ) square .
The samples were laid on top of ( but not chemically bonded to ) an insulating layer of silicon oxide and an underlying layer of pure silicon .
This transparent substrate acted as the gate electrode .
The whole system was cooled to 45 kelvins ( 379 degrees Fahrenheit below zero ) .
" To measure the absorption of infrared light by neutral graphene and by electrostatically doped graphene " -- that is , not chemically doped , but rather " doped " by the gate voltage -- " we needed the intensity and tight focus of a beam of synchrotron radiation operating at infrared frequencies , " says Michael Martin .
" The ALS IR beam , less than 10 micrometers across , was positioned at various points across the sample , which allowed us to directly measure transmission and reflectance and obtain the sample 's optical conductivity . "
The term " optical " in optical conductivity refers to the high frequency of light , as opposed to the very low frequency of household alternating current ( ac ) .
The researchers induced optical - frequency ac in the graphene sample with the infrared beam and manipulated the voltage via the electrodes .
The changes in voltage changed the conductivity and carrier density in the sample , and directly affected its ability to transmit or reflect light .
Indeed , the researchers found that the reflectance and transmission of graphene can be dramatically tuned by applied gate voltages .
" In a normal electronic system such as a semiconductor , the Fermi energy " -- the energy of the carriers ' highest occupied quantum state when the temperature is absolute zero -- " is proportional to the density of the carriers , " Li says .
" But in a system of 2 - D Dirac fermions , the Fermi energy is proportional to the square root of the carrier density . "
The researchers observed this unique square - root density dependence of the Fermi energy , which verifies that electrons in graphene indeed behave like Dirac fermions .
Thus many of the effects predicted for graphene by theory were confirmed in these experiments , and measured to an accuracy never before obtained .
Graphene surprises
Other results , however , revealed " many - body interactions , " more complex than what had been suggested by the " single - particle " picture of graphene , which treats the carriers as an ensemble of independent particles .
Theories predict that if electrons in graphene experience no interactions with one another or with the carbon atoms , then at low energy ( or frequency ) -- energy below twice the Fermi energy -- they will absorb hardly any light .
Instead , the researchers observed considerable absorption of infrared light in this low - energy region .
" This unexpected absorption may stem from interactions between electrons and lattice vibrational modes of the carbon atoms , or from mutual interactions among electrons , " says Li .
Another surprise is the speed of the electrons .
As independent particles , electrons in graphene should travel at a constant speed regardless of their energy .
The researchers found that , at high energies , electrons in graphene indeed move at constant speed -- but their speed increases systematically as their energy is lowered .
This enigmatic behavior may be due to electron - electron interactions , predicted theoretically in 1994 .
" Many - body interactions could be as simple as Coulomb interactions between electrons , or they could be more complicated , " says Martin .
" The data give a clear signature , but we do n't completely understand them . "
" Some of these effects might be related to the limitations of the samples we studied , " says Li . " We 'd like to do the measurements on samples suspended over a void , so as to eliminate any disorder induced by the substrate .
Still , even allowing for refinements , it appears that our measurements present a challenge to the current understanding of this intriguing material . "
Google ’s latest Android prototype is miles improved over the versions we last saw .
Back at CES the GUI was clunky and the whole thing looked relatively primative ; Google themselves asked us to keep an open mind and instead concentrate on the OS ’ potential .
Now , they ’ve brought out a device that you could , frankly , mistake for production hardware .
The HTC Android Dream phone is a worthy competitor to the forthcoming iPhone 2.0 !
As our exclusive demo videos show , the Android team have been putting in some long hours bringing the user interface up to the standard people expect .
The iPhone sets the bar high , and leftfield rivals like Samsung ’s TouchWiz GUI really pile on the pressure .
What they ’ve given us is , at first glance , a blend of the successful parts of each of those , together with a dose of Google ’s own minimalist aesthetic .
Hopefully you ’ll agree with us , once you ’ve looked through the photos and watched the video , that the design is a winner .
In this first video , we see an overview of the new interface and menu structure , including the clever pattern - based unlock screen .
Much of the GUI can be interacted with – for instance pulling down the title bar reveals missed calls and new messages – using the familiar palatte of swipes and taps .
You can also see the straightforward way to create shortcuts on the home screen ; a matter of holding down your finger and then following through the contextual menus .

Obama 's 50 - state strategy , from the latest campaign email :
People like you have been the heart of Chairman Howard Dean 's 50 - state strategy to rebuild our party and empower Democrats to compete everywhere .
We 've all seen the energy and enthusiasm at the grassroots level impact races up and down the ballot over the last three years .
I am proud to announce that our presidential campaign will be the first in a generation to deploy and maintain staff in every single state .
That 's incredible .
It 's revolutionary .
Much was said last week about " Obama keeping Dean at the DNC " .
That much was never in doubt .
No nominee has ever booted a sitting chairman .
It would reek of civil war .
Even Clinton would 've kept Dean .
There really was no story there .
What is a story , however , is that Dean 's 50 State Strategy and Obama 's 50 State Campaign are now coming together in this fashion .
Campaign offices in every single state ?
Obama's is the only campaign that promised this type of effort , and they 're delivering .
So what 's that mean ?
It does n't mean Obama will win 50 states , obviously .
But it does mean a commitment to 1 ) an expanded presidential battleground , 2 ) long - term party building , and 3 ) attention to the down - ballot races that will ultimately decide whether the Obama Agenda will see the light of day .
The more seats Obama 's Democratic Party can amass in the House and in the Senate , the stronger his influence and the bolder his legislation can be .
In other words , this is much bigger than the presidential race , and I 'm extremely encouraged that a presidential campaign has decided to take such a broad approach to these coming elections .
As far as the presidential race itself is concerned , let 's go back to my battleground map from last week :
This map can and will evolve over the coming months .
But as of now , the yellow states are those that are within single digits in the polls and thus are considered " battlegrounds " .
And right now , Obama is competitive in 13 14 Bush states -- Alaska , Nevada , Montana , North Dakota , 1 - 2 EVs in Nebraska ( which splits its electoral votes ) , Colorado , New Mexico , Iowa , Missouri , Indiana , Ohio , North Carolina , South Carolina , and Florida .
In contrast , McCain is competitive in just six Kerry states , and Massachusetts and New Jersey will solidify putting them out of play .
What 's more , heavy African American populations in Mississippi and Georgia can put those states within reach , while continued strong Latino participation in Texas could likewise throw the Lone Star State into contention , forcing the McCain campaign to play even wider defense than this map would suggest .
Beyond those states not in yellow or Blue above , Senate races in Idaho , Louisiana , Mississippi , Oklahoma , Kentucky , and Texas can be positively influenced by Obama 's organizing , as well as House races in just about every single state .
Throw in state - level races for good measure , and you suddenly have the biggest nationwide organizing effort perhaps in the party 's entire history .
That is tremendous stuff , and something to look forward to in the coming months .
It 's an effort , as well , that will require lots of volunteer power , so keep your eyes open for local opportunities to lend a hand .
Millions of new Democrats wo n't register themselves or turn out to vote on their own !
So that 's why they call it Muscle Beach .
( That 's Ahmad Saleh , 32 , doing push - ups .
With one hand .
In mid-air . )

And a history of the place ( with great archival photos -- yes , of women , too ) here .

These charts show the retail price of gasoline in the US , given as mg of gold per gallon of gas .
They are based on an average price for regular gas in all areas of the country , sampled weekly by the Energy Information Administration .
Prices for gasoline were fairly stable from 1990 to 1999 , oscillating around 100 mg / gal .
From 2000 to 2008 , they became more volatile , varying from 100 to 200 mg , and averaging about 140 mg .
In late 2008 , as the economy collapsed , gas prices fell to a new low of 57 mg , and have since fallen to about 50 mg today – the lowest seen since 1929 .
Yet over the time period covered by these charts , the dollar price of gas has gone from under $ 0.10 per gallon to around $ 4.00 per gallon , and currently sits at about $ 2.00 per gallon .
As a child , I often saw gasoline for 25 cents per gallon – in the days when that meant a silver quarter .
The melt value of that quarter today is almost $ 6 , another way of pointing out that today 's fuel prices , rather than being high , are in fact near their historic lows !

Demonised in the West as goons guarding the Olympic torch along its chaotic world tour , these pictures show how China 's paramilitary police learn their unwavering discipline .
Officers of the People Paramilitary Police preparing for the Olympics are drilled on the parade ground with pins in their collars and crosses on their backs to ensure perfect posture .
But instead of the blue tracksuits members wore while escorting the flame , they are kitted out in full dress uniform during the exercise at their base in Shenyang , Liaoning province .

Stop slouching !
Pins prod into the neck of this paramilitary policeman
To the point :
This paramilitary policeman sticks his neck out
It is hoped their presence in Beijing in August will ensure no visitor or resident steps out of line with the tough Communist regime .
In fact the biggest security effort the world has seen has been enlisted to patrol the Olympics .
At least 94,000 security staff will be deployed at Beijing in August - outnumbering the 10,500 athletes by nearly nine to one .
And The operation will be led by the People 's Armed Police .
Beijing is worried activists for Tibet 's freedom will fly to China to stage protests .

But the International Olympic Committee has said athletes should speak freely on their political beliefs , as long as they follow Olympic Charter rules .
Meanwhile Chinese President Hu Jintao today vowed to continue a recently begun dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
But he offered veiled accusations the Tibetan spiritual leader is causing more problems than he is solving .
Mr Hu , speaking at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda , demanded the Dalai Lama stop trying to divide China , incite violence and harm Games .

" We hope that the Dalai will express his sincerity through his acts , " he said sternly .
" We hope the Dalai will stop acting to separate the homeland , stop orchestrating the inciting of violent acts and stop undermining the Beijing Olympics , so as to create the conditions for further discussions .
We hope that the contacts will have a positive result . "
The Dalai Lama has denied these accusations , which China makes repeatedly , saying he seeks only autonomy for Tibet , not independence .
He has also denied any involvement in March protests in the region that turned violent .
Representatives of the exiled Tibetan government met with Chinese officials earlier this month for the first time since 2006 .

The talks were prompted by the recent unrest in Tibet , which China has governed since the 1950s .
China says 22 people died during anti-government riots in Tibet 's capital of Lhasa in March , while overseas Tibet supporters say many times that number died in protests and a subsequent crackdown .
China 's response to the demonstrations has sparked an international outcry and drawn attention to its rule of the Himalayan region — and its larger human rights record — just as it takes center stage in the run up to the Beijing Games .
The Olympic torch relay 's international tour drew protests on many stops .
So this research has implications beyond race .
It ought to apply to any peer group perceived by strangers .
It suggests why emerging economies like Russia and China , despite their low average incomes , are such hot luxury markets today — and why 20th - century Texas , a relatively poor state , provided so many eager customers for Neiman Marcus .
Rich people in poor places want to show off their wealth .
And their less affluent counterparts feel pressure to fake it , at least in public .
Nobody wants the stigma of being thought poor .
Veblen was right .
But he was also wrong .
Or at least his theory is out of date .
Given that the richer your group , the less flashy spending you ’ll do , conspicuous consumption is n’t a universal phenomenon .
It ’s a development phase .
It declines as countries , regions , or distinct groups get richer .
“ Bling rules in emerging economies still eager to travel the status - through - product consumption road , ” the market - research group Euromonitor recently noted , but luxury businesses “ are becoming aware that bling is n’t enough for growing numbers of consumers in developed economies . ”
At some point , luxury becomes less a tool of public status competition and more a means to private pleasure .
In Veblen ’s day , the less affluent scrimped on their homes in order to keep up appearances in public .
“ The domestic life of most classes is relatively shabby , as compared with the éclat of that overt portion of their life that is carried on before the eyes of observers , ” Veblen wrote , noting that people therefore “ habitually screen their private life from observation . ”
By contrast , consider David Brooks ’s observation in Bobos in Paradise that , for today ’s educated elites ,
it ’s virtuous to spend $ 25,000 on your bathroom , but it ’s vulgar to spend $ 15,000 on a sound system and a wide - screen TV .
It ’s decadent to spend $ 10,000 on an outdoor Jacuzzi , but if you ’re not spending twice that on an oversized slate shower stall , it ’s a sign that you probably have n’t learned to appreciate the simple rhythms of life .
Virtuous or vulgar , what all these items have in common is that they ’re invisible to strangers .
Only your friends and family see them .
Any status they confer applies only within the small group you invite to your home .
And the snob appeal Brooks pokes fun at corresponds to the size of the audience .
Many friends may see your Jacuzzi or media room , but unless you ’re on HGTV , only intimates will tour your master bathroom .
A slate shower stall may make you feel rich , but it wo n’t tell the world that you are .
As peer groups get richer , the balance between private pleasure and publicly visible consumption shifts .
Russ Alan Prince and Lewis Schiff describe a similar pattern in their book , The Middle - Class Millionaire , which analyzes the spending habits of the 8.4 million American households whose wealth is self - made and whose net worth , including their home equity , is between $ 1 million and $ 10 million .
Aside from a penchant for fancy cars , these millionaires devote their luxury dollars mostly to goods and services outsiders can’t see : concierge health care , home renovations , all sorts of personal coaches , and expensive family vacations .
They focus less on impressing strangers and more on family - and self - improvement .
Even when they invest in traditional luxuries like second homes , jets , or yachts , they prefer fractional ownership .
“ They ’re looking for ownership to be converted into a relationship rather than an asset they have to take care of , ” says Schiff .
Their primary luxuries are time and attention .

Ohio Homeland Security Encourages Boaters to Be Prepared
Warm weather brings a multitude of tourists , boaters , and fishermen to the Lake Erie region .
These watercrafts can be one of Ohio ’s greatest security resources , and the Ohio Department of Public Safety ( ODPS ) is working to encourage boaters and fishermen to be prepared and aware of their surroundings .
Ohio Homeland Security ( a division of ODPS ) recently established the Northern Border Initiative ( NBI ) , a collaborative Homeland Security effort among federal , state and local partners along Ohio ’s international maritime border and Lake Erie shoreline .
Through both the NBI and the “ See Something , Say Something ” campaign , Ohio Homeland Security is taking a proactive approach and involving citizens in domestic preparedness efforts .
Through Ohio Homeland Security , the Ohio Department of Natural Resources , US Coast Guard and US Border Patrol , various law enforcement and community leaders from Lake Erie ’s North Coast region are partnering to encourage boaters and tourists protect the Lake Erie region .
The NBI is an extension of the “ See Something , Say Something ” public awareness campaign , aimed at educating Ohioans on recognizing the possible signs of terrorism .
“ The people of Ohio are our most valuable resources , ” said Henry Guzmán , ODPS director .
“ Boaters and fishermen who travel our northern maritime border for business and pleasure are in key positions to be able to identify when something is out of place or potentially dangerous . ”
Ohioans are reminded to contact local law enforcement or the Ohio Terrorism Tipline ( 1-877-647-4683 or 1-877-OHS-INTEL ) if suspicious activity is observed , such as : unattended vessels or vehicles in unusual locations , lights flashing between boats , recovering or tossing items into / onto the waterway or shoreline and / or transfer or people or things between ships or between ship and shore outside of port .
“ The Northern Border Initiative is a cooperative initiative for state , local and federal law enforcement to create a fusion of efforts as each entity works to keep these waterways and the mainland as safe as possible for everyone , ” said William Vedra , executive director of Ohio Homeland Security .

KABUL , Afghanistan  Afghanistan ’s defense minister confirmed Sunday that a police captain was connected with the group behind the assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai a week earlier and that an army officer supplied the weapons and ammunition used in the attack .
Both men have been arrested and are under investigation for their suspected role in the attack on the military parade , which killed three people , including a member of Parliament , and wounded 11 .
One of the suspects may have been a sympathizer , and the other was probably motivated by money , Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak said .
Afghanistan ’s intelligence chief , Amrullah Saleh , blamed Al Qaeda for the attack .
He said three of the men involved were in contact with people outside Afghanistan , including people in Miram Shah , a town in Pakistan ’s tribal region of North Waziristan , the main base for Taliban and Al Qaeda in the region .
The three , who were killed in a house raid Wednesday , include an Afghan named Homayoun , suspected of directing an attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul in January , and two foreigners who were planning suicide bombings in the city .

I sat in the waiting room with one other applicant .
He was older than me by about ten years .
Judging by our clothes , it was clear that we were taking different approaches to this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity .
He dressed professionally .
Black suit , white shirt , striped tie .
His dress shoes were polished , and their shine matched well with that of his belt buckle .
I dressed casually .
Blue jeans .
Sneakers .
A brown collared sweater that hid the geeky maroon “ Computer Wizard ” t- shirt that I was using as an undershirt .
I was trying to dress the part .
I had heard that Google ’s dress code was simply “ You must wear clothes , ” so I wore something I might wear to the office if I got the job .
Sitting across from Mr. Business Suit , I started wondering if I made a huge mistake .
For whatever reason , Mr. Business Suit had n’t acknowledged my presence since I arrived .
He sat cross -legged with a magazine in his lap , half - heartedly thumbing through it without looking up .
He kept this up until the Hiring Manager opened the door to the adjacent office and called his name : “ Don ? ”
Don set his magazine down and stood up .
“ Good luck , ” I said hopefully .
He nodded at me and followed the Hiring Manager out of the room .
I took pleasure noticing that the Hiring Manager wore sneakers and jeans .
Now that I was the only applicant left in the room , I started reviewing the materials I brought with me to the interview .
In my “ Portfolio ” ( a thin 3 - ring binder ) I had :
Loose copies of my resume
How - To Instructions and Screenshots from three of my Open Source Projects
Two Letters of Recommendation from previous Employers
A Thank You Card that I planned to mail immediately following the interview
I imagined that I had at least ten minutes until the Hiring Manager asked for me .
I was therefore surprised when a petite woman entered the room and called my name : “ Shaun ? ”
“ Yes ? ”
“ I ’m Stacy , ” she said , extending her arm .
I stood up , tucked the Portfolio under my arm , and shook her hand .
“ Shaun Boyd .
How do you do ? ”
“ Just fine , thanks .
I have good news for you . ”
“ Oh ?
What ’s that ? ”
“ Your application has been fast - tracked .
I ’ll be giving you a quick tour of our facility , and then I ’ll introduce you to the team that ’s interested in your background . ”
“ Oh my , that is good news , ” I said through a huge smile .
“ How exciting ! ”
“ Definitely .
Follow me . ”
As I followed her through the double doors and down the corridor , Stacy filled me in on what being “ fast - tracked ” meant .
She explained that I still needed to be interviewed , but because my application was unanimously selected by an existing project team I was exempt from the first - tier “ initial screening ” interview .
I would start at the second - tier interview , which would be conducted by current members of the team I might be working with .
Stacy , a Senior Hiring Manager , would sit in during this interview to see how I interacted with the team members , and to answer any HR questions I might have about the position .
Stacy led me into her office and told me to have a seat .
She typed an instant message onto her screen , sent it , and then proceeded to copy and paste the same message to four or five other people .
She toggled through the responses for a few minutes before speaking to me again .
“ We have almost 30 minutes until the entire team will be available to meet with you .
Would you like to join me for some Free Lunch in the cafeteria ? ”
“ Absolutely , ” I said .
The cafeteria was intimidating .
Nearly every station had at least half - a- dozen Google employees in line for their Free Lunch .
Since they were already familiar with the selection and ordering process , they moved around the cafeteria with ease while I stood in place holding an empty tray .
Stacy pointed to the different stations , told me the type of cuisine that was served there , and encouraged me to not be shy .
“ Everything is always free , tasty , and nutritious , ” she said , more or less reciting everything I had heard about Google ’s cafeteria verbatim .
I got into the line for Chinese cuisine .
I asked for a helping of General Tso ’s Chicken over white rice .
The chef asked me if I ’d like some orange slices to go with my entree , and I said “ Yes please ! ”
I joined Stacy at a round table in the center of the cafeteria .
She introduced me to Tom and Anu , two of the team members who would be interviewing me once we finished our lunch .
She then busted my chops a little by telling them how I chose to get Free Lunch instead of a tour of the facility , but they said I made the right choice .
Anu scolded me for not taking advantage of the Slurpee machine .
Tom asked about the Portfolio I was carrying .
I paged through it briefly , and explained that it was basically a detailed addendum to my application .
I said that I ’d like to show it to the entire team during the interview , if they ’d be interested .
He gave me the impression that they would be .
Once we finished lunch , we returned our trays and left the cafeteria .
The four of us rode the elevator up together and got off on the floor where the meeting with the entire team would take place .
I followed Stacy around a corner and through a large wooden door .
I stepped onto the boat and felt disoriented .
I suddenly found myself on a sailboat with my father , in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean , rocking violently in a complete mess of a thunderstorm .
My dad was signaling for me to grab the lines near the bow , but before I could grab a hold of them a giant wave crashed into the broad side of the boat and knocked me overboard .
Right before I hit the surface of the water , I woke up .
…
I ’m jobless in Michigan .
For the past month , I ’ve been relentlessly applying to and interviewing for various local jobs with little to no success .
As of last night , the job hunting process has permeated my subconscious mind to the point where I ’m literally dreaming about it .
What I experienced in my dream was so vivid that I felt compelled to share it above .
No , it never happened .
No , it ’s not an accurate representation of the application and interview process at Google .
It is , however , more interesting than my recent experiences in the real world .
If I misled you , I ’m sorry .
I just wanted to take a break from writing cover letters to write something enjoyable .
I hope some readers will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it .

Update :
Let me tell you a story .
It 's a story about a husband and wife with vastly different movie tastes .
Their preferences were so wildly divergent that they could hardly ever agree on what movie to rent at the video store .
In fact , it has been known that the couple has even gotten into an argument over what movie to rent that grew so heated that it resulted in the two leaving the local video rental establishment empty handed .
That is , without their Blockbuster ( or indie flick ) in hand .
Enter Netflix .
Netflix 's queue system brought peace and tranquility to the movie renting process .
Husband and wife could both add the movies thatwanted to see to the queue .
What arrived was n't always everybody 's favorite but it was there , sitting on the coffee table , so often it was watched anyway during a quiet evening together after a hard day at work .
As great as this was , however , it was n't perfect .
Hubby and wife started jockeying the queue to get their picks at the top .
Even with the best of intentions ( most of the time ) , things got out of balance .
Questions came up like " Three Hal Hartley movies in a row ?
What 's up with that ? " and " How come Netflix is recommending ' Dr. Dolittle 2 ' ?
I did n't like the first one !
" Then Netflix said , " let there be profiles . "
And it was good .
Husband and wife could now maintain their own queues and ratings .
Husband was no longer recommended " Maid in Manhattan " and Netflix no longer thought that wife would ♥ " The Corporation " ( or any other documentary , for that matter ) .
Both were guaranteed to have something they wanted at almost any given time .
This brought balance to the household .
Good ch'i .
Harmony .
Why would Netflix want to mess with this ?
Why rock their boat ?
They 've been customers for almost six years , and have been so happy that they 've shared their story with dozens ( maybe even hundreds ) of people .
Why force two of your most loyal customers into the arms of another DVD rental company ?
Me ?
I 'll be their staunchest supporter , but I 'm not sure about these two .
And theybe the only ones .
It looks like these two will remain in movie rental bliss .
After an overwhelming response , Netflix has canceled their plans for killing off profiles .
Harmony is once again restored !

FBI files indict Bush , Cheney and Co. as war criminals
By Bill Van Auken
23 May 2008
The most stunning revelation in a 370 - page Justice US Department Inspector General ’s report released this week was that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had formally opened a “ War Crimes ” file , documenting torture they had witnessed at the Guantánamo Bay US prison camp , before being ordered by the administration to stop writing their reports .
The World Socialist Web Site , together with human rights groups and other opponents of US militarism and repression , has long insisted that the actions of the Bush administration — the launching of wars of aggression , assassinations , the abduction and detention of civilians without trial and , most repugnant of all , torture — constitute war crimes under any legitimate interpretation of longstanding international statutes and treaties .
To have this assessment confirmed , however , by the IG of the Justice Department , the only senior official there not answerable directly to the White House , and by agents of the FBI , an agency not known for its sensitivity to questions of democratic rights , is an indication of the rampant character of these crimes as well as the crisis they have engendered within the US government and America ’s ruling elite as a whole .
The report makes it absolutely clear that torture was ordered and planned in detail at the highest levels of the government — including the White House , the National Security Council , the Pentagon and the Justice Department .
Attempts to stop it on legal or pragmatic grounds by individuals within the government were systematically suppressed , and evidence of this criminal activity covered up .
There was no immediate reaction from the White House on these new revelations .
Responses from other agencies directly implicated in the crimes at Guantánamo were indicative of the general atmosphere of impunity in which the torture detailed in the IG ’s report continues to this day .
“ There ’s nothing new here , ” said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman .
A State Department spokesman , meanwhile , described the charges contained in the report as “ pretty vague . ”
Pretty vague ?
One ca n’t help but wonder what the spokesman would consider explicit .
The report contains page after page of testimony by FBI agents on the sadistic and sickening practices carried out at Guantánamo .
In one section , the report states : “ [ An FBI Agent ] recalled that , at some point during the interrogation , the military officer ‘ put water down ’ a seated detainee ’s throat .
He said he guessed that the purpose of the water was to give the detainee the sensation that he was drowning , so that he would provide the information that the interrogator wanted .
[ The agent ] stated that the detainee was gagging and spitting out water .
He said that the detainee appeared to be uncomfortable , and assumed that he had trouble breathing . ”
Consider the account of the interrogation of Mohamedou Ould Slahi , a Mauritanian national who was arrested by his own government , turned over to US forces and brought to Guantánamo in 2002 :
“ He was left alone in a cold room known as ‘ the freezer , ’ where guards would prevent him from sleeping by putting ice or cold water on him ...
“ He was subjected to sleep deprivation for a period of 70 days by means of prolonged interrogations , strobe lights , threatening music , forced intake of water , and forced standing .
“ He was deprived of clothing by a female interrogator ;
“ Two female interrogators touched him sexually and made sexual statements to him ;
“ Prior to and during the boat ride incident , he was severely beaten . ”
In addition , the document says , he was “ led to believe he was going to be executed , and urinated on himself , ” and was told that his mother and family would be detained and harmed .
Similar episodes were described , according to the IG report , by literally hundreds of FBI agents , who witnessed CIA , military and private contractor interrogators carry out illegal acts of torture and abuse against detainees .
In addition , the report cites : several agents who reported instances of beatings , 30 agents who reported witnessing prolonged shackling of detainees in stress positions , 70 agents who reported detainees being subjected to sleep deprivation , 29 agents who had information on the use of extreme temperatures in order to “ break the detainees ’ resolve to resist cooperating ” and 50 agents reporting the use of extended isolation to “ wear down a detainee ’s resistance . ”
In addition , four agents reported the kicking and beating to death of two detainees in Afghanistan who had been subjected to prolonged shackling in a standing position .
The episodes of torture detailed in this report are the tip of the iceberg .
They do not include the treatment of Murat Kurnaz , a Turkish citizen born in Germany , who was arrested during a trip to Pakistan in the fall of 2001 and was handed over to US officials for a $ 3,000 bounty .
First taken to the US base in Kandahar , Afghanistan , he was then transferred to Guantánamo .
While by 2002 the US authorities concluded that Kurnaz had nothing to do with terrorism , he was imprisoned until the middle of 2006 and released only because of pressure from the German government .
Barred from entry to the US , he testified via video link to a sparsely attended hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee this week .
“ I did nothing wrong and I was treated like a monster , ” he said .
He told how he was subjected to electric shocks , being suspended by his wrists for hours and subjected to the ‘ water treatment , ’ in which his head was stuck into a bucket of water and he was punched in the stomach , forcing him to inhale the liquid .
( The Justice Department Inspector General ’s report , it bears noting , affirmed that this last form of torture did not constitute “ waterboarding , ” but did represent “ an effort to intimidate the detainees and increase their feelings of helplessness . ” )
“ I know others have died from this kind of treatment , ” said Kurnaz .
“ I suffered from sleep deprivation , solitary confinement , religious and sexual humiliations .
I was beaten multiple times . ”
“ There was no law in Guantánamo , ” Kurnaz concluded .
“ I did n’t think this could happen in the 21st century ....
I could never have imagined that this place was created by the United States . ”
The inmates held at Guantánamo represent barely 1 percent of those detained at US prison camps and secret jails run by the military and the CIA in Iraq , Afghanistan and other points around the world .
An estimated 27,000 people are being held without charges , much less trials , many of them simply having disappeared into Washington ’s global gulag .
Some are held on prison ships , others in secret dungeons run jointly by the CIA and regimes to which it “ outsources ” detainees , like Egypt , Jordan and Morocco , where other , cruder forms of torture — being buried alive , given electric shocks or slashed with scalpels — are employed .
The report also reconfirms that the revolting scenes captured in the photographs taken at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq that came to light four years ago — naked and hooded men being subjected to torture and sexual humiliation by US guards — were no aberration .
The methods described in the report — forced nudity , the use of attack dogs in interrogations , chaining detainees in “ stress ” positions , leading them around on dog leashes , draping them in women ’s underwear — were identical to those officially blamed on a “ few bad apples ” at Abu Ghraib .
The uniformity of abuse at these widely separated facilities is evidence that the psychopathic and criminal sadism inflicted upon those detained by US forces was planned and orchestrated from the top .
Indeed , as ABC News revealed last month , top administration officials on the so - called Principals ’ Committee — Vice President Dick Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , CIA Director George Tenet , Attorney General John Ashcroft and National Security Council Adviser Condoleezza Rice — conducted detailed discussions on “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” which , according to ABC , “ were almost choreographed — down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic . ”
Bush subsequently told ABC that he was “ aware our national security team met on this issue .
And I approved . ”
The report establishes that FBI and Justice Department officials advised the White House National Security Council of their concern that the practices witnessed by the agents were “ gravely damaging ... the rule of law ” at Guantánamo .
In the end , however , they were told to back off , and they complied , thereby becoming accomplices in this criminality and its cover -up .
The revelations in the FBI report have provoked no significant protests or demands for action from the Democrats in Congress , or for that matter from the party ’s presidential contenders , Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , neither of whom have made torture an issue in their campaigns .
The New York Times Tuesday carried a lead editorial titled , “ What the FBI agents saw , ” which laid out the details of the report and stated that it “ shows what happens when an American president , his secretary of defense , his Justice Department and other top officials corrupt American law to rationalize and authorize the abuse , humiliation and torture of prisoners . ”
The paper ’s conclusion : “ The Democrats must press for full disclosure ” through hearings to uncover “ the extent of President Bush ’s disregard for the law and the Geneva Conventions . ”
This , they tell their readers , “ is the only way to get this country back to being a defender , not a violator , of human rights . ”
Such is the impotence of erstwhile American establishment liberalism .
The extent of the Bush administration ’s outright criminality has been thoroughly exposed over the course of several years .
The wholesale and deliberate violations of the Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture are , under international law , war crimes — just as the FBI recognized they were .
What is demanded is not another toothless congressional hearing , but rather the constitution of a war crimes tribunal .
Those responsible must be held accountable .
Bush , Cheney , Rice , Rumsfeld , Powell , Tenet and Ashcroft should be placed on trial .
Those like former White House counsel and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Cheney ’s chief of staff David Addington and Justice Department deputy assistant secretary John Yoo , who crafted the pseudo - legal arguments legitimizing torture , should be prosecuted as well , together with those military and intelligence officials who directed the criminal practices at Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , Bagram and other CIA and military camps and prisons .
The Democratic leadership has no desire or intention to fight for such a reckoning .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders have repeatedly insisted that impeachment of the president and vice president is “ off the table . ”
They have no interest in pursuing the administration on the issue of torture because they themselves are complicit , with Pelosi and other senior congressional Democrats having been briefed extensively on the criminal methods employed at Guantánamo , which they approved and concealed from the American people .
On a more fundamental level , the Democrats have been complicit in a policy of global militarism and aggression — carried out under the mantle of a “ global war on terrorism ” — which is directed at using armed force to further the interests of America ’s ruling oligarchy .
It is this criminal strategy — resulting in the loss of over 1 million Iraqi lives — that has given rise to the crime of torture itself .
Nonetheless , the deepening crisis of American capitalism is creating the conditions for profound shocks and changes in political and social relations that may well result in Bush , Cheney and Co. standing in the dock as war criminals .
Such a trial is vitally necessary from the standpoint of halting these ongoing crimes , preventing the use of similar methods against political opposition within the US itself and politically educating the American people .
This just in from the One First Street , N.E. , front : The Supreme Court has released its opinions in Exxon v. Baker , the punitive damages case , and Kennedy v. Louisiana , the case regarding the constitutionality of capital punishment for non-homicide child - rape .
In Exxon , eight justices concurred in a decision to remand and vacate the award ( Alito did not participate ) .
Scotus blog 's Tom Goldstein writes that the Court divided equally on whether maritime law permits punitives for the acts of agents .
The Court deemed the punitives ...

To the casual eye , Kevin Gutzman has written a scholarly book about Virginian political thought and practice from revolutionary times through 1840 .
But its scholarly merits do not exhaust the merits of Virginia ’s American Revolution : From Dominion to Republic , 1776 - 1840 .
Readers are also treated to the incidental pleasure of watching the Straussian rendering of American history dismantled piece by piece .
As that version would have it , the United States was formed by a single American people in the aggregate and is not and never was a compact among sovereign states .
The states are necessarily subordinate in their relationship with the federal government , never having enjoyed independent existences of their own .
They possess no corporate mechanism by which to resist federal usurpation , and they are bound to accept the federal government ’s monopoly on constitutional interpretation .
Gutzman begins his story in the 1760s , as the controversy with the mother country is growing more and more intense .
Richard Bland , who served in the House of Burgesses , began his 1766 pamphlet An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies by revisiting his colony ’s early history .
In coming to these shores , he said , Virginia ’s settlers had availed themselves of the natural right to emigrate .
They had come to a new land at their own expense , and were no longer subject to English law , having fallen under the " Law of Nature " instead .
That meant Virginians had been in a position to enter , of their own free will , into a mutually binding relationship with the Crown , which they subsequently did .
They expected future kings to abide by James I ’s promise that Virginia ’s form of government would never be altered .
Virginia could be taxed only by its representatives , and possessed " such Freedoms and Privileges as belong to the Free People of England . "
The Crown had repeated this guarantee numerous times , said Bland , in its commissions to Virginia ’s royal governors .

Thomas Jefferson lent his own support to this narrative in his Summary View of the Rights of British America , but as Gutzman observes , there is " virtually nothing in Jefferson ’s Summary View that Mason , Bland , Carter , or the Burgesses had not said before . "
The preamble to Virginia ’s republican constitution of 1776 spelled out Virginia ’s understanding of its legal status before the world , as it had been explicated by Bland and Jefferson .
Virginia had the exclusive authority to govern for Virginia .
The king , meanwhile , had unjustly refused to accept a position as head of a great commonwealth of dominions tied together by a common loyalty to his dynasty .
The grievances listed in the preamble revolve almost entirely around the issue of self - government — economics barely appears ; religion , not at all .
That self - government was later reaffirmed in the Articles of Confederation , Article II of which described the states as having maintained their " sovereignty , freedom , and independence . "
Virginians were persuaded to adopt the federal Constitution in 1788 on the grounds that that sovereignty would hardly be affected by the proposed confederation .
With all the emphasis that is normally placed on the Constitution ’s Framers , we are apt to neglect the importance of the ratifiers , for it is they whose interpretation of the Constitution — and in particular , the precise nature of what they believed they were getting into — is of ultimate importance .
And here is the heart of Gutzman ’s argument .
At Virginia ’s ratifying convention , the concern was raised that phrases like " general welfare " could be cited by ambitious politicians who wanted to exercise powers beyond those outlined in Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution .
Federalist Edmund Randolph , who had been Virginia ’s attorney general for the past decade , assured everyone that his fears were unfounded , for all rights were declared in the Constitution to be " completely vested in the people , unless expressly given away .
Can there be a more pointed or positive reservation ? "
In other words , this was a strictly limited and federal government .
George Nicholas , who would become Kentucky ’s first attorney general , explained :
If thirteen individuals are about to make a contract , and one agrees to it , but at the same time declares that he understands its meaning , signification and intent , to be , what the words of the contract plainly and obviously denote ; that it is not to be construed so as to impose any supplementary condition upon him , and that he is to be exonerated from it , whensoever any such imposition shall be attempted — I ask whether in this case , these conditions on which he assented to it , would not be binding on the other twelve ?
In like manner these conditions will be binding on Congress .
They can exercise no power that is not expressly granted them .
Randolph and Nicholas belonged to the five - man committee that was to draw up Virginia ’s ratification instrument .
They were in a unique position to articulate the understanding that would govern Virginia ’s ratification .
Virginians kept this limited view of the Constitution and the federal Union very much in mind into the 1790s .
Disturbed by Alexander Hamilton ’s financial program , particularly the federal assumption of state debts , Patrick Henry drafted a resolution for the Virginia legislature in which he borrowed from the language of the assurances of Randolph and Nicholas that the federal government would have only those powers expressly delegated to it .
The House passed it that day , the Senate six weeks later .
Shortly after Henry drafted his resolution , a General Assembly committee issued a report about the Washington Administration ’s policies , which it found alarming .
It declared ( borrowing from Randolph and Nicholas ) that the states were " contracting parties " whose rights were " sacred . "
It insisted , echoing Randolph , that " every power not granted [ to the federal government ] was retained " by Virginia .
What this means , Gutzman explains , is that
Nicholas and Randolph ’s explanation of the Constitution , and thus of the significance of Virginia ’s ratification , had come to be seen as completely authoritative by the overwhelming majority of Virginia ’s political leadership .
As in the Imperial Crisis and the Confederation period , Virginians conceived of their interstate union as precisely a federal union , a union among parties that were somehow on an equal footing ( as Nicholas had put it , thirteen contracting parties ) .
Virginia , not America , remained the primary political unit , the United States Government a convenience .
Virginians continued to draw out the implications of these views over the course of the 1790s .
According to John Taylor of Caroline , the great Virginian political pamphleteer , " The confederation is not a compact of individuals ; it is a compact of states . "
It was therefore the responsibility of the state legislatures to monitor the federal government and , if necessary , to prevent the enforcement of laws that violated the Constitution .
Constitutions are violated , Taylor said , and it would be absurd to expect the federal government to enforce the Constitution against itself .
If the very federal judges the Constitution was partly intended to restrain were the ones exclusively charged with enforcing it , then " America possesses only the effigy of a Constitution . "
The states , the very constituents of the Union , had to do the enforcing .
So by the time of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 , whose doctrines of interposition and nullification held that the states could refuse to enforce any federal law they considered unconstitutional , there was nothing new or unusual about such a view .
It was merely the logical implication of assurances by Federalists at the ratifying convention , assurances that had dominated Virginia ’s constitutional thought in the ensuing decade .
Those resolutions , in other words , " floated like leaves on the stream of the Virginia constitutional tradition of Jefferson ’s A Summary View of the Rights of British America , Richard Bland ’s An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies , John Taylor ’s pamphlets of the 1790s , and the Richmond Convention ’s instrument of ratification ( as explicated by George Nicholas and Edmund Randolph ) . "
In form and content they belonged to the tradition of Patrick Henry ’s Stamp Act Resolves and his General Assembly Resolution of 1790 .
Historians had sometimes claimed that Jefferson , the anonymous author of the Kentucky Resolutions , hastily devised nullification as an ad hoc response to the Alien and Sedition Acts ’ assaults on civil liberties .
But as Gutzman shows , nullification , Jefferson ’s proposed remedy , was in fact the culmination of a decade ’s worth of Virginian political thought traceable to the ratifying convention .
There was nothing ad hoc about it .
The principle of local self - government and against interference from distant central authorities was central to Virginian political thought both before and after the War for Independence .
This is a key point of continuity between late colonial Virginia and the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 .
" As during the Imperial Crisis , so after the enactment of the federal Constitution , Virginians put their state first and the distant authority they had erected for their state ’s convenience — formerly in Great Britain , now in the federal capital — somewhere down the list . "
Now if someone were to try to use this history as an argument in support of states ’ rights today , or more generally on behalf of the compact theory of the Union , one can imagine a predictable response : Virginia was only one state , and its ratification debates do not authoritatively bind others in their own interpretations of the Constitution and the nature of the Union .
Gutzman has anticipated this reply , and has elsewhere answered it — persuasively , to my mind .
Since Article II of the Articles of Confederation declared the states ( including Virginia ) to be sovereign , and since the delegates to Virginia ’s ratifying convention explained to the people of Virginia that their state was one of thirteen parties to a compact from which they would be exonerated if it exceeded its delegated powers , then how could other states lack such a status themselves ?
If we accept the co-equality of the states as a constitutional principle — that is , some states cannot have more or different rights than others — then no other conclusion seems to follow , even if other states may have understood the nature of the Union differently at the time they entered .

In light of all this , one can imagine Gutzman ’s opinion of the centralizing John Marshall , but Marshall figures little in this book , which focuses primarily on Virginia ’s experience rather than on the Union as a whole .
For Gutzman on Marshall , see his excellent book The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution .
In short , Virginia ’s American Revolution is not only an invaluable contribution to the scholarly literature , but it is also a treasure trove for those who would recapture the original American republic .

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Chemicals used to make nonstick ( teflon ) cookware and stain - resistant ( scotchgard ) fabrics are spreading around the world and turning up in surprising places , everywhere from wildlife and drinking water supplies to human blood .
Now , a team of researchers including Kathleen Arcaro of the University of Massachusetts Amherst has found these suspected carcinogens in samples of human milk from nursing mothers in Massachusetts .
" Perfluorinated compounds , or PFCs , are found in human blood around the world , including the blood of newborns , but this is the first study in the United States to document their occurrence in human milk , " says Arcaro , a professor in the department of veterinary and animal sciences and a member of the environmental sciences program .
" While nursing does not expose infants to a dose that exceeds recommended limits , breast milk should be considered as an additional source of PFCs when determining a child 's total exposure .
"
The breast milk was collected as part of Arcaro 's larger , ongoing study examining the link between environmental exposures and breast cancer risk .
Chemical analyses were conducted in the laboratory of Kuruntachalam Kannan at the New York State Department of Health .
Results are scheduled for publication in Environmental Science and Technology .
This research was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences .
Milk samples were collected in 2004 from 45 nursing mothers in Massachusetts and analyzed for nine different PFCs .
Perfluorooctane - sulfonate ( PFOS ) , used to make stain - resistant fabrics , was found in the highest concentration in breast milk , followed by perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) , used in nonstick cookware .
On average , each liter of milk , which is roughly equivalent to one quart , contained 131 billionths of a gram of PFOS and 44 billionths of a gram of PFOA .
The amount of PFCs that nursing infants would consume each day did not exceed Total Daily Intake Values set by the U.K .
Food Standards Agency Committee on Toxicology , which were based on a review of current toxicology studies .
Arcaro cautions that recommended intakes of PFCs based on Total Daily Intake values should be interpreted with caution , since there is no consensus on these values , which are derived from rodent studies .
Mothers should also compare the risks of breast feeding with the benefits , which include better nutrition and immune system development and enhanced defense against infections in children .
Milk from mothers who were nursing for the first time was also studied to see how PFC concentrations changed over time .
Total PFC concentrations and the concentration of PFOS increased during the first six months of nursing .
" This may be related to increased food intake to meet the energy demands of nursing , and changes in food consumption patterns in nursing mothers , " says Arcaro .
" In a Canadian study , diet was shown to contribute 61 percent of a person 's total daily intake of PFCs .
" Food sources of PFCs include grease - resistant packaging such as microwave popcorn bags and pizza boxes , as well as fish and other animals that contain these chemicals .
Exposure can also come from personal care products including dental floss and shampoo .
PFCs are persistent chemicals that can linger in the environment and the human body for years without being broken down .
Several studies have documented their presence in the blood of newborns collected immediately after birth , and in children between the ages of 2 and 12 , who have blood levels similar to those found in adults .
These studies led the team to investigate breast feeding as a source of PFCs , information that will be needed to determine the sources and magnitude of exposure in infants and children and whether PFCs have an effect on birth outcomes in newbornsUniversity of Massachusetts AmherstLeslee Dru Browning is a 6th generation Medical Herbalist & Nutritionist from the ancestral line of Patty Bartlett Sessions ; Pioneer Mid-Wife & Herbalist .

Why YSK : I used to be a drain cleaner .
EVERY SINGLE DAY
I had people coming to me for a second opinion because they were told they had to replace their sewer line for 5 grand .
In the two years I spent drain cleaning , I only came across a whopping FOUR people that actually needed their sewer line replaced and well over a hundred that were told they had to .
Here are some of the many tactics these companies use :
- The most common one is that they could n’t get their blades past a blockage so the line must be broken .
If this were true , the blades would come back with either mud on them , or completely clean and shiny .
Even then , there are lots of other reasons why they could be shiny so it ’s not a definite break in the line .
- They clean the line with small or sometimes even no blades .
If it ’s the mainline , at least 3 inch blades should be used .
Preferably 4 inch though .
But some companies do n’t do that .
So they will poke a hole into the blockage , and everything will run just fine ... for a few days .
Shortly after , that tiny hole will close again and you ’ll call them back out .
They ’ll try to convince you it ’s because the line is broken when it ’s not .
- They make you think roots in the mainline are a huge deal and the line must be replaced .
Roots are the most common cause of sewer line backups .
It ’s incredibly common and should be expected if you have a tree near your sewer line .
Some people will go ten years before their first root caused backup because it can take time for the roots to get through the pipe .
Your sewer line is still in good shape .
Just get it snaked every year and use root killer to slow the growth .
- They scope the line and find bellies with sitting water or small offsets .
While not ideal , most houses have them and it ’s not necessarily a big deal .
It ’s something to keep an eye on , not waste 5 - 10 grand on .
Here ’s some general tips regarding the trade :
- If the company does n’t have the prices online , do n’t tell them if you ’re renting out the house .
If you ’re a landlord they ’ll assume you ’ve got extra cash and up charge you .
- If your basement has a floor drain , get a $ 10 water alarm .
If it ever backs up , you ’ll know immediately and stop the spread of water before it causes massive amounts of damage .
This is particularly important if you do n’t go into the basement often .
I once went to an elderly lady ’s house that had a foot of water in the basement .
She was too old to go downstairs and did n’t notice the smell because she was hooked up to an oxygen tank thingy .
Decades of memories stored in boxed were destroyed .
- If you have a sewer line scoped , make sure you see them do it yourself .
They like to swap footage with another house and act like your line is broken .
Also make sure they use at least 3 inch blades on your mainline .
Also make sure to get a copy of the footage .
You can send it to multiple companies and they ’ll usually give you their opinion for free so you do n’t need it scoped multiple times !
- Clean out the p-traps to your sinks .
I ’ve had dozens of people call me to spend five minutes unscrewing their trap , cleaning it out , the putting it back .
When I try to tell them that it ’s easy to do yourself they say they do n’t mess around with anything plumbing related .
But seriously , watch a two minute video and do it yourself in 5 minutes and save a hundred bucks .
-DO NOT FLUSH ANYTHING DOWN THE TOILET UNLESS IT CAME OUT OF YOU , OR ITS TOILET PAPER !!!!
It does n’t matter if your wipes say they ’re “ flushable ” .
it does n’t matter if it ’s “ just a few tampons ” .
It does n’t matter if you “ did n’t think your kid was dumb enough to flush his cat stuffed animal ” .
Do n’t do it !
Just because it gets past the toilet does n’t mean it gets through the whole line .
If you ’re flushing wipes or tampons , there ’s a good chance your just collecting them and one day you will be met with a very unpleasant surprise .
I ’ve seen anywhere from a couple tampons clogging the line to filling up HALF OF A FIVE GALLON BUCKET with tampons .
The only thing worse than spending 10 hours fishing for tampons is spending a thousand bucks for someone to fish for your tampons .
There ’s a lot more to it but I ’m doubtful many will even read this .
Which is a shame because I saw people getting scammed every single day and it ’s easily avoidable .
Most people do n’t know much of this and these companies know that .
And they take advantage of it .
Edit : I forgot to mention , do n’t use any draino or anything similar .
It ’s very acidic .
It can melt away pipes overtime and does a very poor job anyways .
It usually only pokes holes into things .
Save your pipes and clean out the trap yourself by hand , or call someone to do it .
Also , I highly recommend never using a snake yourself for the mainline , or even really a kitchen line .
I have no idea how places like Home Depot are allowed to rent them out to just anyone .
I know people that were trained to use them and still lost a finger .
If you ’re not incredibly familiar with it you can go from being just fine to missing a finger in literally a split second .
Spend the extra hundred dollars and have a professional do it .
It takes a long time to be trained to use it and messing up or not knowing how to use it properly can cost you a finger or two .
Also , if your toilets start to bubble / gargle when you run any water , your line is most likely going to be backing up .
You could have a backup in one minute , or in a week .
It ’s best to have someone out ASAP !
People are asking why you should n’t use the snake yourself or how I could cause a lot of damage .
This is why .
BE WARNED , THIS IS NSFW AND GOREY .
And this is n’t even the worst that can happen !
Also , drain cleaners love kitchen sink disposals because it keeps them in business .
The more food you put down , the more likely it will get clogged .
Especially avoid greasy foods , egg shells , and coffee grounds .
If you ’d like to avoid a backup , do n’t put any food down the sink and use a paper towel to wipe off excess grease on dishes !
Opinion
A topflight science brainbox at Cambridge University has weighed into the ever - louder and more unruly climate / energy debate with several things that so far have been mostly lacking : hard numbers , willingness to upset all sides , and an attempt to see whether the various agendas put forward would actually stack up .
Professor David J C MacKay of the Cambridge University Department of Physics holds a PhD in computation from Cal Tech and a starred first in Physics , so we can take it that he knows his numbers .
And , as he points out , numbers are typically lacking in current discussion around carbon emissions and energy use .
MacKay tells
The Reg that he was first drawn into this field by the constant suggestion — from the Beeb , parts of the government etc — that we can seriously impact our personal energy consumption by doing such things as turning our TVs off standby or unplugging our mobile - phone chargers .
Anyone with even a slight grasp of energy units should know that this is madness .
Skipping one bath saves a much energy as leaving your TV off standby for over six months .
People who wash regularly , wear clean clothes , consume hot food or drink , use powered transport of any kind and live in warm houses have no need to worry about the energy they use to power their electronics ; it ’s insignificant compared to the other things .
Most of us do n’t see basic hygiene , decent food and warm houses as sinful luxuries , but as things we can reasonably expect to have .
This means that society as a whole needs a lot of energy , which led MacKay to consider how this might realistically be supplied in a low - carbon fashion .
He ’s coming at the issues from a green / ecological viewpoint , but climate - change sceptics who are nonetheless concerned about Blighty becoming dependent on Russian gas and Saudi oil — as the North Sea starts to play out — will also find his analysis interesting .
Eliminating carbon largely equates to eliminating gas and oil use .
“ I do n’t really mind too much what your plan is , ” MacKay told The Reg this week .
“ But it ’s got to add up . ”
He says he ’s largely letting his machine - learning lab at Cambridge run itself these days , and is personally spending most of his time on trying out different energy scenarios .
MacKay sets out his calculations in a book , Sustainable Energy —
Without the hot air .
You can download it here .
As he says :
The one thing I am sure of is that the answers to our sustainable energy questions will involve numbers ; any sane discussion of sustainable energy requires numbers .
This book ’s got ’em , and it shows how to handle them .
He emphasises that the book is n’t quite finished yet , and says he ’s always glad to hear from someone who has something to add or has spotted a mistake .
In Without the hot air , MacKay examines our total energy usage in the UK , and then tries to provide a similar amount of energy but without using any oil and gas .
He ’s willing to consider windpower on a thoroughly heroic scale , as it is probably the renewable technology best suited to the UK climate .
As a benchmark for wind , he writes :
Our conclusion : if we covered the windiest 10 per cent of the country with windmills , we might be able to generate half of the energy used by driving a car 50 km per day each .
Britain ’s onshore wind energy resource may be “ huge , ” but it ’s not as huge as our huge consumption .
I should emphasize how audacious an assumption I ’m making . …
The windmills required … are fifty times the entire wind hardware of Denmark ; seven times all the windfarms of Germany ; and double the entire fleet of all wind turbines in the world .
This conclusion – that the greatest that onshore wind could add up to , albeit ‘ huge ’ , is much less than our consumption – is important …
IN THE early 1970s a fourfold rise in the price of oil almost brought the world to a standstill .
The shock of the Arab embargo left a deep mark in many countries : America subjected its cars to fuel - efficiency standards , France embraced nuclear power — though sadly shoene rukku , or “ energy - conscious fashion ” , the inspiration for Japan 's fetching short - sleeved business suit , was ahead of its time .
Thirty - five years on , oil prices have quadrupled again , briefly soaring to a peak of just over $ 135 a barrel .
But , so far , this has been a slow - motion oil shock .
If the Arab oil - weapon felt like a hammer - blow , this time stagnant oil output and growing emerging - market demand have squeezed the oil market like a vice .
For almost five years a growing world shrugged it off .
Only now is it recoiling in pain .
This week French fishermen clogged up the port of Dunkirk and British lorry - drivers choked roads into London and Cardiff .
Nicolas Sarkozy , France 's president , suggested subsidising the worst affected and curbing taxes on petrol ; Britain 's beleaguered government is being pressed to forgo its tax increases on motorists .
In America falling house prices have left consumers resentful — and short of money .
Congress and presidential candidates have been drafting schemes and gas - tax holidays like so many campaign leaflets .
Gordon Brown , Britain 's prime minister , thinks the big oil producers can be persuaded to come to the rescue .
But only Saudi Arabia shows any enthusiasm for that .
Elsewhere , output is growing agonisingly slowly .
That is causing hardship and recrimination .
But it could also come to represent an opportunity .
The slow - motion shock seems irresistible today , but in time it will give rise to an equally unstoppable and more positive slow - motion reaction ( see article ) .
Action replay
It is clear that high oil prices are hurting many economies — especially in the rich world .
Goldman Sachs reckons consumers are handing over $ 1.8 trillion a year to oil producers .
The wage - price spiral of the 1970s has been avoided , but the income shock is painful .
Beset by scarce credit , falling asset prices and costly food , developed - country households are hardly well - equipped to foot the oil bill .
America 's emergency tax rebate , voted this year to help people cope with the credit crunch , has in effect been taken right away again .
Stuck for answers , politicians have been looking for scapegoats .
Top of the list are the speculators profiting from other people 's hardship .
Some $ 260 billion is invested in commodity funds , 20 times the level of 2003 .
Surely all that hot money has supercharged the demand for oil ?
But that is plain wrong .
Such speculators do not own real oil .
Every barrel they buy in the futures markets they sell back again before the contract ends .
That may raise the price of “ paper barrels ” , but not of the black stuff refiners turn into petrol .
It is true that high futures prices could lead someone to hoard oil today in the hope of a higher price tomorrow .
But inventories are not especially full just now and there are few signs of hoarding .
If the speculators are not to blame , what about the oil companies , which have failed to increase output in spite of record profits ?
Profiteering , say some .
However , that accusation does n't stand up to much scrutiny either .
The oil price is set in a market .
For Shell , Exxon et al to hoard oil underground would be to leave billions of dollars of investment languishing unused .
Others fear that oil is pricey because it is running out .
But there is little evidence to support the doctrine of “ peak oil ” in its extreme form .
The Middle East still seems to contain a sea of the stuff .
Even if new finds elsewhere have been rarer and less accessible than in the past , vast quantities of oil could now be profitably stripped from tar sands and shale .
The truth is more prosaic .
Finding and developing new oil fields is an expensive and time - consuming business .
The giant new fields in the deep water off Brazil are unlikely to produce oil for a decade or more .
Furthermore , oil is perverse .
When prices are low , oil - rich countries welcome the low - cost , high - tech and well - capitalised oil firms .
When prices are high , countries like Russia and Venezuela kick them out again .
Likewise the engineers , survey ships and seismic rigs that oil firms need to find and produce new deposits are expensive right now .
The costs of finding oil have , temporarily , doubled precisely because everybody wants to give them work .
Hope at the bottom of the barrel
So the oil shock will take time to abate .
Some greens may welcome that , seeing three - figure oil as a way of limiting greenhouse emissions .
Conservation will indeed increase .
But everything high prices achieve could be done better by sensible carbon taxes .
As well as curbing oil use , high prices have put tar sands in business which create far more carbon dioxide than conventional oil .
Profits are going to ugly oil - fed regimes , not Western exchequers .
And the wild unpredictability of prices will blunt the effect of dear oil on people 's behaviour .
From this perspective , governments should speed up the adjustment — or at least stop delaying it .
Half the world 's people are sheltered from fuel prices by subsidies — which , perversely , have boosted demand and mostly benefited the better off .
Now countries like Indonesia , Taiwan and Sri Lanka have begun to realise that they can ill afford this .
Cutting fuel taxes in the rich world makes no sense either ( see article ) .
There are better ways to return cash to struggling voters .
The 1970s showed how demand and supply , inelastic in the short run , eventually give rise to conservation and new production .
When all those new fields are on - stream , when the SUVs have been sold and the boilers replaced , the downcycle will take hold .
By then the slow - motion oil shock could have catalysed momentous change .
Right now motorists have no substitute for oil .
But it is no coincidence that car companies are suddenly accelerating their plans to sell electric hybrids that are far cheaper to run than petrol or diesel cars at these prices .
The first two oil shocks banished oil from power generation .
How fitting if the third finished the job and began to free transport from oil 's century - long monopoly .
‘ Axis of Evil ’ author David Frum Responds to Questions With Physical Assault and Obscene Language
Aaron Dykes / JonesReport.com | April 28 , 2008
A member of We Are Change L.A. was assaulted and cursed at by former White House speech writer David Frum during a book signing , according to reports .
Frum– a neo -con policy maker who is often credited with coining the phrase ‘ Axis of Evil ’– allegedly lost his temper when he recognized Stewart Howe , of We Are Change L.A. , from a previous book signing .
Howe approached Frum to ask a question when Frum became angry , and then violent , reports indicate .
Frum told Howe , " The one thing I regret from our last conversation is that I did n’t say to you what my friend Christopher Hitchens said … which is , you should fuck off . " [ expletive is reportedly a direct quote ]
According to Howe , David Frum then got up from behind the book signing table and swung at Stewart and his camera while he was phrasing a question about the unraveling 9/11 cover - up and potential criminal charges .
Frum could be the first of former Bush Administration officials to actually get violent with reporters , though a number of mainstream media outlets have called for violence against 9/11 truthers , and at least one Bush supporter physically attacked a truther last week .
David Frum was quoted as saying , " Turn off the camera .
Go away ! " as he smacked the camera during the book signing event .
Howe replied " I will not go away .
I will not turn off the camera .
We are in public .
Are you worried , perhaps , about the criminal liability of being a partner to mass murder after the fact ?
You know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out . "
Reportedly , David Frum swung repeatedly at the camera during this statement before members of event security separated him from Howe and sent him back to his seat .
Moments later , Frum got up from his seat to assault Howe for a second time after over - hearing a discussion with the security guard regarding ‘ the neo-con agenda laid out in PNAC documents . ’
David Frum allegedly tried to break the camera while Howe announced to the recording that " he ’s assaulting me , and I have it on film . "
Frum then said , " I do n’t want to be on your camera . "
Stewart Howe responded , " We ’re in public .
I ’ve just been assaulted by David Frum on film . "
Security escorted the We Are Change L.A. reporter from the event on grounds that he was obstructing the book signing , though the guard agreed that Howe had a right to free speech and that Frum had assaulted him .
Members of the book signing staff objected that he was holding up the line .
Howe objected that no one was in - line and that he had asked the question in a civil and polite manner .
Members of We Are Change L.A. tried to clarify the incident with David Frum during an event the following day ( April 27th ) where reporters say Frum again became upset and battered their cameras .
Two members of We Are Change in New York were recently assaulted for asking a question during a Laura Bush speaking event .
Gary Talis was falsely charged with 3rd degree Assault and framed in the NY Post as having attacked a girl in a wheelchair despite the fact that witnesses on the scene say that it was actually the girl ’s father who had provoked the fight with Talis and even used his disabled daughter ‘ as a weapon . ’
Multiple neo-con blogs then called for violence to be carried out against Talis , despite the fact that the NY Post account contradicted the police report .
The response of provocation and violence has been entirely unilateral on the part of neo-conservatives and their supporters– an unfortunate response to the peaceful activism of We Are Change and other 9/11 truth groups that have proved effective at holding members of the establishment accountable .
The use of violence to combat peaceful activism was first called for in talking points from the mainstream media and is now being put into action by neo -con thugs everywhere to intimidate and challenge those trying to expose the truth .
Howe is considering pressing charges against the former Bush Administration speech writer in relation to assault / battery on the basis of video evidence and security eyewitnesses .
RUSH TRANSCRIPT BELOW ( BASED ON AUDIO )
— VIDEO COMING SOON —
HOWE : Here he is – the man the myth , the legend– David Frum .
FRUM : The one thing I regret from our last conversation is that I did n’t say to you what my friend Christopher Hitchens said .
HOWE : What , you ’re friend said which type of medication ?
( apparently referring to a previous incident )
FRUM : No , no , — which is , you should fuck off .
HOWE : Oh , okay .. alright …
Well , I guess we kind of saw that one coming — but gosh you got me back on my heels here .
Let me then pose you an A or B question very civilly – A ) do you think you think that this hoax which is the 9/11 investigation is going to keep on going
( Frum gets up from table approximately 5 ft. away )
HOWE ( cont ’d ) : could you perhaps see that there will be culpability fears
( Frum now approaching Howe from around camera– reaching for camera lens , swatting )
FRUM : Turn off the camera .
( smacks it )
Go away !
[ Hit camera ]
( Frum walks away . )
HOWE : I will not go away .
I will not turn off the camera .
We are in public .
Are you worried , perhaps , about the criminal liability ?
( Howe turns to avoid Frum swinging , hits camera )
HOWE ( cont’d ) :
Of being a partner to mass murder after the fact .
You know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out .
FRUM : Go away –
( An older woman wearing an ‘ event staff ’ shirt gets between the altercation )
EVENT STAFF : I ’m going to have to ask you to leave ; ( Frum walks away )
HOWE : I ’m being polite ; I ’m asking him a question .
It ’s my first amendment right as a citizen .
EVENT STAFF : But not in this context .
HOWE : And he ’s too scared to address the question .
Look at him running away .
As the truth continues to come out , Mr. Frum , there are going to be criminal charges against all of those who are complicit in mass murder after the fact because of the cover - up .
And you know that ’s very real possibility .
You should be scared .
You should be unwilling to address this , you know .
Because when it all comes out there are going to be a lot of people held responsible for the deaths .
I mean , you must be a little concerned about that .
You know the house of cards is falling apart .
The 9/11 commission report is a joke .
SOMEONE IN CROWD :
If you want to ask him a question , buy a book
HOWE : I ’m asking a question .
There ’s no one in line .
( Security walks up ) .
HOWE : I ’m asking a question
SECURITY : What ’s going on here ?
BOOKSIGNING STAFF :
The author is signing for the people who ’ve made purchases .
( There is no one actually in line . )
And we do n’t know the validity of him being press .
( muffled audio )
HOWE : No , I have not made a purchase
WOMAN : He ’s crowding me in line
HOWE : But there ’s nobody in line
HOWE : I ’M actually with WeAreChange LA media and I ’m asking a civil , polite question .
IF the 911 investigation continues to fall apart and the facts come out , if he ’s worried about being held liable as a co-conspirator in cover - up after the fact .
SECURITY : I see what you ’re saying .
it ’s a reasonable question .
We just do n’t want anyone creating an obstruction .
HOWE : As you can see , there ’s nobody in line to get books signed .
SECURITY : I know , I understand , but you ’re making people uncomfortable
HOWE : Yeah , well , it ’s not my intention to be irritating , but it is an irritating question– the situation of the murders in Iraq and the murders on 9/11 were irritating beyond irritating .
HOWE : And Mr. Frum is a neo-conservative ; they have spelled out their agenda– ( Frum gets up from table ) –in the PNAC docs and he must have to run away rather than face a simple question .
( Frum again lunges at Howe , swings at camera . )
HOWE : Now He ’s assaulting me .
And I have it on film .
FRUM : I do n’t want to be on your camera .
HOWE : We ’re in public .
I ’ve just been assaulted by David Frum on film .
( Security guard witnesses this . )
SECURITY :
You need to take a walk with me this way .
HOWE : And the grounds would be ?
SECURITY : I ’m just trying to save you some trouble .

MILAN  A long - delayed trial of C.I.A. operatives and former top Italian intelligence officials moved forward here on Wednesday , as a judge ruled that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi could be called to testify about the abduction of a radical Muslim cleric here in 2003 .
Testimony also began Wednesday .
The cleric ’s wife , Ghali Nabila , said her husband , Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr , known as Abu Omar , was taken from Italy and transferred to a prison in Egypt , where , she said , he was repeatedly tortured .
While acknowledging a program of “ extraordinary rendition , ” or abducting terrorism suspects outside the United States , the Bush administration claims that no one is sent to nations that torture .
“ I found him wasted , skinny  so skinny  his hair had turned white , he had a hearing aid , ” Ms. Nabila said , recounting her husband ’s condition between prison stays in 2004 .
Wearing a veil that revealed only her eyes , Ms. Nabila at first said she “ did n’t want to talk about ” any abuse against her husband in prison .
But advised by prosecutors that she had no choice , she told the court in tears : “ He was tied up like he was being crucified .
He was beat up , especially around his ears .
He was subjected to electroshocks to many body parts . ”
Jazz greats have said that spinning off an improvised tune is like entering another world , and a new study has provided that world ’s first map .
Researchers at the National Institutes of Health gave six professional jazz pianists a few days to memorize a never - before - seen tune .
The musicians then tickled the ivories while being scanned by an MRI machine , playing the novel composition and an improvisation in the same key .
As compared with the memorized melody , the improvised jam elicited stronger activity in the medial prefrontal cortex , a part of the brain active in autobiographical storytelling , among other varieties of self - expression .
Supporting the altered - state notion , activity dipped in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( an area linked to planning and self - censorship ) , which , the researchers point out , is similar to what happens during dreams .
They note that the same pattern might show up in all kinds of improvisations , from solving problems on the fly to riffing on a topic of high interest — such as , say , your favorite jazz musicians
This story was originally printed with the title , " Roots of Creativity " .
It ’s widely accepted in the software industry that some programmers are much more productive than others .
Many experts cite an order - of - magnitude productivity difference between the “ best ” and “ average ” programmers .
This “ factor of 10 ” difference is so commonly referenced that “ 10X Software Development ” is the name of the blog by development productivity guru Steve McConnell , who says :
Numerous studies have found 10:1 differences in productivity and quality among individuals and even among teams .
The original study that found huge variations in individual programming productivity was conducted in the late 1960s by Sackman , Erikson , and Grant .
They studied professional programmers with an average of 7 years ’ experience and found that the ratio of initial coding time between the best and worst programmers was about 20 to 1 ; the ratio of debugging times over 25 to 1 ; of program size 5 to 1 ; and of program execution speed about 10 to 1 .
They found no relationship between a programmer ’s amount of experience and code quality or productivity .
Some other noteworthy comments on the subject :
“ The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones .
They are an order - of - magnitude better , measured by whatever standard : conceptual creativity , speed , ingenuity of design , or problem - solving ability . ” — Randall E. Stross
“ A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator , but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer . ”
— Bill Gates “ 90 % of the code is written by 10 % of the programmers . ” — Robert C. Martin
But it ’s not just that some programmers work faster ; some programmers can do things that few other programmers can do .
These are your visionaries and trailblazers .
I call this sometimes - 10X / sometimes - infinite advantage : The “ Tenfinity Factor . ”
In my 25 - year programming career , which includes 6 software companies I started , I ’ve had the pleasure to manage and work with many programmers offering a wide range of skills .
Specifically in our venture - backed company during the dot - com boom , though I did n’t write much code , I managed a department of 27 technical people that included some of the best programmers available in a Midwest town like Cincinnati .
In my experience , the tenfinity factor is definitely real .
This wide productivity gap results in five major classes of computer programmers :
1. Visionary / Artist Programmer
The Visionary Programmer is a rare breed that can capture lightning in a bottle and produce code that 99.9 % of others cannot .
These inventors create new applications and paradigms that drive innovation in the software industry .
Napster , Netscape , and the World Wide Web are all inventions from visionary programmers .
For these people , software is more art than science .
Speed and quality are not always the best , but great fortunes are made on the backs of these wizards .
Most development shops can afford only a single visionary programmer , which is often the company ’s technical founder or CTO .
2. Trailblazer Programmer
The Trailblazer Programmer takes a good idea and runs with it .
These are the people who most often create the prototypes that ultimately become useful products .
Trailblazers can produce in a day what takes most programmers weeks or months .
Trailblazers are always experimenting with new tools and technologies , constantly learning and searching for ways to increase productivity , and typically serve as mentors and teachers to other programmers .
You will often find a trailblazer coding away late at night when everyone else has left the office .
Though these professionals tend to be expensive , every successful development shop needs at least one or two trailblazers .
3. Workhorse Programmer
The Workhorse Programmer is the backbone of any productive development shop .
These people are not particularly innovative , but they are highly productive and reliable .
Give a workhorse programmer a good set of specs and the right tools , and they will often deliver on time and within budget .
4. Drone Programmer
Filling the fat in a true bell curve , many programmers are “ drones ” who work 9 - 5 to collect a paycheck .
These people shy away from new technology , avoid learning new things , and likely will not be reading this article .
Most large development shops are full of drones because management fails to realize that more expensive programmers are actually cheaper .
5. Idiot Programmer
Every village has its idiot , and software development is no exception .
Programming requires abstract and logical thinking , yet some right - brained people are lured to programming in search of a good salary .
Idiot Programmers often struggle with the simplest of algorithms , constantly miss deadlines and fail to make much progress .
The sad thing is these are often wonderful people , but simply in the wrong job .
So do you believe in the tenfinity factor ?
What have you seen on the job ?

Here ’s an interesting chain of thought …
Imagine a black hole sucking in protons and electrons .
With their higher mass , protons are likely to be preferentially sucked , giving the black hole a positive charge .
( That ’s not so unusual in space : a similar mechanism can give planets a charge because electrons escape their gravity more easily . )
But black holes also create such strong electrostatic fields at the horizon that positrons and electrons simply appear out of the vacuum .
In those circumstances , it ’ll look as if the protons being sucked into the black hole are being converted into positrons .
So these kinds of black holes will look and behave like antimatter factories , say Cosimo Bambi from Wayne State University in Detroit and pals .
How might we we spot these exotic objects ?
Bambi and friends say a sure signature would be an excess of positrons in cosmic rays with an energy between 1 and 100 MeV coming from a black hole .
Anybody seen any of these ?

Masri is believed to have formed al - Qaeda 's first cell in Baghdad
The United States military in Iraq says a man detained in the northern city of Mosul is not in fact the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq .
An earlier statement from the Iraqi defence ministry said that al - Masri had been captured .
But an American military spokeswoman , Peggy Kageleiry , said Abu Ayyub al - Masri had not been arrested .
She said confusion had arisen because a man with a similar name to the al - Qaeda in Iraq leader had been detained .
Al - Qaeda in Iraq has been blamed for or has claimed responsibility for some of the bloodiest insurgent attacks in Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
Members of al - Qaeda are believed to have regrouped in the northern city since the beginning of the US troops " surge " last year .
Al - Masri is believed to have helped Abu Musab al - Zarqawi form the first al - Qaeda cell in Baghdad .
Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 .
In April 2007 , he was named " minister of war " in the 10 - man cabinet of the Islamic State of Iraq , an umbrella organisation of Sunni militant groups .
Wired Senior Editor Nick Thompson was on the Today Show this morning talking about why the N95 and iPhone are the best high - end phones and the RAZR is the best cheap phone .
OK , fair enough .
Unfortunately for Nick , when he dropped the RAZR to the floor to demonstrate its durability , it ended up getting destroyed in the process .
It 's a sound and sight I 'm sure many of you former RAZR owners are familiar with .
Well , I guess it proved your point , Nick : the RAZR is cheap .
Very cheap .

Forty - eight hours after Pakistani voters overwhelmingly repudiated the Bush administrations " man in Islamabad , " President Pervez Musharraf , Washington seemed uncertain about whether the election results marked a setback to U.S. strategic interests or an advance .
On the one hand , Washington will have to deal with a new government , some of whose likely leaders have publicly denounced U.S. policy in Pakistan .
This makes administration officials  who , as recently as last month , described Musharraf as " indispensable " to the " war on terror "  uneasy .
Given the administrations staunch backing for Musharraf  particularly over the past year as he dismissed the supreme court , altered the constitution , and cracked down against the secular opposition 
Mondays vote seemed to be almost as much a rebuff to Washington as to Musharraf himself .
On the other hand , the crushing defeat of Islamist parties , particularly in some key border areas , including the North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) , marks a major advance for U.S. hopes to contain the spread of the Taliban insurgency beyond the Frontier Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) where it is based .
" [ The Islamist parties ] have been replaced by secular Pashtun nationalist parties who are hostile to the Taliban and who , at a minimum , will not allow the institutions of these provincial governments to be used by collaborators of the Taliban , " Steve Coll , a South Asia expert and president of the New America Foundation , told an interviewer on public television Tuesday .
Moreover , if a functioning government willing to work with Washington can be quickly cobbled together by the two leading opposition parties  the Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) and the Pakistan Muslim League - N ( PML - N )  the " war on terror " could gain renewed legitimacy in the country .
Many analysts here describe Pakistan as " the central front " in that war .
" The counter - terrorism effort that we are doing there is going to be much strengthened when it has the support of the people , " said Wendy Chamberlin , who served as U.S. ambassador in Islamabad under both presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
" I think we are actually in a stronger position to work together [ with Pakistan ] to eliminate extremist elements in Pakistan . "
While the Bush administration praised the vote and pledged to continue working with both Musharraf and any new government that emerges from ongoing negotiations between the two main opposition parties , independent voices called on Bush to drop his support for the former military chief in favor of a stronger embrace of the countrys democratic forces .
" The administration should urge its not - so - indispensable ally to step down , " advised the Washington Post , in a reference to the insistence last month by a senior State Department official that Musharraf was " indispensable " to the pursuit of Washingtons " global war on terror . "
" Mondays election means that [ the Bush administration ] can continue to transition from what is often described as a  Musharraf policy  to a broader Pakistani one , " wrote the Wall Street Journals neoconservative editorial board .
The newspaper also published a column by Hussein Haqqani  an adviser to the late PPP leader , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  demanding that Musharraf " work out an honorable exit or a workable compromise with the opposition " .
The Bush administration had tried to work out precisely such a compromise between Musharraf and the then - exiled Bhutto beginning late last summer .
Musharrafs plunging popularity not only threatened Washingtons anti-terror campaign in Afghanistan and Pakistan , but also the collapse of the Pakistani state in the face of a rapidly spreading indigenous Taliban movement closely tied to al Qaeda .
But that strategy fell apart amid growing evidence  after Bhuttos return in October  that Musharraf was trying to rig elections .
It collapsed entirely in the aftermath of Bhuttos assassination in late December in Rawalpindi  reportedly by a Taliban - linked suicide bomber .
In the wake of Mondays elections results , the Bush administration suggested that such a cohabitation might still be possible , although the strong showings of both the PPP and the PML - N  which together will likely hold two thirds of the new parliaments seats  would make it highly unlikely that PML - N leader , former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , could be excluded from such an arrangement .
Unlike the de facto leader of the PPP  Bhuttos husband Asif Ali Zardari  Sharif , who was overthrown and exiled by Musharraf in a military coup detat in 1999 , has called on Musharraf to resign .
" We are going to continue our work with President Musharraf and whatever that new government may be on goals of our national interest , " said State Department spokesman Sean McCormack Tuesday .
Most independent analysts here , however , believe that Washington should not insist with any new government that Musharraf retain his position .
Indeed , most experts say the U.S. would be best served by letting Pakistans internal politics take their course .
" We should allow the process to play itself out , " said Karl Inderfurth , who served as assistant secretary of state for South Asia under Clinton .
" I dont believe that it is up to the United States to hold on to Musharraf . "
While Musharraf may not be " indispensable " in Washingtons war on terror , close cooperation with the Pakistani military  which came under the command of Gen.
Ashfaq Parvez Kayani after Musharraf became president last fall  remains essential , according to Inderfurth .
" There can be no solution to what s taking place in Afghanistan today if we dont have Pakistans cooperation , and that means the Pakistani army ,  Inderfurth said .
Some observers credit Kayani  who has issued a series of directives designed to drastically reduce the militarys role in the civil service and the economy  with also ensuring that the election was carried out more cleanly than most analysts here and in Pakistan had expected .
The Pentagon , which is eager to sharply increase its aid and training programs for the Pakistani military  and has even proposed to carry out joint operations in FATA  clearly hopes that any civilian government that emerges from the elections will not try to impose any obstacles to enhanced cooperation .
But some experts believe that given Washingtons war on terrors widespread unpopularity in Pakistan such hopes may be in vain .
" There is this notion that if a coalition can be stitched together , this will strengthen the war on terror , " said Rajan Menon , a South Asia expert at Lehigh University .
" It will not , because the war has very , very little support among Pakistanis , regardless of social class , ethnic background , or religious commitment who feel that it has only spread the violence without translating into any tangible benefit for average Pakistanis .
" If you have a democratic government headed by the PPP or Sharif , it will have to reflect this popular sentiment , " Menon said , noting that Zardari has already called for more dialogue with militant Islamists in the tribal areas than military confrontation .
But Chamberlin insisted that a new U.S. approach could help reverse negative perceptions of Washingtons war on terror .
The new approach would feature sharply increased economic and other non-military aid , particularly to frontier regions ; strong support for civil society and the justice system ; and enhanced U.S. diplomatic involvement in negotiating a resolution of the long - running Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan .

Yes , you have gotten poorer .
And at an accelerated pace .
The net worth of U.S. households fell in the first quarter , the second straight decline , thanks to the double - whammy of sliding home values and the plunge in stock prices , the Federal Reserve said in a report today .
The central bank ’s so - called flow of funds report estimated the net worth of American households at $ 55.97 trillion as of March 31 , down $ 1.7 trillion , or 2.9 % , from year - end .
That was more than three times the $ 530 - billion drop in the fourth quarter .
Home values fell by $ 329 billion in the first quarter after a $ 196 - billion drop in the fourth quarter .
But it was the slump in stocks that really hammered Americans ’ net worth :
The value of their stock accounts and mutual funds sank by $ 956 billion in the first quarter , after a $ 598 - billion decline in the previous quarter .
( The market has recovered quite a bit since , of course . )
Still , at least by the Fed ’s estimation , Americans ’ overall balance sheet remains quite healthy .
Net worth , remember , is assets minus liabilities .
Households ’ assets , at $ 70.46 trillion , dwarf their liabilities of $ 14.49 trillion , which mainly consist of mortgage and consumer debt .
What the totals do n't show , however , is how net worth is distributed .
A huge chunk of it is in the hands of the wealthiest people .
Down the income chain there have to be plenty of people with negative net worth , especially in light of the housing bust .
Some minor encouraging news in the Fed ’s report : Households continued to build up cash savings , which reached $ 7.59 trillion at the end of March , up from $ 7.08 trillion at the end of the third quarter .
On the other hand , as every saver knows , you ’re earning next - to - nothing on cash accounts now , thanks to the Fed ’s interest - rate cuts .
Where does he get those wonderful toys ?
– The Joker , Batman
The Army has a bat plane concept in mind it would like made into reality .
It has granted the University of Michigan a $ 10 Million grant to make this dream come true .
This miniature plane spy plane is to be the size of only six inches , and consist of different micro electronic features for increased surveillance and awareness .
“ The Bat ” , as it has been named , will include different communication tools and sensors within a tiny aerial gadget .
Little cameras will be included for imaging and surveillance , tiny microphones to assess sounds from separate angles , and detectors to notify of poisonous gases and / or radiation .
A radar will be also installed on board as well as a sensitive navigation system , so it would be able to fly at night and find its way just like a real bat .
In case the original grant is not sufficient , there is also a possible addition of $ 12.5 million to allow the Bat to take flight .
Besides the features included , the Bat weighs only a quarter of a pound and aims to use just 1 W of energy .
This makes the spy bat plane a great innovative electronic for the army .

Barack Obama showed he was willing to use bare - knuckle tactics during his first race in Chicago .
It may take a Solomon - like decision to appease both candidates .
Clinton has argued that the primary results of two of the nation 's largest states should count because , otherwise , millions of voters are being disenfranchised .
Obama has said he is willing to work out some compromise .
But he is insistent that the primary results are invalid because the two states failed to follow party rules and that the rules are the rules .
The DNC has not seated the Florida and Michigan delegates because the two states violated party edicts in holding their primaries early .
Although neither candidate campaigned in the two states , Clinton won about 50 percent of the Florida vote , compared with 33 percent for Obama .
She won 55 percent of the vote in Michigan , where Obama 's name was not on the ballot .
In his first race for office , seeking a state Senate seat on Chicago 's gritty South Side in 1996 , Obama effectively used election rules to eliminate his Democratic competition .
As a community organizer , he had helped register thousands of voters .
But when it came time to run for office , he employed Chicago rules to invalidate the voting petition signatures of three of his challengers .
The move denied each of them , including incumbent Alice Palmer , a longtime Chicago activist , a place on the ballot .
It cleared the way for Obama to run unopposed on the Democratic ticket in a heavily Democrat district .
" That was Chicago politics , " said John Kass , a veteran Chicago Tribune columnist .
" Knock out your opposition , challenge their petitions , destroy your enemy , right ?
It is how Barack Obama destroyed his enemies back in 1996 that conflicts with his message today .
He may have gotten his start registering thousands of voters .
But in that first race , he made sure voters had just one choice . "
Watch how Obama shut out challengers in his first race »
Obama 's challenge was perfectly legal , said Jay Stewart of the Chicago 's Better Government Association .
Although records of the challenges are no longer on file for review with the election board , Stewart said Obama is not the only politician to resort to petition challenges to eliminate the competition .
" He came from Chicago politics , " Stewart said .
" Politics ai n't beanbag , as they say in Chicago .
You play with your elbows up , and you 're pretty tough and ruthless when you have to be .
Sen .
Obama felt that 's what was necessary at the time , that 's what he did .
Does it fit in with the rhetoric now ?
Perhaps not . "
The Obama campaign called this report " a hit job . "
It insisted that CNN talk to a state representative who supports Obama , because , according to an Obama spokesman , she would be objective .
But when we called her , she said she can't recall details of petition challenges , who engineered them for the Obama campaign or why all the candidates were challenged .
But Will Burns does .
Now running himself for a seat in the Illinois legislature , Burns was a young Obama volunteer during the presidential candidate 's first race .
Burns was one of the contingents of volunteers and lawyers who had the tedious task of going over each and every petition submitted by the other candidates , including those of Alice Palmer .
" The rules are there for a reason , " Burns said .
He said that challenging petitions is a smart way to avoid having to run a full - blown expensive race .
" One of the first things you do whenever you 're in the middle of a primary race , especially in primaries in Chicago , because if you do n't have signatures to get on the ballot , you save yourself a lot of time and effort from having to raise money and have a full - blown campaign effort against an incumbent , " Burns said .
Burns said he believed that Obama did not enjoy using the tactic to knock off Palmer .
" It was not something he particularly relished , " Burns said .
" It was not something that I thought he was happy about doing . "
Watch Burns describe how Obama used the rules to his advantage »
But Obama did it anyway , clearing the field of any real competition .
Obama 's staff would not comment on what the senator thinks about that petition challenge now .
Instead , they referred CNN to this 2007 comment made by Obama to the Chicago Tribune .
" To my mind , we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up , " the senator is quoted as saying in the Tribune .
" My conclusion was that if you could n't run a successful petition drive , then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be . "
But in that same newspaper story , Obama praised Palmer .
" I thought she was a good public servant , " he said .
Palmer , who has campaigned for Clinton , told CNN that she did not want to be part of this story .
Obama supporters claim that Palmer has only herself to blame because she indicated she would not run for the 1996 state Senate and instead aimed for Congress .
After losing in that bid , she returned to running for the state Senate seat , a move Obama supporters claim amounted to reneging on a promise not to run .
But Palmer supporters , who did not want to be identified , said that she never anointed Obama as her successor and that the retelling of the story by Obama supporters is designed to distract from the fact he muscled his way into office .
One other opponent who Obama eliminated by challenging his petitions , Gha-is Askia , said he has no hard feelings today about the challenge and supports Obama 's presidential aspirations .
But back at the time he was running for state Senate , Askia said , he was dismayed Obama would use such tactics .
" It was n't honorable , " he said .
" I would n't have done it . "
He said the Obama team challenged every single one of his petitions on " technicalities . "
If names were printed instead of signed in cursive writing , they were declared invalid .
If signatures were good but the person gathering the signatures was n't properly registered , those petitions also were thrown out .
Askia came up 69 signatures short of the required number to be on the ballot .
Kass , the Chicago Tribune columnist , said the national media are naive when it comes to Chicago politics , which is a serious business .
He said they have bought into a narrative that Obama is strictly a reformer .
The truth , Kass says , is that he is a bare - knuckled politician .
And using the rules to win his first office is part of who Obama is .
" It 's not the tactics of ' let 's all people come together and put your best ideas forward and the best ideas win , ' " Kass said .
" That 's the spin ; that 's in the Kool - Aid .
You can have some .
Any flavor .
But the real deal was , get rid of Alice Palmer .
" There are those who think that registering people to vote and getting them involved in politics and then using this tactic in terms of denying Alice Palmer the right to compete , that these things are inconsistent .
And guess what ?
They are .
They are inconsistent .
But that 's the politics he plays . "
And this weekend , DNC delegates will have to decide what kind of rules it will invoke in helping choose its next candidate .

Newly Independent Pop Band McFly Gives Away Free CD With Newspaper

Last month we wrote about the British pop band McFly , who had announced that it was ditching its record label , because the label was n't interested in experimenting with new ways to get music to fans .
So now that the band is independent , it 's jumped right on the bandwagon of experimentation .
In fact , it 's following the footsteps of Prince , back before he started freaking out .
That is , they 've done a deal with a big UK newspaper to distribute copies of their new album for free with the newspaper ( thanks to Nick for sending this in ) .
As we 've noted in the past , this is a fantastic strategy for both newspapers and musicians .
It helps both sides quite a bit , which is exactly what the band sees , noting that they just want to get more fans , and are hoping more will come see them on their latest tour .
Yet , of course , it 's not making some happy : specifically those who have based their entire business models around the concept of selling plastic discs .
Music retailers flipped out when Prince did this , and it's likely that they 'll be upset about McFly as well .
But , you do n't jump into the next generation by appeasing the old generation .
Also , the article quotes a former recording industry exec who complains that if bands keep doing this , record labels will lose money and wo n't be able to find and promote new bands .
That 's missing the point , of course .
It assumes that it 's the record labels skilled hand that is necessary in finding and promoting new bands -- which is not true at all .
The same guy also suggests ( in a video on the site ) that record labels also wo n't want to give tour support .
That 's also quite ridiculous .
If the band is making so much more money from concerts now , the smart label will still give tour support , after making sure that it gets a cut of the touring revenue as well .
And , if the record labels decide not to do it , then have no fear that concert promoters will step in and provide the necessary support in their place .

Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
If John McCain wins the presidency , his comeback — after the bankrupt debacle his campaign had become in the summer of 2007 with his backing of the amnesty bill — will be the stuff of legend .
And as nominee , he is entitled to conduct his own campaign and be cut slack by a party whose brand name is now Enron .
That said , McCain seems to have decided to win by love - bombing the Big Media and putting miles between himself and the base .
Consider his “ Forgotten Places ” tour of last week .
It began in Selma , Ala. , where McCain went to Edmund Pettis Bridge to hail John Lewis and the marchers night - sticked and hosed down by the Alabama State Troopers on the Montgomery march for voting rights .
Now that was a seminal movement in the fight for civil rights .
But this is not 1965 .
Today , John Lewis is a big dog in the “ No - Whites - Need - Apply ! ” Black Caucus .
The Rev. Jeremiah Wright is sermonizing White America .
The Rev. Al Sharpton is trying to shut down the Big Apple .
And the fight for equal rights is being led by Ward Connerly .
With no help from McCain , Connerly is trying to put on five state ballots a Civil Rights Initiative that declares white men are also equal and not to be denied their civil rights because of the color of their skin .
And where does McCain stand ?
From Selma , McCain went to the Gee ’s Bend Quilters Collective , where black ladies make the famous blankets .
The stop could not but call to mind the hundreds of thousands of textile and apparel jobs in the Carolinas and Georgia lost after NAFTA and Most - Favored Nation for China , both of which McCain enthusiastically supported .
McCain ’s next stop was Inez , Ky. , where LBJ declared war on poverty .
But LBJ ’s war was a politically motivated scheme to shift wealth and power to government , which led to a pathological dependency among America ’s poor , his own abdication and Ronald Reagan ’s 1980 campaign against Big Government that ushered in the Conservative Decade .
McCain then went to New Orleans to backhand Bush for failing to act swiftly to rescue the victims of Katrina .
But the real failure of New Orleans was of the corrupt and incompetent regime of Mayor Ray Nagin and the men of New Orleans , who left 30,000 women and children stranded in a sea of stagnant water .
No doubt Bush hit the snooze button , but why the piling on ?
Then McCain headed up to Youngstown , Ohio , to tell the folks their jobs are never coming back and NAFTA was a sweet deal .
But why , when America ’s mini-mills and steel mills are among the most efficient on earth — in terms of man hours needed to produce a ton of steel — are n’t those jobs coming back ?
Answer :
It is due to the free - trade policies of Bush and McCain , which permit trade rivals to impose value - added taxes of 15 percent to 20 percent on steel imports from the United States while rebating those taxes on steel exports to the United States .
We are getting it in the neck coming and going .
An America First trade and tax policy could have U.S. steel mills rising again , while those in Japan , China , Russia and Brazil would be shutting down as uncompetitive in the U.S. market .
But we no longer put America first .
The U.S. government burns its incense at the altar of the Global Economy .
The losers are those guys in Youngstown McCain was lecturing on the beauty of NAFTA .
And the winners are the CEOs who pull down seven - , eight - and even nine - figure annual packages selling out their country for the corporation .
Does McCain think $ 6 trillion in trade deficits since NAFTA , a dollar rotting away and 3.5 million manufacturing jobs lost under Bush was all inevitable ?
Does he think we can do nothing to stop the deindustrialization of a country that used to produce 96 percent of all it consumed ?
Why should those guys in Youngstown vote for McCain ?
So the feds can teach them how to shovel snow ?
Even Hillary , whose husband did NAFTA with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole ’s help , now gets it .
Then McCain took a time out to denounce the North Carolina GOP for ads tying the Rev. Wright to Obama , and the pair to two Democratic congressional candidates .
To their credit , the North Carolinians told McCain where to get off and are running the ads .
What does a McCain victory mean for conservatives ?
Probably a veto on tax hikes and perhaps a fifth justice like Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , Samuel Alito or John Roberts , to turn two pair into a full house .
Fifty years after Warren , it could be game , set , match for the right .
But McCain may also mean more Middle East wars , more bellicosity , more manufacturing jobs lost , malingering in the culture wars , and more illegal aliens and amnesty .
In Pennsylvania , thousands of Republicans re-registered to vote Democratic , and 27 percent of the GOP votes went to Mike Huckabee or Ron Paul .
McCain may just stretch this rubber band so far it snaps back in his face .
Mr. Russert , last Sunday ( June 1 , 2008 ) on Meet The Press you had as your guest former George W. Bush Press Secretary Scott McClellan .
You asked him the following question :
Some have suggested because you were part of the propaganda machine that sold the war , that many people have died and been injured because of the war , you should donate some of the profits from this book to the families of the victims of the Iraq War .
Will you do that ?
Here 's the clip from the show :
That 's an excellent question , Mr. Russert .
Although YOU you have n't accepted any culpability for your own enabling during the lead up to the war as McClellan has stepped - up to do , it 's still a fact that Meet The Press provided a national platform for the Bush administration to push its war with minimal challenge from YOU .
Thus , Mr. Russert , I 'd like to ask you that very same question :
Because YOU were part of the propaganda machine that sold the war , that many people have died and been injured because of the war , should n't you , Mr. Russert , donate some of your hefty salary from your show to the families of the victims of the Iraq War .
Will YOU do that ?
On last Sunday 's show , you also chided Scott McClellan for not questioning his boss , George W. Bush , on whether the war on Iraq was " a war of necessity or a war of choice " - the same question you asked Bush on February 8 , 2004 in your highly anticipated interview from the White House Oval Office .
Here 's that exchange between you and G.W. Bush :
RUSSERT : In light of not finding the weapons of mass destruction , do you believe the war in Iraq is a war of choice or a war of necessity ?
G.W. BUSH : I think it 's -- that 's an interesting question .
Please elaborate on that a little bit .
A war of choice or a war of necessity ?
I mean , it 's a war of necessity .
We , we , we -- my judgment , we had no choice when we look at the intelligence I looked at that says the man was a threat .
Bush was n’t granting many interviews at the time so this was a real “ get ” for Meet The Press .
However , as we now know , Mr. Russert , since you were such an asset to the Bush administration , this interview was more a " get " for them than for you .
Here 's that clip :
Mr. Russert , this is what you said to Scott McClellan ragarding that very same question of whether it was a war of necessity or a war of choice :
Why did n't you [ McClellan ] say to him , " Mr. President , this is the fundamental issue confronting our country . "
Why did n't you go to your superiors and say , " Guys , ladies and gentlemen , we have a problem here .
This is the fundamental issue , choice or necessity , and the president seems unaware of it .
Mr. Russert , you are so oblivious to what journalists do that your own clip proves your inanity .
You 're supposed to be the “ journalist . ”
Why did n’t YOU drill down on Bush over that very same question ?
You had the perfect opportunity when you asked it but YOU JUST LET IT GO !
Yet you assail Scott McClellan - a man who 's shown more courage in two weeks than you 've shown in years !
Do you really believe we 're that naive ??
It was n’t McClellan ’s job to grill Bush .
Bush was McClellan 's boss !
It was yours !
I waited an entire week for that George W. Bush Meet The Press interview .
It was so heavily hyped that I honestly believed you might do your job .
Even today it stands as one of the most disappointing hours on television .
Bush just rambled on and you let him push his agenda .
It rivaled Geraldo Rivera and Capone 's empty vault for hype with no substance .
But its ramifications were n't silly .
They were heinous .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystery_of_Al_Capone's_Vault ( MTP / Bush transcript link below ) .
In Dick Cheney 's March 16 , 2003 appearance on Meet The Press ( transcript link below ) , Cheney filibustered your every question and pushed his agenda for war .
You asked all the EXPECTED questions from which Cheney made his case .
Eighty hours later , Bush launched " Shock & Awe . "
A former government official has already claimed , Mr. Russert - under oath I might add - that your show was useful to the administration in pushing its pre-war message .
Here 's what Vice President Cheney 's own former Communications Director Cathie Martin said during the perjury trial of Scooter Libby :
" I suggested we put the Vice President on ' Meet the Press , ' which was a tactic we often used .
It 's our best format . "
As Dana Milbank wrote in the Washington Post on January 26 , 2007 :
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR2007012501951.html
Flashed on the courtroom computer screens were her [ Martin's ] notes from 2004 about how Cheney could respond to allegations that the Bush administration had played fast and loose with evidence of Iraq 's nuclear ambitions .
Option 1 : " MTP - VP , " she wrote , then listed the pros and cons of a vice presidential appearance on the Sunday show .
Under " pro , " she wrote : " control message . "
For the record , Mr. Russert , lots of us like whistle - blowers like Scott McClellan .
We need them because in the lead up to the war and throughout this Bush administration , corporate media has not done its job .
Right now McClellan is doing what corporate media should have been doing all along .
He 's telling us the truth .
We thank him for his courage and for his offer to share the proceeds of his book with those who have suffered .
And YOU , Mr. Russert .
Will YOU ante up for the victims of the war that YOU helped promote ?
If McClellan should do it - SHOULDN'T YOU ?!

The US military has lost hundreds of sensitive nuclear missile components , in the latest embarrassment for The Pentagon , the Financial Times reported in its online version .
Citing US officials familiar with a Pentagon report , the British daily said the US Air Force could not account for many sensitive components previously in its nuclear inventory .
One official put the number at over 1,000 , it said .
The latest incident comes after blunders which saw live nuclear warheads transported over US skies , and an accidental shipment of nuclear triggers to Taiwan .
A senior official said the report had " identified issues about record keeping " for sensitive nuclear missile components .
There was no suggestion they could have ended up in countries that should not have received them , he said .
Earlier this month US Defence Secretary Robert Gates sacked the air force 's civilian secretary and chief of staff , blaming them for two major blunders that shook confidence in US control over its nuclear arsenal .
Mr Gates said " a substantial number " of generals and colonels also face possible disciplinary action as a result of an investigation into a mistaken shipment of fuses for nuclear weapons to Taiwan .
The Taiwan incident , and an accidental transfer of nuclear armed cruise missiles from one US air base to another last year , were symptoms of a decline in the air force 's standards and focus , Mr Gates said at the time .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli defense officials and political pundits rounded on Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz on Sunday after he threatened attacks against Iran , accusing him of exploiting war jitters to advance his personal ambitions .
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz speaks during a news conference in Tel Aviv December 11 , 2005 .
REUTERS / Gil Cohen Magen
Mofaz , a former armed forces chief and likely challenger to the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in their Kadima party , said in a newspaper interview last week that Israeli strikes on Iran looked “ unavoidable ” given progress in its nuclear plans .
The remarks helped drive up oil prices by nearly 9 percent to a record $ 139 a barrel on Friday and drew a circumspect response from Washington , which has championed U.N. sanctions against Iran and only hinted force could also be a last resort .
While the White House suggested Mofaz was giving voice to the Jewish state ’s fear of the Islamic republic , officials in Israel ’s Defence Ministry pointed to a power - struggle roiling centrist Kadima as Olmert tries to beat off a bribery scandal .
“ Turning one of the most strategic security issues into a political game , using it for the internal purposes of a would - be campaign in Kadima , is something that must not be done , ” Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai told Israel Radio .
The state - owned broadcaster quoted another senior defense official as saying Mofaz ’s interview “ did not reflect policy ” and “ risked making it even harder for Israel to persuade more countries to step up their sanctions against Iran ” .
Asked about the flurry of criticism , Mofaz aide Talia Somech said he had spoken “ out of his more than 40 - year - long commitment to the national security of Israel ” .
“ We would like his statements to be taken at face value , and not be given alternative interpretations , ” she told Reuters .
Iranian - born Mofaz had served as defense minister until Olmert made him transport minister in a 2006 cabinet reshuffle .
CHALLENGE
Though Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons , the virulently anti-Israel statements of its government pose a challenge for Israeli leaders , who must at once reassure their public while trying to keep in sync with U.S. interests in the Middle East .
Israel , which is assumed to have the region ’s only atomic arsenal , bombed an Iraqi reactor in 1981 and , last September , a Syrian target which the Bush administration described as a North Korean - built reactor .
Damascus denied having such a facility .
But many independent analysts say Iran ’s nuclear sites are too numerous , distant and fortified for Israel to take on alone .
Iran , for its part , has threatened to retaliate for any attack with missile salvoes against Israel and U.S. assets in the Gulf .
The mass - circulation Israeli daily Maariv devoted a full spread to the fallout from Mofaz ’s interview with the rival Yedioth Ahronoth .
Maariv ’s headlines -- “ Big Mouth ” , “ Demonstrable Damage ” and “ Boomerang ” -- made clear its views .
“ Were Mofaz defense minister today , he would demand that the transport minister be fired forthwith , ” wrote Maariv ’s Ben Caspit .
“ Suddenly , ( Iranian President Mahmud ) Ahmadinejad is the underdog .
Iran is on the defensive from crazed Jews . ”
There was agreement from Yedioth ’s economic analyst , Sever Plotzker , who suggested that Mofaz was , paradoxically , giving a back - end boost to Iran -- the world fourth - biggest oil producer :
“ Blathering away about how ‘ we ’ll attack and destroy you ’ does not deter the decision - makers in Tehran , but it does drive the oil markets crazy ...
And who profits from that ?
Tehran . ”

World ’s Oldest Man Dies
A Spaniard thought to be the oldest man in the world has died at the age of 114 , his family said on Saturday .
Associated Press , 07 March 2004
Now and then the newspapers report the death of the world ’s oldest person .
How often does this occur ?
Judging from the newspapers , it does n’t seem to be a particularly rare event .
The death of the world ’s oldest person was reported in March 2002 , November 2003 , December 2003 , February 2004 , and March 2004 .
The ages of the individuals were 115 , 116 , 114 , 116 , and 114 years .
It ’s hard to assess the accuracy of these reports , since we can’t really be sure if the world ’s oldest person has been correctly identified at any given moment .
Still it raises an interesting question about the expected rate at which the oldest member of a population fails .
Obviously the answer depends on the distribution of life spans .
If one widget is produced every U seconds , and each widget has a life span of exactly L seconds , then each widget will be the oldest when it fails , so the world ’s oldest widget will fail once every U seconds .
On the other hand , if there is variability in the life spans , then many widgets will fail without ever having been the oldest widget .
In general , suppose one widget is produced each U seconds , and the life span of each widget is drawn from a given density distribution f( t ) .
If the jth widget has a lifespan of T j , then it will be the oldest surviving widget when it fails if and only if T j−1 < T j + 1U and T j−2 < T j + 2U and so on .
In other words , the necessary and sufficient condition is that T j−k < T j + kU for k=1,2,3 ...
The probability is therefore the infinite product of the probabilities of all these conditions .
Integrating this over all possible values of T j .
gives the probability that any given widget will be the oldest widget when it fails .
Let F( T ) denote the cumulative probability distribution , i.e. , the integral of f( t ) from t = 0 to T .
The weight factor for the contribution of the incremental range around the time t is f(t ) dt , so the probability that any given widget will become the world ’s oldest is
To give an expected value of 1 for the number of “ oldest widget failures ” , we need 1 / P oldest widgets , and since one widget is produced every U seconds , this implies that the mean time between the production of widgets destined to fail as the oldest widget is U/P oldest seconds .
If the life span density f(t ) has the exponential distribution the result turns out to be particularly simple , at least in the rare event approximation , i.e. , when λU is much less than 1 .
We have
Hence the probability that any given widget is destined to fail as the oldest widget is
By numerical integration we find that if Uλ is small compared with 1 then the value of this integral approaches Uλ . ( An analytical proof of this is given below . )
It follows that we need 1 / ( Uλ ) widgets to get an expected value of 1 for the number of oldest widget failures , and since one widget is produced every U seconds , the mean time between oldest widget failures ( for exponentially distributed life spans ) is simply 1/λ , which of course is also the mean life span of the individual widgets .
For example , if the average life span for widgets with exponentially distributed life spans is 100 years , then we would expect a failure of the oldest widget once every 100 years .
( Needless to say , the fact that deaths of the world ’s oldest person are much more frequent than this is due mainly to the fact that human life spans are not exponentially distributed . )
Incidentally , the integrand
in the expression for P oldest is a function of U and λ independently , even though the integral from t = 0 to infinity turns out to be strictly dependent on just the product Uλ .
To illustrate , the plot below show the integrand functions for the cases ( U=1 , λ = 0.4 ) and ( U = 2 , λ = 0.2 ) .
Another interesting feature of the integrand function I (t ) is that , like the Riemann zeta function , it has no positive real roots and all the negative integers − 1 , − 2 , −3 , etc. are roots .
This similarity is perhaps not too surprising , considering that the zeta function has an infinite product representation
The behavior of I ( t ) , interpreted as an analytic function for complex values of t , could also be considered .
( For what complex values of t does the function I ( t ) vanish ? )
If the value of Uλ is on the order of 1 or larger , then P oldest becomes progressively less than Uλ ( since it obviously can never exceed 1 ) .
Approximate values of P oldest for various values of Uλ are tabulated below .
For large values of Uλ we can show that P oldest approaches
To analytically prove this , and also to prove that P oldest approaches Uλ for sufficiently small values of Uλ , we can expand the product in the function I ( t ) to give the sum of series
Collecting terms with the same multiplier of U in the exponents , we find that the coefficients are the numbers of partitions of the multiplier into distinct positive integers .
Using the fact that the generating function for the number of partitions into k distinct parts is
the first three series can be evaluated as
Thus we have
If λU is large the higher - order terms become small very quickly , so up to the first order we can take just the first series and integrate to give
On the other hand , if λU is very small we can replace each expression of the form 1 −e−k λU in the denominator of the previous equation with kλU ( at least up to some value of k ) to give
( It ’s true that eventually kλU will become large for any finite value of λU , but by then the numerators will have become negligible . )
Integrating this from t = 0 to infinity , we get
for sufficiently small values of λU .
Another way of evaluating the expression for P oldest is to set λ equal to 1 ( since the integral depends only on λ U ) to give the simplified expression
Then we expand the product , integrate term by term , and collect terms to give the result
The coefficient of e−kU depends on the partitions of k .
If we let p j ( k ) denote the number of partitions of k into j distinct positive integers ( without regard to order ) , then the coefficient of e−kU is given by
For example , to find c 10 we examine the partitions of 10 into distinct positive integers
Thus we have p 1 ( 10 ) =1 , p 2 ( 10 ) =4 , p 3 ( 10 ) =4 , and p 4 ( 10 ) =1 , so the coefficient is
The first twenty - eight coefficients are listed below :
For small values of U the function P oldest ( U ) approaches U , so setting U = 0 we should find that the sum of these coefficients ( plus the leading unit coefficient ) is zero .
To show that this is indeed the case , consider all 2N subsets of the set of natural numbers from 1 to N .
For example , the set { 1 , 2 , 3} has the non-empty subsets {null} , { 1} , { 2} , { 3} , { 1,2} , { 1,3} , { 2,3} , { 1,2,3} , each of which is a partition into distinct integers of some natural number .
As N goes to infinity this encompasses more and more of the components of the c k coefficients ( albeit not in the same order , so conditional convergence must still be considered ) .
In general the number of subsets with k elements is the binomial coefficient C( N , k ) , so we can consider the sum ( including the leading unit coefficient )
For example , with N = 6 we have
The fact that C ( 6 , k ) / ( k+1 ) happens to be an integer for all k from 0 to 5 is related to the fact that 6 is a perfect number .
This is also true for the next perfect number , i.e. , C( 28 , k ) / ( k+1 ) is an integer for all k from 0 to 27 .
However , for all integers N we have s N = 1 / ( N+1 ) .
Therefore , letting N go to infinity , we see that the sum of all these subsets , which is the same as the sum of all the partitions into distinct integers of every natural number , divided by the appropriate denominator , is zero .
We also have the following interesting relation :
Making this substitution , we can express the probability P oldest for sufficiently small U as
consistent with the observation that P oldest approaches U for small U .
The 114 year old Spaniard who died in March of 2004 as the world ’s oldest person is said to have attributed his longevity partly to sleeping 15 hours per day .
( The mathematician Abraham de Moivre in his old age supposedly noticed himself sleeping 15 minutes longer each day , and by extrapolating this trend to the point when he would be sleeping 24 hours per day he predicted the date of his death , a prediction which reportedly turned out to be exactly correct . )
Reports of the death of the world ’s oldest person always remind me of the final lines of “ King Lear ” :
The weight of this sad time we must obey ,
speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
The oldest hath borne most .
We who are young

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s Canon Inc , a leading printer and copier maker , said on Friday it would invest 60 billion yen ( $ 575 million ) to build a new toner cartridge plant in the United States , prompting its shares to rise as much as 4.4 percent .
The plant in Virginia will buffer the impact of currency fluctuations and rising transport costs on its U.S. business , the company said .
Canon and other exporters have been hurt by a stronger yen , which makes their products less competitive abroad and cuts into earnings when profits are brought home .
Canon , which competes with Xerox Corp and Ricoh Co in copiers and printers , said the new factory would have fully automated assembly lines and employ about 700 people .
It is expected to start operations as early as December 2009 .
Consumable items such as toner and related services are an important source of profit for office equipment makers as they generally fetch high margins and provide a constant revenue stream .
Canon said last November it would spend a total of 140 billion yen to boost its capacity to make toner cartridges in Japan , where the company currently makes most of its products for the global market .
A stronger yen forced Canon , which earns more than three - quarters of its group revenues overseas , to post an 18 percent fall in quarterly operating profit and cut its full - year outlook in April .
Shares in Canon were up 3.4 percent at 5,420 yen as of 0027 yen after rising as high as 5,470 yen earlier .
The benchmark Nikkei average was up 1.7 percent .
" In the United States , your university system is one of the drivers of American prosperity , " said Claude Allègre , a former education minister who tried without success to reform French universities .
" But here , we simply do n't invest enough .
Universities are poor .
They 're not a priority either for the state or the private sector .
If we do n't reverse this trend , we will kill the new generation . "
It was student discontent on campuses across France that fired up the recent protests against a law that would have made it easier for employers to dismiss young workers .
College students were driven by fear that their education was worth little and that after graduation they would not find jobs .
The protests closed or disrupted a majority of France 's universities for weeks , labor unions declared solidarity and eventually the government was forced to withdraw the law .
" Universities are factories , " said Christine le Forestier , 24 , a 2005 graduate of Nanterre with a master 's degree who has not found a stable job .
" They are machines to turn out thousands and thousands of students who have learned all about theory but nothing practical .
A diploma is worth nothing in the real world . "
The problems stem in part from the student revolts of May 1968 , which grew out of an unexceptional event at Nanterre the year before .
One March evening , male students protesting the sexual segregation of the dormitories occupied the women 's dormitory and were evicted by the police .
