On Sunday , Gen. Wesley Clark said that McCain ’s military service , while honorable , did not necessarily prepare McCain to be a good president .
What is interesting to me is that the McCain himself went on the offensive immediately , trotting out a number of retired military men — including Bud Day , one of the original Swift Boat veterans — to condemn Clark ’s comments .
As you might recall , the Swift Boat veterans were a 527 group that attacked John Kerry ’s military service in a number of TV ads , ads that at the time were denounced by John McCain as “ dishonest and dishonorable ” .
Why is this interesting ?
Because Clark did not actually attack McCain ’s military service , just the idea that his military service somehow means that one cannot question McCain ’s military judgement .
In fact , Clark praised McCain ’s service .
McCain also attacked Obama , denouncing “ the kind of campaign Sen. Obama and his surrogates and supporters want to engage in , ” even though Obama consistently praises McCain ’s service , calling him “ a genuine American hero . ”
( On the other hand , Bud Day directly and dishonestly attacked Kerry ’s service four years ago . )
So , when someone completely overreacts to a mild criticism , it makes me think they are trying to hide something .
You know , like when you make a mild comment about someone having a drink at a party and they freak out and accuse you of calling them a drunk .
So what could McCain be hiding about his service ?
Well , here are a few things we do know about it :
John McCain graduated fifth from the bottom in his class at Annapolis ( in the bottom 1 % ) .
He received favored treatment because his father and grandfather were admirals , becoming a fighter pilot despite his low grades , and remaining one despite losing 5 planes ( at least two of which were his fault ) .
He was involved in an accident on the aircraft carrier Forrestal that killed 134 men .
While he was a POW in Viet Nam , he collaborated with the enemy , participating in anti-American propaganda .
Those are the things that McCain has admitted to .
The more interesting part is that ( unlike John Kerry ) John McCain has never released all his military records , preferring to keep them secret .
Even the stuff we do know about McCain ’s record should cause us to ask some serious questions .
But McCain does n’t want any of those questions answered , and will use known liars to attack anyone who dares to ask even the most innocuous question .
UPDATE : Wesley Clark is not backing down , and other military men are coming to his defense .
UPDATE 2 : During a McCain campaign conference call ( his second on the subject in as many days ) McCain surrogate Orson Swindle said :
General Clark probably would n’t get that much praise from this group .
I ca n’t speak for them , but we all know that General Clark , as high - ranking as he is , his record in his last command I think was somewhat less than stellar .
So let me get this straight .
The McCain campaign is claiming that it is unacceptable to attack someone ’s military record , and to prove their point they attack Clark ’s military record — except that Clark did n’t actually attack McCain ’s record .
Incidentally , Clark ’s last command was as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO .
UPDATE 3 : Despite what the media keeps repeating , McCain was n’t actually a fighter pilot , he was a bomber pilot .
On 60 Minutes in 1997 he said “ I am a war criminal .
I bombed innocent women and children . ”
Big crowd gathers for House Judiciary hearing on Bush " impeachment "
A boisterous crowd has already gathered for today 's hearing in the House Judiciary Committee on the case for impeaching President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) has been leading the charge on the issue , and although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) have said there will be no formal impeachment hearings , they 've given Kucinich and his allies a session today to make the case .
There are at least 100 people in line to attend the hearing , and the committee has announced that there will be two " overflow " rooms to accommodate everyone who wants to watch the proceedings .
The crowd is definitely in a festive mood and appears to be a merging of the anti-Iraq war and Bush - hater crowds , if they are n't already one body , anyway .
But the Capitol Police are n't expecting a lot of problems during today 's session .
" This is a happy crowd , " one Capitol Police officer told another as they discussed arrangements for the hearing .
" They love what is happening here , so it should n't be too bad . "
In the most depressing news of the day , according to the latest NPD data , Steven Spielberg ’s amazing Wii exclusive Boom Blox only sold 60,000 copies in its first month of release .
Putting that number in perspective , that is only 0.6 % of all Wii owners .
While a lot of third parties are having trouble releasing hits on Nintendo ’s popular console , this news comes as an extra shock since Boom Blox is easily one of the best games on the Wii .
The puzzle mechanics are exceptional and the unique motion controls are used in a truly revolutionary , intuitive way .
And , oh yeah , it was created by Steven freakin’ Spielberg .
Despite the low sales , EA remains confident the game will sell better and says it has already met the giant company ’s expectations .
And , honestly , 60,000 is n't terrible ... it ’s just a bit disappointing .
To ensure better sales , though , I am making a plea to the other 99.4 % of Wii owners :
If you like puppies , buy Boom Blox !
What do you think ?
If you own a Wii and have n't bought this incredible game ... why not ?

A project launched last week aims to create what is in essence a medical Wikipedia , an online encyclopedia focused on explaining conditions , drugs , procedures , medial facilities and other medical topics written by physicians and PhDs .
The Medpedia Project launched a preview of the Medpedia site Wednesday with the support of medical heavyweights like Harvard Medical School , the Stanford School of Medicine , the University of Michigan Medial School and the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health .
These schools and other organizations have agreed to provide content and to urge their employees to sign up to be editors of the new site , which is scheduled to go live with 1,000 pages of information by the end of the year .
The site , which is built with the same open source software that runs Wikipedia , will be written and edited by volunteer medical doctors or experts with PhD degrees , noted James Currier , Medpedia 's founder and chairman .
The site will provide profiles of each of each editor , including their background and areas of expertise , he added .
The volunteer editors will also have to disclose any compensation received from key outside entities like pharmaceutical companies .
Experts can now apply on the site to be editors .
Those selected will work with committees organized by specialties like pediatric oncology or dermatology to update and edit Medpedia Web pages .
Currier , who has worked on creating online communities since the 1990s , said that Medpedia aims to help apply the collaborative , bottoms - up approach that user - generated content brings to Web 2.0 sites to the medical community , which traditionally has been governed by the hierarchical , top - down approach of doctors handing down information to patients .
Currier also founded Tickle , a psychological and self - assessment testing company that was sold to Monster in 2004 for more than US$ 90 million .
While the Medpedia plans initially received a " tepid " response from some in the medical community , interest increased they learned that the content would be created only by fully vetted licensed experts , according to Currier .
Mitch Kapor , the founder of Lotus Development Corp. and the founding chair of the Mozilla Foundation , also supports the effort as a member of the Medpedia board of advisors , Currier said .
Currier said that the bottoms - up , collaborative approach made popular by Wikipedia and other social networks is perfectly suited to the Medpedia goal of creating and interlinking content about 13,000 drugs and 30,000 medical conditions .
" That problem alone is too complex for a top - down hierarchy , " he said .
" Whenever you have a very complex , interrelated ever - changing body of knowledge like medicine it is a perfect marriage with this bottoms - up collaborative process we 've seen on the Web .
As [ the editors ] contribute small bits , the sum total is much greater than anything a directed system could produce
If there is a collaborative source it will not ever be perfect , but it will be the best we could ever do just from a mathematical perspective . "
Currier said that unlike other online efforts around health information , Medpedia will provide all information relevant to a specific topic on one page and not chop it up over multiple pages to try to generate more page views .
In addition , the navigation hierarchy has been designed to be simple for all levels of users , he added .
While the main page on a topic will be written in language easy for consumers to understand , each topic will also feature a technical page for medical professionals or for patients as they delve deeper into a particular condition or topic , Currier added .
" It 's feeling inevitable that all the medical and health information will be available worldwide at no charge via an open , collaborative platform like Medpedia , " said Linda Hawes Clever , a medical doctor and clinical professor at University of California , San Francisco , Medical School , in a statement .
" Medpedia will also serve as an important place for medical professionals to get credit and become known for their specialties . "
Clever is also a member of Medpedia 's advisory board .
In the future the site will show text - based advertising from third - party advertising sites like Google Ad Sense .
A link will allow users to flag inappropriate ads , which will then be reviewed by editors and potentially prevented from being shown on the site in the future , Medpedia said .
For its part , Harvard Medical School will publish content on the site that are uneditable that their faculty has created .
Other organizations like the University of Michigan Medical School will encourage their faculty to edit Medpedia , Currier noted .
Medpedia noted that other health and medical organizations supporting the effort include the American College of Physicians , the Oxford Health Alliance , the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies and the European Federation of Neurological Associations .
These groups are contributing content and promoting participation in Medpedia to their members .
Medpedia is also receiving content and cooperation from the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control , the Federal Drug Administration and other government research groups .

Seven years on , no answer from White House on anthrax attacks Eric Brewer
Published : Wednesday July 16 , 2008

It 's been almost seven years since  in the weeks immediately following 9/11  anthrax powder sent through the mail killed five people , threatened the lives of two Democratic senators , terrorized the entire nation , and helped prod a panicky Congress into passing the so - called Patriot Act .
In the intervening years , not only has the killer remained free , but missteps in the investigation have had major negative consequences .
Just last month , in fact , the Department of Justice agreed to pay $ 4.6 million to former bioweapons expert Stephen Hatfill to settle a lawsuit Hatfill brought against the Justice Department , the FBI , and former Attorney General John Ashcroft for destroying his reputation and career by publicly implicating him in the case .
And Glenn Greenwald has pointed out that in 2001 , ABC News was fed false information by several " well - placed sources " ( presumably officials in the Bush administration ) suggesting an Iraq - anthrax link .
That imaginary link was widely cited by pro-war cheerleaders .
At Monday 's White House briefing , I asked if President Bush was satisfied with the progress of the investigation into the attacks .
Press Secretary Dana Perino told me that she did n't even " know if he has had an update on it . "
Here is our exchange : Q
Is the president satisfied with the progress of the investigation into the anthrax attacks ?
MS. PERINO : I do n't know if he has had an update on it .
But obviously this is something that the FBI is doing .
We do n't do the investigation from the White House .
Q Well , is he following the progress ?
MS .
PERINO : You know , I 'm sure he -- he gets updated by Director Mueller once a week on a variety of issues .
And if that comes up , I 'm sure he gets an update .
Q
You do n't know if he 's satisfied with the progress ?
MS. PERINO : I do n't .
One reason I thought the White House might need to be reminded of this issue is because as recently as last January , in his 2008 State of the Union address , the President appeared to have completely forgotten about the attacks , stating , " We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11 . "
The anthrax letters , of course , were postmarked on September 18 and October 9 , 2001 , one to four weeks after 9/11 .
In his radio address to the nation on November 3 , 2001 , Bush called them " a second wave of terrorist attacks , " and promised that " we will solve these crimes , and we will punish those responsible . "
But just a few months later , the White House was already stalling .
Asked about the pace of the investigation on February 25 , 2002 , then - Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said , " The President would like to get this , obviously , resolved as quickly as is possible .
The pace of justice is a methodical one ... the President believes the FBI is doing a good , solid job . "
The question did n't come up again at a White House briefing until more than three years later , when a reporter asked Scott McClellan , " Why have we not found the person or persons responsible for the anthrax attacks of 2001 ? "
Scott 's reply : " That 's a matter that remains a priority .
It remains under investigation .
The FBI continues to pursue it . "
So it 's incredible that now , after three more years , all the White House spokesperson has to say is , " If that comes up , I 'm sure he gets an update . "
Not " he believes the FBI is doing a good job . "
Not even " that matter remains a priority . "
Just " if it comes up , he gets an update . "
That 's simply unacceptable .
Why is n't THE PRESIDENT bringing it up ?
And almost as bad , why has n't the establishment media pressed the administration harder on this issue ?
Especially after this story by David Willman in the L.A.
Times revealed that Justice Department officials kept the investigation focused on Hatfill for almost five years , even though investigators never found any evidence linking him to the attacks , and that many experts who have been involved in the case now believe that it will never be solved .
When the Ramsey family was cleared in the JonBenet case , the media went wild .
I can only suppose that one more Bush failure is no longer considered newsworthy .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first reporter to ask about the Downing Street memo and the Pentagon analysts scandal at White House briefings .
If you ever watched Joe Cocker 's performance at Woodstock in 1969 , you may have wondered what he was singing .
Wonder no more , since he now has subtitles to make it all very clear .
( Thanks , Gary ! )
So , some guy from a local newspaper calls me up a few years back .
" Mind if I ask you some questions ? " he asks so chipperly I can almost picture him all Drudge -d up with fedora , suspenders and tape recorder .
Yes , I think .
Argh !
Whose mom spilled the beans to the press about my school 's 3 1600s ?
" No .
Go right ahead . "
You have n't lived until you 've had the opportunity to field questions from the fourth branch of government .
Reporters usually do n't ask questions unless they 're pretty sure what you 're going to say , especially a feel - good story like this .
They do n't care about carrying on real conversation ; they 're just waiting for you to drop a quote or two they can throw into the story outline they 've put together .
It 's not necessarily bad ; it 's just the way things work .
In high school , you found a few quotes about a subject and built a paper of bullshit on top of those quotes .
Reporters work backwards , starting with a skeleton of bullshit and dropping quotes and stats in where they fit to give some weight to their claims .
The normal stuff .
" What are your interests ? " " Play any sports ? " " Do you get good grades ? " " Were you always smart ? " " Do you have siblings ? " I give disiniterested factual answers and stare at the clock , hoping to get back to my game of Close Combat before the Nazis can bring their Panzershreck unit down on my poor little half - track .
Then : " How did you react when you heard the news ? "
I 'm not too excitable , especially about something like this .
Sure , I was happy that I lived up to my academic potential and pleased my family and all , but I can't put any value in a test that does n't measure honesty , integrity , work ethic , intelligence , reliability , and other factors that truly affect college and job performance .
It certainly does n't make me a better person .
By observation , I 've noticed two types of student obsessed with the SAT .
For some people , the SAT is a culmination of a lifetime spent trying to live up to the dreams of sick parents .
You know the people .
Though devoid of independent thought , they study six hours a night and have been memorizing SAT flashcards since age 3 .
These students , the ones who ran for student council , who got all A+s through sheer will power and parental threat , who attended five " leadership conferences " in their junior year , generally bomb the SATs .
And they cry when no one 's looking because they 've been taught their entire life that their worth is measured by a multiple of 10 .
Yet these are the people who will succeed in college , since they actually know how to study and have n't coasted by on intelligence .
They might be annoying , impossible to talk to intelligently , and very messed - up psychologically by mom and / or dad , but these people know their goals and work feverishly toward them .
There is another group which has a big interest in SATs : arrogant smart kids looking for some confirmation of their mighty intelligence .
It 's like a dick - measuring contest for honor students .
The psychology of this very common type goes back to the worth issue again .
Schools and parents subconsciously teach that the SAT measures intelligence , and colleges use the number to determine your " worth " in a very real way .
So obviously , there 's going to be feelings of superiority over those with lower numbers .
I 've always had confidence in both my intelligence and my penis length , so the only kick I ever got out of being # 1 was knowing that one of these egotistic jerks was n't on top of the heap .
As someone who does n't fit too well in either one of those groups , my interest in the SATs was limited to a realist 's view of the test .
It 's unfair , based a great deal on chance , and poorly designed .
Despite what some advertisements might tell you , the test is made such that any amount of preparation can't increase your score by much more than 100 points .
So while it might measure some aspect of the way your brain works , it does n't measure how much you give a damn .
And in real life , someone who works their ass off will always triumph over a lazy genius .
Plus , filling in circles does not determine intelligence ; most people recognized as geniuses have achieved that status by not following directions .
The SAT is not based on intelligence or knowledge , but some third mental characteristic , a mix of the two that some people have and some people do n't .
Unfortunately , there is such a disparity in the quality of high schools that the SAT is necessary for the colleges to evaluate the student 's true academic potential .
I think the time is fast approaching for a rethinking of the entire educational system .
The only problem is that many people are profiting from our schools being a wreck , so politicians ' palms are being filled with green so frequently that they do n't have any time to write meaningful education bills .
Anyway , back to my " conversation " .
" Oh , I was thrilled . "
Then Clark Kent asks me a question I can't toss off with a clear conscience : " What would be your advice for other students looking to get a 1600 ? "
I could give the textbook " sleep right , good breakfast " shit ( compare : I was up to 2 am drinking , and had Pop Tarts before the test ) .
I could tell them to study vocab words or to stay calm or to take practice tests .
I could tell them a myriad of parent - pleasing lies , but why make the kids suffer ?
Either the kid has it , or he does n't .
Some poor geek is going to have his parents throw this article in his face and try to force him to learn from it .
Should n't I try to give him something he can point to and say " Ha ! " about ?
And maybe teach him something real ?
" My advice would be to not care about the test at all .
It 's not an indication of worth or success , it 's just a silly color - by - letter game made up by people who should know better . "
Silence on the other end of the phone .
He 's not happy with that , but I 'm done talking .
I get back to my computer just in time to see those fucking Germans blow up my half - track .
I never did bother to read the article .
The field of robotics could be poised for a breakthrough , leading to a new generation of intelligent machines capable of taking on multiple tasks and moving out of the factory into the home and general workplace .
The great success of robots so far has been in automating repetitive tasks in process control and assembly , yielding dramatic cuts in production , but the next step towards cognition and more human - like behaviour has proved elusive .
It has been difficult to make robots that can truly learn and adapt to unexpected situations in the way humans can , while it has been equally challenging trying to develop a machine capable of moving smoothly like any animal .
There is still no robot capable of walking properly without jerky slightly unbalanced movements .
But significant progress has been made over the last few years , and the stage was set for a push towards a new generation of intelligent machines at a conference bringing together young scientists in both Europe and Japan , which both have a strong history of robotics development .
The event , jointly organized by the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( JSPS ) , and held in Japan , was targeted at young researchers actively working in the fields of cognitive science and robotics .
The difficult problem of making robots capable of moving elegantly was discussed in two presentations , with Professor Florentin Worgotter from Gottingen University in Germany pointing out that Russian physiologist Nikolai Bernstein had anticipated the difficulty of mimicking animal movements in 1930 , because this required a complex combination of mechanics , neuronal feedback , and instantaneous adaptability .
However Worgotter suggested that with greater understanding now of how animals coordinate their movements , the same principles could soon be transferable to robots , even if it will be some time before this problem is solved completely .
Meanwhile Dr. Shuuji Kajita from Japanese research group AIST demonstrated biped robots with new walking techniques based on the Zero - Moment Point principle , which is essentially designed to ensure that any top heavy system such as a humanoid robot can walk without losing balance or imposing too great a stress on its points of contact with the ground .
Such robots move considerably better than earlier machines , with scope for further improvement .
Enabling robots to be adaptable and learn from their mistakes in their operating environment was another major focus of the ESF / JSPS conference .
Professor Yasuo Kuniyoshi from the University of Tokyo admitted that traditional approaches based on artificial intelligence techniques developed over the past 25 years had not succeeded in making adaptable robots .
Such techniques involve breaking down events that a robot has not been programmed to expect into smaller parts in an attempt to analyse them .
The problem with this is that the robot has no context in which to decide how to act , and an alternative approach now being tried involves imposing constraints on the robot 's interactions , from which more intelligent behavior can emerge .
Then Dr. Ales Ude from the Jozef Stefan Institute in Slovenia introduced the new concept of ' object- action complex ' ( OAC ) , which has recently been proposed to help robots learn actively through manipulation in an attempt to perform specific tasks .
This can be combined with imitation and coaching , resembling more closely the way people learn new tasks .
No matter what approach is adopted to teaching robots , there has to be some form of communication with humans , and so this was another major focus of the conference .
Professor Aude Billard from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Laussane reported recent progress developing natural means of transmitting human knowledge about tasks and skills to robots .
Her work exploits various methods of human - machine interaction , in particular the ability to imitate .
Up to now , giving robots the ability to imitate even simple gestures has proved sufficiently complex to occupy the research community for many years .
But very recently , it has become clear that the way forward lies with enabling robots to interpret the user 's intention and predict the user 's actions .
Billard 's group has progressively added complexity to its algorithms ( computerised procedures ) for learning by imitation , taking inspiration from various stages of learning in children .
This starts from reflexive imitation of body motions and builds up to informed and selective replication of goal - directed tasks .
The future of cognitive robotics lies in combining the techniques discussed at the ESF / JSPS conference to develop true humanoid machines capable of assisting in homes , offices , and public places .
For example a humanoid butler could assist disabled people at home , while humanoid porters could carry heavy bags in airports or train stations .

Kangaroos can stand more than 6ft tall ( 1.8 m ) and weigh 100kg ( 220lbs )
An Australian woman has been saved by a pet dog which leapt to her aid after she was attacked by a large kangaroo , her son has said .
The marsupial assaulted Rosemary Neal , 65 , at her farm near Mudgee in New South Wales , 265 km ( 160 miles ) north - west of Sydney , her son , Darren , said .
" The kangaroo just jumped up and launched straight at her , " he said .
" My dog heard her screaming and bolted down and chased him off .
If it was n't for the dog , she 'd probably be dead . "
Mrs Neal was taken to hospital with concussion and cuts to her face , hands and back , her son said .
He added that the area had been overrun by kangaroos in recent years .
Kangaroos are widespread across Australia .
Most species are not considered aggressive toward humans .

Eschewing the tradition established by spiritual leader Ronald Reagan of fabricating demeaning stories and perpetuating racial stereotypes , the Republican Party on Thursday lashed out after a middle aged black man declined a substantial government handout .
“ It ’s an insult to the droves and droves of people who do accept that money , who take advantage of what the system is offering , ” said Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan .
“ What is he , too good for that money ?
Here we are , trying to make sure the playing field is even , no one has an advantage over anyone else , and he says ‘ thanks but no thanks . ’
This is n’t the America I know and love . ”
Duncan was just one of many GOP leaders to hit out at the grossly unappreciative African American .
One top
House staffer remarked that the man could have bought “ so many darn Cadillacs ” with the money , but “ apparently that just was n’t enough . ”
“ Here we have absurdly rich white men , playing within the rules , Medicare working so well for them .
And this guy goes and declines our giveaways , ” the staffer continued .
“ We designed the system to work , and it worked so well for so long .
Now , this black [ sic ] guy wants to actually try to get ahead , have more than what the government is offering ?
“ Looks like , when we get control of Congress again , we ’ll have to really increase the amount that the federal government gives out , to bring them back into the system , make sure no matter how much more potential you have , you stay on the same level as everyone else . ”
Perhaps most outraged by the African American ’s refusal to take advantage of the government ’s money was syndicated radio show host Rush Limbaugh , who had been vocal for years about his disdain for those who participated in the welfare state .
Now , he concentrated his ire on the man ’s willingness to actually work for every dime he earned .
“ The audacity of this man , to get on the road and work every day to pay his bills and reach his dreams , it enrages me , ” Limbaugh commented during his show on Thursday .
“ Folks , America is under siege , and those of you in a certain twenty two states that are currently polling two candidates within five points of each other in the Presidential race and have either large African American populations or voters dissatisfied with the economy , you ’ll soon feel the impact of this affront to the tried and true American welfare system . ”
Limbaugh became impassioned as the rant went on , continuing until he was nearly in tears .
“ It ’s just not fair .
Now guys like me are going to have to work extra hard , more than ever , to make sure those the playing field is even , thanks to those ingrates . ”
The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory is sending a spacecraft closer to the sun than any probe has ever gone – and what it finds could revolutionize what we know about our star and the solar wind that influences everything in our solar system .
NASA has tapped APL to develop the ambitious Solar Probe mission , which will study the streams of charged particles the sun hurls into space from a vantage point within the sun ’s corona – its outer atmosphere – where the processes that heat the corona and produce solar wind occur .
At closest approach Solar Probe would zip past the sun at 125 miles per second , protected by a carbon - composite heat shield that must withstand up to 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit and survive blasts of radiation and energized dust at levels not experienced by any previous spacecraft .
Experts in the U.S. and abroad have grappled with this mission concept for more than 30 years , running into seemingly insurmountable technology and budgetary limitations .
But in February an APL - led team completed a Solar Probe engineering and mission design study at NASA ’s request , detailing just how the robotic mission could be accomplished .
The study team used an APL - led 2005 study as its baseline , but then significantly altered the concept to meet challenging cost and technical conditions provided by NASA .
“ We knew we were on the right track , ” says Andrew Dantzler , Solar Probe project manager at APL .
“ Now we ’ve put it all together in an innovative package ; the technology is within reach , the concept is feasible and the entire mission can be done for less than $ 750 million [ in fiscal 2007 dollars ] , or about the cost of a medium - class planetary mission .
NASA decided it was time . ”
APL will design and build the spacecraft , on a schedule to launch in 2015 .
The compact , solar - powered probe would weigh about 1,000 pounds ; preliminary designs include a 9 - foot - diameter , 6 - inch - thick , carbon - foam - filled solar shield atop the spacecraft body .
Two sets of solar arrays would retract or extend as the spacecraft swings toward or away from the sun during several loops around the inner solar system , making sure the panels stay at proper temperatures and power levels .
At its closest passes the spacecraft must survive solar intensity more than 500 times what spacecraft experience while orbiting Earth .
Solar Probe will use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its orbit around the sun , coming as close as 4.1 million miles ( 6.6 million kilometers ) to the sun , well within the orbit of Mercury and about eight times closer than any spacecraft has come before .
Solar Probe will employ a combination of in - place and remote measurements to achieve the mission ’s primary scientific goals : determine the structure and dynamics of the magnetic fields at the sources of solar wind ; trace the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind ; determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles ; and explore dusty plasma near the sun and its influence on solar wind and energetic particle formation .
Details will be spelled out in a Solar Probe Science and Technology Definition Team study that NASA will release later this year .
NASA will also release a separate Announcement of Opportunity for the spacecraft ’s science payload .
“ Solar Probe is a true mission of exploration , ” says Dr. Robert Decker , Solar Probe project scientist at APL .
“ For example , the spacecraft will go close enough to the sun to watch the solar wind speed up from subsonic to supersonic , and it will fly though the birthplace of the highest energy solar particles .
And , as with all missions of discovery , Solar Probe is likely to raise more questions than it answers . ”
APL ’s experience in developing spacecraft to study the sun-Earth relationship – or to work near the sun – includes ACE , which recently marked its 10th year of sampling energetic particles between Earth and the sun ; TIMED , currently examining solar effects on Earth 's upper atmosphere ; the twin STEREO probes , which have snapped the first 3 - D images of explosive solar events called coronal mass ejections ; and the Radiation Belt Storm Probes , which will examine the regions of energetic particles trapped by Earth ’s magnetic field .
Solar Probe will be fortified with heat - resistant technologies developed for APL ’s MESSENGER spacecraft , which completed its first flyby of Mercury in January and will begin orbiting that planet in 2011 .
Solar Probe ’s solar shield concept was partially influenced by designs of MESSENGER ’s sunshade .
The British government , oil producing countries and oil companies are all to blame for high oil prices , according to a recent UK poll .
With the government taking most of the blame ( 38 % of those polled placed the blame on Whitehall ) , it seems that few people acknowledge the fact that increasing consumption of a finite resource sold on a volatile world market is the real reason for high prices at the pump .
Of course , taxation makes up a significant percentage of the retail price of fuel , which is something that governments do have influence over .
To this effect , Conservative party leader David Cameron has proposed a sliding scale for value added fuel tax which decreases as crude oil prices increase , shielding the consumer from global oil market shocks .
However , taxation is ultimately irrelevant to the long term future of oil prices , as prices will inevitably rise as demand in an increasingly affluent world continues to outstrip increase in supply .
It is in this respect that Western governments need to face up to the necessity of implementing long term policies to reduce and eventually eliminate the world economy ’s dependence on oil .
Solutions for the future ?
Reducing , or indeed increasing fuel taxes wo n’t achieve this , and neither will drilling for more oil or encouraging people to dive fewer miles in more efficient cars .
The only real solution is the development of technology that can offer similar practicality to fossil fuels and provide this to billions of consumers at a low price ( in many places a pint of oil still costs less than a pint of beer ) , and this technology will only be developed and become viable as oil prices increase , letting the market do its work by reducing the comparable cost and risk of new investments .
Perhaps , therefore , the best thing that governments can do in this case is to leave the issue alone – governments have a poor track record in successful market intervention , with many current drilling and tax reduction proposals likely to only prolong the pain and increase damage to the environment .
The British are right to blame their government , although maybe we should blame them for doing too much , rather than too little ?

Chaos at the heart of Britain 's nuclear clean - up industry has been laid bare by an internal government audit after embarrassing cost overruns and bureaucratic bungling .
The Department for Business admits there are " inherent risks " associated with the financial affairs of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ( NDA ) that forced the department to find £ 400 m from other budgets to balance the books .
It also admits that budgetary problems were exacerbated by misunderstandings , unminuted meetings and lack of sufficiently trained staff .
In response to a critical report by MPs about its handling of the NDA , the department ( BERR ) reveals that 42 % of its budget is already being pumped into the NDA , which admitted last week its total future clean - up cost estimates were now £ 10 bn higher than 12 months ago at £ 73bn .
The job of overseeing the NDA has been moved from BERR 's energy group to its shareholder executive in an attempt to tighten up accounting while the NDA has sent its finance staff for retraining at the National School of Government run by the civil service , the report reveals .
The operational failures of the Thorp and Mox fuel recycling plants at Sellafield in Cumbria are known to be largely responsible for wiping millions of pounds of expected income off the NDA 's budget , leaving it to seek more cash from government .
" The fact that the funding gap anticipated was met in part by using all of BERR's end year flexibility illustrates the extent to which the department is vulnerable to movements in the NDA 's budget caused in large part by the reliance on volatile commercial income , " says BERR in its report - " NDA budgeting shortfall 2007 - 8 lessons learned " - which was quietly slipped out through a parliamentary website this week .
The document , a response to a business and enterprise committee inquiry , reveals that the NDA and the Treasury were at cross-purposes over some aspects of the clean - up agency 's budget and decisions taken at a vital meeting as far back as February 2006 were misunderstood .
These problems were exacerbated by the lack of proper procedures at those talks .
" There is no formal record of that meeting , nor was there subsequently any correspondence that confirmed what those present believed to have been agreed , " the BERR report says .
" To minimise the risk of misunderstandings in the future , all parties have acknowledged the importance of a written record of all material decisions and future actions . "
The report also says that the government is looking at whether changes are needed to help the NDA manage its budget more effectively .
It admits the " commercial income [ from Thorp and Mox ] is volatile and over time will decline as sites progressively close and move into the decommissioning phase " .
Greenpeace was scathing about the latest revelations .
" Just when you thought things could n't get any worse we find out that the people in charge of dealing with Britain 's radioactive waste have adopted chaos theory as a business model , " said Ben Ayliffe , senior nuclear campaigner at Greenpeace UK .
" The NDA 's failure is as much a failure of government , who set up the authority knowing it would have to rely for half of its income on failing nuclear plants .
The same government that brought us this shambolic funding system is now telling us it can deliver new nuclear without subsidy .
No one can take this claim seriously on the basis of this latest nuclear farce we 're witnessing . "
The government has switched money meant for low - carbon and renewable technologies to clean up the waste from nuclear power stations .
Figures released by BERR in February showed that at least £ 15 m that was meant to be used on " sustainable energy capital grants " had been switched to the NDA .
Ministers also plundered the defence budget as well as cash that should have been used for " regional selective assistance " to bolster the NDA .
BERR said some money had been switched in the spring supplementary estimates for 2007 - 08 but insisted this was a technical matter to balance the books on paper .
The NDA 's budget problems have also caused conflict with the Environment Agency , which argued that insufficient funds had been made available by ministers for the clean - up of certain sites .
The NDA was accused of making things worse by deciding to concentrate on especially toxic waste at sites such as Sellafield .
This prioritisation will delay clean - up elsewhere , the Environment Agency argued .

Bill Gross on the “ suspicious ” inflation reporting in the U.S …. how proper measures would affect your investments
Trade deficit soars to 13 - month high … what ’s to blame for our $ 60 billion imbalance
Chris Mayer puts speculators ’ influence on oil prices in sobering perspective
FHA takes giant loss … how the government ’s mortgage financer is suddenly facing insolvency
Another stimulus package ?
Which presidential hopeful is calling for a second round o’ rebates
There ’s a common cliche : “ too little , too late . ”
Whether this phrase was made for politicians , we do n’t know .
But they are so freaking good at it :
“ A strong dollar is in our nation ’s interests , ” said President Bush yesterday .
The man behind our record government debts and deficits promised to continue “ our nation ’s commitment to a strong dollar . ”
You can sleep tight tonight … the White House will be closely “ monitoring the situation . ”
Hank Paulson added his 2 cents yesterday , saying he , “ would never take [ monetary ] intervention off the table . ”
In an interview with CNBC , the Treasury secretary hinted that his department is willing to do whatever it takes to prop up the ol ’ greenback , including market intrusion .
But of course , that wo n’t be necessary , as the U.S. ’s “ long - term fundamentals compare quite favorably with other major industrial nations around the world , and that ’s going to be reflected in … the value of our currency . ”
Right … long - term fundamentals will soon be reflected in the value of the U.S. dollar .
That ’s what scares us .
“ The Federal Open Market Committee will strongly resist an erosion of longer - term inflation expectations , ” uttered Ben Bernanke , completing the trifecta of Capitol Hill jawboning .
Similar to his speeches last week , Bernanke hinted yesterday that inflation is becoming the Fed ’s No. 1 concern : “ The risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so . ”
Markets reacted quickly to the trio of dollar proppers .
In Chicago , bookies and gamblers — ugh , excuse us — futures traders now give 1 - in - 3 odds that the Fed will raise rates before August .
They meet again on June 24 - 25 … we ’re not holding our breath .
And currency traders took the bait …
The dollar index shot up a full point yesterday .
This morning , it ’s trading at a one - month high of 73.4 .
The euro ’s down nearly 3 cents from its Monday peak , to $ 1.55 .
Same story with the pound , down to $ 1.95 .
The yen kept its cool , at 106 .
“ I ’ll tell you an area where we ’ve been foolin ’ ourselves , ” writes Bill Gross in his latest monthly missive , “ and that ’s the belief that inflation is under control . ”
Here ’s the cornerstone of Gross ’s argument … the averaged inflation rates of 24 global nations versus the U.S. government ’s measure of American inflation :
“ Looks a mite suspicious , ” understates Gross .
“ Sure , inflation was legitimately much higher in selected hot spots such as Brazil and Vietnam in the late ’90s and the U.S. productivity ‘ miracle ’ may have helped reduce ours a touch , compared to some of the rest , but the U.S. dollar over the same period has declined by 30 % against a currency basket of its major competitors , which should have had an opposite effect , everything else being equal .
“ I ask you : Does it make sense that we have a 3 - 4 % lower rate of inflation than the rest of the world ?
Can economists really explain this with their contorted Phillips curve , output gap , multifactor productivity theorizing in an increasingly globalized , ‘ one price fits all , ’ commodity - driven global economy ?
I suspect not .
Somebody ’s been foolin’ , perhaps foolin’ themselves .
According to Gross , if inflation were measured more accurately , a “ readjustment of investor mentality ” would push bond , stock and real estate prices down 5 - 10 % .
President Bush ’s “ strong dollar ” policies have garnered the biggest trade deficit in over a year , the Commerce Department announced this morning .
In their monthly “ trade balance ” report , the government reported that trade was … well … rather unbalanced .
The April trade deficit widened 7.8 % , to $ 60.9 billion .
That ’s the biggest gap since March 2007 .
Oil imports were largely to blame .
The U.S. imported a record $ 29 billion worth of crude , up $ 4 billion from last month .
Interestingly , the U.S. paid an average price of $ 96 a barrel in April .
We ’ll go way out on a limb here and forecast that there ’re more crude import records to come .
It ’s worth noting that U.S. exports attained a record high of their own .
Export sales totaled $ 155 billion in April , up 3 % .
Aircraft , farming machinery and medical equipment were the biggest drivers in the latest all - time high .
Oil retreated from record highs yesterday , but remains at $ 134 a barrel .
A good bit of the “ pullback ” can be attributed to the International Energy Agency … the IEA cut its global demand forecast again yesterday .
The global energy watchdog says it still expects demand to increase this year , but by only 0.9 % , down from its 1.2 % forecast earlier this year .
“ I guess traders did n’t bother to read beyond the executive summary , ” notes our friend Dave Gonigam .
“ The IEA cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries , too . ”
Indeed , the report was not as one sided as the market has interpreted … we found this to be the key takeaway in the latest IEA forecast :
“ Supply growth so far this year has been poor and higher prices are needed to choke off demand to balance the market …
Abnormally high prices are largely explained by fundamentals ” .
“ I find it remarkable , ” opines Chris Mayer , “ that so many people seem to refer now to the oil price as being a ‘ bubble ’ without any reservation .
It is as if the oil bubble were a self - evident truth .
“ I ’m not so sure .
A bubble implies that nothing but pure speculation drives the price higher .
But it seems to me that plenty of fundamentals underpin a high oil price . ”
( Two of those fundamentals — U.S. money supply and growing foreign demand — Chris has told you about before … two of our favorite charts . )
“ Besides , hedge funds hold about 1.1 billion barrels of oil through futures contracts , according to Goldman Sachs .
The world burns through 31 billion barrels per year .
Kind of puts the 1.1 billion in perspective , no ?
In reality , it ’s a pretty slender inventory .
Maybe people are n’t building up their inventories enough .
“ I do n’t know where oil is headed .
I know we will have gut - wrenching pullbacks .
But it seems to be that $ 100 - plus oil is here to stay for at least several years . ”
Chris has advised his Special Situations readers pick up a few select oil and gas exploration and production companies .
He tells us there are a few lesser - known domestic “ E& Ps ” with big acreage and even bigger potential for meaningful finds .
You can get the details by signing up , here .
Gasoline prices reached another all - time high today .
The national average “ price at the pump ” is up to $ 4.04 for the cheap stuff .
Grain prices are still on the rise , as well .
Corn contracts in Chicago found another record high , $ 6.73 a bushel , as today ’s planting progress report was worse than expected .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said only 60 % of the American corn crop is in “ good or excellent condition . ”
Last week , they said 63 % was in similar shape ; a year ago , 77 % was in the same condition .
What ’s more , only 77 % of the nation ’s soybean crop has been planted .
This time last year , 92 % was in the dirt .
“ The U.S. ’s ‘ strategic grain reserve ’ is almost empty , too , ” adds Kevin Kerr .
“ It ’s not really a formal ‘ strategic reserve ’ like the Petroleum Reserve , but it is an indicator of how much grain we have on hand , should we have a major domestic crop failure , such as we are witnessing now .
“ According to published reports , there are only 24.1 million bushels of wheat in inventory .
With recent sales for humanitarian relief , that leaves only 2.7 million bushels in the entire inventory .
To put that number in perspective , it ’s about enough wheat to make only half a loaf of bread for every family in the U.S.
In addition , the reserve shows there is no cheese , no butter , no dry milk powder , no additional grains .
The cupboard is bare , that ’s for sure . ”
As food and energy costs soar — get this —
Washingtonites are already clamoring for a second “ stimulus package . ”
Barack “ I ’m a free - market guy ” Obama said yesterday that Washington should inject another $ 50 billion into the ailing U.S. economy .
Stunned by Friday ’s jobs report , Obama called for the extension of unemployment benefits and another round of stimulus checks .
The bill he proposed would add at least another 13 weeks of unemployment benefits to the current 26 - week federal cap .
The rebate checks , well , he has n’t figured out how that will work yet … just an idea .
Bush ’s influence spreading … in more ways than one Bush ’s influence spreading … in more ways than one
Elsewhere in Washington , the Federal Housing Administration quietly admitted yesterday a $ 4.6 billion loss .
The FHA , the government ’s mortgage financer and insurer , is suffering unexpectedly high default rates on home loans .
Gasp !
Can you believe it ?!
The FHA has found its own special way to put its business in jeopardy : the seller - financed down payment mortgage .
That ’s when the seller covers the buyer ’s down payment and then adds the payment to the total price of the loan … an awesome way for people with zero capital and horrible credit to own a home .
Who would have thought these would n’t pan out ?
Not the FHA … seller - financed down payment mortgages account for over 30 % of their loan portfolio .
FHA officials announced that it had to extract over $ 4 billion from its measly $ 21 billion capital cushion to cover the losses .
“ No insurance company can sustain that amount of additional costs year after year and still survive , ” admitted FHA chief Brian Montgomery .
“ Unless we take action to mitigate these losses , FHA will soon either have to shut down or rely on appropriations to operate . ”
The U.S. stock market is having a hard time digesting all this drama .
Traders suffered a volatile day yesterday , and when the dust settled , major indexes were all over the place .
The Nasdaq fell 0.6 % , the S&P 500 finished unchanged , and the Dow rallied 0.5 % .
Investors in China , however , had no such dilemma .
The Shanghai Composite plunged 7.7 % as we slept last night .
Chinese markets were closed the day before , so this morning ’s session was the first chance to react to Friday ’s bloodbath on Wall Street .
Plus , the Chinese central bank announced it would be raising the required reserve ratio for banks yet again .
The People ’s Bank of China has moved the RRR 15 times in the last year and a half .
That may be a welcome relief for those watching Chinese growth and inflation … but for Shanghai Composite investors , already down 42 % this year , it was just another reason to sell .
Other Asian nations felt the pain too … Hong Kong ’s market fell 4.2 % .
Taiwan fell around 2.5 % .
India , Japan , Indonesia and South Korea all fell over 1 % , too .
“ Since the beginning of history , it has been very difficult to hold onto your money , ” writes a reader .
“ If members of your own clan did n’t try to take it , then rival clans would , and even if you could defend your wealth from them , you could always trust that your own king or priest or army would come after it .
“ The only thing that has changed is that they now use the law to get your money .
If you want to keep some of your wealth , in addition to a good lawyer , diversification can help …
“ But perhaps I ’m just paranoid … growing up , my father used to remind me about how after the civil war ( in Nigeria ) all the Igbos ( the loosing side ) who had more than £ 10 had their bank balances reset to £ 10 ( about $ 100 , adjusting for inflation . )
All their shares were confiscated and all their real estate in major cities was classified as ‘ abandoned ’ and confiscated by the state .
“ I ’m not saying it would ever happen in America ( after all , Americans love the rich and do n’t see currency speculators , oil executives and other rich people as their enemies ) , but I really wonder what percentage of voters own gold and how many of them would care if confiscating people ’s gold was sold as ‘ a solution ’ to inflation and unemployment ? ”

NEW YORK – Sandra Day O'Connor is going from Supreme Court justice to game maker .
Delivering the keynote address Wednesday at the annual Games For Change conference at Parsons The New School For Design , O'Connor detailed a project she is spearheading called Our Courts , which she described as an " online , interactive civic education project for seventh - and eighth - graders " that familiarizes students with the legal system .
O'Connor believes that America 's youth are n't learning enough about civics , and thinks that the educational power of videogames is just the thing to change that .
" Only one - third of Americans can name the three branches of government , " O'Connor said , " but two - thirds can name a judge on American Idol . "
" If someone told me when I retired from court that I 'd be talking at a conference about digital gaming , I 'd think they'd had one drink too many , " O'Connor told the crowd of academics and gaming professionals .
Now in its fifth year , the Games For Change conference is hosted by Parsons The New School For Design and is dedicated to exploring the development of videogames that deal with social issues .
" Of the three branches of government , the one that 's least understood is the judiciary , " said former U.S. Senator and current New School President Bob Kerrey , introducing O'Connor .
O'Connor said that the No Child Left Behind act of 2001 has
" effectively squeezed out civics education " from public schools .
" We can't forget that the primary purpose of public schools in America is to produce citizens who have the skills and knowledge to sustain our form of government , " she said .
" Public education is the only longterm solution to preserving an independent judiciary and constitutional democracy . "
That 's why , O'Connor said , she wanted to work alongside University of Wisconsin - Madison professor James Paul Gee to create Our Courts , which will begin rolling out in September 2009 .
The game " lets students engage in real issues and real problems , " O'Connor said .
It will allow them to " step into the shoes of a judge , a legislator , an executive – teach them how to think through and analyze problems , take action and voice opinions to their elected representatives . "
An early exercise in the game will likely deal with educating students about their First Amendment rights , using examples like Tinker v. Des Moines and the " Bong Hits For Jesus " case .
O'Connor said that she is " encouraged " to see young people becoming involved in political campaigns through the net .
" E- mailing , blogging , networking on Facebook – they can take leadership , make their voices heard through tools that belong to their generation .
We need to give them ownership to allow them to interact with the material , " she said .

This is potentially huge .
Viacom , which owns MTV and Paramount Pictures , has been involved in a legal battle with YouTube ( and now Google ) over what Viacom alleges is massive copyright infringement of their property .
Viacom claims to have identified 160,000 unauthorised clips of its programmes .
Now , a US court has told Google that it must hand over the a detailed log – some 12 terabytes of data – which contains the log -in ID of all users , as well as their IP address and information on all the video clips they have ever watched .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , a digital rights group , has called the ruling “ a set - back to privacy rights . ”
And it is .
I mean , there ’s nothing really explicit or illegal on YouTube ( I think ) , but the idea that a corporation has the right to snoop around the viewing habits of everybody , just because 160,000 clips , out of an estimated 1.5 billion YouTube video clips , may or may not contain copyright material , is pretty scandalous .
It ’s not just Viacom , either ; the UK ’s Premier League is also filing a lawsuit against Google claiming that YouTube has been used to show football highlights .
I mean , really – highlights ?
What ’s the big deal ?
YouTube has responded by initialising new filtering tools to prevent copyright materials being uploaded to their site .
Last time I looked , they did n’t appear to be working too well .
A spokesman for the EFF said , “ The Court ’s erroneous ruling is a set - back to privacy rights , and will allow Viacom to see what you are watching on YouTube .
We urge Viacom to back off this overbroad request and Google to take all steps necessary to challenge this order and protect the rights of its users . ”
How long until YouTube ‘ does a Napster ’ , and becomes a shallow , big business - friendly version of itself ( i.e. , with no users ) , or disappears altogether ?
All it ’s going to take is a Viacom victory – or whoever else decides to go to bat against Google .
Until then , be careful what you watch – do you really want Viacom to know that you ’ve seen the laughing baby ten thousand times ?

The man who fell off a sofa while laughing at Have I Got News For You - and ended up in court
A man was handcuffed , arrested and dragged before a court after falling off the settee with laughter while watching Have I Got News For You .
Christopher Cocker , 36 , was enjoying the BBC1 show when a joke made by panellist Paul Merton had him doubled up with laughter .
He collapsed on the floor - but the thud startled his downstairs neighbour who , believing he had collapsed , called police .
Funny man : Paul Merton 's joke on Have I Got News For
You left Christopher Cocker rolling on the floor with laughter - and then locked in a police cell
Officers arrived and said Cocker was initially co-operative but became ' aggressive ' when they asked his name and tried to shut his front door .
He was eventually disabled with parva spray through the gap and arrested .
Jonathan Taylor , defending , said : ' The officer accepts in his statement that he struck my client and then sprayed him again .
' He was handcuffed and unceremoniously thrown into the back of a police van .
When he ended up in a police cell he was asking himself how all this had happened . '
Mr Taylor told Blackburn Magistrates ' Court , Lancs. , said that having informed the police he was the only one in the flat and he was fine , his client could not understand why they wanted his details .
' With hindsight he should just have told the police what they wanted to know and they would have gone on their way , ' said Mr Taylor .
Cocker , of Blackburn , Lancs. , pleaded guilty to resisting a police officer and was given a conditional discharge for six months following the incident on May 20 .
A charge of assaulting PC Michael Davies was withdrawn .
Speaking after the hearing , Cocker said he had been in his flat minding his own business .
He said : ' I can't believe it - I was thrown in the back of a police van before being stripped naked and put in a cell .
' I was handcuffed behind my back and my ankles bound with plastic ties before six of them carried me to the van .
'' It was something Paul Merton said and I remember falling of the settee , I did n't think it would end up in court .
' I had n't had a drink or anything , I was just watching TV and all this happened .
Paul Merton is one of my favourites .
He 's really funny . '
Prosecutor Alex Mann said the police went to ensure everything was all right and spoke to Cocker who was ' co- operative and relaxed ' and he assured the officers everything was fine .
' He only became worked up when the police asked for his details , ' said Mrs Mann .
' The police tried to explain they just needed the name for the report but he became aggressive and started swearing at the officer . '
After the hearing Joan Codling , 57 , who lives in the flat below and made the call to police , said she contacted officers after being concerned that he may have fallen ill .
She said : ' I was worried in case he was having an epileptic fit .
There was a lot of noise and I did n't know what to do so I called the police . '
A police spokesman said Cocker became ' aggressive ' towards the officers who feared for their own safety .
The spokesman said : ' Parva spray was used to stop any confrontation and was necessary to protect the officers and any members of the public who were around at the time .
' Within the circumstances , we feel we used reasonable force . '
( Fortune Magazine ) -- Doug Buchanan grins with relief when he sees the carcasses .
He has just driven up a steep dirt road onto a vast , sunbaked mesa overlooking the Mojave Desert in western Nevada .
There , a few feet from the trail , lie the corpses of two steers .
A raven perches on one , the only object more than three feet above the ground on this pancake - flat plateau .
Cattle , dead or alive , qualify as good news in Buchanan 's line of work .
If cattle are present , that means grazing is permitted , and that in turn means that this land is most likely not protected habitat for the desert tortoise .
Buchanan , 53 , is scouting sites for a solar power company called BrightSource Energy , an Oakland - based startup backed by Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) .
The blunt , fifth - generation Californian , who used to survey the same area for natural - gas power sites , knows that the presence of an endangered species such as the tortoise could derail BrightSource 's plans to build a multibillion - dollar solar energy plant on the mesa .
BrightSource badly wants these 20 square miles of federal land on what is called Mormon Mesa .
The company was in such a hurry to stake its claim with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management that it applied for a lease sight unseen .
That 's an expensive gamble for a startup , given that application fees alone run in the six figures .
" I usually like to go out and kick the tires before filing a claim , " Buchanan says , " but there 's a lot of competitive pressure these days to move fast . "
That 's putting it mildly .
A solar land rush is rolling across the desert Southwest .
Goldman Sachs , utilities PG&E and FPL , Silicon Valley startups , Israeli and German solar firms , Chevron , speculators - all are scrambling to lock up hundreds of thousands of acres of long - worthless land now coveted as sites for solar power plants .
The race has barely begun - finished plants are years away - but it 's blazing fastest in the Mojave , where the federal government controls immense stretches of some of the world 's best solar real estate right next to the nation 's biggest electricity markets .
Just 20 months ago only five applications for solar sites had been filed with the BLM in the California Mojave .
Today 104 claims have been received for nearly a million acres of land , representing a theoretical 60 gigawatts of electricity .
( The entire state of California currently consumes 33 gigawatts annually . )
It 's not just a federal - land grab either .
Buyers are also vying for private property .
Some are paying upwards of $ 10,000 an acre for desert dirt that a few years ago would have sold for $ 500 .
No doubt the prospect of potential riches is overheating expectations .
But California and surrounding states have mandated massive increases in renewable energy in the next few years .
That has led some experts at Emerging Energy Research of Cambridge , Mass. , to predict that Big Solar could be a $ 45 billion market by 2020 .
Meanwhile , the land rush is setting the stage for a showdown between solar investors and those who want to protect a fragile environment that is home to the desert tortoise and other rare critters .
The Southwest is on the cusp of what could be a green revolution .
And the biggest obstacle of all may be ... environmentalists .

Over the past year a parade of executives bearing land claims have made the trek to a stucco BLM office just off the interstate in the dusty city of Needles , Calif. , a 110 - mile drive south from Las Vegas .
( It 's the town where the late " Peanuts " cartoonist , Charles M. Schulz , briefly lived as a boy ; in the comic strip , Snoopy 's brother Spike is a resident . )
The Bush administration has instructed the BLM to facilitate renewable - energy projects ( along with nonrenewable ones ) .
But Sterling
White , the BLM 's earnest Needles field manager , is also concerned about what could happen if they transform the Mojave into a collection of giant power stations .
" One of our biggest challenges is the cumulative impact of these projects , " he says .
Nearly 80 % of the land that White 's office oversees is federally protected wilderness or endangered - species habitat .
That leaves about 700,000 acres for solar power plants , only some of which are near transmission lines .
Land leases are handed out on a first - come , first - served basis , but White is also supposed to weed out speculators from genuine solar developers based on loose criteria such as who is negotiating with utilities and who is applying for state power licenses .
White has yet to approve a single lease , but he has summarily rejected four because they lie in protected - species habitat .
***
Solar prospectors tend to be as secretive about their land as forty - niners were about the veins of gold they discovered .
Most bids are placed by limited - liability corporations with opaque names that conceal their ownership .
And no one has been as quick to move into the Mojave - or as tightlipped about it - as Solar Investments .
That entity , it turns out , is Goldman Sachs 's ( GS , Fortune 500 ) solar subsidiary .
The investment bank 's designs on the desert are a topic of intense interest and speculation .
Goldman declined to comment .
But here 's what we know :
Solar Investments filed its first land claim in December 2006 and within a month had applied for more than 125,000 acres for power plants that would produce ten gigawatts of electricity .
Many of the sites lie close to the transmission lines that connect the desert to coastal cities .
( Goldman has also staked claims on 40,000 acres of the Nevada desert . ) **
Nobody expects Goldman to begin operating solar plants .
It will probably either partner with another developer or sell its limited - liability company ( and its leases ) outright .
The firm has been making the rounds of solar developers .
" The conversation 's been pretty wide - ranging , primarily as an investor interested in financing deals , " says one solar energy executive approached by Goldman .
" But there 's clearly an element of interest in our technology . "
Goldman has requested permission to install meteorological equipment on its sites and is evaluating " competing technologies , including solar dish systems , power towers , and large - scale photovoltaic arrays , " according to a letter Goldman sent to the BLM in August 2007 .

CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa ( CNN ) -- Iowa officials are concerned about towns along the Mississippi River as floodwaters in the state 's eastern counties began to drain toward the river .
Two weeks of flooding has left five people dead and forced more than 38,000 from their homes as several major rivers that feed into the Mississippi -- including the Cedar , Des Moines and Iowa rivers -- overflowed their banks .
The National Weather Service warned that the Mississippi River was expected to crest at nearly 26 feet at Burlington , Iowa , on Wednesday .
That 's about 11 feet above flood stage , partly because of levee failures along the Iowa River that have dumped more water into the system .
In Washington , Sen .
Tom Harkin of Iowa said the flooding has devastated his state 's corn crop and may have inflicted up to $ 1 billion in damage to Iowa 's agricultural sector alone .
The flooding has forced farm - equipment manufacturer John Deere to idle two plants in Waterloo , he said .
" Across eastern Iowa , the flooding rivers have washed out railroad lines ; Mississippi barge traffic has come to a halt ; and closed major roadways , " said Harkin , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee .
" Thousands of Iowa businesses , large and small , have been impacted . "
In Cedar Rapids , residents were allowed to return home temporarily to retrieve keepsakes and other items Sunday , but authorities said Monday that strike teams had determined the neighborhoods were no longer safe , even for a quick visit .
" We are taking a step back , " Cedar Rapids Fire Department spokesman Dave Brown said , adding it would be awhile before evacuees would be permitted to go back home .
Police set up checkpoints to keep people away from the affected neighborhoods , deemed unsafe after weeks of heavy rain forced the Cedar River from its banks , leaving much of Iowa 's second - largest city underwater .

Evacuees waited in line at the checkpoints Sunday to receive special wristbands that allowed them to go home and gather their belongings .
Authorities set a curfew and asked the residents to stay out of the neighborhoods between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. , so people stuffed what they could into plastic bags and returned to the checkpoints .
One resident , however , grew angry when he was not allowed to pass a checkpoint Monday , according to a news release from the Cedar Rapids Police Department .
After being denied re-entry to a flooded neighborhood , Rick Blazek , 53 , returned to his vehicle as a state trooper used his police vehicle to block the checkpoint , according to the news release .
" Blazek drove his vehicle toward the state trooper and struck the state trooper three times with his vehicle , " the release said .
Police told Blazek to get out of his vehicle , and when he refused , " the driver 's window was broken out because the doors were locked and Blazek was removed from his vehicle , " according to the release .
The trooper was not injured .
Blazek , who was arrested and charged with assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon , could not be immediately reached for comment .
Flood - related deaths include a 35 - year - old man found on a gravel road near Wapello , an Iowa State University student struck by lightning in Curlew , a farmer swept away by floodwaters in Wright County , a man killed in a car accident in Hamilton County and a 51 - year - old woman found dead in her Cedar Rapids home , said Courtney Greene , a spokeswoman for Iowa Gov. Chet Culver 's office .
" We 're looking at all - time flood records in terms of levels , " Culver told reporters Monday evening .
" The challenges remain , but we are more determined than ever to win the fight . "
Iowa authorities have determined that the death of a woman whose body was found in her car Monday was not flood - related .
The woman was found near New London , after her stopped car was hit by a National Guard bus .
Investigators determined the woman died before the collision , Greene said .
Resident Tracy Murphy was able to return to her home Sunday before authorities deemed the neighborhoods dangerous .
She made a beeline for her family photos when she entered her house , parts of which looked as if burglars had ransacked it .
Watch Murphy return home »
" Anything can be replaced , but your photos can 't , " she said .
A trash can was overturned and belongings were strewn across rooms .
Murphy 's eyes welled up as the realization hit her : " My whole , entire life is gone . "

The checkpoints -- manned by police and the Iowa National Guard -- remained in place Monday , but Brown said authorities would not be letting residents check on their homes .
Strike teams assessed the residential and commercial areas where the waters had receded Sunday and determined those areas were not safe for re-entry , he said .

Veronica Johnson evacuated her home and later had to evacuate her mother 's house , she said .
She has n't been able to return in four days -- and not just because of dangerous floodwaters .
" I live by a gas station , and the tankers from underground busted up through the ground , so I have gas spilled all around my house and the whole neighborhood , " she said .
Residents have been getting angry with the authorities who are keeping them from their homes , she said , but she understands safety comes first .
" They have Red Cross , police department , fire department , and the people who they brought in -- the Marines and stuff , the National Guard -- have been excellent , " she said .
" They are keeping us out of our homes even though we 're getting upset with them .
We have no right because they 're trying to protect us . "
Local authorities expect to release a list of areas that are safe by Monday afternoon , with the hope that people can begin returning to their homes Tuesday , Brown said .
About 36,000
Iowans were evacuated because of statewide flooding , 24,000 of them in Cedar Rapids .
The massive flooding has overwhelmed the city -- which is in a 500 - year flood plain , an area the federal government says has less than a 0.2 percent chance of flooding .
Watch residents begin the cleanup process »
" It 's been compared to a 3,000 - year flood , " Cedar Rapids police Detective Brad Novak said .
" So something with that rarity of an event , there is no playbook to go by . "
Culver has declared 83 of the state 's 99 counties disaster areas .
More than 3,300 Iowa National Guard troops have been deployed to help primarily with sandbagging and staging resources , Maj. Gen. Ron Dardis of the Iowa National Guard said Sunday .
Another 700 troops were expected to join them Monday .
Watch workers desperately sling sandbags »
There have been 18 weather - related deaths in the state since May 25 -- 12 of them from tornadoes and the rest linked to flooding , Greene said .
This month 's severe weather has trampled towns from North Dakota to Indiana .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency says more than 11 million Midwesterners will be affected by flooding and tornadoes .
FEMA has set up six disaster recovery centers in Iowa and has provided nearly $ 4 million in assistance so far , state and federal officials reported .
So far , 24 counties are under federal disaster declarations , making residents eligible for individual aid , Lt. Gov. Patty Judge reported .
The flooding is " some of the worst " to hit the United States since Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast nearly three years ago , FEMA Administrator David Paulison said Sunday .
Watch how the Midwest is familiar with flooding »
The agency has received more than 12,000 disaster assistance applications from the hardest - hit states -- Iowa , Indiana and Wisconsin .
Starting Tuesday , the American Red Cross will set up kitchens in Iowa to serve up about 100,000 meals to residents each day .
The agency , which is housing 720 flood victims in 30 shelters , plans to spend about $ 15 million on Midwest relief efforts .

There was a time when I was more than dabbling in heroin , when I went totally into myself and detached myself from society , and I sat down and wrote some really good songs , like ' Barbed Wire Boy ' , which was about someone on gear .
I liked heroin because it made me feel warm , made me feel I did n't need anyone else .
But now I 'm not just a songwriter but singing in a band , and my focus is performing and not wanting to let the band down .
We all want to make a success of it and the unity has given me a focus - a bit like heroin , actually .
So I do n't perform under the influence .
Any drugs I choose to take will only be after I 've performed .
I do n't think I want , or can afford , to be unprofessional and experiment with speed and ketamine on stage , even if I think it might make me interact with the audience better .
I like speed socially .
I last took some three or four days ago , at someone else 's gig .
I was dancing around having funny conversations .
You have so much energy on good speed and the next day you 've lost about a stone - that 's what I like about it .
I was asked last week if I wanted to chip £ 10 in for a £ 60 bag of coke , but it turned out to be ketamine .
All the young people are getting into ketamine now , but it makes you quite aggressive .
I took ecstasy a couple of weeks ago with my boyfriend .
Ecstasy in the old days was always good vibey , but the pills today , like the techno , have become more erratic .
I certainly wo n't dabble with crack any more , like I used to - it takes your soul away , you look a mess and you become an unpleasant person .
I think if I did n't have the band to focus on , if I did n't see opportunities in life , I might be more inclined .
The fact is there are young people all over the country who see that even if they had a job , it 's so low paid they 'll never be able to afford a home and a family .
So they 're taking drugs to deal with it , or selling drugs as a way to have something .
The other thing about Britain is it currently has the worst drugs in the world , in terms of quality , cleanliness and the user 's ability to measure them and be able to judge their tolerance to them .
Because we 're an island , and because of terrorism and security , people here are becoming acclimatised to bad - quality drugs .
If you believe that people go through behavioural phases , moving through periods of taking drugs and growing out of them , then the real concern should be the decreasing quality of what those people - and the poor , especially - are taking .

I take clonazepam and diazepam because they help me draw and design , but I also take them to help with anxiety , nerves , twitching , bodily aches .
Any job where you have to have a very steady hand and stay calm is helped by Valium or any of the benzodiazepines .
I read that snipers take them to steady their grip and I 've met a surgeon who uses them for the same reason .
To draw well , especially to cope with a client or someone visiting to be sketched , benzodiazepines can be essential .
But generally to work alone and really concentrate , with confidence , without shaking , they help .
I 've broken the back of two portraits this week and that probably would n't have happened without the ' pams .
But it 's not quite as simple as that .
I have to get the doses and timing right .
I prefer to take clonazepam because it 's milder , takes longer to kick in and is less addictive .
But I took diazepam on Wednesday because I 'd arranged to see friends but could n't quite cope with socialising .
Also , I was afraid about bumping into someone I recently came out of a relationship with .
Some people might take them for fun , but I 'm not doing that .
I 'm not out looking for 10 for a fiver on street corners ... not really .
Maybe eggs - temazepam capsules - which are great for sleeping .
But I usually rely on the goodness of doctors .
I 'm stocked up at the moment , but in a month , six weeks - and this feeds into the anxiety - I 'm looking at an appointment with a consultant who 's going to be asking me how many I 've been putting aside for rainy days and what I 'm drinking and ... 20 questions .
She might be wanting my liver or my blood to be tested .
Because benzodiazepines store up in your body fat , I 've been doing a lot of exercise recently .
I 've not had muscles like this before .
The exercise is about cleaning the system , making what I take more effective , and also fighting some of the anxiety in a physical way .
Cycling helps .
Recently I cycled home from the studio too late , having taken two or three 10mg tablets at the studio , and I went into a skip .
That was n't good .
I was in the relationship then .
She was n't sure what she wanted .
Since it ended I 've not had the anxiety of performing for her , but I 've also been anxious about the relationship ending .
At their best , benzodiazepines basically make me feel really relaxed and really productive and then really able to wind down .
They 're good for insomnia , temazies [ temazepams ] especially , and they can knock me out , sometimes with whisky , so I 'm not too sleepless to be unable to work the next day .
I like playing poker on the internet in the evening , and low ' pams can help that , unless I take too much too early .
Last night I timed it pretty well and I was a winner .

On Tuesday night I did a shoot for an alternative magazine , a bit kinky , and coke sort of went with the job , it 's the least you expect .
But my day job is in TV production , where there 's lots of cocaine , generally , although my boss really frowns on drugs .
When you boil it down , drugs are a social thing , for weekends .
And almost always with my best friend , usually at clubs or at her flat .
That 's what drugs mean to me - friendship , laughter , dancing .
On Thursday we got into two clubs under false names .
She can get any man to buy us a bottle of champagne , and I could , too .
But , at the end of the day , drugs are what we 're really looking for .
We were on this terrace smoking and we had a little coke from this bloke .
We took the piss so much and he still drove us home and gave us what he had left .
The first time I had good cocaine before sex was the first time I really enjoyed sex .
My sister said , ' It was just luck , ' but it 's been like that since .
I 'm not advocating it for that reason .
You hear some men are useless [ on cocaine ] , terrible .
Maybe the women saying that are useless , too , or they 've been disappointed like me .
I do have sex without cocaine , but it 's never quite the same .
I 'm trying to think of drawbacks .
I get sweaty .
But I drive better , I park better , I chat better , I feel better and make love better .
I do n't believe everyone is better looking on coke , but when you 're with people who do it , they tend to be better looking anyway .
Every time I 've had a really , really good time socially in the past two years , drugs have probably been involved .
But the best times , the funniest times , the stupidest , are with my best friend .
We can put on this really cheesy fitness video from the Eighties and kill ourselves laughing .
Last weekend we got drunk and stoned and she had a bit of coke left - because sometimes we take it from men , pretend to snort it somewhere and then save it for when we 're alone .
We did n't go out in the end because it was raining and we wanted to prank call , which is mainly lying on cushions .
Even if there 's no one else , it 's still a bit like a festival , being with her and taking stuff .
We act out scenes in films - like Meet Joe Black - or impersonate Sarah Silverman sitting in a chair .
We run up and down the stairs with hats on singing ' Shitdisco ' by Shitdisco .
We 've probably never done ecstasy on a Sunday , or mushies [ mushrooms ] .
We 'd say Friday for that - because she 's younger than me , but does a straighter job .

I became aware of drugs when I was about 16 .
I would hang around Soho and a woman told me about the uppers and downers that were going around .
They did n't interest me at all .
I was fit , an athlete .
Pretty much teetotal , and I remain so .
But then when I was about 24 and working in the diamond trade in Hatton Garden someone gave me some Thai grass to smoke and I enjoyed the experience .
Ever since - 43 years - weed has been my recreational drug of choice .
In the Eighties I had cocaine , but it never did anything for me , and I dabbled with ecstasy and it 's OK , but nothing I 'd want to keep doing .
My abiding memory of LSD is just how dirty and dusty everything seemed .
No , it 's always been grass for me .
But you can't get the stuff that was around in the past that would always make you see the funny side of life .
Once , I even put some expensive
Thai sticks in a lit oven to dry out and then completely forgot to take them out .
I was sitting there with the windows closed , inhaling the wreckage .
It 's the funny and philosophical side I 'm after , and it tunes you in to music , of course .
It 's like a perpetual Hamlet advertisement , really .
Unfortunately , the only weed you can regularly get today is skunk and it 's quite heavy .
But there 's never been any question in my mind that if all marijuana was legal we would be a far healthier and happier society .
Smoking weed tunes me in to a part of myself I like being tuned in to .
There should be proper drug education in schools and kids could be allowed to dabble , maybe .
Ultimately , I look to a future where weed is n't classed as a drug .
The only thing that 'll stop me smoking it is death .

It was mental my parents suggesting I should have some one - to - one drugs counselling , because all they knew about was a few pills missing and my spliff - and my dad 's been spliffing since before I was born .
My mother drinks white wine and a night for her costs as much as I 've spent for a week .
It makes me sarcastic with them .
I 'll say things like , ' I 'll see you in the queue . '
Mum and Dad are saying no to me going to two festivals now .
The other thing that did n't help was a party I was at was raided .
They had sniffer dogs and everyone was lined up and they made some girls cry and found an ounce thrown about the place .
One thing my father said is , ' Do n't get a record , or when you get a car they 'll pull you over every Friday until you 're a dying man . '
It 's good advice .
I do n't think my parents have ever cared if I 've had three Stellas .
If I was out of it they'd be happy to think it was lager .
My mother thinks I 'll be seen smoking by the neighbours .
I saw a burglar when I was having a smoke at the window once .
I saved next door a fortune , probably .
It 's much easier in summer , moving about , because using the gazebo - the gazeblow , we call it - at the park on this side of town is a bit of a joke .
The council and the community police walk in a circle at 15 - minute intervals , so we 're in , out .
No one really bothers us at the skate park in the evening .
The adrenaline of skateboarding takes the edge off spliff .
But summer 's way better because there 's loads of places to go .
It 's never been a problem getting skunk in town .
Or hash .
It 's not a problem when I can't get it .
The time I was always wanting it was back at the beginning , really .
I was being bullied .
It sort of helped me .
I 'd changed schools and there were two major serious psychos there .
When I started taking some of the pills my parents had - I do n't even know what they were - they were OK , like anti-depressing .
A bit trippy with drink .
I do n't do that now .
The thing is , I 'm paying more for skunk from friends than I would from some dealers , because dealers will start offering you anything else they want to unload .
You 're saying , ' No , no , no .
I only want some hash really . '
What I 'd seriously like is to be online on MySpace , be on PlayStation 2 , and have a smoke halfway through homework , with a dressing gown across the bottom of the door and really knowing no one 's going to be in the house for two hours .
That and being on the ramps where there 's someone with smokes and jokes .
And girls .
My picture of paradise is a girl on the ramps - no lamer , she 's always busting it out - who sort of gets she 's sexy but does n't .
She has Air Insurgents [ trainers ] and has the moves and has her own little stash of hash .
Everyone I hang around with wants the girl like that .

Obviously I have to take my little packets to work prepared , so I do n't have drama in the toilet getting a razor blade out and measuring each time for a snort .
I 'll have had one at home , so there 's two packets for work .
One 's ready for lunch and another later .
It 's usually two , or three .
I need three if it 's cut [ adulterated ] ; ideally four - in case I 'm working late , or I 'm not coming home after work .
I 'll usually know in advance if it 's heavily cut .
If it 's no good then I 'll want to smoke it .
I prefer smoking sometimes , but I can't be setting an alarm off .
So I need to know the day 's schedule .
If a case comes forward or I 'm at the office and there 's bullshit about someone 's dental appointment , or a personal injury case suddenly reappears that someone 's messed up , that 's when I might get a bit angry .
On Tuesday I thought I 'd have to smoke on the office balcony because I could n't wait .
But it 's really no big deal going to work with a habit , unless others are making it difficult .
It 's others causing the problems .
I 'd never have concerns at work if it was good stuff .
Sometimes if it 's really weak , or my husband 's found mine and taken a bit from each packet while I 'm asleep , that 's when I think about the needle , but I can't be carrying a kit .
I can cook up in the toilet some time , if I must , but I 'm not doing the needle now - ever , really .
Just sometimes in the evenings , when I have to , because of all the hassle .
This week I 've had good stuff .
Not really good , but not really dodgy .
When it 's really good , the forehead pours , you know straightaway .
Once , the paper towels and toilet paper ran out , because the cleaner was n't there the night before , and I brushed my hand against the photocopier and it was dripping , and a clown said , ' It must be very hot in the Ladies . '
I did n't reply .
I take care of everything that 's put in front of me .
I 'd probably have given up working in law if it was n't for smack .
When work 's boring it numbs the boredom .
Everything 's better on smack , everything .
But I could n't do more than a gram a day on what I earn , and I 'm eating at Subway .
Whereas my bosses could afford two grams without noticing .
They do n't , I 'm just saying .
There 's no one else on skag there , although there 's loads in law .
There was a problem recently when my husband kept phoning the office .
Two dealers disappeared last month and my husband thought I was hiding stuff at work .
He has n't phoned since .
If he loses me a job he knows I 'll kill him .
I work perfectly on smack .
I 'm not drinking at lunch , like others in my office .
When you 've got heroin you do n't need alcohol .
The only difference is you can't get it 24 hours in Tesco .
I know one lawyer who 's been on smack for 18 years .
One clerk I knew died last year , but that 's because the stuff that came through was great after he'd been having stuff for weeks that was 15 per cent , you understand ?
He was a good worker , good with papers like me .
After work yesterday I went somewhere to get some , because I was thinking ahead to the weekend .
But I did n't get any .
I was just sat waiting in a room with these guys , watching The One Show .
We were just watching television for hours .
One of them was a guy I knew from university who started getting angry because he said one of us ate his KitKat .
The dealer said he'd sort us by seven , then two hours ...
We were just waiting and waiting .
I had a report with me and I read some of that .

Grave digging is one of those jobs where it 's easy to smoke on the job , and common .
It 's a bit ironic because , when I got into drugs , a late - starter [ at 21 ] , I spent my first night coming down from sulphate in a graveyard .
I found blue bombers [ sulphate ] exhilarating and sociable .
I 'm introverted , but the sulphate made me extroverted , confident .
I was snorting it at art college , for art 's sake and for the enjoyment of music and company and friends , and the high philosophy of it and the liberation .
Sometimes I was up for nights on end and had psychotic comedowns .
Two weeks solid was the most I ever did .
I 'll take a bit now , but only at parties which I really do n't want to leave .
Acid 's a touchy subject .
My first time was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life .
Everything was so clear , so bright and so real .
Although I 've had LSD since - seven in a week at music festivals - and it's never been quite the same for me , I decided that first experience was how the world is , for real , and I 've always kept the memory with me .
I tell myself , ' When the world 's not looking and feeling like that , it 's me not seeing it . '
I was cost - conscious about ecstasy in its early days - you could get eight tabs of acid for the price of an E where I was , but I ended up on the rave scene in the late Eighties and taking E regularly , dancing all night .
The reason I do n't take it much now is because at my age it would be crippling to dance around in cycling shorts and a hat with dog 's ears going absolutely berserk too much .
I think it was all the drinking that caused me to get a really chronic nosebleed two months ago .
I was taken off in an ambulance .
A week in hospital .
They told me to cut out everything - the drinking , the blow , the puff , everything .
And I 've gloried in it all my life .
After a month , I thought because it makes me sleep so well - I like 10 hours - that I 'll have spliffs , but with toy tobacco .
And I thought that I 'll drink but I wo n't cane it , then a couple of lines of cocaine , up the best nostril .
The funny thing is that they 've been talking at work about drug testing everyone .
The last time they said that , it never happened .
But it 's looming , looming .
So before the weekend I was feeling healthier , from not caning it , yet thinking the world was turning against me .
But on Saturday I went up a friend 's house and we were going to have a little drink in the garden and someone else came round and he had some MDMA and I ended up going next door and sleeping with my friend 's neighbour .
I have n't even taken a girl out in nine years and so it was quite an outrageous thing for me to do , a total transformation of confidence .

The Virgin Atlantic ad on TV - it 's very spacey and John Hannah 's in it - is like a commercial for the hallucinogenic side of ketamine , to me .
There 's drug imagery everywhere .
You flick through the channels on TV and see lots of people who are obviously on drugs - middle - aged presenters , politicians , the lot - who sniff when the camera 's not on them .
I 've been told as a fact that drugs are allowed and encouraged on one of the reality shows .
It 's edited out .
I 'm a gay man .
And I have friends who think anti-drug is anti-gay , full stop .
I feel it 's certainly no business of anybody else who someone sleeps with or what they put in to their body .
Obviously I like to think they 're going to be sensible - hah - about it , avoid people spiking their drinks and going bareback [ not using a condom ] , and looking after themselves and not necking anything and everything .
I want to remember what I 've done .
And obviously if a business depends on you functioning day in , day out - and you need to earn to be able to party , anyway - you 're going to want to stay healthy .
Of course , sex keeps you fit and sex drugs contribute .
But I 've got a form of cystitis and I 've had sex once in the last week .
If you were hoping for a story of cocktailing drugs night after night and six - hour sex sessions , I can't oblige right now .
One thing I 've usually done is give myself Monday off work .
If I 'm out on Friday , working Saturday , and then out again , this is the age when it starts to become a bit torturous .
I have n't had meth [ crystal meth ] for weeks , and when I do it 's only at weekends .
I would n't do Special K [ ketamine ] from Monday to Friday either and I 'm usually only having Dorothys [ small amounts ] .
I find some people in a k - hole insufferable .
I love the way sounds and lights become indistinguishable , blended , warped .
But I do n't go right to the edge with it .
I had cocaine , Viagra and poppers at the weekend .
I had GHB , I think , the weekend before .
I still like Adam [ ecstasy ] sometimes , although it 's getting less popular here .
I 'm more detached during the week .
I 'm not saying I wo n't go to special events and any opening if they 're during the week , but I 'm usually not seeing people and being offered drugs during the week .
My boyfriend is connected with a university , is away there , and anything he brings is at the weekend .
I 've been gardening and decorating for several weeks and every time I 've taken something I 've had the house in the back of my mind .
I was given some amphetamines that I thought I could use , but I have n't .
No hash .
There 's a satisfaction in grafting from 10 am to 6 and then eight in the evening to 11 or 12 , and the exhaustion .
So Saturday night - if we 've not clubbed on Friday - is the time I need something to take me out of that , to have the energy , the sex and the obliteration .
On Sunday and Monday I 'm really only interested in cookery - I 'm fabulous .

But my girlfriend - she does girl scams , like ' You can look at my arms , I 'm clean .
I need £ 20 for a room tonight . '
I try that , but she 's got the looks .
Not looks for lapping - lap dancing - but men help her .
The best time was when we got some money - she stole someone 's coat - and we got tickets for a train to the coast and we were superstars , that 's how we were feeling .
I 've smoked in all places this week .
In the phone box , when I was rattling [ desperate ] .
We have 20 places a mile from here .
You can do McDonald 's ' toilets .
And there 's apartments .
There 's a roof near here and I get buzzed in .
We both keep a glass flower tube there , hidden - she sawed it in half , one for her , one for me .
Valentine 's Day !
On Wednesday I visited my mother and she gave me £ 30 .
I said I 'd go clean , but I went to a den near there .
Now she 's not answering again .
She does n't get it .
It 's the best feel ever , a rock [ of crack ] .
I 'm hot , I 'm clever , I 'm gliding .
People can buy a car , go in that restaurant any time they want , but we can't buy crack without hassle .
If you won the Lottery you could get crack five , six times every day and no one would be sorry .
No one 's bag would get lifted .
I would n't have my cousin saying I shat up the wedding .
I 'd be kinder , no depression , if I had crack and the housing association had n't screwed my girlfriend over .
I feel shit .
I want £ 40 .
Mark , party organiser , London
Drugs : 'everything short of injecting '
Spends : £ 50 a week on opium , £ 30 a week on cannabis
As a party organiser , I recognise that people like to go out at night and have a good time and that they often take drugs to help them have a good time - and there 's nothing more or less to it than that .
And obviously I want to enjoy myself , but I can't get out of control while I 'm organising a party for a perfume company or a caviar restaurant .
When I'm DJing it works better , I play better when I 've had ecstasy or I 'm drunk and stoned , but I do n't go so far that I can't physically operate the controls .
It 's when I have little parties to celebrate the success of big parties that I tend to let loose , perhaps taking three or four people away to Paris ( women , preferably ) and having a splendid old time .
I 've recently become attracted to opium .
I find it wonderful , fantastic , lovely , yet one feels instantly that it 's incredibly addictive for some people - the sirens ring , it 's so seductive .
If it was possible to get in London I 'd smoke more .
Last week I got a text saying some would be available at the weekend , but sadly it was n't .
I really do n't want to give the impression that drugs are a huge part of my life , as I 've never been on anything for more than a few days in a row .
But since I was 18 , I 've tried pretty much everything , short of injecting .
The only thing I 've had so far today is weed .
Not skunk , which my friend [ dealer ] does n't sell , and I think is debilitating .
I 'm talking about good old - fashioned weed .
I particularly like a joint - a small one - first thing in the morning with a strong coffee .
A shower , when you 're a little stoned , can be the most wonderful thing in the world .
And then , walking outside , everything is more lovely and beautiful and it can almost brand a smile on to my face for the rest of the day .
Smoking good weed and drinking double espressos , that 's a really lovely thing for me ; they work together wonderfully , whether I 'm sitting watching pretty girls outside a cafe or working on projects into the night , when they give me the energy to work but without the jitters that would then stop me sleeping .
They cancel out the bad points of each other and accentuate the good points , calming me down enough so I can concentrate on work and yet setting off the mind so it 's free , fancy , flighty .
But the thing I 'm really looking forward to is mushroom picking .
Mushrooms are my favourite drug because they bring the rush , the open and clear mind , the laughter and the energy .
And they 're chemical - free .
Whereas acid takes the world out and puts it in a tumble dryer , mushrooms are more like a natural progression - taking the world and stretching it .

A STRONG Australian dollar has pushed Sydney and Melbourne up on the list of the world 's most expensive cities for expatriate workers , according to a global cost of living survey .
The research , which measured the cost of living in 143 cities , revealed prices are rising in Australia 's major cities - particularly in Melbourne , which catapulted 28 places to become the 36th most expensive city .
Sydney remains the nation 's most costly city , jumping six places to be ranked as the world 's 15th most expensive city .
The Mercer Consulting Group survey , taken in March , is based on the needs of expatriates and measures the comparative cost of more than 200 items including transport , food and housing .
The rankings are relative to New York , which is the reference point and has an index rating of 100 .
" Without a doubt , Australian cities are becoming more expensive , " said Mercer executive Rob Knox .

That 's the takeaway , so far as I can tell , from this Josh Marshall post , which starts with the dubious claim that this McCain ad - which Ramesh and John Weaver rightly call childish - is actually playing on white America 's subliminal fears that Barack Obama wants to sleep with promiscuous white starlets , and proceeds to the claim that any pundit ( like Milbank , say ) who uses the word " presumptuous " to describe Barack Obama is just playing along with the McCain campaign 's vile attempt to caricature Obama as an " uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women . "
Look , I understand that liberals are frustrated at Barack Obama 's inability to pull away in the polls , despite all the favorable tailwinds he 's enjoying and the fact that John McCain is running a staggeringly inept campaign .
I 'd be frustrated too !

Nutritionists say too much fibre and too little fat on nursery menus can lead to stunted growth
For years nutritionists have recommended a diet high in fibre and low in fat , with plenty of fruit and vegetables .
Now , however , nurseries are being told the food they serve in accordance with these guidelines is unsuitable for toddlers and could lead to vitamin deficiencies and even stunted growth .
' Nurseries are applying the principles of adult healthy eating to the food they are supplying to young children , ' said Sarah Almond , a consultant specialist paediatric dietician who has analysed the results of a trading standards study into nursery food .
' We expected the study to show nurseries were serving children food that was too high in calories , fat , saturated fat and salt , and low in vegetables and fruit .
Instead , we found that the majority of nurseries had gone to the other extreme and appeared to be providing food that was too low in calories , fat and saturated fat and too high in fruit and vegetables . '
This situation was putting children at the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies , she said .
The research also found that four out of five nurseries were giving children portions that were too small and only three in 10 provided them with meals containing enough calories .
According to Almond , the under - five age group has different and specific nutritional requirements to those children of school age : pre-school children have a high energy and nutrient requirement .
Because they have a small stomach and a relatively under - developed gut , they cannot consume large quantities of food at a time but need frequent small meals and snacks throughout the day .
In addition , too much fibre - such as that absorbed through over - consumption of fruit and vegetables - can result in insufficient intake of other food groups and inhibit the absorption of key minerals .
' Because a significant number of children attend nurseries from 7 am until 7 pm , the food and nutrition they receive there are key to their health , ' said Almond .
' Nurseries are applying requirements of healthy eating for school - age children and adults to the one - to - four age group , who have entirely different requirements . '
In contrast to school meals , there are no government regulations for the provision of toddlers ' meals .
Guidelines from Ofsted and the government on healthy food for young children offer nurseries only general advice , with a suggestion that childcare agencies refer to the Food Standards Agency 's advice on food and nutrition for young children .
Experts say the lack of national legislation means the trading standards study , which analysed samples from one week 's worth of breakfast , snacks , lunch and supper from every nursery in East Sussex , is likely to be an accurate reflection of the national picture .
' The majority of nurseries are confused or misinformed about what entails healthy eating for the under - five age group , ' said Neil Leitch , campaign director of the Feeding Young Imaginations at the Pre-School Learning Alliance .
' They are over - focusing on the message about eating five portions of fruit and vegetable a day and forgetting that it is completely inappropriate to simply purée a meal that would be healthy for a four - year - old and feed it to a two - year - old .
' The nutritional content of toddlers ' meals is a proper science and nurseries are simply not aware of vital calories , fats , carbohydrate , sugars , fibre , protein , vitamins and minerals . '
Purnima Tanuku , chief executive of the National Day Nurseries ' Association , agreed : ' Nationally , nurseries face conflicting advice about food .
Consistent advice from Ofsted and other bodies about nutritional requirements for this age group are badly needed . '
PEORIA , Ill . --
A week before Bradley University soccer players were to report for the Fall 2007 season , midfielder Danny Dahlquist 's family attended Mass at St. Mark 's Catholic Church near the school .
The church was the foundation of their family , and as Danny 's mother , Tricia , left that Sunday morning , a woman approached her .
" She walked up to me and started shaking my hand , saying what a beautiful family we had , " Tricia said .
" I thought , ' Well , thank you . '
As she was leaving , I realized she had slipped money in my hand .
Apparently she had won it somewhere and felt the need to share , spread the wealth so to speak , and she said , ' Bring your family out to dinner . ' "
The Dahlquists went home and called Danny , who was living in a house with teammates near campus .
He joined his parents and six brothers and sisters at Corky 's Ribs & BBQ .
Danny quickly ate and , because he was born about a three hours ' drive from Wrigley , wanted to watch the Cubs game .
He picked up his baby sister , Ellen , and walked back and forth to the area in the restaurant where the game was on TV .
Tricia still has that image burned in her mind .
" That 's my last vision of him , " she said , " standing there with his sister in his hand . "
It was the last time the family was together .
COLLEGE PRANK GONE WRONG
It was Saturday , Aug. 11 , 2007 , and the Bradley soccer friends and teammates living at 2008 West Laura Ave. had decided to throw a party .
Danny had moved in for his sophomore year , opting to live off campus instead of in the dorms where he'd lived as a freshman on the team .
Living the life of a Bradley soccer player was a dream for Dahlquist .
As he grew up across the street from Bradley , a private school with about 6,000 students , he'd become a devout Braves soccer fan .
When he was 10 , he met Bradley soccer coach Jim DeRose at a soccer camp .
It would be an achievement for a local kid to make Bradley 's team .
Danny told his parents he'd rather practice for four years at Bradley , a Division I school , than go somewhere else and play for a Division III school .
He loved the university where his parents work -- Tricia as an English instructor and Craig as the senior associate athletic director .
Danny 's parents , Craig and Tricia , work at Bradley and settled the family in a home near the campus .
Courtesy Dahlquist family
But on this night , the teammates and roommates were going to party .
They got some alcohol -- later found to be obtained by one of the players , Nick Mentgen , -- and invited some friends .
Later that night , the housemates wanted to play a prank on a few of their roommates .
According to various reports , Dahlquist and the others had done this before : lighting fireworks , including bottle rockets , Black Cats Fireworks and Roman candles , under one another 's bedroom doors .
So when Dahlquist and another housemate went to their rooms to go to bed , they were prepared .
" Danny , anticipating that I think from the previous night or two , shoved some towels underneath the door to keep that from happening or to keep the door from being opened or to keep the Roman candles out , " said Kevin Lyons , Peoria County 's state 's attorney .
Based on police interviews , court documents and a report from Lyons , this is what happened :
Dahlquist 's roommates -- Bradley soccer players Mentgen , David Crady and Ryan Johnson and a fourth friend , Daniel Cox -- lit Roman candles and shoved them under Dahlquist 's bedroom door on the second floor of the house .
Each was involved in the incident through obtaining the fireworks , lighting them or placing them under the door .
After one did n't go off , likely because the opening under the door was blocked , one of the men used a coat hanger to remove the blockage and at least one more Roman candle was shot under the door .
" The flames were about 1,500 to 1,800 degrees in temperature Fahrenheit , " Lyons said .
" The flames went across the room .
There was a futon across the room and these balls shooting across the floor would hit the wall [ and ] burst into a bigger flame .
The second time when they ran down the stairs and outside , there was no Danny Dahlquist , no nothing . "
Dahlquist 's bedroom was on fire .
After his teammates saw a glow in the second - story window , they went back into the house but could n't rescue their friend because of the smoke and heat .
They woke another roommate , sophomore midfielder Travis English , who was asleep in his own room , and got out of the house .
At 4:34 a.m. , Gina Goett , a friend invited to the party by Mentgen and Johnson , dialed 911 .
It was a chaotic scene , with sirens , police , smoke and fire .
Johnson fled .
Mentgen was helped up to a secondary roof as he was trying to help get his friend out .
In a police interview , an emotional Mentgen described the scene : " I hear Danny , so I know that he is conscious , but he can't see me and I can't see him I just hear him saying he is not making words out I can hear him not yell , but ahhh - ahhh nothing like ' Hey , help ! '
Nothing like that .
I do n't think he even knew what was going on . "
Firefighters found Dahlquist on the floor near a window in his room .
He was rushed to the hospital but pronounced dead at 5:09 a.m. on Sunday , Aug. 12 , from " asphyxiation due to smoke inhalation . "
PEORIA -BORN AND BRED
Growing up in this blue - collar city of about 100,000 in north - central Illinois , Dahlquist attended Notre Dame High School a few miles from his home .
His name is engraved at the school on a plaque celebrating the 2004 Class A state soccer championship .
Dahlquist 's former teammate and roommate , Nick Mentgen , right , tried to save Danny from the burning house .

The 5 - foot - 9 , 145 - pound Dahlquist was n't a superior athlete , but he wanted to play at Bradley so badly that a close friend likened him to the famed Rudy Ruettiger , who inspired the 1993 film " Rudy , " about a former Notre Dame football player .
" It was everything to him , " his father , Craig , said .
" This community gave him an opportunity to not just be friends with those at Notre Dame , and not just be friends with those in the neighborhood , but becoming friends with everybody around this 10 - to 15 - mile radius .
They all came together to play soccer . "
Dahlquist enrolled at Bradley in the fall of 2006 , made the soccer team as a freshman midfielder and was redshirted .
The Braves went 8 - 8 - 4 that season , narrowly missing the NCAA tournament in a loss at home to Creighton in the Missouri Valley Conference championship .
The next season , Dahlquist was determined to be an integral part of the team .
Teammates and Coach DeRose noticed Dahlquist practicing harder and improving .
He 'd moved into an off - campus house with Mentgen , Johnson , Crady and English .
Dahlquist was growing up , becoming more independent .
LOSING A SON AND A TEAMMATE
The Dahlquists were just waking up when the call came around 6:45 a.m .
Craig and Tricia Dahlquist had worked up a good speech for their son about underage drinking , but emergency - room personnel immediately took them to a room where one of the nuns at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center told them what happened .
They asked if they could see him .
She said no .
Danny had died .
When Gary Gygax died in March , several eulogists observed that this co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons had made a big imprint on our computer culture .
It 's hard to believe that the online game World of Warcraft , for example , would boast more than 10 million subscribers today had Gygax and Dave Arneson not come along first , calculating the armor class of bugbears and determining the number of experience points paladins need to move up a level .
The underlying assumption was that Dungeons & Dragons had slipped into nerdy nostalgia ....
Story of Veterans in DC , delivering 23,000 petitions , in support Dennis Kucinich ’s 35 Articles of Impeachment , June 11 , 2008
VFP D.C. Organizing dynamo , Tony Teolis , shown here , presenting Conyers with thousands of IMPEACH signatures
While most of the 20 some Veterans were conciliatory and pleased to hand our 23,000
pro-IMPEACH petition signatures to Chairman Conyers , both Iraq Veterans Against the War Board of Directors Co-Chair , Adam Kokesh , and Delaware Valley Veterans Executive Director , Bill Perry , made it clear to Judiciary Chair Conyers that we felt betrayed by Conyers failure to advocate for Impeachment , as he had done earlier , ever since the Downing Street Memos , in April , 2005 .
In this photo , Impeachment Champion Mike Ferner , another of us Vets who have been working on Impeachment ever since Spring , 2005 , presents Conyers with even more of our 23,000 petitions demanding that Congress respect our Oath to Protect & Defend our Constitution v. Domestic Enemy , George Bush .
Immediately AFTER
The House sent articles of impeachment against President Bush to the Judiciary Committee Wednesday on a mostly party - line vote : 251-166 .
Speaking to us Veteran Activists , after today ’s historic vote , Kucinich said that if the Judiciary Committee does not act within 30 days , he intends to introduce another , longer version of the articles of impeachment , with 60 counts instead of 35 .
“ I am not going to let this go .
I am not going to let it go .
I ’ll just keep coming back and they can pile these things up in committee but I ’ll keep coming back , ”  Kucinich said .
“ I ’ll bring it up again , and there will be more .
There will be more . ” 
We request our fellow Veterans , and all our associates to please call , fax , write , and e-mail YOUR Rep , to support ( H Res 1258 ) because of the Administrations ’ “ abuses of power ”  during the run-up to the Iraq War , and ever since , as our illegal invasion & occupation continues .
Thank you .
Be Well , RAISE HELL !

For many years PostgreSQL has included a hardened version of Perl ( Pl / Perl ) .
I have no idea how it works , but it may be worth looking at as a starting point for securing the interpreter .
From : loic
2008-07 -23 05:34 am ( UTC )
While I actively dislike perl this seems like a really fun project .
Does your hardened perl interpreter need to provide a way for the hosting environment to limit the time a script can execute for , or provide a way to kill running scripts ?
Or can that just be done with unix process control syscalls ( kill , wait , etc ) .

Safe.pm
The Safe.pm module is rarely mentioned at all , but it should do most of what you need already .
But probably a more drastic ( aka , delete offending parts ) approach is preferred here .
From : brad
2008-07-23 07:28 am ( UTC )
Re : Safe.pm Safe.pm is n't actually all that safe , from what I hear .
Historically at least it has n't .
The more drastic approach ( removing the implementation of all the bad opcodes from libperl itself ) is what we 'll do for a real implementation .
The Sys :: Protect module that Artur and I released tonight could be done with Safe.pm , but we have more ambitions with it than Safe . pm does , but in the end Sys : : Protect is just for testing on developers ' local machines anyway , so Safe. pm could 've worked there , were it not for other sandbox restrictions we need to do in the XS code .

That 's very cool .
Another approach might be to offer a hardened JVM or CLR runtime .
That way , you can just drop compiled code from whatever language onto the appengine and make it go .
All the hardening of the libraries and VM would only have to be done once .

CPAN ?
" Only vetted , security - audited XS modules will be allowed . "
Does this mean all XS modules need to be vetted - or all modules must be both XS and vetted ?
I 'm worried if it 's the second ; what would be the point of perl without CPAN ?

Taking it seriously generally involves paying attention to things a little more significant than white space .

Truth be told , once you spend some time in the language , and get your vim settings right , it 's not that big a deal .

Google Apps was part of the answer and I even considered to start torturing myself into Python on a daily basis so I do n't get that tired of it , but it did n't work for about 5 - 6 times so Perl support might do that for me ;)
I wonder how much of LWP you 're planning to bring over - will it be possible to have granular HTTP support of modules like Just recently I was thinking that the reason for many of my app ideas not developed is that I only feel in the right mood in my favorite Perl and that I do n't want to care for infrastructure anymore - too tired of it at work .

( I wrote it to make single connection to LiveJournal servers when fetching FOAF files so there is only one connection to Perlbal ) .

I agree wholeheartedly When ever I get a yen to do something cool , I always seem to do it in Perl .
I just can't get in the right mood using python .
I have tried quite a few times to get into it , but I just can't .
I for one am willing to help as much as I can manage to find time .

LWP 's so common that I imagine I 'll provide a fake module which quacks like a duck , so must be LWP .

Although this writeup has a lot of negative commentary , the hardened Perl interpreter does sound similar to what 's going on at the BBC / Siemens .
With Google 's clout , sounds like an interesting place to reach out for expertise .
Model triumph for Kelly who refuses to wear a prosthetic arm
It is the eyes that stand out first , that intense gaze into the camera that all good models have .
Not until the second glance do you notice Kelly Knox is a little different from the rest .
Miss Knox , who was born without a left forearm , has won a BBC3 competition to find the UK 's best disabled model .
Winner : Kelly Knox was born with no left forearm
Her prize is a contract with a top agency , Take 2 Model Management , and a fashion shoot for Marie Claire magazine , which produced the picture seen here .
Miss Knox , 23 , who vowed at seven never to wear a prosthetic arm , claimed she never classified herself as disabled , until she decided to enter Britain 's Missing Top Model .
Young mum : Jackie shows off her daughter Kelly at just 10 days old
And she does n't intend her differences to influence her career in the fashion industry .
She said : ' In my household we do n't use the word disabled .
Never have done , never will do .
' I do n't feel disabled but society will label me as being disabled . '
Miss Knox lives with her mother Jackie , 61 , in Enfield , North London .
She beat hundreds of applicants to appear on the BBC show .
Proud of herself : Kelly aged four ( left ) and all dressed in blue at nine
The disabilities among the eight finalists ranged from profound deafness to brain injury .
The girls were put through six weeks of modelling tests before the winner was chosen last night by a panel of judges .
Through her triumph , Miss Knox knows she could pave the way for others in her situation .
Rope trick : Kelly Knox was full of adventure , even at the age of seven
Her condition is not genetic , according to doctors , but is just something that happens ' by mistake ' .
' It 's more likely to be on the left - hand side and it 's more common in girls than boys , ' she said .
All smiles : Kelly at 10 , loved to be the star attraction
' I 've had so many messages from people who have been born like this and parents of children who say I am such an inspiration .
' That makes me think , " That 's why I did the competition . " '
She credited her two brothers Colin , 34 , and Karl , 37 , for enabling her to stand up for herself .
Cover girl : Kelly is featured in this month 's Marie Claire magazine
' At school I was never bullied - which I think makes me very lucky as I know a lot of people would have been bullied .
' Some people born this way have a tough time . '
Miss Knox added : ' I know it sounds really strange but the only time I get the hump is when I get a piece of tough meat on my plate and I can't get into it .
Her current job , as a credit controller for a soft furnishings company , is worlds away from modelling .
She said : ' If I could give up credit control for modelling of course I would .
' Having a taste of that life has made me realise just how much I would love to do it . '
Marie O'Riordan , editor of Marie Claire , said : ' To get disability discussed on the sofas throughout the land is no mean feat and using a popular format of a reality show was a clever way of seducing viewers into a more complex world .
' We hope this does pave the way for girls with disabilities to get into modelling in the future . '

“ June 23 , 2005 was a very dark day in our nation ’s history , ” Don Corace writes at the beginning of his new jeremiad defending property rights against rapacious government buttinskis .
That was the day the Supreme Court handed down its shocking 5 - 4 decision in Kelo v. City of New London , affirming local governments ’ rights to seize your home and flip it to another private owner if the new guy promises to bring in more tax revenue .
The public rightly shuddered with revulsion at the specter of their bedrock rights being subject to the whims of “ redevelopment ” - addicted local pols .
Alarmed statehouses prepared scores of eminent domain - limiting bills , while city halls from coast to coast dug in their heels .
The tension between those three – and the scattershot , logic - defying umpiring offered by the judiciary – forms the basic narrative conflict in Corace ’s “ Government Pirates . ”
The Kelo case , involving a nice old lady who just wanted to protect her dream cottage against pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its municipal enablers , startled many Americans who did n’t think this kind of stuff could happen here .
But Corace ably points out what many New Yorkers and other urbanites – particularly the poor – have long known : Eminent domain is like the Ring of Power in redevelopment schemes .
Local officials insist they ’re reluctant to use such terrible power , but sometimes you just gotta break an egg or three to make an omelet .
The book , which is designed and organized to maximize readings on the outrage - o- meter , comes chock - a- block with bullet - pointed anecdotes of redevelopers gone wild .
There is the infamous case of Riviera Beach , a largely poor and African - American Florida town whose mayor worked for years to displace as many as 6,000 residents and 300 business owners to make way for a vague resort development .
Closer to home , there ’s the New York Times – who cheered on Kelo , natch – using eminent domain and corporate welfare to build its schmancy new digs in Midtown .
For Corace , eminent domain is just the gateway into a world where local governments respect no man ’s castle .
“ Kelo has sparked a healthy dialogue , but eminent domain abuse is only the ‘ tip of the iceberg , ’ ” he writes .
“ Through local zoning and the regulation of wetlands and endangered species , governments take property without compensating owners and also extort land and money in return for approvals . ”
Property owners nationwide wake up each day to learn that their local city councils have changed the rules about lot sizes , building heights , parking requirements , and so on , often serving to make the land functionally unusable .
“ Temporary ” moratoria are implemented , typically without compensation for the handcuffed owners .
If Corace hits a discordant note , it ’s in his anger at the “ almighty power ” of “ unelected ” judges , “ dressed in black robes and sitting in a marbled temple . ”
He ’s steamed that the judiciary has assumed the responsibility of judging laws against the Constitution , but if Kelo had turned out the way he wanted , that ’s precisely what the Supreme Court would have done .
Corace ’s on firmer ground detailing the collective incoherence of various court rulings , and the limitless reservoir of bad faith and money that local governments will tap into when they have a better idea for your property than you do .

The Assault on Private Property Rights – and How We Can Fight It

Different approaches to wireless Internet access in San Francisco and neighboring Silicon Valley are producing very different results , with one project springing up around the city and the other inching through regulatory procedures .
The high - tech meccas are still pursuing municipal wireless after the first bubble in that industry burst last year .
The free - for - cities business model that was to have covered all major U.S. cities in Wi-Fi failed because of high costs and low subscription rates , with some thorny political battles thrown in .
San Francisco was one of the most high - profile casualties .
But with a new , grassroots approach , San Francisco seems to be leaping ahead of Silicon Valley , a breeding ground for much of the technology behind the concept .
A company called Meraki is recruiting San Francisco residents to host its network infrastructure , while competitive ISP ( Internet service provider ) Covad Communications Group tries to get multiple approvals for a one - square - mile test network in Silicon Valley .
On the bright side , Covad now plans to start deploying some radios on that test network beginning next week , according to Cisco Systems , which is supplying the equipment .
Covad was not available for comment .
Both communities have been left at the altar before .
San Francisco 's network was to have been built and operated by EarthLink before that company pulled out of the Wi-Fi business in the middle of a fierce fight between the city 's mayor and board of supervisors .
Silicon Valley 's first network partner , Azulstar , failed to raise approximately US $ 500,000 for two test networks despite promising a vast regional network that would serve the very cities that many high - tech venture capitalists call home .
In the wake of the muni meltdown , the two areas have moved in different directions , each with its own advantages and downsides .
That 's the way municipal wireless as a whole is moving , as cities and regions seek the right local approach rather than a cookie - cutter solution , analysts said .
Meraki is building its San Francisco network by offering residents free Wi-Fi repeaters and broadband Internet connections in exchange for router mounting locations , such as balconies and rooftops .
The plan is to provide coverage in neighborhood homes and public areas without a complicated lease agreement or an expensive network buildout .
Nearly 10,000 residents have accepted the deal so far , according to Meraki CEO Sanjit Biswas .
This map shows the location of each repeater and the number of people using it .
The company expects to reach most of the city 's population for between $ 1 million and $ 3 million , he said .
Meraki attributes some of its savings to the self - regulating nature of its network , which Biswas said cuts out the need for expensive planning and maintenance .
And because it does n't use city or utility assets such as streetlamps , Meraki does n't need any bureaucratic approvals , he added .
Meraki has gotten some help from San Francisco city government on rolling out Wi-Fi in affordable housing , but only in the form of introductions to housing officials , Biswas said .
The city is highlighting Meraki 's project as a way to help close the digital divide , one of the stated purposes of the EarthLink network .
Meraki wants to have a presence in every San Francisco neighborhood by the end of this year and cover those neighborhoods by the middle of 2009 , Biswas said .
So far , about 100,000 people have used the network , he said .
The San Francisco project is one of a kind , a giant test for Meraki , he added .
Ordinarily , Meraki sells its gear to groups that are trying to get cities online , especially in the developing world , Biswas said .
Silicon Valley started with a plan even bolder than San Francisco 's : to cover a region stretching virtually all the way from San Francisco 's southern border down to the beach town of Santa Cruz , and from the Pacific to Milpitas across San Francisco Bay .
It envisioned multiple wireless networks , including Wi-Fi , WiMax and a special network for public safety .
Big - name backers IBM and Cisco Systems , as well as nonprofit SeaKay , are still part of the consortium backing the network , which was spearheaded by the group Joint Venture : Silicon Valley Network .
But after Azulstar left and Covad joined the consortium , the project was scaled back to focus on a Wi -Fi mesh to serve small businesses , at least in the beginning .
That service would complement the more expensive high - speed wireless Covad already sells to large enterprises .
" We want to make sure we walk before we run , " Covad Vice President of Wireless Strategy Alan Howe said in February .
So far , the project seems to be still in the walking phase .
On June 23 , nearly four months after Covad announced it was joining the effort and would build a one - square - mile test network in San Carlos , California , the company won approval from the city council to mount radios on city assets such as light poles .
It is still seeking permissions from the California Department of Transportation and from local school officials , because there is a state highway and a school within the test area , said Seth Fearey , vice president and chief operating officer of Joint Venture : Silicon Valley Network .
" I think there were lessons learned as this went along , " Fearey said , adding that the point of the test network is to learn about all aspects of doing a job Covad has never done before .
Realizing the original vision of the network , spanning about 1,500 square miles and 40 municipalities , would require many more such approvals .
But despite its lumbering gait , a project like Silicon Valley 's has benefits that some faster - growing systems do n't .
Volunteer networks , such as Meraki's San Francisco project and the consumer - hosted sharing system offered by Spain 's Fon , can only go so far in meeting the needs of a city and its residents , analysts said .
Coverage just is n't consistent enough , said Esme Vos , editor of Muniwireless.com .
" It is an answer if the city does n't want to use it at all for its own purposes , " such as public safety or wireless meter reading , she said .
However , " there 's no one to scream at , at the end of the day , when the thing does n't work . "
But in a large city , such a network for use on the go could complement ubiquitous wired broadband services , said Monica Paolini of Senza Fili Consulting .
What 's new in municipal wireless is the acknowledgement that each type of network has its place , she said .
" There is no model that works everywhere , " Paolini said .

Bishop Burnham said the rules of the game had changed An Anglican bishop has said he is prepared to convert to Roman Catholicism after the General Synod voted to allow women bishops .
The traditionalist Bishop of Ebbsfleet has asked the Pope , as well as Catholic leaders in England and Wales , to help him and his parishes defect to Rome .
The Right Reverend Andrew Burnham said objectors within the Church of England were feeling " shipwrecked " .
He said : " We are floating in the water looking for someone to rescue us . "
A Church of England group is drawing up a code of practice to reassure critics after the Synod vote earlier this week .
The Synod voted in favour of consecrating women and against safeguards demanded by traditionalists opposed to the move .
If you are in the water you just hope that help will come , you can't actually engage in the luxury of wondering what form the help will come in
The Rt Rev Andrew Burnham Following the vote the Vatican said the result would create an " obstacle " to reconciliation between Anglicans and Catholics .
The Roman Catholic church does not ordain women .
Writing in the Catholic Herald the bishop called for " magnanimous gestures from our Catholic friends , especially from the Holy Father , who well understand our longing for unity and from the hierarchy in England and Wales " .
" Most of all we ask for ways that allow us to bring our folk with us , " he wrote .
Bishop Burnham hopes entire parishes under his care will convert but be allowed to remain worshipping in their existing churches under the supervision of Catholic bishops .
He told BBC Radio Four 's The World at One he did not know what form the help would take , but was awaiting a response from Rome .
" If you are in the water you just hope that help will come , you can't actually engage in the luxury of wondering what form the help will come in . "
' Sexist ghettos '
When asked if he had considered converting to Roman Catholicism he said : " That would be me , on my own , doing what might be right for me .
I have a care for people who are trying to live out conscientiously the Catholic faith as they understand it , within the Church of England .
" That is becoming increasingly difficult , and will become impossible , and I want to help them as well . "
But he said ultimately people would have to make individual decisions " because no one becomes a Catholic as part of a group " .
The Church of England 's draft of the code of practice will be put before the General Synod in February .
Bishop Burnham said some objectors would no doubt take part in the discussions .
" But we are not objecting to women as such , we are objecting to the way the Church of England decides to make decisions on behalf of the Church .
" It 's a very small fragment of the Church ... and we say that it that it simply does n't have the authority to make fundamental changes in the Bible , in the sacraments , in the creeds or in the ministry . "
He said all a code of practice can provide is " sexist ghettos " in which people could " engage in ( their ) own prejudices " , which he said was not their objective .
They had all " prayed for clarity " with the vote , he said .
" In the end you can't both have women bishops and not have women bishops .
You 've either got to decide to have them or not . "
" What happens to people like me who believe the Church can't make that decision ?
What do you do if you are playing in a game of football and someone picks up the ball and runs ?
" They 've changed the game .
The game in a sense is over and you have to see what to do next . "
A final vote on the issue of women bishops is still several years away .

What are these ?
Speaking at the time to The American Journalism Review , the Washington Post columnist David S. Broder complained about what he saw as a worrisome trend .
“ One day they are calling journalists to write favorably about their prominent political patrons , ” Mr. Broder said , “ and the next minute they are sitting at the table with journalists and indistinguishable from the journalists . ”
This year , there has been hardly a hiccup as the cable news networks and other outlets have sought to stoke interest in the presidential race  already a huge ratings boon  by signing up strategists who have either left politics only recently or still work in campaigns , a detail that is usually shared with the audience but not always .
Nicolle Wallace , who had been the communications director for President Bush ’s 2004 campaign and then held the same job in the White House , was an on -air political consultant for CBS News until last month , when she agreed to join the campaign of Senator John McCain .
Alex Castellanos , formerly the top advertising strategist for Mitt Romney , has been a regular guest on CNN ’s bipartisan panel on Democratic election nights .
Mr. Castellanos is also now an outside adviser to Mr. McCain ’s advertising team .
The CNN analyst Paul Begala is a Clinton supporter who works as a consultant to Progressive Media USA , a liberal group that is running attack ads against Mr. McCain .
Mr. Begala often sits alongside James Carville , another former aide to Bill Clinton , or Donna Brazile , a Democratic National Committee member and superdelegate .
“ We have now reached a point particularly in 24/7 cable where it is not the journalist who is the preferred participant , but the politician , the political activist , the Karl Rove type , ” said Marvin Kalb , the former director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University who was a correspondent for CBS and NBC .
There are “ Karl Rove - types , ” and there is Karl Rove , who helped to define the modern brand of hardball politics and built a new team of Republican operatives , some of them now with the McCain campaign .
They include Ms. Wallace and Steve Schmidt , the candidate ’s senior strategist .
With each passing year a new score of problems arise out of Earth ’s changing climate .
Whether you blame it on man , natural cycles or the crazy neighbor next door , the effects are unmistakable and must be acted upon .
One of those effects that have fallen by the wayside is the massive political and sociological effect taking place in Africa .
Sadly , issues of this import falling by the wayside in Africa are not a new phenomenon .
Too often the individual lives of Africans are overlooked and ignored .
However a two - day Climate Change Summit , that took place earlier this week , and hosted by the City of Johannesburg in partnership with the SA Local Government Association , endeavored to seek out solutions to one of these problems ; forced migration .
The theme for the summit was “ All hands on deck : towards a low carbon economy , ” and the issue of forced migration was only one of the issues on the table .
But some may see it as the most important to be dealt with at the moment .
In a joint statement released at the beginning of the conference , the City and SALGA said ;
“ The issue of the link between the way climate change will impact on Africa and the political implications thereof is a burning one .
The ongoing xenophobic attacks on foreign nationals in South Africa have prompted even further need for the urgency of this special session to look at climate change and forced migration . ”
With an increase of floods , drought , famine and the like in much of the middle band of Africa , many people are heading south to find a better way of life .
It is not just , as the news has so often painted it , an escape from political instability , but an escape from the raging climate .
“ One of the actions taken by the city to deal with the influx [ people from other countries ] is the establishment of a migrant helpdesk to provide legal migrants and asylum seekers with information on basic services such as housing , education and healthcare in the city , ” SALGA Chairperson and Executive Mayor of Johannesburg , Councillor Amos Masondo told the summit at the Nasrec exhibition centre .

Wich lead author of Oryx paper on continuing orangutan population declines

Endangered wild orangutan ( Pongo spp. ) populations are declining more sharply in Sumatra and Borneo than previously estimated , according to new findings published this month by Great Ape Trust of Iowa scientist Dr. Serge Wich and other orangutan conservation experts in Oryx – The International Journal of Conservation .
Conservation action essential to survival of orangutans , found only on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo , must be region - specific to address the different ecological threats to each species , said Wich and his co-authors , a pre-eminent group of scientists , conservationists , and representatives of governmental and non-governmental groups .
They convened in Jakarta , Indonesia , in January 2004 to address the threats to orangutan survival and develop new assessment models to guide conservation planning .
New orangutan population estimates revealed in the July issue of Oryx reflect those improvements in assessment methodology – including standardized data collection , island - wide surveys , and better sharing of data among stakeholders – rather than dramatic changes in the number of surviving orangutans .
The experts ' revised estimates put the number of Sumatran orangutans ( P. abelii ) around 6,600 in 2004 .
This is lower than previous estimates of 7,501 as a result of new findings that indicate that a large area in Aceh that was previously thought to contain orangutans actually does not .
Since forest loss in Aceh has been relatively low from 2004 to 2008 , the 2004 estimate is probably not much higher than the actual number in 2008 .
The 2004 estimate of about 54,000 Bornean orangutans ( P. pygmaeus ) is probably also higher than the actual number today as there has been a 10 percent orangutan habitat loss in the Indonesian part of Borneo during that period .
" It is clear that the Sumatran orangutan is in rapid decline and unless extraordinary efforts are made soon , it could become the first great ape species to go extinct , " Wich et al. wrote .
" Although these revised estimates for Borneo are encouraging , forest loss and associated loss of orangutans are occurring at an alarming rate , and suggest that recent reductions of Bornean orangutan populations have been far more severe than previously supposed . "
The new numbers underscore important issues in orangutan conservation .
With improved sharing of data and deeper collaborations among stakeholders , the experts determined that 75 percent of all orangutans live outside of national parks , which have been severely degraded by illegal logging , mining , encroachment by palm oil plantations and fires due to a general lack of enforcement by regulatory authorities , who are either unable or reluctant to implement conservation management strategies .
However , some recent conservation successes – keyed on political and financial support , media attention and advocacy by conservationists – offer cause for cautious optimism that illegal logging in protected areas can be effectively reduced and improved management of protected areas can be attained , according to the experts .
" It is essential that conservation measures are taken to protect orangutans outside national parks , and these measures will by necessity be specific to each region , " Wich et al. wrote .
The experts reported positive signs that forest conservation is gaining prominence as a political agenda .
For example , habitat loss has stabilized in some parts of Sumatra with a temporary logging moratorium in the province of Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam , where most of the island 's orangutans occur , both in and out of national parks .
Opportunities also exist to develop reduced - impact logging systems on the island of Borneo , where most orangutans live in forests already exploited for timber .
Although other threats to orangutan survival exist , such as hunting in agricultural areas where human - orangutan conflicts exist , the biggest by far is forest destruction associated with the burgeoning palm oil industry in Indonesia and Malaysia .
Together , they are the world 's largest palm oil producers with a combined global market share of 80.5 percent .
Rapid expansion of the palm oil industry coupled with poor land - use planning are further pressuring forests and the orangutans who depend on them for survival .
For example , in Sumatra , the controversial Ladia Galaska road project in the Leuser Ecosystem will , unless halted , fragment two of the three largest remaining orangutan populations , Wich et al. wrote .
A similar project in 1982 split the Gunung Leuser National Park , and the improved access facilitated uncontrolled illegal settlements inside the park , large - scale illegal encroachment and logging , and poaching of threatened species .
Also cited as an example of faulty land - use planning was a mega rice project , funded primarily by Indonesia 's reforestation fund , which eliminated 10,000 square kilometers of peat swamp forest and killed an estimated 15,000 orangutans from 1996 to 1999 .
" Both are examples of ill - advised projects with few benefits to local economies but major environmental costs , " Wich et al. wrote .
" However , as such projects provide substantial revenue for a small group of individuals with considerable political influence , unprecedented political will is needed to prevent similar projects in the future . "
The experts ' report includes sweeping recommendations for :
Effective law enforcement and prosecution to stop hunting orangutans for food and trade ;
Mechanisms to mitigate and reduce human - orangutan conflict in agricultural areas , including large - scale plantations ;
The development of an auditing process to assess the compliance of forestry concessions to their legal obligation to ensure orangutans are not hunted in concession areas ;
Increased environmental awareness at the local level , following examples set by the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Program and the Kinabatangan Orangutan Conservation Project that promote awareness of conservation of forests and the importance of biodiversity :
Development of mechanisms to monitor orangutan populations and forest cover , building on those in place on both Borneo and Sumatra ;
Continuation of surveys in less explored regions ; and
Continued improvement of survey methodology to include nest - decay rates .
" All efforts to monitor orangutans , however , will be to no avail unless the decline in numbers is halted , and this requires a change in political will , " Wich et al wrote .
" It is essential that funding for environmental services reaches the local level and that there is strong law enforcement .
Developing a mechanism to ensure these occur is the challenge for the conservation of orangutans . "
Great Ape Trust Director of Conservation Dr. Benjamin Beck said the paper makes a significant contribution to orangutan conservation discussion .
" First , we have an unambiguous , scientifically rigorous answer when regulators and policymakers ask us how many orangutans really remain , and how that compares to historical population sizes , " Beck said .
" Those responsible for environmental stewardship cannot hide indecisively behind purported scientific uncertainty .
" Second , those answers are the results of pooled knowledge of nearly two dozen high - profile investigators who set aside their own professional reputations and agendas to collect data in a standardized format and share the results for a very high , common priority : the literal survival of the species that they study and love , " Beck continued .
" In addition to being a critical contribution to orangutan conservation , this paper is an exemplar of collaboration among conservation scientists and practitioners . "
Dr. Rob Shumaker , director of orangutan research at Great Ape Trust , said Wich 's paper is historically important and verifies the crisis situation for wild orangutans .
" This represents enormous amounts of work from the authors and demonstrates their commitments to the science of orangutan conservation , " he said .
" It 's a particularly notable achievement for Dr. Wich and continues his extraordinary dedication to the study of orangutans .
" It is my fervent hope that these data inspire action on the part of everyone who can positively affect orangutan conservation . "
After the release of Grand Theft Auto IV , it was only a matter of time before we heard just how well the game did at retail .
Last week , the world seemed to pause for a few days as every enthusiast and mainstream news organization began to breathlessly report on how great and / or dangerous the game was ; you could n't turn on the television or radio without hearing either praise or dire warnings .
Now that Take Two has given us some numbers , the sales numbers are incredible : six million units have sold globally , with an estimated $ 500 million of retail value .
The first - day sales ?
3.6 million , with a retail value of $ 310 million .
It looks like Rockstar made its budget back rather easily .
Be sure to read our review of the game if you have n't yet , because while both versions of the game seem to suffer from some glitches , this is one of the best showcases for the power of storytelling and voice acting in gaming yet .
The launch also proved that there 's room for a gaming and movie blockbusters to coexist side by side .
Despite the huge sales of GTA IV , Iron Man had a phenomenal opening weekend .
It seems people do n't simply lock themselves away to play games ... which must shock the politicians .
GTA IV casts a large shadow .
Sony is saying that the game is going to bring a boost to its business .
The Chicago Transit Authority is being sued by Take Two over pulled GTA IV ads .
Last week , no Xbox Live Arcade games were released , because it did n't seem anyone wanted to compete with the Grand Theft Auto IV launch .
Jack Thompson got in on the action , and he was helped by a very misguided video put together by IGN.com .
It 's lucky these games made it to the shelves at all , as UPS employees were busted helping themselves to a free copy .
" Rockstar 's goal is to make each new title in the Grand Theft Auto franchise even better than those that preceded it , and Grand Theft Auto IV is a smashing success on that score .
Grand Theft Auto IV makes full use of the power of next generation technology , and offers players an experience unique in the interactive entertainment medium .
This game sets a new standard in the industry , with critics hailing it as both an artistic and technological masterpiece , " said Ben Feder , Take Two 's chief executive officer .
It 's hard to imagine what it 's like to be working for Take - Two right now , with the sales numbers pouring in along with the bad publicity .
Hopefully , you 've had a chance to actually sit down and enjoy the game , because there is much to like here .
In terms of scope , character , and sheer fun , Grand Theft Auto IV deserves these sales numbers .
Paradoxically , the launch has proven that the gaming industry is growing up , while the US is still rather immature in how it deals with its media creations .
Indians want Obama as the new President of the United States .
In India , Obama leads McCain by 33 to 28 percent , according to the survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project .
The survey covered 24,000 people in 24 countries between March 17 and April 21 .
Mc Cain is not the preferred candidate in any country except for three where he matches Obama ’s popularity - United States , Jordan , and Pakistan .
In countries like France , Germany , and Spain Obama is heading with 88 % popularity and confidence to do the right thing vote .
Margins are narrower in Great Britain though .
Among the people who have been following the election , large majorities in France ( 68 percent ) , Spain ( 67 percent ) and Germany ( 64 percent ) say they believe that US foreign policy will improve after the election .
This sentiment is also common in the African countries included in the survey – Nigeria ( 67 percent ) , South Africa ( 66 percent ) and Tanzania ( 65 percent ) .
However , in Jordan and Egypt people disagree .
Five years after the start of the war in Iraq , the image of the US abroad remains far less positive than it was before the war and at the beginning of the century .
The survey also finds a widespread belief that U.S. foreign policy “ will change for the better ” after the inauguration of a new American president .
Back when home prices were multiplying , banks poured oceans of borrowed money into real estate loans .
Unlike the dot - com companies at the heart of the last speculative investment bubble , the new gold rush was centered on something that seemed unimpeachably solid  the American home .
But the whole thing worked only as long as housing prices rose .
Falling prices landed like a bomb .
Homeowners fell behind on their loans and could not qualify for new ones :
There was no value left in their house to borrow against .
As millions of people defaulted , the banks confronted enormous losses in a bloody period of reckoning .
In March , the Federal Reserve helped engineer a deal for JPMorgan Chase to buy troubled investment bank Bear Stearns .
Many assumed the worst was over .
But , this month , the open distress of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  two huge , government sponsored institutions that together own or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in outstanding mortgages  sent a signal that more ugly surprises may lie in wait .
To calm markets , the government last weekend hurriedly put together a rescue package for Fannie and Freddie that , if used , could cost as much as $ 300 billion .
The urgent need for a rescue  together with another round of billion - dollar write - offs on Wall Street  has unnerved economists and investors .
“ I was a relative optimist , but I ’ve certainly become more pessimistic , ” said Alan S. Blinder , an economist at Princeton , and a former vice chairman of the board of governors at the Federal Reserve .
“ The financial system looks substantially worse now than it did a month ago .
If the Freddie and Fannie bailout were to fail , it could get a hell of a lot worse .
If we get more bank failures , we have the possibility of seeing more of these pictures of people standing in line to pull their money out .
That could really scare consumers . ”
In one respect , Mr. Blinder added , this is like the Great Depression .
“ We have n’t seen this kind of travail in the financial markets since the 1930s , ” he said .
More than two years ago , Nouriel Roubini , an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University , said that the housing bubble would give way to a financial crisis and a recession .
He was widely dismissed as an attention - seeking Chicken Little .
Now , Mr. Roubini says the worst is yet to come , because the account - squaring has so far been confined mostly to bad mortgages , leaving other areas remaining  credit cards , auto loans , corporate and municipal debt .

Cylons in America : Critical Studies in Battlestar Galactica
Tiffany Potter
The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc. ( 2008 )
Good television is n't just piffle anymore .
It 's complicating our ideas of race , gender , and genocide , and it 's doing this on purpose .
With the release of Cylons in America : Critical Studies in Battlestar Galactica , Tiffany Potter and C.W. Marshall have firmly established the acclaimed science fiction series on academic ground .
The two University of British Columbia professors are the first to compile a critical analysis of the series , but just barely .
In July , Josef Stein and Tristan Tamplin will enlighten us with Battlestar Galactica and Philosophy , and two more BSG - themed books are set to follow .
Cylons in America will undoubtedly unleash two battling voices inside the reader : the fluff - fed television cynic who sneaks over your shoulder and whispers , " Kierkegaard ?
Come on , really ?
Are n't they getting a bit carried away ? " and then the other , likely stronger voice -- the voice of the nerd that has been growing inside you since your lunch money was stolen in Grade 1 -- who will rejoice and yell , " Oh my God !
The exponential expansion of The Singularity !
I 've been talking about this all along ! "
The book has been written with the average BSG viewer in mind , and is therefore comprehensible to mid-level nerds lacking in PhDs .
For those of us who have n't picked up a philosophy , literature , or physics text in a few years , it wo n't be completely understandable , but it 's a good stretch for the brain .
And since the issues examined in the series are chillingly relevant to anyone living in a post 9 - 11 universe , the book 's cultural insights do n't require much more than an avid imagination and a critical perspective on recent events .
In an interview with C.W. Marshall and Tiffany Potter , these insights were made clear over coffee and croissants .
Science Fiction is engaged with modern culture , and allows us to confront controversy
Tyee : " In the introduction to the book , you mention the relative freedom of science fiction , allowing BSG to ' offer more honest commentary on contemporary events than is to be found on 24 - hour news stations . '
Can you explain this ? "
Marshall : " Science fiction is a great place for thought experiments .
But it has to be credible , there has to be a truth .
So in BSG , putting true characters in a situation where they are , say , actively stealing an election , if it were set today in America , would be too obvious a commentary .
But there 's a distance .
' Oh , it 's a space election .
They 're stealing space votes . '
This way , we can connect without the walls we put up when we have established that ' this is the way I vote , ' or ' this is the way I think . ' "
Potter : " And they push this into the explicitly political as well .
One of the most startling moments in the series is when you have Apollo and Helo debating the relative merits of genocide .
One is arguing in favour of exterminating the Cylons , and the other is opposed .
There is this moment of viewership where you sit back and realize that you are momentarily in favour of genocide .
And then you step back from it and realize what you 've done .
It forces you to experience it .
I mean , I did n't sit down that night thinking , ' I am going to think about the relative merits of genocide . ' "
Outer Space is a great place to confront our deeply ingrained conceptions of self and other
Marshall : " Sci -Fi has always pushed boundaries .
Star
Trek gave us the first interracial kiss on TV , when Kirk kissed Uhura in the 1960s , when it was unthinkable .
It was n't even legal in some places . "
Tyee : " Why is it so dangerous for us to confront these issues head - on ? "
Potter : " There 's a big reason and a mercenary reason for this .
The mercenary reason is advertising .
There 's money to be lost if you upset people , especially your advertisers .
But the culture of DVD , of watching a whole series without commercials , has in some ways freed up producers to do things they could n't before .
" The big reason is that we have inherent barriers .
[ People think ] , ' I see the world in this way , ' or ' I self - position as a Democrat , or a Republican , or a Liberal , ' so sometimes we are n't ready to engage these questions because they touch too close to home .
We feel that we 're being smacked , that our beliefs are being undermined .
But when you put the confrontation in outer space , you can allow those questions to be asked without feeling that your individual values are being interrogated . "
Tyee : " Right , so it takes us out of the dichotomies we 've been raised with , and into the dichotomies that have been introduced by the series .
I think the most important thing this series does is play with the self / other divide , question it , and make you realize that everybody has these divides , even if we have been taught to challenge those divisions .
I remember being surprised by how strong my feelings were when this was challenged . "
Marshall : " Yes , the insurgency is an example of this .
The series is clearly operating in a post 9 - 11 world , the idea that the terrorists are among us , that anyone could be a bad guy .
For two seasons , it was the remnants of humanity surviving against terrorists , and then beautifully , in the final episode of season two , they skip a year later , and suddenly the humans are being mapped not onto America , but onto the occupied Iraq .
Suddenly the people we care about are clearly representing Muslims , Iraqis , people who we 've been told ' are n't like us . ' "
Potter : " Right , they have not allowed the presumptive ' us ' to remain consistent .
In the case of the suicide bombing during the insurgency , we identify with the character , we know why he is angry , and then he straps a bomb to his chest and blows up other characters we identify with .
We are horrified , but in a way , we kind of get it .
In a way that I do n't think any of us ever got suicide bombing .
What that show did was give us a moment where the suicide bomber was the presumptive 'us . '
No other show has dared do this . "
Greek Tragedy , Danish Philosophers , and Battlestar Galactica are totally compatible
Tyee : " There is an article in the book tracking Sharon 's character through Kierkegaard 's stages of personhood .
I can't help wondering , is BSG really intending to present her this way ?
Are they asking for this kind of scrutiny ? "
Marshall : " Whether they 're asking for it or not , it does n't matter .
It 's a subject worthy of academic study .
They have created a work where someone with a knowledge of Kierkegaard could see a pattern in it , just like there might be any number of patterns for any number of viewers .
Now we can understand Sharon 's character arc better , and we can see something new in Kierkegaard 's thought , and more easily apply it to new circumstances .
It becomes a tool for us , rather than something that someone once thought back then . "
Potter : " In many ways this comes back to the question of intentionality that we talk about in literary studies .
For a cultural studies approach to literature , it 's actually less important what the author thought they were doing than what they actually did . "
Tyee : " Why is there suddenly so much academic interest in BSG ? "
Marshall : " I always joke with my students about the grand works that define the human condition : there 's Homer 's Illiad , there 's King Lear , and then there 's Robocop .
The funny thing is , they think it 's a joke .
But good science fiction has always been academic . "
Tyee : " You both specialize in more traditional English and Classics subjects .
Do you teach BSG as a literary text ? "
Marshall : " I teach Classics , Latin and Greek mostly , so it 's also hard for me to fit it in .
But you can certainly look at BSG and see it operating in the same way as ancient literature .
The questions I ask of ancient literature , if they are going to be valid questions , should also be applicable to other forms of culture , particularly things outside of high culture .
If what I 'm asking of Greek tragedy makes no sense for a sci-fi TV show , then maybe there 's an assumption in my question that I have n't fully unpacked . "
It is impossible to hide the fact that you have not finished watching all current episodes of Battlestar Galactica when speaking to someone who has watched all current episodes of Battlestar Galactica and compiled a book on the subject
Tyee : " There are many things , it seems , that were interpreted , but not intended by the writers ... "
Marshall : " Well yes , at the end of season three ... "
Tyee : " Aaah !
I have n't finished that yet . "
Marshall : " Oh .
Do you want to know these things ?
Should I stop ?
I 'm sorry .
Has the tape recorder seen the end of the series ?
Should I ask the tape recorder if this is okay ? "
Tyee : " Okay , okay , for the good of the article , tell me . "
Marshall : " Well , there is a big reveal at then end of season three , where certain characters start hearing music , and it's a song that becomes familiar to them , a song from Earth .
And the song they chose , ' All Along The Watchtower , ' has a hugely provocational element that has n't been fully explained .
It completely changes the tone of what happened before .
For a lot of people , that choice really bothered them .
It 's been interpreted many different ways , and many of our authors actually scrambled to change their articles after this episode came out . "
Tyee : " Okay , let 's move on before you tell me who is actually a Cylon . "
Even though Battlestar Galactica is great , it has not succeeded in creating a post - Singularity narrative , because this is logically impossible
Tyee : " In BSG 's intro , the Cylons are described as ' evolving . '
They are obviously evolving to become more human - like , at least in physical form .
Prof. Marshall , you discuss this idea of evolution in your article .
What do you think this means ? "
Marshall : " The Cylons are a human product that is proving itself better than us .
And those robots are what we created , and the robots then create robots that look like humans .
And each step is a progress , much quicker than real evolution .
So evolution is a metaphor in that sense -- it 's not genetic -- they are choosing their improvements .
But they are trying to become more human , and striving for love , which technically is against evolution , so it is challenging what it means to ' advance . ' "
Potter : " Yes and no .
They are trying to be like God , and their God who created them is the humans . "
Marshall : " And that 's ambition . "
Potter : " This also refers to the common science fiction trope of The Singularity .
The Singularity is the moment where the computers that we have created come to be smarter and more capable of creation than the humans themselves , and in that moment they overtake humanity and increase exponentially .
This is the source of a lot of dystopic science fictions . "
Marshall : " But by definition no science fiction will be able to represent The Singularity because it 's so different .
Once humans are creating something better than us , it literally shoots out exponentially , so the question of what life is becomes no longer something we are able to comprehend .
We can't have a post - Singularity narrative , because narrative is n't going to make sense , or at least the way it makes sense to us now . "
Tyee : " Whew . "
Marshall : " So what limits this growth in BSG ?
There has to be something , otherwise it would not be realistic .
As we argue in the book , this limit is their drive to be human , this is stopping the Cylons from achieving a post - Singularity existence , and allowing the story to be told , and understood by us . "
Tyee : " So I guess the next step in sci-fi is writing this post - Singularity narrative ... "
Marshall : " Well that would probably just be a bunch of ones and zeroes on pages !
Or a grey smudge .
I have no idea . "
People who watch Battlestar Galactica are also interested in other things
Tyee : " Anything else you 're excited about ? "
Potter : " Our next book is on The Wire . "
Tyee : " Really ? "
Potter : " Really . "

From Discourse.net :
This gets complicated .
According to – City Pages ( Minneapolis / St. Paul ) , Moles Wanted , the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force is recruiting people to infiltrate anti- GOP protest groups in the run-up to the upcoming Republican convention .
The law is clear that police may attend public meetings undercover to see what people are up to .
And of course undercover operations in private settings are also legal , although there should be guidelines as to when they are appropriate .
And of course it ’s good citizenship for private citizens to report crimes when they witness them .
But this story raises a number of serious questions .
First , there ’s this : the FBI told the potential informant that he “ would be compensated for his efforts , but only if his involvement yielded an arrest .
No exact dollar figure was offered . ”
In other words , the FBI is recruiting unpaid volunteers to become infiltrators .
And they get paid only if they give information leading to an arrest .
Which creates a serious incentive for agents provocateurs .
This is not a sensible policy at all .
It is in fact a very bad idea .
Second , there ’s the weird description of the targets — “ vegan potlucks ” — and the general sense of massive overkill , which contributes to the chilling effect discussed in the article .
I also wonder whether a similar effort is underway for the Democratic convention ( not that two wrongs make a right ) .
If it is not , would that be because of a political bias in the FBI , or a considered judgment that McCain is more likely to be a target of violence than the first Black ( or female ) major - party Presidential candidate ?
Bottom line : we do n’t want violence , but we also do n’t a stifling police presence that — whatever its motives — feels like an attempt to stifle dissent .
And we especially do n’t want to live in an informer nation in which people with no training and who knows what personal agendas are offered a chance to make money by stirring up trouble and then phoning the FBI .
Update : Emptywheel at Firedoglake has some good comments , notably :
How does one equate vegan potlucks with this restriction on permissible terrorist investigations ?
Mere speculation that force or violence might occur during the course of an otherwise peaceable demonstration is not sufficient grounds for initiation of an investigation under this Subpart , but where facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that a group or enterprise has engaged or aims to engage in activities involving force or violence or other criminal conduct described in paragraph ( 1 ) ( a ) in a demonstration , an investigation may be initiated in conformity with the standards of that paragraph .
[ her emphasis ]
It ’s a very good question .
Rule of Law anyone ?
From Emptywheel :

[ my emphasis ]
I ask because apparently , Minneapolis ’ Joint Terrorist Task Force is recruiting people to infiltrate vegan potlucks to look for potential –what ?
–tahini enthusiasts ?–in advance of the RNC convention this fall .
Paul Carroll was riding his bike when his cell phone vibrated .
[ snip ]
When Carroll called back , Swanson asked him to meet at a coffee shop later that day , going on to assure a wary Carroll that he was n’t in trouble .
Carroll , who requested that his real name not be used , showed up early and waited anxiously for Swanson ’s arrival .
Ten minutes later , he says , a casually dressed Swanson showed up , flanked by a woman whom he introduced as FBI Special Agent Maureen E. Mazzola .
For the next 20 minutes , Mazzola would do most of the talking .
“ She told me that I had the perfect ‘ look , ’ ” recalls Carroll .
“ And that I had the perfect personality — they kept saying I was friendly and personable — for what they were looking for . ”
What they were looking for , Carroll says , was an informant — someone to show up at “ vegan potlucks ” throughout the Twin Cities and rub shoulders with RNC protestors , schmoozing his way into their inner circles , then reporting back to the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force , a partnership between multiple federal agencies and state and local law enforcement .
The effort ’s primary mission , according to the Minneapolis division ’s website , is to “ investigate terrorist acts carried out by groups or organizations which fall within the definition of terrorist groups as set forth in the current United States Attorney General Guidelines . ”
Carroll would be compensated for his efforts , but only if his involvement yielded an arrest .
No exact dollar figure was offered .
[ my emphasis ]
Now , maybe the vegans we ’ve got here in Michigan are dramatically different from those infesting Minnesota .
But where I ’m from , vegans tend to be fairly peaceful people .
If they ’re unwilling to steal a bee ’s honey , I figure , they ’re going to be unwilling to use force to make their point .
So I ’m really curious how this operation got beyond the " mere speculation that force or violence might occur " that the US Attorney ’s own guidelines demands .
And if you ’re really intent on infiltrating groups of vegans in anticipation of a bunch of violence - loving Republicans coming to town , why use the JTTF ?
Last I heard , we were so threatened by terrorists that we had to give up all our phone data to AT&T .
But now we ’ve got time to infiltrate vegans .
I can only think of one explanation for this .
Somehow , Rachel Paulose escaped the cubbyhole they ’ve assigned her to in DC and returned to Minneapolis to continue doing absurd things with Minnesota ’s federal law enforcement efforts .

The world 's most stupid thief ?
Mugger snatches necklace on tram then admires haul in CCTV lens
This is the moment when a mugger provided police with an unmistakable clue to his identity - by admiring his reflection in the lens of a CCTV camera .
The image shows the thief moments after he had stolen a £ 200 silver necklace and bracelet from a 16 - year - old boy .
Rather than escape , he decided to try on the jewellery , apparently unaware - or unconcerned - that he was being filmed by the camera he was gazing into .
' Not the brightest spark ' :
How police described this thief trying on the stolen necklace in front of a camera
The resulting image shows his face clearly .
Today , detectives appealed for anyone who can identify the mugger to come forward .
The robbery happened on a tram in Bromley .
The victim was with his girlfriend and another boy when they were approached by the youth .
The mugger demanded that the boy show him a bracelet he was wearing , then grabbed it before asking to see the necklace , which he also snatched .
After putting on the jewellery , the robber took at least 15 seconds to admire his reflection .
When he made to get off the tram his victim asked for his jewellery back but the youth claimed he had a knife and would stab him .
Police said the boy is very upset as the necklace was given to him by his late mother and so has huge sentimental value .
Dc Dan Arundell , of British Transport Police 's robbery squad , said : " The CCTV images are very clear .
" It was quite clear that he was checking himself out in the reflection of the CCTV camera .
" The general consensus is that he is not the brightest spark .
He was there for a long time and either did n't care or was n't aware he was being filmed . "
He added that the victim tried to go after the mugger , adding : " The youth turned around to face him and said , ' You do n't want me to use this , ' with the knife in his pocket .
" All three were severely intimidated and felt they could not stop him . "
The robbery happened on the tram between Elmers End and Woodside on 23 March .
Anyone who can identify the culprit from the CCTV image should call British Transport Police on 0800 405040 .

ISLAMABAD ( AFP ) — Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf resigned on Monday , bringing down the curtain on a turbulent nine years in power to avoid the first impeachment in the nuclear - armed nation ’s history .
The key US ally , who seized power in a 1999 coup , announced the move in a lengthy televised address , rejecting the charges against him but saying he wanted to spare Pakistan a damaging battle with the ruling coalition .
The departure of the former general set off wild celebrations at home , yet it was far from certain what would come next for a nation whose role in the “ war on terror ” has been increasingly questioned by Washington .
“ After viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies , with their advice I have decided to resign , ” Musharraf , wearing a sober suit and tie , said near the end of his one - hour address .
“ I leave my future in the hands of the people . ”

... where it 's not about the camera .
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Texas regulators on Thursday approved a plan to lure $ 5 billion in new investment to build power lines to move electricity from the state ’s windiest areas to power - hungry cities .
Texas utility regulators advanced a plan to build transmission lines to accommodate about 18,500 megawatts of wind generation by 2012 .
The cost for the plan approved by the Texas Public Utility Commission in a 2 - 1 vote exceeds $ 5 billion .
While the plan could add $ 4 a month to Texans ’ power bills , regulators hope that additional wind power will reduce the state ’s reliance on costly natural gas - fired power plants .
If new power lines attract that much wind generation , it would exceed the nation ’s current wind generating capacity .
With 5,500 MW of installed wind turbines , Texas already leads the country in its capacity to generate greenhouse gas - free electricity .
The vote demonstrates Texas ’ commitment to renewable resources , said Dean Gosselin , vice president of wind development for FPL Energy , a unit of FPL Group , the largest wind developer in Texas and the U.S .
“ We are hopeful the rest of America will see the light of this decision , ” said Gosselin .
The commission declined to approve a more ambitious scenario , supported by many wind developers , to allow more than 24,000 MW of wind power , saying more study was needed on wind volatility and safe operation of the grid .
“ This is a big bite , ” Commissioner Paul Hudson said , calling the transmission plan “ nothing short of extraordinary , ” despite the criticism .
“ Ultimately , we think they will get there ( to 24,000 MW ) , ” said Gosselin , “ but it will be done in steps . ”
New transmission is needed to transfer wind power from sparsely populated West Texas to the state ’s biggest cities , such as Houston , San Antonio and Dallas , where demand is highest .
The amount of transmission approved Thursday “ gets us ahead of the need , ” said Calvin Crowder , president of Electric Transmission Texas LLC , a joint venture formed by American Electric Power Co and MidAmerican Energy Holdings , a unit of Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc .
The state is expected to have 9,000 MW of wind generation by year end .
At 18,000 MW , wind could supply power for about 3 million average Texas homes .
Texas ’ wind boom has created congestion on the existing power grid , leading to price volatility in the wholesale market and losses for small power retailers .
Texas has some of the highest wholesale electricity rates in the nation , giving wind developers even more incentive to build .
Why is Google making more money everyday while newspapers are making less ?
I ’m going to pick on The Washington Post again only because it ’s my local paper and this is a local example .
There were severe storms in the Washington area today , and the power went out in our Reston office .
I wanted to find some information about the status of power outages to see whether we should go into the office tomorrow .
Here ’s what I found on the homepage of WashingtonPost.com :
This is the WASHINGTON Post , right ?
So where ’s the news about Washington ?
We just got pounded by a nasty storm — but it ’s not homepage worthy .
Fortunately , although it ’s not top of mind for the homepage editors , it is top of mind for readers — I found the article about the storm in the list of most viewed articles in the far corner of the homepage .
I go to the article , where I find highly useful information like this :
“ We have a ton of trees down , a ton of traffic lights out , ” said Loudoun County Sheriff ’s Office spokesman Kraig Troxell .
Great , that ’s very helpful .
So what ’s my next step , when I can’t find what I want on the web ?
Of course :
Thanks ,
Google , just what I was looking for :
Wow , I thought — it ca n’t be that bad , can it ?
So I went back to the WashingtonPost.com homepage .
This time , I clicked on the Metro section in the main navigation .
Sure enough , the storm was the lead story .
And there at the top was the link to the same useless article .
But then below the photo was this tiny link : Capital Weather Gang Blog : Storm Updates
I clicked on the link , and wow :
Real - time radar , frequent storm warning updates with LINKS , and … a link to that page I had been SEARCHING for on Dominion Power about outages .
( Note the link to the useless news story buried at the bottom . )
It was a brilliant web -native news and information effort — BURIED three layers deep , where I could n’t FIND it .
Is it any wonder why Google makes $ 20 billion on search ?
And what ’s the root cause problem ?
The useless article with no real - time data and no links was written for the PRINT newspaper .
And the homepage is edited to match what will be important in the PRINT newspaper .
And the navigation assumes I think like I do when I ’m reading the PRINT newspaper .
Want local news ?
Go to the metro SECTION .
The Capital Weather Gang blog is a great example of “ getting ” the web — but then making it impossible to find …
Oh , and if you click on the tiny Weather link on the homepage ( which I only noticed on my fourth visit ) , you get a page that looks like the weather page in , you guessed it , the print newspaper — all STATIC .
Again , it takes another click to get to the dynamic , web - native weather blog .
Yesterday , I saw a ranking of the top 25 “ newspaper websites ” — and that ’s exactly the problem , is n’t it ?
These are newsPAPER websites , instead of WEBsites .
WashingtonPost.com ranks # 5 , with this comment :
The figures from the WPO 10 - Q indicate that revenue for the company ’s online business is relatively small and represents only a modest part of the sales for the newspaper group .
That is unfortunate .
If any company should be right behind The New York Times in internet revenue it is the Post .
So much potential , like the hugely innovative weather blog , crushed by the weight of tradition .
And it ’s not just the Post , of course ( not to unfairly pick on them ) — it ’s every print publisher boxed in by the legacy business .
Here ’s an idea for newspaper website homepages — just a search box and a list of blogs .
Seriously .
Instead of putting all the web -native content and publishing in the blog ghetto , like NYTimes.com does , why not make that the WHOLE site ?
( I mean seriously , having a blog section on the website is like having a section in the paper for 14 column inch stories . )
It ’s like newspapers on the web as saying : here ’s all the static stuff we produced for the paper — you want all of our dynamic web innovation ?
Oh , that ’s downstairs , in the back room .
Knock twice before you enter .
It ’s a shame — so much marginalized value .
I bet I could stop going to the New York Times site entirely and just subscribe to all of their blog RSS feeds , and still get all the news , but in a web - native format , with data and LINKS .
Of course , the only way to do that is click on 50 RSS buttons one at a time .
And they only publish partial feeds .
Sigh .
UPDATE :
Mark Potts had a similar frustration with the storm coverage — and it looks like he never even found the weather blog .
Another big missed opportunity — the Dominion electric site can’t tell me specifically if the power is still out in our office in Reston .
But I bet Washington
Post readers with offices in that area – or even in our office condo — could help me out , if someone gave them a place to do so .
The Post weather blog has a ton of comments , but information is haphazard — how about a structured data form where you can post your power outage status , maybe map it on Google maps ?
Lastly , at least Google knows how to make the Post ’s weather blog findable :
UPDATE # 2 :
Jonathan Krim , the local editor from WashingtonPost.com , offers an important clarification :
As the editor for local coverage , I appreciate the comments on our coverage yesterday .
But I am compelled to point out :
The page Scott uses for his example is not our home page for local users .
We have one for our very large non-local audience , which is what you display in your blog post .
You can change your settings , making the Washington home page your default , by clicking at the very top of the page .
Had you looked at our local home page , you would have had a different experience , with very prominent display links to our capital weather gang coverage .
My response :
Jonathan ,
Thanks for the comment .
I had already heard that others who were logged in had a different experience .
Perhaps the lesson then is about assumptions around user registration and login .
I ’m a dedicated reader of WashingtonPost.com , but I never login .
It may be necessary to supplement the customization for logged in users with geo- targeting based on IP address , which is n’t perfect , but it might have worked for me yesterday .
I also think you should integrate the Capital Weather Gang blog into the main weather page , instead requiring another click to get to it .
I think the main lesson is the tremendous pressure that Google puts on every site to make the user experience perfect .
You had the data and coverage I wanted .
You had the customization for local users .
But somehow I still missed it and went to Google instead .
UPDATE # 3 :
Several people have commented that my not finding out about the Post ’s local customization for logged in users , either from the Post directly or through another source , means I did n’t have all the facts .
In one sense , that ’s true , but the example here is not about WashingtonPost.com as an object in a vacuum with a certain feature set , or what the Washington Post.com thinks about how their site works , but about MY EXPERIENCE using the site .
My experience was lacking , and therefore I concluded that it would be lacking for other users like me .
Some people might have clicked on the Weather link , or gone straight to the Metro section , or were logged in .
But my experience represents this is not true for all users .
And the point of this post is not about the extent of WashingtonPost.com ’s shortcomings , which may not be that significant , i.e. they are easily correct , but about the demands of the web as dictated by the existence of Google .
Google is obsessed with not letting any users fall through the cracks .
Despite having customization for local users and the right content , I still fell through the cracks as a user of WashingtonPost.com .
And that is the key fact of this post .
That ’s the brutal reality of the web that we all live by .
We can have all these features and content and design and intent , but the user experience is the only arbiter .
Google understands this better than newspapers .
If newspapers understood it better , their sites would get better , which would create more economic value for them on the web .
I have to give Howard Kurtz some credit because he has n't backed away from the Military Generals scandal .
He plays audio from one of the military analysts who was part of the propaganda scandal with the Pentagon and who lovingly praises Rumsfeld .
It looks like O'Reilly was used in the same way that Dick Cheney used Russert in spreading their talking points to the American people .
What say you , O'Reilly ?

Kurtz :
The networks continue to ignore that New York Times story about TV 's military analysts getting briefings and talking points from the Pentagon as they defended the Iraq war effort .
We reported twice on this program a huge batch of documents and e-mails show how cozy that relationship was .
But now comes an audiotape of it , 2006 meeting between more than a dozen analysts and Don Rumsfeld , in which some of the retired military officers are giving the secretary advice on selling the war .

The boundary between religious belief and mental illness can sometimes be fuzzy .
It is common for persons suffering from some forms of mental illness to have religious content in their delusions or obsessions , and this can be a complicating factor in effective diagnosis and treatment .
Still , beliefs which may seem quite unusual to most of us are almost never sufficient for a psychiatric diagnosis .
Sam grew up in a small town in the Midwest and was raised in the same fundamentalist Protestant denomination of most of his neighbors .
Faith was an important part of his life , not because he was particularly devout but because it was the context in which he grew up .
His childhood was fairly ordinary , but he was never what his parents would consider a typical child .
Sam was always much quieter and more introspective than his brother .
He struggled in school , had difficulty making friends , and was never the athlete his father sought .
Sam was 14 when his father died , and this affected him greatly .
Within two years , he would drop out of high school and take a job at a gas station near his home to help support his family .
Sam 's brother , 3 years his elder , had graduated from high school and received a scholarship to attend a state college , leaving Sam and his mother behind .
Sam had some mechanical aptitude and was soon able to secure a better paying job as an auto mechanic .
He was living on his own by 19 , as his relationship with his mother became increasingly distant .
Some would later say that Sam 's mother had experienced a series of " nervous breakdowns . "
Sam spent much of his time reading a Christian bible and watching TV .
Over the next few years , Sam became increasingly quiet and withdrawn .
He had civil relationships with his co-workers , but he rarely accepted their offers to go out for a beer after work .
He attended church regularly , but even there , he seemed more distant .
His pastor reached out to him a few times , but Sam struck him as little more than socially awkward .
There was something off about him .
Nobody knows exactly what sent Sam over the edge .
It was such a gradual process that there was no way to identify any one trigger .
It might have been his mother 's failing health , although he rarely saw her by this point .
It might have been the alcohol , for he had been drinking more lately .
In any case , Sam 's functioning began a gradual process of deterioration .
He became increasingly obsessed with his bible , continued to retreat inward , and grew careless at work .
His appearance became increasingly disheveled , and his hygiene suffered .
After a loud argument with his pastor , Sam was asked not to return to church .
This argument , prompted by Sam 's conviction that humanity was failing to follow the law laid down in Leviticus , ended with him accusing his pastor of being " a fake " and " an agent of Satan . "
This would be the beginning of Sam 's legal troubles .
Sam became convinced that his god considered mixed fiber clothing sinful .
He had seen the hate - mongers on TV condemning homosexuality but could not understand why they ignored the rest of Leviticus .
He started harassing shoppers of the largest clothing store in town , eventually entering the store and damaging racks of mixed fiber clothing .
He was arrested dozens of times , convicted often , and given antipsychotic medication which he refused to take .
The local mental health system was ill - equipped to handle Sam , and he continued to slip through the cracks .
There are people like Sam in every community .
They often bounce in and out of the legal and mental health systems , neither of which are particularly well - equipped to deal with them .
Their mental illness does not always have religious overtones , but when it does , this can make friends and family members less likely to seek mental health treatment .
Some may see them as mentally ill ; others may think that they are just being good fundamentalists .
When mental health professionals look at Sam 's case , it is the functional impairment that stands out rather than the content of what he believed .
Generally speaking , beliefs that do not lead to significant distress or impairment in functioning are not considered sufficient for psychiatric diagnosis .
In Sam 's case , the impaired functioning was readily apparent .
A Messed Up Disclaimer
Thanks to Stephanie who writes , “ this came with a desk I ordered three years ago .
The desk is ok , but this little warning is STILL on my refrigerator . ”
It has recently been revealed that Scott McClellan ’s new book was reviewed and vetted by the administration , well before its publication .
And yet the liberal left , for the most part , is still acting as if Scott should be given some kind of prize for coming forward with this “ new ” information ; as if he were some sort of whistle - blower , rather than the co-conspirator that he really is .
Are we really that naive , that they can toss out an obvious red-herring like this and we will jump at the bait , just because some neo-cons and administration officials profess to be outraged by McClellan ’s book ?
According to an MSNBC investigation , McClellan ’s new book was reviewed by the White House more than a month ago .
The investigation goes on to note that what is interesting about this , is that for the most part , all of the White House insiders that have commented publicly about the book recently have expressed outrage and “ shock ” over it ’s contents .
Pretty amazing when you consider that they read it long ago .
Now , some argue that perhaps the staffers who reviewed the manuscript may not have brought the subject up with the key players themselves .
But how much sense does that make ?
A book pending publication is about to come out from a former key White House official that has controversial things to say about many of the current high ranking White House staffers , as well as the V.P. and the President himself , and that person doing the review does n’t think to mention it ?
Rather unlikely .
More likely , since lying is pretty much the status quo of this administration , is that these high ranking officials are , once again , lying … now .
In a Washington Post interview , McClellan himself has admitted that he did in fact give the manuscript to the administration to check for “ national security ” reasons over a month ago .
He says he met with White House council to discuss the book .
While McClellan ’s book offers no real new information on the White House run-up to the war ( nothing new that has n’t been written for years actually , by liberal as well as conservative writers , bloggers , and real whistle blowers ) it does however offer stunningly off - handed justifications for administration officials .
In several of the quotes that have been leaked , McClellan repeats the same mantra over and over again :
That Bush would n’t lie , that he did n’t directly lie , and that he is n’t the type of man to lie .
“ Bush , according to McClellan , “ is n’t the kind of person to flat - out lie . ”
This stands in stark contrast to much of the recent news out these days about the run-up to the war including lists of 935 direct lies about the threat posed by Iraq as well as the conscious effort of the administration to prep ex-military figures with the latest talking points , so they could go out and parrot them in the media , with a pro-war agenda .
And of course there are those 16 little words that the President spoke at the 2003 State of the Union Address that had been removed earlier because it was proven they were not true , and yet , somehow , they found their way back into the script .
Hell , the President himself admitted to lying to the White House press corps when they asked about the Rumsfeld resignation and the fact that the president had just said , a week before the 2004 election that Rumy was staying .
President Bush just told the press corps that he told them that story because that ’s what you do when you do n’t want to tell them the real story .
You LIE .
But do n’t take my word for it .
You ever wonder how many stories he and his staff just did n’t want to tell us .
So , this new revelation comes out about McClellan getting the White House staff to sign - off on the book , and no red - flags pop-up in the liberal blog - o - sphere ?
Here ’s a clue : Sibel Edmonds , a real whistle blower , ca n’t get an interview on MSM if she lit herself on fire and tap - danced to the national anthem , and McClellan has n’t got enough time in the day to run around to all the “ complicit media ” interviews to push his tell - all fable .
In fact , Edmonds is the most gagged human in history , legally speaking , and the White House edited McClellan ’s book .

May 9 , 2008  --
For two Tulane University students , pledging a fraternity became a nightmare after the older members of Pi Kappa Alpha allegedly scorched them with boiling water , leaving them with second - and third - degree burns across their bodies .
Ten students from the New Orleans university are now facing felony battery charges after the Wednesday incident , which was reportedly intended to give pledges an opportunity to prove their pain threshold , according to The Associated Press .
The incident occurred during " Hell Week , " when fraternities try out prospective members .
Earlier this week , San Diego State University suspended six fraternities after drug enforcement authorities arrested several of the chapter 's students on suspicion of dealing drugs on campus .
Police , who arrested 75 students in the drug bust , believe that one SDSU fraternity , Theta Chi , was selling cocaine to fellow students .
And while tales of pledging horrors make headlines — from the University of Texas student who fell to his death from a balcony during a hazing event in 2006 to a more recent University of Wisconsin - Madison incident where fraternity members allegedly poured buckets of human waste over their peers – many experts on Greek life still resist arguing for the abolition of fraternities .
" I think people make a very compelling case about the Greek system being a broken system , " said Alan DeSantis , an associate professor at the University of Kentucky and author of " Inside Greek U : Fraternities , Sororities , and the Pursuit of Pleasure , Power and Prestige . "
" But with all the vices , it produces a unique experience for young men and women looking for fellowship . "
Can ' Broken System ' Be Saved ?
DeSantis , who has been a member of the Greek community himself for more than 25 years and has studied it for almost as long , says that the system 's problems can be solved .
" Fraternities should n't be shut down , because they have the potential of doing some really good things , " said DeSantis .
" The problem of course is that many times these organizations do not live up to their potential .
" As an institution I think it 's worth saving , but what it 's going to demand from us is a more active role in the guidance of these young men , " DeSantis told ABCNEWS.com .
He suggests that fraternities have as much guidance as college sports teams do – coaches , faculty advisors and university officials oversee much of NCAA athletic programming .
" Fraternities are really unique in the fact that they have university affiliation but very little governance over what takes place in these secret organizations and isolated houses , " added DeSantis .
But some say the events at Tulane and San Diego , and other hazing and drug - related issues are not a sign that the system is broken , but rather are isolated , unfortunate events .
" It 's very important that we distinguish [ the incidents at Tulane and San Diego ] as not the norm but as exceptions to the rules , " Peter Smithhisler , CEO of the North - American Interfraternity Conference , told ABCNEWS.com .
" When a fraternity is done right it 's the premiere leadership experience on the college campus , " said Smithhisler , who added that a swift response – like the suspension of the chapters in Louisiana and California – is routine in times of misbehavior .
Fraternity Members Say It 's Worth It
Nathan , a recent college graduate who asked his last name not be used to protect his identity , told ABCNEWS.com that he was hazed extensively when pledging as a freshman at a small , East Coast liberal arts school .
" We had to ingest a lot of concoctions that were spoiled bad , " said Nathan , who added that he estimates he vomited during 70 percent of his pledging activities .
" I got my lowest GPA when I pledged . "
And while Nathan says he does n't think hazing is a " good thing , " he does appreciate the close relationships he formed with his peers because of it .
" I have a special bond with [ my fraternity brothers ] that I can assume is akin to what people experience in the military , " said Nathan , who added that he was " embarrassed " when he heard about the incidents at Tulane and SDSU .
" If Greek life were to shut down I 'd be really upset about it , " said Nathan .
" Fraternities are a good thing but lost in all this shuffle is information about all the good things we do .
We do n't just join a fraternity to join . "
Dan Hogan , a senior at the University of Iowa and member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity – one of the organizations involved in the SDSU drug bust – says that philanthropy and community service projects organized by the group are often overlooked among the headlines about hazing deaths and drug dealing .
" It would be a horrible decision if fraternities were to begin to be shut down , " said Hogan , who says he was not hazed nor has he hazed other members .
" The good outweighs the bad . "
" These guys – they 're my closest friends for life , " said Hogan .
" I can not imagine what college would have been like without being in the [ fraternity ] . "
That ’s right , a Lamborghini Reventon was recently pit against a Tornado fighter jet “ on a 3000 - meter runway to see which vehicle could accelerate faster . ”
Unsurprisingly , the Lamborghini lost , but still managed to put on a great show — hopefully will be in the next Top Gear episode .

… the 650 - horsepower Reventon may be badder than both John Shaft and Truck Turner combined , but when matched against a fighter jet whose twin Turbo - Union RB199 engines combine to make 39,332 horsepower at sea level , it ’s bound to come up a little shy

NEW YORK ( Reuters Life ! ) - Most Americans believe the choice to end one ’s life is a personal decision and that physician - assisted death should be legal , according to a new survey .
More than 80 percent of adults questioned in the poll by Knowledge Networks said the right to die should not be decided by the government , church or a third party , yet only 50 percent of Americans over 60 and less than 25 percent of younger people said they have a living will .
“ People put that off .
They ’re in denial and they have their heads in the sand , ” said Dave Bunnell , editor - in - chief of ELDR magazine , which commissioned the poll .
“ Unforeseen events are always around the corner .
You can become paralyzed .
You can be put in a state where you ca n’t really communicate and can’t make your wishes known and for that reason , you want them known in advance so people do n’t do the wrong thing , ” he said in an interview .
Slightly more than 66 percent of the 1,000 Americans questioned in the online poll said they wanted physician - assisted suicide to become legal in their state .
Nearly half said they could eventually become the primary caregiver to elderly family members or friends .
Oregon is the first state in the country where physician - assisted death is legal for certain terminally ill patients .
Washington is currently looking to become the second state to legalize the practice , according to the magazine .
The poll also showed that more than 90 percent of people said they would want artificial life support stopped if they were in a persistent vegetative state .
Over 80 percent said they wanted the option of being sedated if they were suffering .

Welcome to the Hatari web site !
Hatari is an Atari ST / STE / TT / Falcon emulator for GNU / Linux , BSD , Mac OS X , Windows and other systems which are supported by the SDL library .
The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari in 1985 .
Using the Motorola 68000 CPU , it was a very popular computer having quite a lot of CPU power at that time .
Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment for running GEM applications , Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games and demos .
Hatari is open source software and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
Features :
Hatari supports the emulation of most of the ST and STE hardware , including some special tricks like raster interrupts , border effects and PSG sample sound .
A joystick can be emulated with the cursor keys or with a real PC joystick .
Hatari also features the possibility to " mount " a directory of the host system as a ST drive , or to use images from an original Atari 's hard disk .
Hatari is also able to emulate the additional hardware of the TT or Falcon machines , like the Videl video chip or the DSP 56001 .
However , note that TT and Falcon support are currently still in development and experimental .
System requirements :
Hatari needs a fast machine ( 1 GHz or more for ST / STE emulation , > 2 GHz for Falcon emulation ) which is running a POSIX compatible operating system ( preferably GNU / Linux ) that supports the SDL library .
There are also some ports to other operating systems like macOS or Windows , please see the links page for more information .
Non-Linux systems like FreeBSD etc. are rarely tested , so if you run into problems while compiling Hatari on such platforms , please let us know !
Have a look at the downloads page for details about the required libraries and available packages .
Some binary packages are now available , too , but not for all architectures .
So you might need to also have GNU C on your system to recompile the source code of Hatari .
Before you can finally run the emulator , you also need a TOS image file .
TOS is the built - in operating system of the Atari 16/32 bit computers .
Since it is not possible to ship one of these image files with Hatari , you either have to create your own image from your Atari or you have to use EmuTOS , a free TOS replacement .
SDEROT , Israel ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Wednesday that a nuclear - armed Iran would be a " game - changing " situation , not just in the Middle East but throughout the world .
Sen . Barack Obama on Wednesday eyes a rocket 's remains in Sderot , Israel , which has faced attacks .
Obama said a nuclearized Iran could lead to other countries , including ones with ties to terrorists , feeling the need to obtain nuclear weapons .
That , he said , could lead to terrorists getting their hands on loose nuclear materials .
" That is our single most important threat , both to Israel but also to the United States of America , " he said in the southern Israeli town of Sderot .
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said that if he 's elected , he wants to act quickly to mobilize the international community to " offer a series of big sticks and big carrots to the Iranian regime to stand down on nuclear weapons . "
" But what I have also said , though , is that I will take no options off the table in dealing with this potential Iranian threat , " he said .
When asked by a reporter , Obama clarified his remarks made during a debate last summer that he would be willing to meet with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea " without precondition . "
The Obama campaign has since added nuance to that position , particularly regarding meeting with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Obama said Wednesday that he would be willing to meet with any leader if he thought it would promote the national security interests of the United States , but he said there is a difference between " meeting without preconditions and meeting without preparations . "

Their itinerary :
Afghanistan
Kuwait
Iraq
Jordan
Israel ( with a trip to Ramallah , West Bank )
Germany
France
United Kingdom Sen. Barack Obama and two other senators are on a trip to the Middle East and Europe .
Their itinerary :
" That continues to be my position : that if I think that I can get a deal that is going to advance our cause , then I would consider that opportunity , " he said .
" My whole goal in terms of having tough , serious direct diplomacy is not because I 'm naive about the nature of any of these regimes .
I 'm not , " Obama said .
" It is because if we show ourselves willing to talk and to offer carrots and sticks in order to deal with these pressing problems , and if Iran then rejects any overtures of that sort , it puts us in a stronger position to mobilize the international community to ratchet up the pressure on Iran . "
After Obama 's remarks , Sen .
John McCain 's campaign accused the Democrat of shifting his position and said his comments show " his refusal to admit a mistake about what he said . "
See where the candidates stand on Iran
Obama 's news conference -- the second since he left last week for his trip through the Middle East and Europe -- took place in the Sderot , which has come under rocket attack from Palestinian militants in Gaza .
It was one of many stops the senator from Illinois made Wednesday as part of an international tour aimed to boost his foreign policy credentials .
Obama has said he is making the trip as a senator and not a presidential candidate .
See where Obama has been »
Ahead of his remarks , Obama toured a home that had been ravaged by a rocket attack .
Obama called the terror in Sderot " intolerable " and praised the residents for their courage and resilience .
" I'm here to say that -- as an American and as a friend of Israel -- that we stand with the people of Sderot and with all the people of Israel , " Obama said .
" Israelis should not have to live endangered in their homes and schools .
I 'm hopeful that the recent understanding to end the attacks will provide some relief , but America must always stand up for Israel 's right to defend itself against those who threaten its people , " he said .
" We must support Palestinian leaders who share this vision , " Obama said , calling attention to President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayad , both of whom he met with earlier Wednesday .
Obama repeated his belief that Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel , remarks that have caused concern among some Palestinian leaders .
" I have said that before , and I will say it again , " Obama said , but without repeating his June comment that the city should remain undivided .
" I also have said that it is important that we do n't simply slice the city in half , but I 've also said that that 's a final status issue .
That 's an issue that has to be dealt with by the parties involved : the Palestinians and the Israelis .
It 's not the United States ' job to dictate the form in which that will take , but rather to support the efforts that are being made right now to resolve these very difficult issues . "
Obama 's campaign last month spent several days clarifying his position after he said in a speech that Jerusalem should not be divided .
Earlier this month , Obama told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he had used " poor phrasing . "
" The point we were simply making was , is that we do n't want barbed wire running through Jerusalem ... that it is possible for us to create a Jerusalem that is cohesive and coherent , " he said .
Obama said it was in the interest of Israel 's security to arrive at a lasting peace with the Palestinians .
" It 's the job of the United States , I think , to make sure that that peace is centered and promotes Israel 's long - term security , " he said .
Obama was joined in Sderot by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni .
McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , also toured Sderot when he visited the region in March .
Obama 's news conference followed a day of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders , including Israeli President Shimon Peres , Israeli opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu , Barak , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayad .
Obama was to return to Jerusalem on Wednesday evening to meet with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .

Turning to social effects , we detect statistically significant effects of neighbors ’ lottery winnings on car consumption and exterior home renovations .
For example , PCL nonparticipants who live in winning codes are more likely to acquire a new car in the six months after the lottery win than nonparticipants living in nonwinning codes .
Further , we find that nonwinning households who live next door to PCL winners are significantly more likely to purchase a car in the six months after the lottery than nonwinning households located elsewhere , and that nonwinning households living in postcodes where a large number of households won the PCL are more likely to start a major exterior home renovation in the six months since the lottery than nonwinning households located elsewhere .
the Dutch Postcode Lottery ( PCL ) .
Each week , this lottery allocates a prize to participants in a randomly chosen postcode ( containing 19 households on average ) .
About one third of the Dutch population participates in the lottery .
A participant wins € 12,500 per ticket .
In addition , one of the participants wins a BMW .
From an experimental design perspective , the lottery provides PCL participants in the winning code with an unexpected temporary income shock equal on average to about eight months of income , while leaving all other households ’ incomes unchanged .
The authors comment on these results :
What simple models of consumer behavior might explain the social effects estimated in our data ?
While it is tempting to interpret our estimates as reflective of a psychological need to ( be seen to be ? ) “ keeping up with the van den Bergs ” , we note that they could also be driven by other factors .
For example , our results for home renovations are also consistent with a scenario where a simultaneous lottery win provides a focal point ( and perhaps eases liquidity constraints ) for voluntary contributions to the local public good of neighborhood ( or even building ) appearance .
Social spillovers in car consumption in our data could be driven by information sharing about cars and / or dealers ( Grinblatt et al , 2004 ) , or by something as simple as households passing money to immediate neighbors , who might be family members .
Also , it is worth reemphasizing that our estimates do not distinguish ‘ imitative ’ consumption patterns ( I buy a car because you buy one ) from more general effects of neighbors ’ incomes on a household ’s consumption .
Still , we do find that households ’ consumption of visible , durable goods ( and only such goods ) are affected by genuinely exogenous shocks to their neighbors ’ incomes .
We find these effects intriguing and deserving of further study ...
Finally , we note that , when taken together , our own and social effects results can ... be seen as ‘ good news ’ for ... fiscal policies such as unexpected tax rebates designed to stimulate consumer spending :
To the extent that the latter aim specifically at “ big - ticket items ” ( mostly durables ) – where consumer spending is most cyclically sensitive to begin with — our results suggest that unexpected income shocks ( such as tax rebates ) may not only have substantial ‘ own ’ effects on consumption , but significant social multiplier effects as well .
These social multipliers are distinct from , and would presumably operate in addition to , the usual Keynesian multipliers that have been studied in this context .
I 'm not so sure how important the last change in the multiplier would be unless it is for the case where one neighbor gets a tax rebate and the other does n't .
When everyone gets the tax rebate , it might affect how the money is spent - perhaps it would be biased toward things that neighbors can easily observe - but the effect on total spending may not be that large .
That is , when everyone wins the lottery , the social effect may have more impact on the type of spending than on the total amount that households spend .

DECLINE of EMPIRES : The Signs of Decay
A federal appeals court struck down the regulatory cornerstone of the Bush administration ’s efforts at controlling air pollution on Friday , agreeing with the utility industry that the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded its authority when it established the 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule .
North Carolina and some companies that produce electric power opposed some parts of the regulation , creating a rare instance in which President Bush found himself allied with enviromental groups .
The unanimous ruling handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , said the regulations had “ fatal flaws . ”
At its most stringent , the regulations covering 28 states in the eastern half of the country , would have required 70 percent reductions in such major pollutants as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide beginning in 2015 .
I have developed a few web applications powered by Google App Engine since its launch in May .
It has been a fairly easy transition from my traditional programming in Python and Django backed by MySQL to the distributed App Engine environment , Bigtable , and the limitations of each .
I have learned a few App Engine best practices over over the past month and would like to share some best practices for App Engine development gained mostly through trial and error .
In this post I will share data optimization tips for Google ’s hosted Bigtable instance , reduce the errors and resource usage of your application , and add a few steps to your deployment checklist .
Key - based lookups
I program Django applications referenced by a set of short unique object labels named slugs .
A slug column is uniquely queried across a model and easily indexed for fast scans .
In the Bigtable world of Google App Engine slugs are optimally stored as a model ’s key name .
Key names are limited to 500 bytes and must be unique across your defined entity .
This unique key lookup directly copies the entity into memory without needing to scan an entire distributed hashtable .
Entity key names provide very fast lookups for developers who like to plan ahead .
You cannot alter the key name once it ’s set and it cannot start with a number or underscores .
If you can accept these limitations within your code you ’ll experience an even snappier reads from your data store .
Reduce indexed columns
It ’s tempting to choose a Datastore property by its input helper or based on names similar to a SQL equivalent .
So what ’s the difference between a short String and Text ?
An index .
According to Guido , a 300 byte string stored as Text is the same size as String but without an index .
If you have a short string you never query or sort you ’ll optimize your data queries if it ’s stored as Text .
Define a favicon
App Engine developers should define favicon.ico , robots . txt , and other frequently requested file paths .
Google App Engine logs frequent errors inside your administrative console if it has to hunt for your icon with every browser request .
Define the location of your static favicon file directly from app .yaml for fast response times :
- url : /favicon.ico static_files : static/favicon.ico upload : static/favicon.ico
You should follow a similar pattern for robots .
txt and optionally the verification files from Google Webmaster Tools , Yahoo !
Site Explorer , and Windows Live Search .
Define default 400 and 500 response templates
Your site is not perfect .
Visitors will inevitably request pages that do not exist or generate an internal server error .
Your site should define default templates for 404 and 500 status codes or risk displaying whatever is sitting on Google ’s NetScaler .
The screenshot above shows an error page of an App Engine application without a defined 500 handler .
A link on the page suggests a visit to Google ’s support website where your visitors will find no support options of interest .
Django developers should define 404.html and 500.html in your app ‘s templates directory .
Django will load and render each file for the default page_not_found and server_error views respectively .
Deploy and request
Developers should prime Google ’s distributed server networks by issuing requests for key URL s a few minutes after deploy .
These automated requests trigger your memcache storage and distribute your app instance across Google ’s distributed servers .
The first request requires more CPU cycles and memory than subsequent requests as Google tries to prioritize active application instances and their versions .
You can speed things up by always issuing one or more requests after a successful deploy .
This process is not unlike flushing and re-populating CDN PoP s with new content from your origin server or propagating dynamic handlers across your front - end cluster .
It ’s best to kick off the process early and have the latest version of your content waiting for new visitors on subsequent requests .
Summary
CAPTAIN NEMO’S UNDERWATER RIFLE
Replicating Captain Nemo ’s underwater rifle
as a fully - functional pneumatic spear gun .
Nemo fires his rifle to protect Ned and Conseil from an attacking shark .
In Verne ’s book , the weapon fired an “ electric bullet ” comprised of a glass sphere carrying a charge .
In Disney ’s movie , the prop rifle fired a burst of air bubbles , and the red streak was added to the film later by animation .
Larry Brooks suggested I duplicate the effect by combining a burst of bubbles with the beam from a red laser pointer ; that ’s a great idea and we may make that modification in the future ; but first , in keeping with our other Leagues items , we decided to make our rifle fully functional .
Since we do n’t have any “ electric bullets ” laying around , we decided to go with a pneumatic system that fires a spear .
We chose to build our rifle according to the published Disney plans , AMAP .
We tried to stay as close to the specs as possible , but also tried to match what we see in the movie .
For instance , the plans call for an open peep site above the trigger .
That does n’t show on some the movie props we ’ve seen ; and at any rate , a diver could never get his helmet behind such a site to take aim .
So we did without it .
We might add it on later , though .
Here ’s a replica prop gun from Bob Burns ’ collection : made of metal , fiberglass , and the like .
It has the peep site we spoke of .
There were several variants used in the movie .
Notice that this one has a longer black “ pistol grip ” than what shows in the plans .
Also , the spheres aft of the barrel are black on this gun , while on the plans they are specified as being brass .
“ What ’s right ? ” , you might ask .
Actually , both types are seen in the movie .
Here ’s a picture of the workbench aboard the dive barge in the Bahamas back in ’ 54 while the guns were being serviced .
Notice the lower rifle has the larger pistol grip , and the spheres are black .
The upper rifle has a smaller pistol grip and brass colored spheres , like what ’s specified in the plans .
We chose to go with the latter design , as much as possible .
But what did Nemo use to dispatch the shark ?
If you look closely , you can see that the spheres on the gun he actually fired were brass colored , not black .
So , that ’s another reason we went with brass .
As an interesting factoid : notice that the air bubbles did not come directly out of the barrel ; but rather , from a small black tube that seems to extend up from the air tank to the front of the muzzle cage .
This might have been done to put a thin , concentrated stream of bubbles right where they wanted it .
The work begins .
Here , I ’m using the oxy - acetylene torch to cut steel to produce the basic stock assembly .
This will then be shaped by hand , to serve as the foundation on which all the other parts will be assembled .
When it came to the air tank , the plans called for “ hammered copper ” .
We could have simply taken a piece of tubing and painted it copper-colored .
But instead , we made our tube out of what the plans called for : hammered copper sheet , rolled into the correct shape .
Here ’s a look at the muzzle cage while we were putting it together .
To the left is the muzzle brake , or whatever you want to call that “ holey thing ” the cage attaches to !
J
In this view we see the nearly completed rifle , minus the tubing from the tank to the sphere , hanging on our model display case .
Where the plans call for brass , we have brass .
Where copper is specified , that ’s what we used .
The little “ N ” on the stock was carved by hand from 1/8 ” brass plate .
The aluminum hemispheres on either end of the tank were sand cast from wooden plugs made for this project .
The front hemisphere comes off , allowing a handmade high - pressure tank to be placed inside the copper tube .
That ’s what will provide power to fire the spear , which can be tipped with a point for hunting , or with any of a number of commercially - made power heads for protection against dangerous underwater predators .
Here ’s the rifle with external detailing completed as far as we intend to go with it at this time .
On most replicas I ’ve seen , the tube running from the aft end of the air tank to the brass sphere is a simple black rubber hose .
On the plans , “ flex metal ” tubing is called for ; and I ’ve seen that on at least one gun I know was an actual prop ; so that ’s what we used .
The plans say the frame and pistol grip are supposed to be gunmetal blue like the barrel .
( The flash makes the blue stand out a little extreme in this picture , BTW . )
But because all the other props I ’ve seen had the frame painted black , that ’s how I did mine .
I may change it in the future , or might leave it the way it is .

How has the United States economy gotten to this point ?
It ’s not just the apparent recession .
Recessions happen .
If you tried to build an economy immune to the human emotions that produce boom and bust , you would end up with something that looked like East Germany .
The bigger problem is that the now - finished boom was , for most Americans , nothing of the sort .
In 2000 , at the end of the previous economic expansion , the median American family made about $ 61,000 , according to the Census Bureau ’s inflation - adjusted numbers .
In 2007 , in what looks to have been the final year of the most recent expansion , the median family , amazingly , seems to have made less  about $ 60,500 .
This has never happened before , at least not for as long as the government has been keeping records .
In every other expansion since World War II , the buying power of most American families grew while the economy did .
You can think of this as the most basic test of an economy ’s health : does it produce ever - rising living standards for its citizens ?
In the second half of the 20th century , the United States passed the test in a way that arguably no other country ever has .
It became , as the cliché goes , the richest country on earth .
Now , though , most families are n’t getting any richer .
Suppose tomorrow the Bush administration announces plans to deploy thousands of Homeland Security Troops to American cities , to walk the streets armed in the search for un-American , possibly terrorist activities ( such as taking photos where there is n’t anything obviously pretty to be taking a photo of , being overly swarthy , videotaping cops and Homeland Security Troops , etc ) .
These guys would only be answerable to the DHS , and they would be recruited from the likes of Blackwater , Wackenhut , and so forth .
Obviously there would be some outrage , yeah ?
I mean , not as much as there should be , but a lot of folks would n’t care for this at all .
Now imagine that these troops are outfitted exactly like Stormtroopers from Star Wars .
What percentage of geeks would declare that this was awesome ?
What percentage of non geeks ?

What is it with Stormtroopers ?
How have we , as a culture , come to love the faceless face of oppression ?
Sure , in the movies they bump their heads and ca n’t hit a sidewalk with a can of paint and talk about that new BT - 16 and do the Wilhelm scream and all , but it ’s still pretty clear who they are and what they represent .
But people ca n’t get enough of them .
Go to any sci-fi or comic convention and you ’ll see several people in meticulously crafted Stormtrooper armor .
In fact , there ’s a group devoted to this , which is now also marching in things like Fourth of July parades ( which is where the first image was taken ) .
Seriously , someone thought Stormtroopers in a Fourth of July parade was a good idea .
This summer there ’s a CGI “ Clone Wars ” movie coming out .
The guy on the left is Anakin Skywalker , who will become Darth Vader , right hand man to the evil Emperor .
The troops in the background are the guys who will eventually become the Stormtroopers .
Hopefully Anakin and the Clonetroopers can use all their cool ships and weapons and stuff to defeat … the bad guys ?
As with Attack of the Clones , are we really going to once again be expected to root for the people that we already know are going to enslave the galaxy ?
But fascism is n’t just wicked awesome , it can also be dead sexy .
Once the helmet is on you wo n’t see the face of your oppressor but you ’ll see her hot hot midriff and her thermal detonators .
This is female empowerment .
It can also be fun !
Here are some of the folks who kill for the Empire having a little downtime !
( Picture by waihey on Flickr )
In that last photo , an argument can obviously be made for satire , for letting the context play against the characters as a way to defang and ridicule totalitarianism .
It ’s also kind of funny !
Still , here ’s the 118th Rose Parade .
What ’s the satirical message here ?
These guys were trained by a colonel in the real Army .
I ’m not suggesting there ’s some kind of conspiracy afoot to make us more tolerant of ( and , in fact , enthusiastic about ) a fascist society .
I ’m suggesting that such a conspiracy probably would n’t be necessary .
Key war on terror architect Douglas Feith has now confirmed Donald Rumsfeld , Paul Wolfowitz and Wesley Clark in admitting that the so - called War on Terror is a hoax .
In fact , starting right after 9/11 -- at the latest -- the goal has always been to create " regime change " and instability in Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , Sudan , Somalia and Lebanon so as to protect Israel .
And the goal was never really to destroy Al Qaeda .
As reported in a new article in Asia Times :
Three weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , former US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld established an official military objective of not only removing the Saddam Hussein regime by force but overturning the regime in Iran , as well as in Syria and four other countries in the Middle East , according to a document quoted extensively in then - under secretary of defense for policy Douglas Feith 's recently published account of the Iraq war decisions .
Feith 's account further indicates that this aggressive aim of remaking the map of the Middle East by military force and the threat of force was supported explicitly by the country 's top military leaders .
Feith 's book , War and Decision , released last month , provides excerpts of the paper Rumsfeld sent to President George W Bush on September 30 , 2001 , calling for the administration to focus not on taking down Osama bin Laden 's al - Qaeda network but on the aim of establishing " new regimes " in a series of states ...
***
General Wesley Clark , who commanded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombing campaign in the Kosovo war , recalls in his 2003 book Winning Modern Wars being told by a friend in the Pentagon in November 2001 that the list of states that Rumsfeld and deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz wanted to take down included Iraq , Iran , Syria , Libya , Sudan and Somalia [ and Lebanon ] .
When this writer asked Feith . . . which of the six regimes on the Clark list were included in the Rumsfeld paper , he replied , " All of them . "
***
The Defense Department guidance document made it clear that US military aims in regard to those states would go well beyond any ties to terrorism .
The document said the Defense Department would also seek to isolate and weaken those states and to " disrupt , damage or destroy " their military capacities - not necessarily limited to weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) .
Understanding CSS positioning part 2
This is the second part in the Understanding CSS positioning series , which will focus on float and more advanced display properties .
Float is one of the most often used CSS property in current day stylesheets , and this article will show that there are quite some more display properties than just block and inline .
We ’ve already covered those properties in part 1 , so if you have n’t read it yet , start there first !
Floating to the side
In essence , floating allows you to place a block element to the left or right border of its containing element and let the rest of the content flow around it .
A floated element automatically becomes a block element so you can add a width and height to it .
Between the two , always make sure that you specify a width , because without it the rendering can be unpredictable .
The CSS for floating is : float : left ; , float : right ; or float : none ; .
Floating looks like this :
This is a very useful feature when making layout , because like position : absolute ; you can place block elements besides each other , but unlike it , they can interact with each other as well .
You can float two elements next to each other , and when the left element gets wider , the right element will move accordingly .
Like so :
For a silly reason , Internet Explorer 6 adds extra bits of margin around floated elements .
To solve this , there is an equally silly fix : just add display : inline ; to the floated element and the extra margins magically disappear ..
Since floated elements will always be block , this does n’t affect any real other browsers .
Clear
There are times when you do n’t want certain content to be next to floated elements .
To accomplish this , you can use clear .
You can decide to clear all left , right or both , floated elements , or explicitly tell an element to clear nothing with clear : none ; .
You can use these two properties together : a floated element can also clear other floated elements before it .
This is useful when you have a list of two elements that you want to display next to each other , but every pair on it ’s own line .
( for example , definition lists or label + input combinations )
Just float all elements , and add clear : left to each first element :
.div1 { float : left ; clear : left ; } .div2 { float : left ; }
Will result in this image :
There are a number of rendering bugs in internet explorer 6 ( the most common one is called the peekaboo bug ) , most of which can be fixed by making sure your elements have hasLayout , so just add a width , positioning or zoom : 1 to your css .
Overflowing
When you float an element , its parent will not scale to encompass it unless the parent element is floated itself or the inline content makes the parent element long enough .
If you float an element that is longer than it ’s parents element , this will happen :
You could just tell it to encompass it .
To do so , just add overflow : auto ; to the parent element .
Fixed :
Display : even -more !
In the first part of this series we discussed the block , inline display modes .
But CSS2 has a bit more :
inline - block
list - item
run-in
compact
table
However as you might expect , none of them work cross - browser , and a couple do n’t work at all .
For an excellent overview , check out PPK ’s compatibility table to see that we can pretty much forget about run-in and compact
Display : inline - block ;
That seems a bit contradictory , does n’t it ?
It ’s not though .
An element with inline - block get placed inside flow , on the line next to other elements , but you can style it like a block element .
So it can have a width and height and add margin and padding to it .
This does n’t work in firefox2 ( it does in 3 ) and is a bit buggy in internet explorer 6 and 7 : there it only works on elements that naturally have display : inline ; Update : or , like NatalieMac said in the replies , by firstly declaring it to be display : inline ; and then display : inline - block in another selector .
IE truly moves in mysterious ways …
Display : list - item ;
List - item works in IE6 and better , so you can feel free to use it .
When you make something a list - item , you basically make two boxes : one that has a block setting for the text within it , and a “ marker box ” , where the dot goes :
Display : run-in ;
Run -in does not work in anything but Opera .
Its description is awfully confusing , but I ’ll try to translate it into more understandable English : an element with display : run - in ; will be placed right in front of the next ( block ) element .
However ,
If there is no block element following it , it will become a block element itself .
The use for this element is being able to make run-in headers :
Behind the scenes , the heading in the above image actually gets placed inside the paragraph and gets display : inline ; .
Display : compact ;
This value is dependent on the next element as well .
Adding to the complexity however , the following will only happen if the element is less than one ( text ) line long : if the next element is a block element and has enough margin - left , the element with display : compact ; becomes display : inline ; and is positioned in the left - margin of the next element .
Adding to that , the line - height of the element with display : compact ; will also be used for the first line of the block element next to it .
In the above ( simulated ) example , you can see that the line - height of the element with display : compact ; ( 3em ) is used as the line - height for the first line of the next element as well .
Display : table
display : table comes with a couple of other display properties :
table - row ( < tr > )
) table - cell ( < td > or < th > )
or ) table - column ( < col > )
) table - row - group ( < tbody > )
) table - header - group ( < thead > )
) table - footer - group ( < tfoot > )
) table - column - group ( < colgroup > )
) table - caption ( < caption > )
The HTML equivalent is placed in parentheses .
These elements do not work in Internet explorer 6 or 7 , but do in all other browsers .
Together , they allow you to emulate a table while using other elements .
There is also an inline - table value , which allows you to place the whole of the above in line with the rest of your content .
That ’s it for CSS2 !
We ’ve now covered all the positioning possibilities CSS2 gives .
Tune in next week to see what CSS3 has to offer us !
Update : part three of Understanding CSS positioning is posted , check it out !

Grand Theft Auto IV is just a week away .
To prep you for one of the most anticipated games of all time , IGN is bringing you a week 's worth of features .
Liberty City is perhaps the most important element of GTA IV Rockstar North Art Director Aaron Garbut about the creation of Liberty City .
The +city's+bridges+are+closed+down+due+to+terrorist+threats+at+the+start+of+GTA+IV .
" I think [ the original ] Liberty City was a great world to play about in and it was a great experience for us to make , but it was n't New York .
While loosely based on New York it had elements of many other cities and was as much a generic American city with a Manhattan - esque skyline in the middle . "
Liberty City was our first attempt at a fully realized 3D city many years ago , at the time simply making an open world that can be interacted with in so many ways was a challenge .
We had a lot to learn and we were making it all up as we went .
I think [ the original ]
Liberty City was a great world to play about in and it was a great experience for us to make , but it was n't New York .
While loosely based on New York it had elements of many other cities and was as much a generic American city with a Manhattan - esque skyline in the middle .
Rockstar is based in New York and over the years many of us have been over from Edinburgh numerous times .
We all knew what an amazing , diverse , vibrant , cinematic city it is .
And the guys in the New York office lived that every day .
I think because we really felt that we had never properly based one of our GTA cities on New York it seemed like now would be a good time to do that .
And since we were hoping to push the detail , variety and life , for lack of a better word , to such a degree it seemed that basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit .
We 've moved slowly in that direction through each Grand Theft Auto .
In GTA III , Liberty City was very much its own place .
It obviously had elements of New York along with other cities but there were no landmarks and nothing deliberately recognizable .
In Vice City , and then more so in San Andreas , we started to take real landmarks and mix them in to our versions of the city .
I think this is just us continuing down that path we had already started on .
It 's one of the reasons we felt comfortable redoing Liberty City .
We spend years of our lives making these worlds we do n't want to retread old ground and " up - res " something we had already done , that would be soul destroying .
By going back to basics , throwing away the original Liberty City and building an entirely new city based on New York we were able to keep it fresh for ourselves and by extension for the people that will play it .
There 's nothing that links them other than name and general feel .
We started from scratch .
Looking to New York itself as a basis and reference point , not to our old work .
There might be a few references to GTAIII our artists have slipped in there but that 's all they are , it 's a completely reinvented , fresh take on Liberty City as New York , rather than Liberty City as an American metropolis .
It 's important to stress though that we never limited ourselves in keeping faithful to the real city .
We treated Liberty as a separate place just as we had in the past .
It 's a distilled , exaggerated New York , a caricature of a city and not a brick for brick recreation .
We exaggerated the best and worst bits , twisted the real city to suit our needs and left out whatever we felt was n't necessary .
MISS D , the teenager at the centre of a High Court abortion row last year , has spoken of her joy of giving birth to a healthy baby boy .
The 17 - year - old gave birth just last week to a 6lb 14 oz boy after going into labour two weeks ' prematurely .
Speaking to the Irish Independent , she said her son does not replace Jasmine , her daughter who was suffering from a fatal brain condition .
And she spoke of the rush of love she felt for her son the first time she held him .
" I was exhausted , but the tiredness went away straight away when I was handed the baby , " she said as she cuddled him .
" It was just amazing when I held him .
I did n't expect such a feeling because of what went wrong the last time .
But it was just incredible . "
The young woman made headlines last May when she fell pregnant by her long - term boyfriend while in the care of the Health Service Executive ( HSE ) .
A scan revealed the baby was suffering from the fatal brain condition anencephaly but health chiefs told her she would be prevented from travelling to England to abort her baby .
Miss D -- who cannot be identified for legal reasons -- went to the High Court and won permission to travel to England where her daughter Jasmine was induced .
Last September she revealed that she was pregnant again
Recalling when she went into labour , on April 8 , she said she was in pain the previous night but was n't sure if she was going into labour .
" I did n't want to go to the hospital because I thought I was in labour a few times before and I was n't , " she said .
Pressure
" I had lots of pressure pains but they did n't feel like contractions .
Eventually we called an ambulance and my mother and boyfriend went into the hospital with me . "
She said she was already four centimetres dilated when she arrived at the labour ward and was in labour for a eight - and - a - half hours .
Her boyfriend , who she has been dating for three - and - a - half years , was there for the duration of her labour to give her moral support , as were the two grandmothers .
" I was n't expecting any feeling in particular afterwards but when they threw him up in my arms it was amazing .
He was just gorgeous . "
However she said that she also felt sad after the birth .
" I felt a little bit guilty because it was my second labour , " she said .
Her 20 - year - old boyfriend has also spoken of his joy at welcoming his first son into the world , saying he would n't have missed the birth " for the world " .
" I 'm so delighted .
He 's a pet , " he said from their home in the north - east .
" The labour was scary and I did n't really believe I was going to be a dad until he was born .
I was just stuck for words afterwards , I did n't know what to say or do , it was just unbelievable . "
The couple have also had to deal with the upheaval of moving house .
Previously they had been living in an apartment , but last Monday -- just six days after the birth -- they moved into a three - bedroom house which Miss D describes as their " home forever " .
However she admits that she is likely to be over - protective of her son .
" He was sick earlier this week , just after we moved into the house .
He was vomiting and the doctor told us that he needed an operation .
But we brought him straight to the hospital and the pediatrician said he was fine , that it was just reflux that was causing him to vomit . "
She said her family are already fighting over who gets to babysit him as he is the first grandchild in the family .
" The grannies are obsessed with him , they 're really really good to him , " she said .
Happiness
" They 're already fighting over him all the time because he 's the first grandchild on both sides .
They 're trying to get us to go out all the time , " she laughed .
However she said that despite her happiness , she will never forget Jasmine , her firstborn .
" This baby is not replacing Jasmine , " she insisted as she cuddled the sleeping baby .
" I love them both just the same . "
She said she goes to visit Jasmine 's grave regularly and often lights candles for her in the church .
" He 's going to know all about her because she was his big sister . "
If there 's one company that knows how to make shorts that do n't suck , it 's Pixar .
They also know how to make feature films that do n't suck , as evidenced by their newest release WALL " ¢E , which , forget the animation category , should be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar next year as far as I 'm concerned .
Stretching all the way back to 1995 's Toy Story , the former Lucasfilm division has a proud history of great features , and an equally proud , if somewhat lesser known , history of great shorts going all the way back to 1984 , many of which have helped Pixar earn its thirteen Academy Awards .
Here they all are , arranged chronologically for your flossing and viewing pleasure .
Andre and Wally B - 1984
This was made at Lucasfilm , but animated by John Lasseter , who would become the head of Pixar .
To look at the animation , it 's incredible to think this was made in 1984 -- consider the monochrome bloops and bleeps your PC , if you were lucky enough to have one , made back then .
The technology was quite restrictive , but Lasseter pushed the envelope by asking the Lucasfilm tech team for tear - drop shapes that could be animated ( over and above the simple geometric shapes he was otherwise limited to ) .
The results are impressive , if brief .
Luxo Jr. - 1986
This was Pixar 's first short after becoming a company independent from Lucasfilm , and it received an Oscar nom for Best Animated Short -- not bad for their first try !
Luxo the lamp has since become the company 's unofficial mascot , and was inspired by one of John Lasseter 's student films at CalArts , " Lady and the Lamp . "
According to Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull , " ' Luxo Jr. ' sent shock waves through the entire industry " “ to all corners of computer and traditional animation .
At that time , most traditional artists were afraid of the computer .
They did not realize that the computer was merely a different tool in the artist 's kit but instead perceived it as a type of automation that might endanger their jobs .
Luckily , this attitude changed dramatically in the early ' 80s with the use of personal computers in the home .
The release of our ' Luxo Jr. , ' ... reinforced this opinion turnaround within the professional community . " 
Red 's Dream - 1987
Following the phenomenal success of " Luxo Jr. , " " Red 's Dream " was a bit of a downer , both because it 's a really sad film , and because it did n't rack up the accolades that " Luxo " had .
We still think it 's still insanely impressive , however .
Tin Toy - 1988
" Tin Toy " represented several significant firsts for the still - fledgling animation company : their first attempt at a semi-realistic human character in a 3D computer - animated film ( the baby ) , and their first film to not only be nominated for , but win , the Oscar for Best Animated Short .
The Library of Congress ' National Film Registry chose to preserve the film in 2003 .
Knick - Knack - 1989
Pushing the animation envelope yet again , " Knick - Knack " premiered at the annual SIGGRAPH computer animation convention -- in 3 - D .
It was re-built and re-rendered for release with 2003's Finding Nemo , for which the female characters underwent some serious breast reduction , presumably to make the film more family - friendly .
It did n't win an Oscar , but for what it 's worth , Terry Gilliam has called it " one of the best animated short films of all time . "
So that 's cool .
Lifted - 2006
To see just how far Pixar has come , check out their Oscar - nominated short " Lifted , " which was released with Ratatouille .
Directed by acclaimed sound mixer Gary Rydstrom , the similarity between the alien protagonist 's baffling control console and the mixing boards used by Hollywood sound guys is no coincidence .
Exclusive IBM looks set to join the seriously multi-core set with the Power7 chip .
Internal documents seen by The Register show Power7 with eight cores per processor and also some very , very large IBM boxes based on the chip .
The IBM documents have the eight - core Power7 being arranged in dual - chip modules .
So , that 's 16 - cores per module .
As IBM tells it , each core will show 32 gigaflops of performance , bringing each chip to 256 gigaflops .
Just on the gigaflop basis , that makes Power7 twice as fast per core as today 's dual - core Power6 chips , although the actual clock rate on the Power7 chips should be well below the 5.0 GHz Power6 speed demon .
In fact , according to our documents , IBM will ship Power7 at 4.0GHz in 2010 on a 45 nm process .
We 're also seeing four threads per core on the chip .
For some customers , IBM looks set to create 2U systems with four of the dual - chip modules , giving the server 64 cores of fun .
These 2U systems will support up to 128GB of memory and hit 2 teraflops .
IBM has an architecture that will let supercomputing types combine these 2U boxes to form a massive unit with 1,024 cores , hitting 32 teraflops of performance with 2TB of memory .
And , er , if you are a seriously demanding type , boy , does IBM have the system for you .
The Giant
The Register has uncovered the first detailed specifications of the " Blue Waters " system IBM is building for the National Center for Supercomputing Applications ( NCSA ) .
If our documents are to be believed - and they 're penned by an IBM executive - this system , funded by a $ 208 m grant and meant to go up at the University of Illinois in 2011 , will be the most massive machine ever created .
We 've got documents showing IBM going after a 10 petaflop system ( peak ) comprised of 38,900 eight - core Power7 chips with each chip running at 4.0GHz .
This monster will have an astonishing 620 TB of memory and 5 PB /s of memory bandwidth .
According to the documents , IBM will rely on a 1.30 PB/s interconnect to link the systems and will feed them with 26 PB of storage .
As if that 's not enough , IBM will offer an exabyte of archival storage .
Why not ?
This insane machine will be built out of more than 100 racks filled with servers and storage systems , taking up close to 4,400 sq. feet .
Er , if this stuff is n't sending shivers down the spines of Sun and Intel , then I do n't know what will .
IBM has clearly decided to get a bit radical with Power7 .
This is n't the single - thread focused Power6 .
It 's a true multi-core chip , which should stack up very , very well against Sun 's 16 - core rock and what will likely be an eight - core version of Itanium around in 2010 .
And then IBM still has the Quasar project lurking in the background , where it 's combining Power and Cell chips .
Stand back , friends .

Can Barack Obama walk a political / cultural tightrope to success on Election Day ?
On Monday , he gave a well - written speech on patriotism .
He noted that “ at certain times over the last sixteen months , I have found , for the first time , my patriotism challenged –at times as a result of my own carelessness , more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who I am and what I stand for . ”
And unlike Democrats of the past–Michael Dukakis comes to mind –Obama is not going to give an inch in any battle over who is really a patriot .
In the speech , he described the wellsprings of his own patriotism :
One of my earliest memories is of sitting on my grandfather ’s shoulders and watching the astronauts come to shore in Hawaii .
I remember the cheers and small flags that people waved , and my grandfather explaining how we Americans could do anything we set our minds to do .
That ’s my idea of America .
I remember listening to my grandmother telling stories about her work on a bomber assembly - line during World War II .
I remember my grandfather handing me his dog-tags from his time in Patton ’s Army , and understanding that his defense of this country marked one of his greatest sources of pride .
That ’s my idea of America .
I remember , when living for four years in Indonesia as a child , listening to my mother reading me the first lines of the Declaration of Independence –“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal .
That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ”
I remember her explaining how this declaration applied to every American , black and white and brown alike ; how those words , and words of the United States Constitution , protected us from the injustices that we witnessed other people suffering during those years abroad .
That ’s my idea of America .
Obama declared , “ I will never question the patriotism of others in this campaign . ”
Which is not such a big promise to make .
( He ’s going to call McCain unpatriotic ? )
And he defined patriotism to include dissent ( such as the whistleblowing of the soldier who first revealed the abuses at Abu Ghraib ) and sacrifice .
But what was intriguing was how Obama blended a championship of dissent with a belief in American exceptionalism .
In fact , he noted that in order for the former to be legitimate if must be cloaked with the latter :
I believe those who attack America ’s flaws without acknowledging the singular greatness of our ideals , and their proven capacity to inspire a better world , do not truly understand America .
Is this a slam of the old U.S. - is - evil , flag - burning left ?
Whether or not it is , in that sentence there is something for everyone .
America is No. 1 , and America has flaws that must be exposed , no matter how difficult , by its patriotic citizens .
Certainly , no one is likely to be elected president in the United States without embracing its ideals and without paying tribute to the national mythology .
Obama , it seems , can do this well :
it may be this quality that best describes patriotism in my mind – not just a love of America in the abstract , but a very particular love for , and faith in , the American people .
That is why our heart swells with pride at the sight of our flag ; why we shed a tear as the lonely notes of Taps sound .
For we know that the greatness of this country – its victories in war , its enormous wealth , its scientific and cultural achievements – all result from the energy and imagination of the American people ; their toil , drive , struggle , restlessness , humor and quiet heroism .
Obama celebrates the myth and calls for dissent–but dissent predicated on an understanding that the United States is in essence a good and special nation .
Politically , this may be an effective way out of the still - resonating battles of the 1960s , a time when some citizens defined patriotism as loving your country right or wrong and others viewed disastrous governmental policies and unjust laws as reflections of fundamental American malevolence .
Obama , its been said , is a post- racial candidate .
( Election Day will show if that ’s true or not . )
But he may also be America ’s first post - 60s candidate .

He is teaming up with the fascist Bloomberg to stop people from smoking " around the globe . "
This is no private initiative .
Bloomberg , as mayor of New York , is well - positioned to use government to make this happen .
The mayor ’s initiative supports efforts to increase the tobacco tax , transform the glamorized image of tobacco , help people quit and protect nonsmokers from secondhand exposure .
" The reality is that all the money in the world will never eradicate tobacco use and that this problem is too big for any one person or organization to solve , " Bloomberg said .
" It ’s going to take a sustained commitment by government , community organizations and the entire global health community , including those who fund it . "
This article mentions countries where " something " has been done already , and in each case it ’s a government law , somewhere , that does something to ban or discourage smoking .
According to Bloomberg , a world without tobacco " is a world in which people live longer and have happier lives . "
Am I the only person who gets tired of reading this kind of crap ?
Who is Michael Bloomberg to judge other peoples ’ happiness and determine what does or does n’t make them happy ?
Does anyone else stop and note that we can’t possibly collectivize happiness ?
Of course , we are talking about a man who believes that a centralized government owns your life and is responsible for determining what you should or should not be doing with your life .
Bloomberg is perhaps one of the worst offenders of individual freedom who is currently in a political position to empower government at the expense of individuals .
His perch atop NYC is bad enough , but he enjoys using his wads of money to fund interventionist government efforts around the globe to extend fascist government policies and crush individual liberties .
Bloomberg loves power , and he loves to control everything around him , and so the stench of his rottenness has no end in sight .

Anchorage , Alaska To Install 16,000 LED Streetlights
July 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Another win for LED bulbs : Anchorage , Alaska plans to replace 16,000 streetlight fixtures — a quarter of all the streetlight fixtures in the city — with LEDs .
The new streetlights will use 50 % less energy than current fixtures , leading Anchorage to potential savings of $ 360,000 each year .
The city has invested $ 2.2 million in the plan .
Since Anchorage has 85 days a year with less than 8 hours of sunlight , energy efficiency initiatives are critical to the city ’s survival .
With other programs currently in the works , they ’re on the right track .
Cree , a US - based LED component manufacturer , started the LED City program in 2007 .
The initiative is designed to test the economic , environmental , and usage benefits of LED lighting in cities around the world .
Other cities that have already committed to the LED City program include Raleigh , North Carolina ; Toronto , Ontario ; Tianjin , China , and Torraca , Italy .

What ultra-advanced anti-gravity system allows UFOs to fly in such a bizarre way ?
Apparently it 's ionized air .
An engineering professor at the University of Florida has it all figured out , and he 's going to build his own flying saucer .
Advertisement
Professor Subrata Roy started working on his " wingless electromagnetic air vehicle " ( WEAV ) for NASA .
The surface of the saucer - shaped craft will be covered with electrodes that , when powered by a battery or other power source , will ionize the surrounding air to create plasma .
When charged with an electric current , the polarized plasma will repel the non-polarized air , creating lift and thrust .
Such an aircraft would have very stable flight characteristics , with the pilot controlling it by diverting the electrical charge to different parts of the surface .
Professor
Roy thinks it could be scaled up to useful dimensions ( his prototype will be about six inches across ) .
I 'd check out the professor 's work while you still can .
He 's scheduled for a visit from a couple of guys in black suits tomorrow , after which his research will be republished in a heavily redacted form .

Blackbirds may be tuneful but they are also fiercely territorial Chicago residents have been sharing tips about how to avoid coming under attack by dive - bombing blackbirds .
Cyclists and pedestrians complain of being pecked after being chased for up to 100 m ( 109 yards ) by the creatures .
During nesting season , male red-winged blackbirds are known to defend their territory fiercely .
Some victims have made comparisons to Alfred Hitchcock 's 1963 thriller The Birds , and have named one of the worst offenders after the British director .
" Something just came down , pecked me in the head , took my hair and started flying away , " said Holly Grosso , a local businesswoman and one of Hitchcock 's recent victims .
" It 's so bizarre .
It 's this little bird . "
Stealth cat Chicago ornithologist Douglas Stotz said blackbird attack hotspots included parks and areas along the shores of Lake Michigan .
Wear an oversized helmet with a trap - door with a stealth cat inside
One Chicago resident 's advice
He said angry blackbirds could be deterred by a direct stare .
More radical suggestions aimed at fending off the swooping attackers have included mimicking the sound of a barking dog or even imitating a larger bird .
" Spread your arms and advance on him , " one e-mail advisory suggested .
" His pattern recognition will kick in making you look like a dangerous predator , such as a hawk . "
Another correspondent suggested cyclists should install baskets on their bikes with a cat inside .
" Or better yet , wear an oversized helmet with a trap - door with a stealth cat inside . "
Potential victims are taking new precautions to avoid the birds by changing their commuting patterns or cycling only with a helmet .
Although it had been suggested that wearing any form of head covering was enough to prevent attacks , this myth was debunked recently when a man was swooped upon while wearing a baseball cap , the Chicago Tribune reported .

What are these ?
A couple months ago I was at my Alma Mater Adams State College to talk about what I would have wanted to know if I was a student .
I ’ve been out of college for 3 years now , and held 3 VERY different programming jobs since graduating with my Bachelor ’s Degree .
I am hoping to shed some light on what I have learned about the “ real world ” and clear up some misconceptions .
Quick background
I just want to give you enough information about where I ’m coming from here .
Obviously , your experiences will be different but I think there are several things common to almost all workplaces and that is what this post will focus on .
I have done data - oriented programming , back - end programming , and web programming for a couple small companies and one quite large company .
All of these positions were around Northern Colorado / Wyoming so we ’re not exactly in Silicon Valley .
If you really care about the details you can check out my Linked In page .
What I would ’ve done differently
There are a few things that I would go back and do if I could :
Work with other OSes - I mostly used Windows because that was what we had in most of our labs .
I would have been more prepared for the workplace if I had done more stuff in a shell .
Go try out Mac or Ubuntu !
Most of the candidates I see nowadays do n’t have non-Windows experience , and it is really frickin’ valuable , I promise !
More research classes and internships -
Do something outside your comfort zone !
You can explore things that noone else has and that experience is absolutely invaluable .
I really wish I had done the facial - recognition programming class or an internship at a bigger company .
Do n’t make my mistake .
Consider taking the SCJA or SCJP exams -
My college program was Java - based but there were so many parts of the Java language that I really did not understand .
I really learned a lot from passing the SCJP and I seriously recommend taking it as the knowledge WILL set you apart .
Connect with more people - I had what I would consider a rougher entrance into the programming world , and I may not have gotten a good programming job ever if I had not met some good companies at university job fairs .
Take advantage of college job fairs outside your college
What I wish I ’d known about the workplace
It was certainly different working on the same type of thing for many hours a day instead of the great diversity I had in school .
My brain felt tired every day at about 4 pm for the first month in the “ real world ” , but I think it ’s just because I was learning so much .
Another thing I was surprised by is that people in the workplace seemed more easygoing than I would have thought and socialization ( face - time ) is an important part of working .
All of the places I have worked I would guess that people tend to spend about 3 hours per week socializing in one way or another .
I have not had to work more than 50 hours per week during most weeks at any of my jobs , but I have friends that do have short periods where they work 80 hours / wk or more .
You should definitely ask about this during your interviews , since you do n’t want to be surprised by this .
Company / workgroup attitude is the most important factor in how much I succeeded in my work .
One major part of the attitude is trust : the managers / tech leads that trusted their engineers ( including newer ones ) to produce good work got it so much more than those that did not .
Similarly , the groups that recognized that their engineers are an investment , and put money toward training etc. , got higher quality work and probably more profit .
When you interview with an engineer , ask how long it was since the company paid for training .
The best job is not usually the best - paying job .
You need to factor in benefits as well as intangibles ( e.g. can I work from home ?
etc. ) and really think hard about it because it affects your happiness significantly .
What I did n’t expect to help me
Things that I did n’t think would matter so much but ended up driving a lot of my success :
Joined clubs outside of engineering - this helped me with my social skills a LOT and helped me become a better team member .
of engineering - this helped me with my social skills a LOT and helped me become a better team member .
Summer internship that forced me to use computing languages that I had not touched before : Perl , PHP , and other CL tools in a mostly command - line Linux environment - Going outside your comfort zone ended up being HUGE in my career because I realized how to pick up technologies and try to build something useful with them .
What I thought mattered and did n’t
GPA ? - nope , except that it will allow you to go to graduate school
General eduation classes ?
- do matter somewhat , because you have to be able to think like your diverse user base and this helps you put you in someone else ’s shoes .
Who you know ? - Yes !
I had no idea how much knowing someone from a company would really boost your chances of succeeding .
Summary :
Do these things to prepare yourself
Go download another OS like OpenSolaris or Ubuntu
Connect with others .
Go to your local JUG .
Join LinkedIn .
Make a good list of questions to ask potential employers
Take extra classes in technology
Apply for an internship , even if you do n’t get it or want it
Learn something outside of the required courses
Consider blogging and / or mentoring
I have compiled a random list of job links that I think are helpful .
Hope they are !
If you are a professional now , share what helped you or what you did n’t expect .
I ’ve only shared my views and yours would be extra helpful to those who need it !
This is Harry Reid 's statement in FISA :
" The Senate will soon vote on a FISA bill that represents the final result of negotiations among the White House and Democrats and Republicans in Congress .
I opposed the version originally passed by the Senate .
And although improvements have been made in the version now before us , this legislation continues to contain provisions that will lead to immunity for the telecommunications companies who cooperated with the Bush Administration 's illegal warrantless wiretapping program .
" For that reason , I will vote no .

WASHINGTON 
In a highly unusual admission of error , the Justice Department acknowledged on Wednesday that government lawyers should have known that Congress had recently made the rape of a child a capital offense in the military and should have informed the Supreme Court of that fact while the justices were considering whether death was a constitutional punishment for the crime .
“ It ’s true that the parties to the case missed it , but it ’s our responsibility , ” the department ’s public affairs office said in a statement .
“ We regret , ” the statement said , “ that the department did n’t catch the 2006 law when the case of Kennedy v. Louisiana was briefed . ”
In that case , decided June 25 by a vote of 5 to 4 , the court ruled that the Constitution prohibits the death penalty for the rape of a child .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ’s majority opinion was based in part on the conclusion that because child rape was a capital offense in only six states , and not under federal law , the death penalty for the crime did not meet the “ evolving standards of decency ” by which the court judges capital punishment .

Homeless
Voice says people who slept on the streets were offered accommodation in motels during APEC last year , but not so during World Youth Day .
ABC TV spoke to homeless man , Shane , who normally sleeps in the Domain car park .
" Since the Pope and that 's been in town , we 've had to relocate to this open park and if it rains we 're sort of buggered , " he said .
" We 've got no wind block . "

But WYD coordinator Bishop Anthony
Fisher says the soup kitchen offered in the city has had to be shifted to a neighbouring suburb , Woolloomooloo .
" I know some of them have moved in order to ensure the privacy of those homeless people so they 're not surrounded by pilgrims , so they can eat their soup in privacy , " he said .

Two of California 's biggest health insurers have agreed to collectively pay $ 13 million and reinstate more than 2,000 insurance policies to settle claims with the state that they illegally dropped policyholders from coverage .
Anthem Blue Cross will pay $ 10 million and reinstate coverage for 1,770 enrollees while Blue Shield of California will pay $ 3 million and reinstate coverage for 450 enrollees .
Both insurers will also reimburse policyholders for any outstanding medical debts that resulted from loss of insurance .
" This fine sends the message that if you come into California to sell health insurance , you must play by the rules , " said Cindy Ehnes , the director of the state 's Department of Managed Health Care .
Both companies denied any wrongdoing in rescission practices , the industry 's term for dropping patients from coverage when they try to make claims on their health insurance policies .
The settlements come two weeks after Ehnes told The Associated Press that the state failed to pursue a $ 1 million fine against Anthem Blue Cross because it was intimidated by the insurance company 's legal prowess .
Days later , the state vowed to seek penalties against Anthem Blue Cross that could have totaled $ 354 million .
Thursday 's announcements completed a two - year consumer protection push by the agency , said Ehnes .
In all , 3,770 dropped insurance policies have been restored through the effort to remediate rescission practices with the state 's five biggest insurers .
Anthem Blue Cross President Leslie Margolin issued a statement saying the state 's largest insurer was pleased to have reached agreement with the state .
" This resolution allows us to continue to build stronger working relationships with the DMHC and we look forward to coming together in a more collaborative way to address the health care needs of Californians , " said Margolin .
Last week ,
Ehnes warned that insurers who did not reach settlements would face stiffer penalties .
The agency has already reached similar agreements with Health Net of California , PacifiCare and Kaiser Permanente .
Blue Shield 's vice president of public affairs , Tom Epstein , noted that its settlement was a voluntary decision .
" We did not acknowledge that any of our practices were inappropriate , " he said in an interview .
In a statement , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger applauded both agreements , adding that " patients should not live in fear of unfairly losing their health care coverage when they need it most . "
Epstein said Blue Shield came to agreement because it recognizes that there 's a lack of direction from the state on rescission practices , and wants to put it behind them .
" We recognize that rescission of a health coverage agreement is a serious matter that has significant consequences for the people involved , " he said in a statement .
" We have treated these issues with the utmost care and have rescinded about one - tenth of 1 % of our individual health plan contracts since 2004 . "
Blue Shield could face another $ 2 million fine in 18 months if it does not simplify applications and be transparent with enrollees in the event that they are under investigation and risk losing their coverage , Ehnes said .
" We are certain to do those processes to avoid that fine , " Epstein said .
In 2007 , Anthem Blue Cross had more than 4.1 million enrollees in full service health plans in California , and Blue Shield of California had more than 2.6 million enrollees .

Starbucks ' new Orange Mango Banana Blend Vivanno
Smoothie is released today , and I got the chance to do an advanced tasting last week .
What I like about it is that it is sweet enough without being overly so .
The coffee - slingers have also opted to use fresh bananas ; there ’s actually a written procedure with respect to banana ripeness and peeling technique .
The juices come from Naked Juice .
The drink clocks in at 250 calories , 16 grams of protein , 5 grams of fiber and 2 grams of fat , and it ’s fairly priced at four bucks .
I think this might be a winner .
There 's also a Banana Chocolate Blend , but I 'd opt for the Orange Mango .
Food Geek Trivia :
Some have proposed that the paisley pattern is based on the shape of the mango .

" Sport is the only human institution based on idealism - it 's survived 33 centuries because of that .
If it was simply competition it would n't have lasted 33 weeks .
Anything which is not based on ethics cannot be called sport .
If it 's a corrupt environment , we can't invite our children into it .
" We must be jealous of that ideal if we 're going to bring them into it and every time we see anyone breaking that ethic we 've got to jump on them .
Otherwise we lose the precious jewel that we hand to the next generation . "
Wise words , noble sentiments , and the fact they were published 16 years ago reflects just how poorly they were heeded at the time .
Now , however , with Dwain Chambers ' remarkable ride finally over , it is perhaps time to reflect on what Olympic sport really means , or more accurately , what it should mean .
That quote comes from Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings ' famous polemic , " The Lords of the Rings : Power , Money and Drugs in the Modern Olympics " , and they belong to former athletics coach and BBC presenter , the late Ron Pickering .
It was also 16 years ago , during another Olympic year , that the British Olympic Association ( BOA ) added by - law 25 to its statute book .
Incensed by what he saw as elite sport 's credibility ebbing away with each new doping scandal , BOA chairman Sir Arthur Gold decided to put Great Britain on a lofty moral pedestal .
From that moment forth , all British drugs cheats would be banned from ever representing their country again at an Olympics .
And so they remain ... but only just .
When Gold took that principled stance he hoped Britain would be setting an example the rest of the world would want to follow .
He was wrong - and has n't sport suffered as a result .
While Rome has burned , too many of sport 's numerous Neros have fiddled .
When Chambers took his case for inclusion in Team GB at Beijing to the High Court on Thursday , he went armed with the fact that if he came from any other country other than here or China he would already be clutching his Olympic kit and credentials .
Nowhere else has matched the Gold standard .
International sport 's supposed moral guardians - the various associations , committees and federations - have not been much better either .
So while Chambers stays at home this summer , with only that long walk to the sunset to contemplate , American sprinter Torri Edwards , Greek star Katerina Thanou and who knows how many other drugs cheats from other nations can look forward to a fortnight in the limelight .
Recent months have seen his case take on a staggering amount of emotional baggage .
To some he has become athletics ' answer to Mike Tyson , the baddest man in the planet : to others he has become an unlikely hero , the victim of prejudice .
He is neither .
As his ex-coach John Regis told the BBC after Mr Justice Mackay 's ruling was announced , Chambers is a nice guy who made a very bad choice .
But he also said cheats cannot prosper .
It was a sentiment repeated by the next two athletes contacted by the BBC , ex-swimmer Sharron Davies and Chambers ' old team - mate Iwan Thomas .
Both expressed sympathy for the 30 - year - old Londoner , who has won over a large section of the British public in recent months with his now legitimate performances on the track and affable nature off it , but said the judge 's call was correct .
For me , this was always a very , very difficult call to make .
On the one side I could see a sport in danger of becoming as credible as pantomime wrestling .
And on the other I could see a young man being punished without any chance of rehabilitation , and demonised beyond all proportion to his crime .
But it is the first view that has become more relevant , more pressing , as time has passed .
And while that is unfortunate for Chambers , it is essential for athletics and sport in general .
Quite simply , the sport Chambers initially returned to from his two - year suspension in 2005 is not the same sport he attempted to pick up again this year .
The seismic shocks caused by events in the US - events which have left the sport there teetering on the brink of Wrestlemania - have changed the landscape everywhere .
The irony is that from purely legal point of view , Chambers should probably be going to the Olympics .
It is clear from the early accounts of what happened in Court 76 that the ruling went against Chambers for two significant reasons : one , judges ' long - standing reluctance to get involved in the parish problems of organised sport , and two , the late notice of this challenge .
The BOA played a canny game last week in persuading the court there was no time for a proper review of the by - law 's legality .
By postponing that review to a date which will now presumably remain forever in the future , Chambers could only ask for an injunction , which is , in effect , an emergency exemption .
But where was that sense of emergency ?
Chambers became ineligible from ever competing at an Olympics for Britain again the moment his positive drugs test was confirmed in 2003 .
There has been ample opportunity for a proper challenge in the five years since .
But by waiting until the week before Team GB must be finalised , Chambers ' case looked like a piece of legal sleight of hand , and Mackay clearly did not want to be used in that fashion .
There is also the question of strategy .
Chambers ' lawyers argued the by - law was a restraint of trade .
That is a difficult charge to make stick when the Olympics are supposed to be about glory , not money .
No , the best argument Chambers had was the double jeopardy implications of the BOA 's hard - line stance .
He had already served the penalty his sport deemed sufficient for his offence , the British by - law was a cruel and unusual sanction that punished him twice .
This is the potential flaw in the BOA 's position that former World Anti-Doping Agency boss Dick Pound identified earlier this year .
If any good can come from this saga it is that the rights and wrongs of the by - law have been aired in public , athletes have been asked to examine their consciences and the moral centre has held .
But most of all , perhaps now the torch Gold lit in 1992 can be picked up by the rest of the world .
It is fitting that the only country to do so already , China , is hosting this summer 's Games .
Olympic hosts should be held to a higher standard , they , after all , set the tone .
Let 's hope that when the world gathers in London in four years ' time it will be a standard shared by everybody .
That ordinance was one of five signed by Nutter in April .
In addition to establishing criminal penalties for those who fail to contact police within 24 hours of discovering their firearms missing , the laws also establish definitions and penalties for assault weapons , limit handgun purchases to one a month , and restrict gun ownership from unstable individuals or those subject to an order of protection .
The IDF dismissed Friday evening earlier reports claiming that Air Force jets have been training in Iraq ahead of a possible strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities .
The IDF Spokesperson 's Office said the Iraqi reports were " unfounded . "
According to the reports , sources in the Iraqi Defense Ministry told a local news network Friday that Israeli fighter jets have been flying over Iraqi territory for over a month in preparation for potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities , adding that the aircraft have been landing in American bases following the overflights .
Nuclear Threat Israeli source : IAF drill a ' dress rehearsal ' for attack on Iran Ynet Political official , described as familiar with military exercise held earlier this month , tells The Times ' Iranians should read the script before they continue with their program for nuclear weapons '
Israeli source : IAF drill a ' dress rehearsal ' for attack on Iran
Word of Israel 's alleged Air Force maneuvers in Iraq has reached Iran .
The sources said the US has boosted security in and around the bases used by Israel during the exercises .
According to the Defense Ministry officials , retired Iraqi army officers in the Al Anbar district reported that fighter jets have been regularly entering Iraqi airspace from Jordan and landing at the airport near Haditha .
The sources estimated that should the Israeli jets take off from the American bases it would take them no more than five minutes to reach Iran 's nuclear reactor in Bushehr .
American officials said recently that more than 100 Israeli F - 16 and F - 15 fighters took part in maneuvers over the eastern Mediterranean and Greece in the first week of June , apparently a rehearsal for a potential bombing of Iran 's nuclear facilities .
I am sure many of you have heard about the NSA spy scandal where the NSA along with the major ISP ’s of the country have been secretly recording our digital lives .
One must know that AT&T customers are n’t the only ones apparently being tapped .
“ Transit ” traffic originating with one ISP and destined for another is also being sniffed if it crosses AT&T ’s network .
Ironically , because the taps are installed at the point at which that network connects to the rest of the world , the safest web surfers are AT&T subscribers visiting websites hosted on AT&T ’s network .
Their traffic does n’t pass through the splitters .
With that in mind , here ’s the 27B Stroke 6 guide to detecting if your traffic is being funneled into the secret room on San Francisco ’s Folsom street .
If you ’re a Windows user , fire up an MS - DOS command prompt .
Now type tracert followed by the domain name of the website , e-mail host , VoIP switch , or whatever destination you ’re interested in .
Watch as the program spits out your route , line by line .
You are looking for traffic that is jumping from Level 3 Communications to AT&T ’s network in San Francisco , presumably over the OC - 48 circuit that AT&T tapped on February 20th , 2003 , according to the Klein docs .
In the above example , mine is not routed that way .
The magic string you ’re looking for is sffca.ip.att. net .
If it ’s present immediately above or below a non - att .
net entry , then — by Klein ’s allegations — your packets are being copied into room 641A , and from there , to the NSA .
Of course , if Marcus , the AT&T whistleblower is correct and AT&T has installed these secret rooms all around the country , then any att .
net entry in your route is a bad sign .
With oil selling for more than $ 130 a barrel in the commodity markets and no end in sight to high gasoline prices , Mr. Bush , a former oilman from Texas who came into office vowing to address an impending energy shortage , does not want to end his presidency in the midst of an energy crisis .
No one knows for certain how much oil is in the moratorium area .
The federal Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 75 billion barrels of oil in the United States may be found in all areas of the country that are now off limits for development , and that 21 percent of this oil  or about 16 billion barrels  is covered by the offshore moratorium .
Mr. Bush ’s new stance on offshore drilling will inject him squarely into the presidential campaign , by putting the full weight of the White House behind Mr. McCain at a time when the candidate is trying to demonstrate presidential stature .
But it will also expose Mr. McCain to accusations from Democrats that a McCain presidency would be akin to a Bush third term .
At the same time , the move will put the onus on Democrats , many of whom have long been staunchly opposed to offshore drilling .
And it is likely to exacerbate the 30 - year - old standoff in Washington over whether domestic drilling or conservation is the way to end American dependence on foreign oil .
That debate has grown especially acute in recent weeks , with the White House in “ I told you so ” mode .
In a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce last week , Vice President Dick Cheney said , “ We should hear no more complaining ” from opponents of domestic drilling , whom he called “ part of the problem . ”
Senator Reid responded by calling the vice president “ Oil Man Cheney , ” saying : “ So all that Cheney can talk about , the Oil Man Cheney can talk about , is drilling , drilling , drilling .
But there is not enough oil in America to make that the salvation to our problems . ”
After hearing of Mr. Bush ’s proposal on Tuesday night , Mr. Reid affirmed his opposition , saying , “ The Energy Information Administration says that even if we open the coasts to oil drilling that wo n’t have a significant impact on prices . ”
Colombian - French former presidencial candidate Ingrid Betancourt , left , hugs Colombian General Commander Mario Montoya , right , upon her arrival in Bogota , Colombia , after being held hostage by FARC guerrillas .
Guillermo Legaria / epa/Corbis
Last week 's dramatic rescue of 15 hostages held by the guerrilla organization FARC was the result of months of intricate deception on the part of the Colombian government .
At the center was a classic man - in - the - middle attack .
In a man - in - the - middle attack , the attacker inserts himself between two communicating parties .
Both believe they 're talking to each other , and the attacker can delete or modify the communications at will .
The Wall Street Journal reported how this gambit played out in Colombia : " The plan had a chance of working because , for months , in an operation one army officer likened to a ' broken telephone , ' military intelligence had been able to convince Ms. Betancourt 's captor , Gerardo Aguilar , a guerrilla known as ' Cesar , ' that he was communicating with his top bosses in the guerrillas ' seven - man secretariat .
Army intelligence convinced top guerrilla leaders that they were talking to Cesar .
In reality , both were talking to army intelligence . "
This ploy worked because Cesar and his guerrilla bosses did n't know one another well .
They did n't recognize one anothers ' voices , and did n't have a friendship or shared history that could have tipped them off about the ruse .
Man - in - the - middle is defeated by context , and the FARC guerrillas did n't have any .
And that 's why man - in - the - middle , abbreviated MITM in the computer - security community , is such a problem online : Internet communication is often stripped of any context .
There 's no way to recognize someone 's face .
There 's no way to recognize someone 's voice .
When you receive an e-mail purporting to come from a person or organization , you have no idea who actually sent it .
When you visit a website , you have no idea if you 're really visiting that website .
We all like to pretend that we know who we 're communicating with – and for the most part , of course , there is n't any attacker inserting himself into our communications – but in reality , we do n't .
And there are lots of hacker tools that exploit this unjustified trust , and implement MITM attacks .
Even with context , it 's still possible for MITM to fool both sides – because electronic communications are often intermittent .
Imagine that one of the FARC guerrillas became suspicious about who he was talking to .
So he asks a question about their shared history as a test : " What did we have for dinner that time last year ? " or something like that .
On the telephone , the attacker would n't be able to answer quickly , so his ruse would be discovered .
But e-mail conversation is n't synchronous .
The attacker could simply pass that question through to the other end of the communications , and when he got the answer back , he would be able to reply .
This is the way MITM attacks work against web - based financial systems .
A bank demands authentication from the user : a password , a one - time code from a token or whatever .
The attacker sitting in the middle receives the request from the bank and passes it to the user .
The user responds to the attacker , who passes that response to the bank .
Now the bank assumes it is talking to the legitimate user , and the attacker is free to send transactions directly to the bank .
This kind of attack completely bypasses any two - factor authentication mechanisms , and is becoming a more popular identity - theft tactic .
There are cryptographic solutions to MITM attacks , and there are secure web protocols that implement them .
Many of them require shared secrets , though , making them useful only in situations where people already know and trust one another .
The NSA - designed STU - III and STE secure telephones solve the MITM problem by embedding the identity of each phone together with its key .
( The NSA creates all keys and is trusted by everyone , so this works . )
When two phones talk to each other securely , they exchange keys and display the other phone 's identity on a screen .
Because the phone is in a secure location , the user now knows who he is talking to , and if the phone displays another organization – as it would if there were a MITM attack in progress – he should hang up .
Zfone , a secure VoIP system , protects against MITM attacks with a short authentication string .
After two Zfone terminals exchange keys , both computers display a four - character string .
The users are supposed to manually verify that both strings are the same – " my screen says 5C19 ; what does yours say ? " – to ensure that the phones are communicating directly with each other and not with an MITM .
The AT&T TSD - 3600 worked similarly .
This sort of protection is embedded in SSL , although no one uses it .
As it is normally used , SSL provides an encrypted communications link to whoever is at the other end : bank and phishing site alike .
And the better phishing sites create valid SSL connections , so as to more effectively fool users .
But if the user wanted to , he could manually check the SSL certificate to see if it was issued to " National Bank of Trustworthiness " or " Two Guys With a Computer in Nigeria . "
No one does , though , because you have to both remember and be willing to do the work .
( The browsers could make this easier if they wanted to , but they do n’t seem to want to . )
In the real world , you can easily tell a branch of your bank from a money changer on a street corner .
But on the internet , a phishing site can be easily made to look like your bank 's legitimate website .
Any method of telling the two apart takes work .
And that 's the first step to fooling you with a MITM attack .
Man - in - the - middle is n't new , and it does n't have to be technological .
But the internet makes the attacks easier and more powerful , and that 's not going to change anytime soon .

Why Do We Accept Signatures by Fax ?
First , to call a terrorist a “ jihadist ” or “ jihadi ” effectively puts any campaign against terrorism into the framework of an existential battle between the West and Islam .
This feeds into the worldview propagated by Al Qaeda .
It also serves to isolate the tens of millions of Muslims who condemn the violence that has been perpetrated in the name of Islam .
Second , these words locate the ideological battle exactly where the extremists want it to be .
The terms of discussion are no longer about the murder of innocents in terrorist acts ; they are about theology .
Third , when American leaders use this language it sends a confusing message to the Muslim world , showing ignorance on basic issues and possibly even raising doubts about American motives .
Why , after all , would we call our enemy a “ holy warrior ” ?
If we want to say what we mean , what terms better describe Qaeda members and other violent extremists ?
“ Muharib ” or the more colloquial “ hirabi ” or “ hirabist ” would be good places to start .
“ Hirabah , ” the base word , is a term for barbarism or piracy .
Unlike “ jihad , ” which grants honor , “ hirabah ” brings condemnation ; it involves unlawful violence and disorder .
There are no covert U.S. military operations looking for Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and the government will not allow any " foreign intrusion " on its soil to search for him , a senior government minister says .
" There are none , " Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told the Associated Press in an interview .
" It will create such an anti-U.S. feeling in Pakistan that I would say would mar the atmosphere of co-operation that exists between us . "
He said the country 's new government has also ruled out allowing any foreign operations inside the country to catch militants .
" Our government 's policy is that our troops , paramilitary forces and our regular forces are deployed in sufficient numbers .
They are capable of taking action there .
And any foreign intrusion would be counterproductive , " he said Saturday .
" People will not accept it .
Questions of sovereignty come in . "
Bin Laden is believed to be hiding somewhere along the Afghan - Pakistan border region .
He said he did n't think bin Laden was in Pakistan .
" I 'm not sure .
Nobody 's aware of that .
Nobody can speak with certainty , " Qureshi said .
" But our policy 's very clear .
We are allies in this war .
And if Pakistan has actionable information vis-a - vis Osama bin Laden or any other high value target , Pakistan will immediately take action . "
But the U.S. has used remotely piloted drones to launch a number of attacks on targets in Afghanistan and along its rugged border with Pakistan .
The new civilian government has been negotiating with tribal elders to secure peace with militants along the Afghan border in hopes of curbing a surge in violence .
It is a step back from what were considered the heavy - handed tactics pursued by the previous government led by supporters of President Pervez Musharraf .
Qureshi described Pakistan 's counterterrorism as a " grassroots " approach .
" Our strategy is that the military option alone is not enough , " he said .
" This war has to be fought besides the armies , with the help of the people , by winning hearts and minds . "
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A man tore the head from a controversial waxwork figure of Adolf Hitler on the opening day of Berlin ’s Madame Tussauds museum on Saturday , police said .
Just minutes after the museum opened , the 41 - year - old German man pushed aside two security men guarding the exhibit .
“ Then he went over to the figure and ripped off the head , ” a police spokesman said .
The man tore off the head in protest at the exhibit , the spokesman added .
The police were alerted and arrested the man , who did not resist .
He was later released though he remained under investigation for assault and damaging property .
The waxwork figure of a glum - looking Adolf Hitler in a mock bunker during the last days of his life was criticized as being in bad taste .
A media preview of the new branch of Madame Tussauds on Thursday was overshadowed by a row over the exhibit .
Critics said it was inappropriate to display the Nazi dictator , who started World War Two and ordered the extermination of Europe ’s Jews , in a museum alongside celebrities , pop stars , world statesmen and sporting heroes .
Dressed in a grey suit , the figure of Hitler gazed downwards with a despondent stare , his arm outstretched on a large wooden table with a map of Europe on the wall of his gloomy bunker .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
About 25 workers spent about four months on the waxwork , using more than 2,000 pictures and pieces of archive material and also guided by a model of the “ Fuehrer ” in the London branch of Madame Tussauds where it is standing upright .
It is illegal in Germany to show Nazi symbols and art glorifying Hitler and the exhibit was cordoned off to stop visitors posing with him .
Unobtrusive signs asked visitors to refrain from taking photos or posing with Hitler “ out of respect for the millions of people who died during World War Two ” .
Camera surveillance and museum officials were meant to stop inappropriate behavior .
Institutions such as the foundation for Germany ’s central Holocaust memorial site condemned the idea of the exhibit as tasteless , saying it had been included to generate business .
The wax figure is the latest in a gradual breaking down of taboos about Hitler in Germany more than 60 years after the end of the war and the Holocaust in which some six million Jews were killed .
The 2004 film “ Downfall ” provoked controversy as it portrayed the leader in a human light during the last days of his life and last year a satire about Hitler by Swiss - born Jewish director Dani Levy was released in Germany .
well would you look at that .

Few seem to remember that Wall Street is not a non-profit community driven by altruism or any sense of service .
They would gladly cheat you out of your entire life savings if their actions were legal , or at least not prosecuted .
In the last two to three years , the lies , deception , misdirection , false reporting , corruption , and grand fraud will be the topic of historical accounts for decades .
When returning on my flights from another successful Cambridge House gold conference , this in Calgary Alberta , many thoughts came to mind , jotted down while gazing at the natural beauty made up from cloud blankets with a sun guarding its lot .
The sun and clouds care not at all about economic landscapes underneath , even if in turmoil .
Whenever travels take me across national borders , nationalism , idealism , culture , and dreams come to mind .
It seems pursuit of truth , clarity , and integrity has become negotiable , one and all in the United States .
Its people are being stripped of so much .
Perhaps this layout will be helpful .
Routinely such matters are covered in the Hat Trick Letter reports .
Gold & silver continue to do well to protect individuals and their wealth .
Banks are no longer safe , an astonishing conclusion .
Bonds are not safe , and neither are money market funds !!!
USGOVT ECONOMIC STATISTICS
It all starts with outright doctoring on a chronic basis by the USGovt , to the point that the vast majority understands and accepts the practice .
Therein lies the foundation for the system extending the institutionalized dishonesty of the nation , carried further by Wall Street as it endorses the doctored statistics routinely .
The fish rots from the head down , Wall Street being the blood system , the economy the torso .
Put your full faith in accurate economic statistical gathering with the Shadow Govt Statistics crew led by John Williams .
No , not the man of Boston Pops musical fame , the other guy .
The Gross Domestic Product has been running negative in growth except for a couple quarters five or six years ago , now about minus 2.3 % or so .
The Consumer Price Index has been accelerating lately , now at 11.8 % and still climbing .
People do eat food , and people do require energy , so please no need to remove them from calculations .
The unemployment rate has been also rising lately , now at 9.8 % or so .
If out of work , then unemployed , that simple , so no need to talk about participation or discouraged workers by the goofy methods in the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The Birth - Death Model is another colossal fraud .
Good thing few know what it is .
The lies can choke a horse .
Motive is clear , to present a picture of strength to sell stocks and government bonds .
If the real CPI was widely known to be over 10 % , both USTreasurys would suffer declines and gold would be pushed to the heavens .
USDOLLAR REBOUNDING � NOT !!!
The USDollar has been trying to rebound for a month .
Past USDollar charts offered in my analysis have entirely focused upon weekly charts .
The daily chart over just the past six months is highly revealing .
In the last two months , the 20 - day moving average has served as stiff upside resistance .
The stochastix show difficulty in staying above the 50 midline , a sign of weakness in the rebound attempt .
With growing federal deficits , widening trade deficits , an underwater banking capital core , and rising homeowner negative equity , the US financial fundamentals resemble a banana republic on four primary pillars , unworthy of any currency rebound .
The pair of 20 - day and 50 - day moving averages are still declining .
Look for a breakdown to 70 and below in the next several weeks .
The downtrend is stronger than any newly formed basis for a bottom bounce .
The impact on gold will be to send it over the 1000 level again , this time as floor support for the summer advances .
The next USFed rate cut could be the impetus .
A game of chicken is being played by the Euro Central Bank , which refused to cut rates since last summer .
OIL PRICE WILL FALL AS USECONOMY SLOWS
Nice thought , but the US is not the engine of global growth anymore .
Asia and the Middle East are the wealth centers , where trade surpluses accumulate .
Whatever slack in US demand , Asian demand will grab it .
Besides , incremental growth in Brazil , Russia , India , and China ( the BRIC nations ) is associated on a decreasing level with their exports to the US .
The crude oil price is surely determined by equilibrium in supply & demand , however , the entire curves are altered by the falling USDollar .
Wall Street cannot seem to admit in its mouthpieces that the USDollar will keep the crude oil price high , and demand from growing emerging economies will prevent much of any price drop from a weaker USEconomy .
The entire claim smacks of US arrogance .
With the crude oil price hitting $ 114 per barrel , will Wall Street firms drop their 2008 call for relaxation back to the 80 - 90 level ?
Doubtful .
Sponsored ( ordered ? ) attacks of hedge funds with cutbacks in credit and margin calls did nothing to bring down the crude oil price .
US BANKS HAVE SEEN THE WORST NEWS
This is not even close to being true , addressed in a previous recent article .
Housing prices are accelerating down , driven by some degree of capitulation on price .
The high level of inventory continues to be aggravated by more home foreclosures .
Anecdotal evidence supports this , as February prices were a quantum level lower .
Hired home processors working on the behalf of bankers and lenders simply gave up .
They want to move inventory , period .
Again , the point must be repeated until it happens .
The Exploding ARMs , the prime adjustable rate mortgages with negative amortization option features , they will begin failing this summer as they reset .
When the rising loan limit is hit , the monthly payment doubles or triples !
The phenomenon of walking away from mortgages has worsened lately .
US banks will suffer wave after wave of losses .
The new US Federal Reserve lending facilities are a certain help , but not a cure .
The banks are suffering from colossal strain in negative capital core , a situation growing worse by the month .
Their capital has melted down completely .
Their status will eventually become worse than Japan �s from 1990 .
CONTAINMENT OF SUBPRIME
This was the wrong deceitful refrain last autumn .
My analysis refuted it steadily , calling the problem one of absolute bond contagion .
The totality of spread risk to the entire global banking system is now finally recognized .
The subprime infection has spread to asset backed commercial paper , to prime mortgages , to commercial mortgages , to municipal bonds , to car loans , and to credit card loans .
European , English , and Asian banks are all affected .
Perhaps the so - called experts were simply wrong in their claim of containment , but doubtful .
Most likely they were a combination of liars and incompetents .
NO SPILLOVER TO OVERALL ECONOMY
This is an ongoing refrain , another cartload of bull cookies .
Since the claimed economic expansion began in 2002 , the boast was that the financial sector lifted the entire USEconomy .
But now , with strain , pain , and no gain on the financial side , we are told to believe no spillover .
When is there EVER no spillover from financial to economic ?
Never !
The connection is obvious , as companies , households , and individuals are increasingly frustrated with blocked loans .
Approval of loans is a major challenge .
Reduced economic activity is the immediate result .
The fact that negative GDP statistics have not been registered yet , only means not yet .
Besides , there is an integrated 4 % to 5 % lie in the GDP anyway .
A negative official GDP means a 5 % recession , which is horrific .
TURNAROUND IN SECOND HALF
Once more , we hear this desperate refrain .
When it hits my ears , it hurts them .
This is the most desperate of claims , used recently by USFed Chairman Bernanke .
It is also used by Wall Street firms .
The USEconomy is at the tipping point , almost negative on even the official GDP .
The US corporate profitability is also at the tipping point , almost negative after losing its growth .
The second half of the year is far enough away , that it is not within quick reach .
The second half of the year is far enough away , that if the turnaround fails , most people will forget .
This is a standard con , woven in desperation .
The words � Second Half � should evoke laughter , nay , guffaws .
LIMITS ON MORTGAGE RELATED LOSSES
Last late summer , Bernanke spoke publicly about an estimated $ 200 billion in total mortgage portfolio and bond losses .
My estimate was $ 2000 billion , as in $ 2 trillion .
Any such similar estimate of this magnitude by a person in a prominent position would have evoked fear and trembling .
So the ratcheted estimate technique has been deployed .
The estimates now have finally reached $ 1000 billion , from more than two or three corners .
With the next prime Option ARM wave of failures , the estimates will move toward $ 2 trillion .
Again , the purpose of Wall Street and USFed pronouncements is not accuracy , but control of the people so as to avert panic .
Boil the frogs slowly .
USFED ROLE : STABLE EMPLOYMENT , MINIMAL INFLATION
This is a tragedy .
The USFed in my view operates as the Dept of Inflation , accountable to nobody , certainly not their employer , the US Congress , which uses them as contactor .
The USFed attempts the unattainable , to control inflation when they unleash it , or permit it .
Their task is akin to herding cats .
They in no way regulate credit growth , since they encourage it actively .
The inflation directive is an absolute heresy , since inflation is the USFed �s raison d��tre , their reason for being .
Maybe minimized perceived price inflation , or officially stated price inflation , those are their purposes .
They manage the inflation machinery , an unmanageable task .
They unleash the monster , and apologize periodically for failure to control that monster .
They mop up their own messes , but are regarded as saviors .
They are looked upon to save the system , after they contributed principally to the destruction of the system .
As for employment , the tragic outcome of inflation is lost jobs on a massive scale .
Chronic inflation lifted US wages to an uncompetitive level .
Failed banking systems and lending apparatus is killing jobs by the millions .
The entire US Federal Reserve is a failed institution .
It seeks greater powers after ruining the national financial structure !!!
GLOBALIZATION KEEPS THE US STRONG
After four decades of chronic inflation , the US was extraordinarily vulnerable to competition from Asia .
In the 1980 decade , immediately after the near death experience of mighty Intel Corp , the dispatch and abandonment of US manufacturing began .
Japan and the Pacific Rim began a long expansion that continues to today .
In the 2000 decade , the refrain was to pursue low cost solutions .
How is that working out ?
A disaster for the US , as China has morphed from a partner to an adversary , precisely as my analysis forecasted in 2004 and 2005 articles .
Trade friction is still an issue .
Globalization was critically important to maintain profitability of US multi-national corporations .
In that respect , globalization keeps the US strong .
As it applies to US workers , globalization is a wrecking ball , destroying jobs , destroying livelihood , undermining families , ruining dreams , gutting the US middle class , producing poverty in its wake .
The entire Globalization movement has been described by some as a rather global socialist concept , in pursuit of a global level field .
BANKS RESUPPLYING WITH FRESH CAPITAL
Insolvent US banks are not bringing in new capital .
They are selling bank capital in return for desperately needed cash .
They sell stock and bonds .
Their core assets have eroded so badly from failed mortgage related losses , that they must sell equity capital and securitized debt so as to resupply their core with cash .
The challenge for US banks is to dilute themselves with additional equity , as they bring in new cash , which brings down their stock prices .
Some recent actions by smaller lending institutions was to double their stock share count , a 50 % immediate dilution .
Without this radical dilution , their insolvent state will lead to difficulties , like running out of cash liquidity .
At that time , they must declare bankruptcy .
BEAR STEARNS WAS BAILED OUT , HUH ?
If so , they why are they dead ?
Why are half of their employees losing jobs ?
Why are their employees losing life savings ?
Why was its office building set for a fire sale ?
No , Bear Stearns was raided , its assets taken by its main creditor , JPMorgan .
This was a clear case of JPMorgan being bailed out by the USFed , in order for its credit derivatives not to blow up .
JPM cut off Bear Stearns on credit , and killed them with the blessing of the USFed and credit extended by the USFed .
They averted a blowup of JPM that would have been an order of magnitude more disastrous than the LongTerm Capital Mgmt fiasco of 1998 .
In fact , the story is worse .
By endorsing the raid , the USFed has given a green light for any bank or investment bank to raid any competitor or client that does NOT have access to USFed lending facilities .
Some call it Fed Len ding Arbitrage .
We are therefore witnessing an ugly extension to the Mussolini Fascist Business Model toward a consolidation phase of mega bankers .
If a competitor or client threatens a big banking institution , conspire with the USFed , deny it credit , raid its assets , and kill them .
This is street fighting in three pieced suits .
CONSUMPTION IS BACKBONE OF US STRENGTH
This lie is being laid bare nowadays .
The USEconomy does not save , but rather spends .
Now with difficulty spending , since credit is tight , the system is grinding in a horrible slowdown .
What happens to spenders when their inflated assets start to deflate ?
They declare bankruptcy .
They suffer the indignity of home foreclosure .
They lose their jobs .
They move into homes of their parents .
They might even move into tent cities .
Try a Google Search of � Tent Cities in the US � for a shock .
Ontario California is the biggest one in the United States .
They will spring up in most major US cities before long .
No , consumption breeds poverty , not prosperity .
The process went so far as to encourage conversions of home equity into spendable cash .
People burned their furniture , to fund their lifestyles .
Now almost 10 % of US households have negative equity , with more owed on loans than their homes are worth .
Consumption fails the system on the macro economic level , and on the micro household level .
WALL STREET AS ENGINE OF CAPITALISM
The last few years should teach any open - minded person that Wall Street exploits the system , rather than invigorates the system .
Wall Street firms do not simply act as agents to bring capital to expanding young enterprising firms .
Wall Street firms also act as agents to defraud large institutions where huge pools of savings used to accumulate .
Wall Street firms actively targeted those firms , for the sale of subprime mortgage bonds .
The more accurate description is that Wall Street has been an active agent in the inflation game , enabling debt to be sold in the financial markets , whether corporate or government in origin .
Wall Street has controlled a monopoly in gathering magnificent fees as it enabled growing companies to pursue additional necessary capital .
But also , Wall Street used its position to conduct the largest fraud ever perpetrated by US financial institutions in modern history .
In doing so , Wall Street proved not only they are parasites to the system , but protected criminals .
They essentially killed the US banking system , by infecting it with toxic assets that to this day continue to choke many processes .
Time will tell if they also killed the USEconomy .
My forecast is for the longest recession in US modern history , as the housing market endures another two years of decline .
TREASURY INVESTMENT PROTECTION SECURITIES
These so - called TIPS don�t protect against much of anything , most of all price inflation .
If they counter the corrupted CPI index that supposedly measures price inflation , then they too are corrupted .
Could the TIPS actually sport a negative yield these days ?
Ooops , exposed !
THE TRAP OF EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS The Exchange Traded Fund concept is simple .
The application is not , especially when criminal motive is executed , protected by USGovt regulators and Wall Street bankers .
Any ETFund managed by a US firm or London firm should be regarded as fraudulent unless proven otherwise .
To me , it is beyond disbelief , moving toward shock , that the gold community has not attacked the StreetTracks GLD fun for its fraudulent operations .
They fail to comply with their own prospectus .
They fail to comply with disclosure .
They have successfully diverted plentiful physical demand into a fund managed by JPMorgan .
Gold believers have been duped .
Every day , one can read of some respected analysts who endorse this ETFund vehicle , despite its fraud .
Where is the thought process ?
If the mafia opens up a neighborhood savings & loan after city - wide thefts , then one should harbor suspicion .
The Barclays ETFund for silver , named SLV , is another fraud .
Jim Turk of GoldMoney has revealed its highly questionable behavior .
Both GLD and SLV have probably been using their gold and silver bullion to short gold and silver for a few years .
These vehicles keep down the price of gold & silver , or at least neutralize money invested in them in terms of the metal prices .
The precious metals community has been hoodwinked , still happening sadly .
The gold community does a great job in researching and scrutinizing the track record , competence , and integrity of management when examining a stock for a mining firm , but not for ETFunds like GLD and SLV .
Very strange and inconsistent usage of gray matter in my opinion .
The Hat Trick Letter provides a special report on this controversial topic in February , with past coverage in the April 2007 report last year .
GOLDMAN SACHS & THEIR 2008 GOLD CALL
In November 2007 , when gold was between 710 and 730 , Goldman Sachs released a research paper that gold would endure the 2008 year marked by the gold price being flat or down .
The report brought laughter to my desk .
My immediate thought was that GSax had put a big long position on gold , expecting a big price upward move .
In fact , in the previous few months , GSax had covered their entire short gold position on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange ( TOCOM ) .
That is about as bullish a change as possible .
Yet the US press announced the GSax negative gold opinion without much minimal research .
Gold promptly shot over 800 in early January , and then jetted over 1000 .
It is consolidating in the lower 900 levels lately .
How was that GSax call after all ?
Not only lousy , but motivated to deceive in my opinion .
GSux has a long history of such intentionally deceptive but useful calls .
They are not a non -profit firm .
They are never held liable for lies .
They are agents for the Dept of Treasury .
They are accused of front running many USGovt sanctioned market rescues ordered by the Working Group for Financial Markets ( aka the Plunge Protection Team ) .
They are above the law .
IMF & SWISS GOLD SALES
In summer 2007 , the Swiss National Bank announced they would sell 250 tonnes of gold bullion .
The gold community shrieked .
That much supply hitting the market would surely send the gold price into a plummet .
Not so !
The Swiss did not sell that much .
In fact , it is unclear they have that much gold to sell at all .
The mere announcement was actually bullish for gold , a sign of central bank desperation .
Why talk about selling if they could actually sell ?
In the last couple months , a similar situation has arisen .
The Intl Monetary Fund has announced another huge gold bullion sale .
They are under budget strain , in need to raise cash to maintain operations .
The gold community shrieked !
That much supply hitting the market would surely send the gold price into a plummet .
Not so !
The IMF was doing the European Central Bank�s bidding .
Since member ECB banks have run low on available gold bullion to dump on the market , the IMF ran the story .
Again , this is desperation .
Since the Swiss made their announcement on gold sales , the gold price has risen over 30 % .
These groups see a $ 1500 gold price coming , and a global gold bull market gaining momentum , acceptance , and publicity .
They are running scared .
WARREN BUFFETT & HIS SILVER FUMBLE
This title could also be �GOLD EARNS NO YIELD � instead .
But my choice is to highlight the deception of popular Warren Buffett , who with 90 % likelihood lied through his teeth two years ago .
A common deception theme circulated by the lapdog press is that gold metal investment earns no yield , no income , a virtual dead asset .
How are debt securities doing these days , the ones that offer 5 % to 8 % in yields ?
The lesson with mortgage related assets is that yield matters little when principal suffers big losses in value .
Exactly .
That is why gold is a good investment , up in value considerably in the last few years .
The Buffett story on his silver fumble involved an important story within the story .
No deep inclusion of his relationship with Hank Greenberg of AIG will be provided .
Greenberg found himself in trouble , but has influential connections .
Hank and Warren are close friends .
What follows is my conjecture , knowing the potential and knowing the extremely likely learning curve extended from Hank to Warren .
AIG is part of the gold cartel , which keeps the gold price down by usage of the illicit gold futures contract game .
Buffett owned in Berkshire Hathaway 129 million ounces of silver , bought under $ 4 per ounce a long time ago .
He boasted of the smart buy .
It did not just sit idly .
He earned a yield off the metal position by selling forward contract options .
This is no different from selling option calls on forward contracts for Cisco Systems or General Electric .
The practice earns a yield , an income stream , sometimes hefty .
The risk is that the price moves up too fast , and the holder of the options ( other guy ) exercises the right of taking your stock , or in Buffett�s case the silver bullion , at the option contract price .
My guess is Buffett sold option calls at a $ 7 price when silver was selling at a $ 5 price .
The silver price moved up rapidly , to his surprise .
That left him with two choices .
He could buy back the contracts , his sold options calls , at a big loss .
Or he could permit the option contract holder to call away his position , selling to that party for the contracted $ 7 price .
The first choice would mean announcement of a loss to Berkshire Hathaway holders , who would naively expect a profit from silver going from $ 4 to $ 9 .
An open admission like that would have exposed Buffett to criticism for mismanaging a silver position , but more importantly , for bringing attention to how silver metal DOES earns a yield .
He made the cowardly second choice .
He said to his shareholders , a bold lie in my view , that he sold his silver position too early .
He did not sell it willingly .
He sold it from exercise of a failed option call , written calls , used widely to earn income , like a dividend yield , a standard practice .
Buffett did not understand the silver market .
More could lurk behind the scenes to this story .
Buffett might have been forced to sell his position , to satisfy Greenberg and his cartel buddies , who were desperate to find sufficient physical silver during broad shortages .
Greenberg was under investigation for fraud .
Buffett might have been involved .
Buffett might have wiggled out of trouble by giving in to the regulatory authorities , letting his silver position be sold to help supply .
We may never know the truth .
My version is much more credible than Warren�s , that he just sold too early .
Nonsense !
BERNANKE HELICOPTER DROPS OF MONEY
So far , the fleet of helicopters is more like a fleet of UPS vans making money drops to Wall Street bankers , not the public , in corporate banking socialism .
The USGovt measly stimulus plan is a total joke , sending $ 600 to $ 700 to each taxpayer .
Bernanke seems to have changed his playbook .
He seems to have a deep motive to strangle the overall USEconomy , while filling banks with lent money or refunding AAA - rated bonds with USTreasurys .
The helicopters are absent .
A giant funnel has been opened to pour money into the elite banks .
Loans to ordinary folks are hard to obtain .
Refinanced loans are next to impossible , especially when either negative equity is involved , or a second mortgage is tied to the property .
A grand disparity exists , as the M1 cash money supply struggles to avoid negative growth , while the broad M3 money supply threatens to grow at an annual 20 % rate .
The fat cat bankers are receiving the attention , not the homeowners whose equity is burning fast .
The Fascist Firemen have the wrong priorities .
The collection of US homeowners is too big to fail , not corrupt Wall Street firms whose demonstrated fraud to this day goes without prosecution .
Civil and other lawsuits might be the only justice that comes .
Plow under the failed bankers .
The practicality of allowing banks to dissolve when they hold credit derivatives will not be permitted .
Too bad homeowners don�t all hold massive credit derivatives .
GEOPOLITICS HOT BUTTONS
This is not the proper forum , but a brief comment is warranted .
Weapons of Mass Destruction were obviously a ploy to justify the Iraq War .
Talk of crude oil in Afghanistan , or oil pipelines , was also nonsense to justify another war front .
The history of Afghanistan is replete with heroin , not oil .
Nothing has changed .
The terrorism charges seem to offer cover for both cushy private military contracts and security equipment contracts .
The terrorism card also clouds the entire seizure raids of an entire nation�s oil treasure , in Iraq .
Nevermind that Iraq has a horrendous history .
Now the United States has a marred history .
The USGovt in the last few years has openly defied NATO treaties .
Placement of missiles in Eastern Europe receives almost no criticism in the US press , even though in violation with another Russian treaty in the aftermath of the Soviet Union demise .
The recent summit meeting between chess player Russian former president Putin and the US president , who lacks broad expertise , was replete with deception .
On the resort off the Black Sea , the two met a week ago .
The press reported only on missile deployment discussion .
The entire meeting was arranged to defuse the threatened attacks by the US Military upon Iranian nuclear facilities .
For the whole month of March , Russian dignitaries had been dispatched to the White House on the matter .
US presidential elections come within months .
The time for action is nigh in the view of the current lame ducks .
The Black Sea meeting was about Iran and US plans for action .
They undoubtedly discussed Iran�s recent request for inclusion in the Shanghai Coop Org ( SCO ) designed for security and cultural sharing .
SCO is led by China and Russia , who would clearly offer military backup to Iran .
The press deceived on the entire meeting .
No mention of SCO was given in the US press , which in my view is nothing but a national apparatus for public address , crowd control , and shaping of public opinion .

Researchers say they have come up with a new concept for a two - dimensional cloak of invisibility that would be much easier to make than the three - dimensional version demonstrated last year in rudimentary form .
This , however , is not the kind of cloaking device the military might be interested in :
When viewed under red light , it would make a lump in an otherwise flat surface appear smooth and shiny like the image in a mirage .
Scientifically , the idea represents a simpler version of a three - dimensional cloaking idea proposed two years ago .
In that concept , a spherical shell of metamaterial — specially shaped metal pieces that bend light in ways other materials cannot — would cause light to skirt the inner edge of the shell like wind around an airplane wing , making anything inside the shell invisible .
But in practice it is hard to make a metamaterial powerful enough to prevent distortions in the invisibility , says physicist John Pendry of Imperial College London , one of those who came up with the concept .
Making a flat cloak would do away with the need for those extreme properties by relaxing the amount of light - bending necessary , Pendry and his colleague Jensen Li , now at the University of California , Berkeley , report in a preprint published online .
Instead of metamaterial , they recommend drilling holes in a layer of silicon and placing it over a metal surface that bulges up in the spot where an object is to be hidden .
They say that if the sizes of the holes were graded in the right way , light shining into the silicon would reflect from the metal lump as if it was flat , rendering it invisible .
The dream of cloaking research is to hide an object illuminated by visible light .
In 2007 researchers partially cloaked an object from radio waves .
But current metamaterials absorb too much visible light to make a convincing cloak .
Pendry says that using silicon would potentially solve the problem , because near - infrared light shines right through it .
To keep costs realistic , however , he says the cloaking region would have to be no larger than a centimeter ( about 0.4 inch ) .
There 's also the question of why anyone would need something disguised as a mirror .
He and Li suggest that the design might , however , be a useful element in proposed integrated circuits that work at high speeds by flicking light beams back and forth .
That 's a bit of a stretch at this point , says Aref Chowdhury , a senior manager at Alcatel–Lucent in Murray Hill , N.J. , who notes that a plain old reflector would do the same trick as the cloak but without the fuss .
" I just do n't see how [ it 's ] going to move the light , " he says .
What is nice , he adds , is the way the authors used the original cloaking concept to come up with a design that gets around many of the sticking points of three - dimensional invisibility .
‘ He said that I could stay in his home for as long as I wanted , and he would advise his executor of this arrangement . ’
President Bush was interrupted on several occasions by protesters who called him a fascist and war criminal during a 4 July celebration .
Speaking at the home of former president Thomas Jefferson , Bush was heckled during a ceremony where people from 30 countries lined up to be sworn in as US citizens .

RADICAL FEMINISTS : USEFUL IDIOTS
By Steven Yates
August 1 , 2006
NewsWithViews.com
A useful idiot is someone who , while zealously promoting one cause , ends up advancing a very different one through stupidity , naivete or inattention .
The useful idiot never sees the big picture .
Vladimir Lenin , the first Soviet dictator , is credited with coining the phrase , although according to P. Boller and J. Georgeï¿½s They Never Said It , heï¿ ½well ï¿ ½most likely never said it .
Not even in Russian .
Whatever its origins , the phrase sometimes comes in handy .
My first two experiences with radical feminists in academia didnï¿½t make much of an impact on me until later .
The first was in Fall 1987 at Clemson University in Clemson , South Carolina .
It was my first full - time job out of graduate school , and I was making a presentation on what was then my area of expertise : theories about the conceptual foundations of science and the dynamics of scientific change .
After outlining four such theories , I took questions .
At one point a female graduate student put up her hand and wanted to know to what extent I could relate the scarcity of women in science to scientific method .
I hadnï¿½t thought about it .
The question had never occurred to me .
A few women have made major contributions to science .
Madame Curie comes to mind .
Their methods werenï¿½t different than those of men , so I considered the range of methods employed in the sciences to be gender - neutral .
The relative scarcity of women in science I attributed mostly to womenï¿½s overall lack of interest in science .
My politically incorrect answer caused me no problems at the time .
This was , after all , before the main wave of feminist incursions into academia and the rise of political correctness ( speech control , thought control ) .
The second incident occurred a few months later at an American Philosophical Association ( APA ) meeting where I had a job interview .
The APA is the largest organization of philosophy professors in the country .
What I saw and heard was from the hall because of an unusually large , overflow crowd .
A somewhat diminutive woman was being verbally attacked ï¿½hissed at , in fact !
ï¿½by an audience that seemed to be mostly women .
None of the panelists ( also women ) came to her defense .
The meeting ï¿½supposedly of adults and professionalsï¿½disintegrated into chaos .
I wasnï¿½t sure what I had seen until months later , when reports began circulating and angry letters to the editor began appearing in the associationï¿½s flagship journal .
The diminutive woman , I learned , was Christina Hoff Sommers , a then - unknown professor at tiny Clark College in Massachusetts .
She had read a paper on ï¿ ½Feminists Against the Family , ï¿½ arguing just that to an audience unused to having its basic premises questioned .
Sommers had concluded that feminists in academia were more interested in promoting revolutionary social change than in furthering a responsible exchange of ideas .
Their ends justified their means .
Among the ends they wanted was an end to the traditional , nuclear ( two - parent ) family .
According to their Marxist view of things , the family is a repository of gender - oppression .
Men are bourgeois ; women are proletariat .
Such notions , however contrived and unoriginal , took academia by storm in the 1980s and even more so in the 1990s .
Sommers distinguished between ï¿½liberalï¿½ feminism and ï¿½genderï¿½ ( radical ) feminism .
The first promoted , e.g. , equal pay for equal work , and opposed discrimination .
The latter is a full - fledged worldview that subjects every institution of society to scrutiny through the lens of gender .
Sommers had no quarrel with the former ; she had plenty of quarrels with the latter .
Its influence , which puts science under the gender microscope along with everything else , explained the question from the Clemson graduate student .
I met Sommers a couple of years later .
My interests had begun shifting from the foundations of scientific method to political thought and the foundations of a free society .
I was interested in libertarian ideas and was networking with other libertarian philosophers , several of whom had befriended her .
We were all outsiders , after all , because we were not collectivists .
Based on what Sommers had to say , and on a few of her articles , I took a look at so - called ï¿ ½feminist scholarship .ï¿ ½
What I found jolted me .
One radical feminist called Newtonï¿½s and Baconï¿½s ideas about scientific method a ï¿½rape manualï¿½ ( they spoke of ï¿½penetrating ï¿½ nature ï¿½s secretsï¿ ½get it ? ) .
Another compared a romantic candlelight dinner to prostitution .
These are just two examples , and not even the weirdest ( donï¿½t ask ! ) .
Around this time it surfaced that a ï¿½feminist legal theorist , ï¿½ Catharine A. MacKinnon , had compared voluntary sexual intercourse to rape .
That oversimplifies somewhat ; what she says is that in ï¿½male - dominated , patriarchical , heterosexist society ï¿½ the line between voluntary consent and coercion is blurred , so that in sexual relations between men and women a fine distinction between ï¿½voluntary ï¿½ intercourse and rape canï¿½t be drawn .
Yup : under the insidious patriarchy , men as a collective are potential rapists ; women are helpless victims .
It seemed like a sick joke to me .
Men dominating women ?
Where ?
At the time I couldnï¿½t even get a date , much less find someone to dominate .
Approach an academic woman ?
I ï¿½d have to have been out of my mind !
But these people were being lionized and treated as heroines who had cracked the academic ï¿½glass ceiling , ï¿½ and whose ï¿½scholarshipï¿½ was ï¿½cutting edge .ï¿½
They were employed permanently by their institutions and paid comfortable salaries , while guys like myself struggled to survive as academic cheap labor .
We migrated from school to school to school on ï¿½visiting assistant professorï¿½ contracts or ï¿½adjunctï¿½ appointments every one , two or three years .
It would not have been as bad if the world according to radical feminism werenï¿½t pure fantasy .
There is no ï¿½patriarchy ï¿½ !
The courts clearly favor women in divorce and child custody cases , and have for years .
Women tend to live longer then menï¿½possibly because men have long tended to work in more hazardous occupations , and are far more likely to die of work - related injuries than women .
Far more attention is paid toï¿ ½and government money spent on ï¿½womenï¿½s health issues than menï¿½s health issues .
Men have always been the ones to fight and die in wars , or suffer war - related disabilities .
( Radical feminists apparently want as many women killed or maimed in wars as menï¿½hence ï¿½women in combat .ï¿½ )
Radical feminist ï¿½researchï¿½ on academic topics like the philosophy of science is often just silly .
Some of their proposals , e.g. , for ï¿½female friendly science , ï¿½ seem to invite ridiculeï¿ ½which they sometimes receive , as when around 1990 a responsible woman philosopher named Marguerita Levin asked sarcastically whether ï¿½feminist airplanes would stay aloft for feminist engineersï¿½ ( ï¿½ Science and Feminism , ï¿½ The American Scholar ) .
The more I investigated affirmative action programs , the clearer it became that they explained the growing influence of radical feminism ( also multiculturalism and other chicaneries of the politically correct era ) .
At the root was the longstanding commitment to collectivism generally .
Preferential hiring for ï¿½diversity ï¿½ had led to a free fall in quality control .
Political correctness , when it rushed across the landscape like a tornado in the 1990s , made the free fall semi-permanent .
( Now to be sure , academic philosophy wasnï¿½t setting the world on fire before this nonsense started , but that ï¿½s another article . )
Christina Hoff Sommers went on to write Who Stole Feminism ? ( 1994 ) .
Under sustained attack in academia , she dropped her APA membership and finally left teaching for a research position at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
There she researched and wrote The War Against Boys ( 2000 ) .
Today , the fruits of radical feminism are everywhere in evidence .
The nuclear family is in trouble ( although in fairness this is due more to the collapse of real , debauched - dollar - adjusted wages forcing both parents to work ) .
Radical feminists dominate many academic humanities departments , including where I did my graduate work ; they are well represented in many administrations at four - year research institutions ; they control professional groups such as the Modern Language Association .
Much contemporary ï¿½scholarshipï¿½ is predictably sex-drenched and gender - obsessed .
Meanwhile , enrollment statistics over the past few years indicate a fall - off in men enrolling in four - year institutions .
This has begun to attract national attention .
Recent stats indicate that the percentage of men on college and university campuses has fallen to 43 percent nationwide , with some institutions falling under 40 percent .
This is treated like a great mystery : why are men falling behind ?
To those of us who have watched gender politics in academe since the 1980s , the answer is obvious .
No man with self - respect is going to sit in a classroom , at the mercy of a radical feminist professorï¿½s denunciations , if he has an alternative .
With political correctness shackling free speech , men are speaking with their feet .
Some are going to less - politicized technical colleges .
Others are choosing occupations that donï¿½t require a four - year degree .
Has radical feminism helped women ?
A better question might be : was it intended to help women ?
Some think not .
Many women have the careers feminism promised ï¿½but also kids born out of wedlock , from one - night stands and the feminist conviction that ï¿ ½a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle .ï¿½
They come home from work exhausted and then have one or more kids to handle .
The result : stress , exhaustion , burn - out .
Boys , meanwhile , grow up without proper male role models .
One of the effects of radical feminism is the feminization of boys and men .
Masculine assertiveness is ï¿½outï¿½ ; ï¿½metrosexualï¿½ sensitivity is ï¿½inï¿½ï¿ ½a recipe for trouble .
As Christina Hoff Sommers argues convincingly , normal boys just arenï¿½t wired that way .
Some men are consciously deciding to stay single .
They will not approach women , in college or at work , out of fear of guilty - if - charged ï¿½sexual harassmentï¿½ allegations .
And with one in two marriages ending in divorce , they are justifiably afraid of being cleaned out ï¿½of having their finances destroyed by divorce courts that favor women .
Worse still , more than one man has had his life ruined by malicious child - molestation allegations .
Again , guilty if charged .
Not to mention the emotional devastation to kids after watching their parents fight , sometimes for years .
All of which presages a lot of peopleï¿½of both sexes ï¿½growing older alone .
Could it be that someone wants things this way , because when people ï¿½s ï¿½especially childrenï¿½s ï¿½families are dismembered and they are psychologically cut off from the most important support network a person can have in an impersonal , materialistic society , they are vulnerable ?
How does all this tie in with my opening paragraph ?
In a recent interview with The New American ( June 12 , 2006 ) , Aaron Russo , currently of America : Freedom to Fascism fame , reports how he once defended his sympathy with the womenï¿½s movement and with equal opportunity to an unnamed member of the Rockefeller clan .
Russo describes the chilling response : ï¿ ½He looked at me and said , ï¿ ½You know , you ï¿½re such an idiot in some ways .
We ï¿½ created the womenï¿½s movement , and we promote it .
And it ï¿½s not about equal opportunity .
It ï¿½s designed to get both parents out of the home and into the workforce , where they will pay taxes .
And then we can decide how the children will be raised and educated .ï¿½ï¿½

Widely portrayed as kung fu's loveable goofy hero , Jackie Chan 's wide - ranging business empire attests to a very different persona ; a driven , ambitious man whose financial acumen is more fearsome than his fist .
Defying his humble origins , the 54 - year - old action star has retained his position as one of Asia 's highest - paid actors for more than three decades .
But even kung fu masters have their weaknesses , and Chan 's Achilles heel is his seeming inability to say no to any of the myriad product endorsements and lucrative advertising deals that come his way .
Chan has plugged everything from Hanes T - shirts to Hefty trash bags and Mountain Dew soda .
Guided by his long - time manager Willie Chan , he tirelessly hawks his own clothing line and gym equipment as well as crooning on dozens of CDs .
Officially one of the most generous stars in showbiz , Chan has donated much of his fortune to disaster relief and children 's charities as well as serving as a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador .
But Chan 's latest role – as spokesman for the Beijing Olympics – has proved the toughest sell of his career .
Chan is momentarily lost for words to defend China from the global outcry over its clampdown in Tibet .
" It is sad , very sad .
But every Olympics it goes on .
No matter .
Next year .
Same thing in London .
When London announced the Olympics – boom !
The bombs going off , " he insists .
" But I am the Olympic ambassador , and I just want to say : Olympics is Olympics .
You can not mix sports with politics .
Olympics for me is love , peace , united .
Every country when they have Olympics a lot of people come out opposed .
This year everyone is concentrated on China but it does n't just happen in China , it happens everywhere .
I just want to say , please , understand , they are just some naughty boys .
They just want to be on TV .
They know if they can get the torch then they can get on TV , and that 's the wrong things .
They misunderstand .
I want to welcome tourists to China .
I will stand in the airport , bowing .
Welcome , welcome , welcome ... "
And Tibet ?
" That 's like ancient history .
That 's not just two or three years ; that 's like a million years of history and myths and nobody can solve this kind of problem .
Let the history tell and let there be the right time to tell , " he says incomprehensibly .
Chan clearly finds himself lost without a script .
Especially since Tibet 's recent anti-China protests – which left more than 22 people dead – inconveniently coincided with his promotional duties for his latest film , The Forbidden Kingdom .
The film marks the long - awaited screen pairing of Chan and Jet Li , the highest - paid actors in Asia .
" I have known him [ Li ] for many years but after I worked with him I found out he is a very quiet person , " says Chan , eager to move on from Tibet questions .
" Even though Jet is humorous , he has a different kind of humour .
I 'm funny , and he is more humorous .
Most of the time he is hiding himself , I think after the tsunami , he almost died , he carried his two daughters and saved them .
Then he became a Buddhist ; most of the time , hiding in hotels for meditation .
I always make fun of him . "
Chan 's been married to his wife for 25 years , Taiwanese actress Lin-Fenn - Chiao : " I 'm very lucky I have a wife like her .
Always not showing off ; hiding and not buying expensive jewellery . "
Despite his charitable generosity , his tough childhood has taught him the value of money .
His parents Charles and Lee - Lee Chan fled the Chinese civil war , first to Hong Kong where they worked for the French ambassador , later moving on to Australia .
By Chan 's own admission , he was an unhappy child .
" We lived at the French Embassy where my dad was a cook and my mom was a maid .
I cried a lot and my mom would have to take me out in the middle of the night so I would n't wake anyone , " he told US Parade magazine .
At seven years of age he begged to be sent to the famed Chinese Drama Academy in Beijing where he excelled in martial arts and acrobatics .
" The first three days were fun , " he recalls .
" But then I received my first beating .
I remember dropping a piece of rice on the floor , and the teacher caned me . "
According to Chan , the children received very little to eat but plenty of discipline : " I was beaten almost every day .
I never forgot how it felt .
It made me never want to hit anyone , and I do n't want children to think its OK to beat someone up , " says Chan .
" I desperately wanted to leave that place but could n't because my parents had signed a contract .
And when my parents left Hong Kong for Australia I was angry at being left by myself . "
But the school 's brutal training regimen – including instruction in kung fu , acrobatics , acting and singing , as well as cleaning chores – proved to be his making .
Many of the school 's graduates were recruited by Peking opera companies .
But then , in the late Sixties kung fu movies had taken off and Chan and his classmates were hired to do dangerous stunts .
Not that Chan saw any money from this since their master kept most of the money , leaving Chan and his classmates penniless .
" I think my own poverty finally helped me understand my parents ' plight whereas , up until that point , I had just felt angry .
They thought they were giving me a better life , putting me in that school , and I wanted to make them proud . "
Driven by a desire to have everything his parents did n't , by 18 he had become the youngest stunt co-ordinator in Hong Kong .
While Chan received good money , stunt - doubling on Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon , he wanted to be a star himself .
Director Lo Wei recognised
Chan 's talent and set about modelling him on Bruce Lee , in the process changing his name to Shing Lung , meaning " become a dragon " .
But Chan 's chance at stardom failed after Wei cast him as a pale imitation of Bruce Lee in his 1976 film New Fist of Fury .
But under the guidance of Hong Kong producer Willie Chan , he set about creating an absent - minded comical persona that propelled him to the top of Asia 's box - office attractions .
Next he strove to translate his success into Hollywood , appearing in 1980 's Cannonball Run .
Disappointed that his performance went unnoticed , he returned to Hong Kong .
Ten years later he was back in Beverly Hills with his wife and son where hard work finally delivered Western success with Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon .
Perhaps because English is his second language , Chan is brutally honest in assessing the one - dimensional careers of fellow action stars Jean - Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal : " From the beginning , they always create one image , that 's it .
Like with Steven Seagal , he 's just the tough guy , always fight fight fight .
But Arnold Schwarzenegger , he was clever .
He does Terminator , then T2 , then he makes the kindergarten police comedy .
" I think I 'm different , I started with comedy but that created so many things , like the cop movies ...
I have so many different roles so that 's why I have so many chances to do other things .
I think that 's why I have longevity in the business . "
Awarded an MBE in 1989 for his services to entertainment , the Beijing Olympic officials have clearly counted on Chan 's irrepressible humour to see them through the worst of public criticism .
Does Chan think he 's doing a good job so far ?
" I do n't know .
You tell me ?
It has n't been easy .
But I do it for the love of my country , " he says solemnly .

magazine .
We 've got photos of McConaughey 's impressive weekend workout .
His statuesque trainer is n't breaking a sweat as she puts the actor through his paces .

I ’m in love with a girl , and her name is Lilly McElroy .
I ’m still searching for the superlative that will totally encapsulate her particular strain of righteous - quirky - artistic - awesomeness .
If there ’s anything cooler than someone with the balls to be fearless and trust that it will work out in the end , it ’s someone who does it all in public .
Basically , Lilly McElroy is the coolest chick ever .
Combining photography with experiential art ( with what I ’m sure must border on performance art for anyone lucky enough to be in the room when Lilly walks in … ) , her on - going series “ I Throw Myself At Men ” is literally that .
She walks into bars and asks dudes she does n’t know if she can throw herself at them while her partner takes a picture of it .
“ I started the project by placing an ad on Craig ’s list looking for men who would meet me at bars blind date style and let me literally throw myself at them .
This worked fairly well , but limited the # of photos I could take .
Now , I go to bars with a friend / photographer and approach men who are physically larger than I am .
I ask them if I can literally throw myself at them .
If they say yes , I have myself photographed doing it and buy them a drink afterwards . ”
Ah. May .
Zing .
The results are whacked out and joyous ; I ’m not sure what ’s more entertaining : the glee with which McElroy hurls herself through the air or the look of abject panic on the faces of the men who know that their manhood pretty much rides on how successfully they catch her .
“ I Throw Myself At Men ” has a very spontaneous fun- house sort of feel , but in “ Locations ” she works in a similar style to a more disturbing , reflective affect .
She choses specific locations – always a privately - owned public space , and always a place where people are in a hurry to move around .
Wearing just a nightgown , McElroy quietly lays down and documents people reactions .
Or , more importantly , their non-reactions .
The quality of the photos is so great that it ’s hard to believe they ’re not controlled sets .
Knowing that these are genuine public spaces that she simply walked into and laid down gives them a unsettled feel – like you want to rush in and make sure she does n’t get stepped on .
Or driven over by a car .
I especially like how her poses do n’t insinuate violence or alarm ; she does n’t appear to have fallen down or been hurt .
She looks like she ’s napping , and that very laid - back serenity in these most robotic of public places make her sojourns there all the more dynamic .
One of the most telling results of “ Locations ” is that while shooting the entire project she was only approached and asked if she needed help three times .
“ A considerable amount of our time is spent in those locations where conduct is regimented .
This has become especially noticeable due to the current practice of reigning in public expression .
Fear of non-conformity has made uncommon behaviors virtually impermissable …
When not dismissed as absurd , my actions were responded to with anger ; re-emphasizing the fact that public behavior has become highly restricted ” .
Marry me , Lilly McElroy !
As if I was n’t already endeared enough , amongst her gloriously bizarre projects , in her “ Recent Acts of Self Portraiture ” series , she ’s got a video still called “ Things from my floor that stuck to my hand ” , where she mummified her hand in masking tape and , true to her word , saw how much stuff from the floor she could snag up .
How fucking random is that ?
I love her .

Karl Rove , contributor for Fox News takes part in a panel discussion at the Fox TV network summer press tour in Beverly Hills , California July 14,2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
DES MOINES , Iowa ( Reuters ) - Four peace activists were arrested on Friday as they attempted to make a “ citizens arrest ” of Karl Rove , who was one of President George W. Bush ’s top aides before leaving the administration last year .
“ It should be Karl Rove in that van .
War Criminal ! ” one of a dozen protesters shouted as the four were put into a police van outside a Des Moines country club where Rove spoke at a private state Republican party fundraiser .
Chet Guinn , a retired Methodist Minister , was among those led away .
“ To be silent when major crimes are being committed against all humanity makes us accomplices , ” Guinn told reporters just before his prearranged arrest , which took place when protesters stepped past a gate .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Many Hillary Clinton supporters still think the New York senator should be the leading contender to be Sen. Barack Obama 's running mate .
Sen . Hillary Clinton will soon hit the campaign trail for Sen. Barack Obama , sources say .
But more than a month after Obama and Clinton put on their big show of unity , the prospect of a joint ticket seems distant at best -- and possibly over .
Sources close to Clinton said the Obama campaign has asked her to hit the trail for Obama , and she will soon do so in the next couple of weeks -- focusing on Nevada , Ohio and Florida .
She 's been told , according to the sources , to expect to travel a lot this fall .
Those close to her say she 's completely comfortable with that , and not angry with Obama even though it looks like she has very little chance of becoming his running mate .
" From what we can gather , she 's not really on the short list , " said Gloria Borger , a CNN senior political analyst .
" The reason Hillary Clinton is out is because she 's not on message for Barack Obama , her campaign is not about change , she represents Washington . "
Clinton 's 18 million primary voters were once painted as the 18 million reasons Obama would want to pick her for the No. 2 spot .
Clinton made it clear that it was a job she 'd take , if asked .
Her closest friends did her bidding .
" She would certainly , as she said to some of the New York delegation , entertain the idea if it's offered , " Clinton supporter Bob Johnson said .
Mindful not to disrespect Clinton or alienate her supporters , Obama insists she has n't been ruled out .
" I 've said consistently that I think Hillary Clinton would be on anybody 's short list , " Obama said on NBC's " Meet The Press " on Sunday .
But as the short list gets shorter , the political calculations seem a little more clear .
Watch more on the Obama vice presidential speculation »
" Hillary Clinton would be in the ticket if the Barack Obama campaign felt that they were in some trouble with the voters that she brings -- the older women , those voters in rural America , battleground states .
They do n't think they are in trouble there , so they probably do n't think they need her , " Borger said .
At the same time Clinton is now fully engaged in talks with the Obama team , the buzz is intensifying over who could be a running mate capable of bringing in Clinton voters .
" There is no one running mate that could deliver her supporters in one swoop the way she could , but I do think , for example , that Evan Bayh of Indiana could go to Indiana , which is turning into a battleground state , and help Obama there , " Borger added .
Sen .
Bayh was also originally a big Clinton supporter and was by her side during much of the primary season .

With gasoline prices being about 40 % higher than what they were last year , it should come as no surprise that many of us have started to significantly reduce the amount we drive .
That being said , it ’s not like we ’re not still going to the store , or taking a short trip over to a friend ’s house .
We ’re just taking alternate forms of transportation .
Based on a recent poll , it appears as if many of us have become reacquainted with two of the oldest forms of transportation : walking and riding a bicycle .
For the past two weeks , I ’ve had a poll up on Daily Fuel Economy Tip which asked the following : “ Are you walking and / or riding a bike more due to higher gas prices ? ”
Here ’s how the responses broke down :
49 % stated they are walking / riding more thanks to high gas prices
48 % stated they are not walking / riding more
3 % stated they were unsure
Even over the last couple of weeks , it seems to me that my morning commute is far less crowded and there are more people walking or riding their bicycles to work on the paths adjacent to the roads I ’m on .
In fact , on several occasions , I ’ve taken my bike into work as well – 8 to 10 miles each way , depending on which path I take – something I never would have thought to do if high gasoline prices were n’t starting to affect my bottom line .
It will be interesting to see how these numbers change as the major car manufacturers adjust to the fact we no longer have a significant demand for trucks , SUVs and other gas guzzlers , and start producing more fuel efficient vehicles .
However , because we ’re in the midst of a relatively seismic shift in energy / environmental awareness , even with more gas friendly cars available , it would n’t surprise me if the number of people walking and / or riding more continues to increase for an extended period of time .
Maybe we can knock out our energy and obesity problems at the same time !
WASHINGTON  Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , a legendary political figure closely tied to the rough - and - tumble history of his home state , and who wields outsize influence over federal spending , was indicted on Tuesday on seven felony counts of failing to disclose gifts that he received from an oil services company .
A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia charged Mr. Stevens , who is 84 and the longest - serving Republican in the Senate , with failing to report more than $ 250,000 in gifts , including extensive renovations to his house in Alaska , a Land Rover and home furnishings on financial disclosure forms that he filed from 1999 to 2006 .
The indictment said that Mr. Stevens “ knowingly and willfully engaged in a scheme to conceal ” the gifts he received from the VECO Corporation , once one of Alaska ’s largest oil field contractors , and its former chief executive , William J. Allen , who last year pleaded guilty in the case .
And it comes nearly a year to the day after F.B.I. agents raided the senator ’s home as part of a long - running and expansive public corruption investigation in Alaska .
Mr. Stevens was informed of the indictment through a telephone call to his lawyer on Tuesday morning and was allowed to surrender instead of being arrested .
He was expected to make an initial appearance in Washington before a federal judge , Emmet G. Sullivan , once a hearing is scheduled .
Generally , you may deduct casualty and theft losses relating to your home , household items , and vehicles on your federal income tax return if the loss is caused by a federally declared disaster declared by the President .
You may not deduct casualty and theft losses covered by insurance , unless you file a timely claim for reimbursement and you reduce the loss by the amount of any reimbursement or expected reimbursement .
Disaster Area Losses – A federally declared disaster is a disaster that occurred in an area declared by the President to be eligible for federal assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act .
It includes a major disaster or emergency declaration under the Act .
See Publication 547 , Casualties , Disasters , and Thefts and Publication 2194 , Disaster Resource Guide PDF for more information .
Casualty Losses -
A casualty loss can result from the damage , destruction , or loss of your property from any sudden , unexpected , or unusual event such as a flood , hurricane , tornado , fire , earthquake , or volcanic eruption .
A casualty does n't include normal wear and tear or progressive deterioration .
If your property is personal - use property or is n't completely destroyed , the amount of your casualty loss is the lesser of :
The adjusted basis of your property , or
The decrease in fair market value of your property as a result of the casualty
If your property is business or income - producing property , such as rental property , and is completely destroyed , then the amount of your loss is your adjusted basis .
Theft Losses -
A theft is the taking and removal of money or property with the intent to deprive the owner of it .
The taking must be illegal under the law of the state where it occurred and must have been done with criminal intent .
The amount of your theft loss is generally the adjusted basis of your property because the fair market value of your property immediately after the theft is considered to be zero .
Insurance or Other Reimbursements
You must reduce the loss , whether it's a casualty or theft loss , by any salvage value and by any insurance or other reimbursement you receive or expect to receive .
The adjusted basis of your property is usually your cost , increased or decreased by certain events such as improvements or depreciation .
For more information about the basis of property , refer to Topic No. 703 , Publication 547 , Casualties , Disasters , and Thefts and Publication 551 , Basis of Assets .
You may determine the decrease in fair market value by appraisal , or if certain conditions are met , by the cost of repairing the property .
For more information , refer to Publication 547 .
Capital Gain
If you have a personal casualty capital gain for the tax year , you may be able to deduct the portion of the personal casualty loss not attributed to a federally declared disaster area to the extent the loss does n't exceed the personal capital gain .
Claiming the Loss
Individuals are required to claim their casualty and theft losses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A ( Form 1040 or 1040 - SR ) , Itemized Deductions PDF ( or Schedule A in Form 1040 - NR PDF , if you 're a nonresident alien ) .
For property held by you for personal use , you must subtract $ 100 from each casualty or theft event that occurred during the year after you 've subtracted any salvage value and any insurance or other reimbursement .
Then add up all those amounts and subtract 10 % of your adjusted gross income from that total to calculate your allowable casualty and theft losses for the year .
Report casualty and theft losses on Form 4684 , Casualties and Thefts PDF .
Use Section A for personal - use property and Section B for business or income - producing property .
If personal - use property was damaged , destroyed or stolen , you may wish to refer to Publication 584 , Casualty , Disaster , and Theft Loss Workbook ( Personal - Use Property ) .
For losses involving business - use property , refer to Publication 584-B , Business Casualty , Disaster , and Theft Loss Workbook PDF .
These workbooks are helpful in claiming the losses on Form 4684 ; keep them with your tax records .
When to Deduct
Casualty losses are deductible in the year you sustain the loss , which is generally in the year the casualty occurred .
You have not sustained a loss if you have a reasonable prospect of recovery through a claim for reimbursement .
If you have a casualty loss from a federally declared disaster that occurred in an area warranting public or individual assistance ( or both ) , you can choose to treat the casualty loss as having occurred in the year immediately preceding the tax year in which you sustained the disaster loss , and you can deduct the loss on your return or amended return for that preceding tax year .
See Revenue Procedure 2016 - 53 PDF for guidance on the time and manner of making and revoking an election under Code Section 165 ( i ) .
Review Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief for Individuals and Businesses for information regarding timeframes and additional information to your specific qualifying event .
Theft losses are generally deductible in the year you discover the property was stolen unless you have a reasonable prospect of recovery through a claim for reimbursement .
In that case , no deduction is available until the taxable year in which you can determine with reasonable certainty whether or not you 'll receive such reimbursement .
Losses from Ponzi - type investment schemes - Special rules may apply to theft losses from Ponzi - type investment schemes .
For more information , see the Instructions for Form 4684 , Casualties and Thefts PDF .
Additionally , review Help for Victims of Ponzi Investment Schemes and Publication 547 .
When Your Loss Deduction Exceeds Your Income
If your loss deduction is more than your income , you may have a net operating loss ( NOL ) .
You do n't have to be in business to have an NOL from a casualty .
For more information , refer to Publication 536 , Net Operating Losses ( NOLs ) for Individuals , Estates , and Trusts .
BT conducted two " small scale " trials of the Phorm system BT should face prosecution for its " illegal " trials of a controversial ad - serving technology , a leading computer security researcher has said .
Dr Richard Clayton at the University of Cambridge made his comments after reviewing a leaked BT internal report .
The document reveals details of a 2006 BT trial with the Phorm system , which matches adverts to users ' web habits .
" It 's against the law of the land , " he told BBC News .
" We must now expect to see a prosecution . "
But BT plans to push ahead with a further trial of the technology later this summer , the BBC has learnt .
" We have not announced a date yet ; we are still planning - it will be quite soon , " a spokesperson said .
Revelations about earlier trials have prompted some customers to organise protests in London to coincide with BT 's AGM on 16 July .
' Small test '
The company did not inform customers that they were part of the original tests in 2006 and 2007 , although 30,000 subscribers were involved .
Nearly 19 million web pages were intercepted during the 2006 tests , according to the leaked report , posted to the whistle - blowing website Wikileaks .
This is n't how we expect ISPs to treat their customers ' private communications
Dr Richard Clayton
' Illegal ' ad system scrutinised BT described it as " a small - scale technical test " .
During the trials adverts were stripped out of web pages served up to BT customers and replaced with more targeted ads , if available .
If none was available , adverts for one of three charities were inserted .
The report also reveals that BT believes that a large scale deployment of Phorm will be " operationally challenging " .
It projected that it would require as many as 300 servers to roll out for all BT customers and added that BT was " unable to find hosting accommodation that will enable a deployment of this model " .
However , the BBC now understands that the technology behind Phorm has been updated and large - scale trials are much more feasible .
' Illegal trial '
Dr Clayton said the leaked report " clearly shows that back in 2006 BT illegally intercepted their customers ' web traffic , and illegally processed their personal data " .
He continued : " The BT author seems delighted that only 15 - 20 people noticed this was happening and looks forward to a new system that will be completely invisible .
" This is n't how we expect ISPs to treat their customers ' private communications and since , not surprisingly , it 's against the law of the land , we must now expect to see a prosecution . "
He said that the BT report also noted that " communications regarding advertisement systems and information collection could lead to negative perception if not carefully handled " .
" They seem to have failed in this aspect as well , " he said .
A BT spokesman said : " The trial was completely anonymous and no personal information was stored or processed .
" BT sought expert legal advice before commencing the trial . "

id : naoya:20080511:1210506301 のエントリのコメント欄で kzk さんに教えていただいた Hadoop Streaming を試しています 。
Hadoop はオープンソース の MapReduce + 分散ファイルシステムです。Java で作られています 。Yahoo !
Inc のバックエンドや 、Facebook 、Amazon.com などでも利用されているとのことです。詳しくは

Hadoop Streaming 記事にもあります通り 、Hadoop 拡張の Hadoop Streaming を使うと標準入出力を介するプログラムを記述するだけで、Hadoop による MapReduce を利用することができます。つまり 、Java 以外の任意の言語で MapReduce が可能ということです。 例によっ て Apache のアクセスログからステータスコードの回数を数える計算を行ってみます。言語は
Perl です。 #!/usr / local /bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; while ( <>) { chomp ; my @segments = split / \s+ / ; printf " %s \t %s
" , $ segments [ 8 ] , 1 ; } という Mapper ( map.pl ) と #!/usr /local/bin/perl use strict ; use warnings ; my % count ; while ( <> ) { chomp ; my ( $ key , $ value ) = split / \t / ; $ count {$key} ++ ; } while ( my ( $ key , $ value ) = each % count ) { printf " %s \t %s
" , $ key , $ value ; } という Reducer ( reduce.pl ) を書いて Hadoop に入力を与えると 、Hadoop クラスタに分散されて計算が実行されます。map ( ) への入力は標準入力を介して行ベースで渡ってきます。reduce( ) への入力は key - value ペアがタブ区切りです。 [ naoya@colinux hadoop ] % hadoop jar ~/ hadoop / contrib/hadoop-0.15.3-streaming .jar \ - input httpd_logs \ - output logc_output \ - mapper /home / naoya/work/hadoop/analog/map.pl \ - reducer /home/naoya/work/hadoop/analog/reduce.pl \ - inputformat TextInputFormat \ - outputformat TextOutputFormat 上記のようにコマンドラインで 、Mapper と Reducer に map.pl、reduce.pl を与えてやります。 出力は HDFS ( Hadoop による分散ファイルシステム ) 上に保存されます 。HDFS のコマンドで cat します。 [ naoya@colinux hadoop ] % hadoop dfs - cat logc_output /* 304 262 200 4606 500 43 404 24
MapReduce における reduce ( ) への入力データ構造 Hadoop Streaming は標準入出力を扱うだけで良く、これはUNIX プログラマにとっては非常になじみ深いプログラミングモデルであり、大きな利点であると思います。 ところで 、Google 論文 にある Reduce の疑似コードを今一度見てみましょう。 reduce ( String key , Iterator values ) : // key : a word // values : a list of counts int result = 0 ; for each v in values : result += ParseInt( v ) ; Emit( AsString ( result ) ) ; reduce に渡ってくる入力は key - value ペアではなく key - values ペアです。map ( ) で emit された key - value ペアは、reduce ( ) に渡る前に、同一のキーでまとめられて、且つキーの順にソートされます。すなわち # key => values ( Iterator ) 200 => [ 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 , ... ] 304 => [ 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 , ... ] 404 => [ 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 , ... ] 500 => [ 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 , ... ]
という形のデータ構造になっています。値はリストです。値はメモリに収まりきらないほど大きなリストになる可能性もあるので、Iterator になっています。 MapReduce の計算モデルが簡易でありつつ幅広い分野に応用が利くのは、この reduce ( ) への入力データ構造が一つの鍵になっています。 最たるものはキーが昇順にソートされている点です。例えば
MapReduce で検索エンジンの転置インデックスを作る場合は ( 単語 => ドキュメン トIDのリスト ) という入力が渡ってくることになります。この入力をストリームで処理して次々と
emit してやると、reduce の出力もそのままキー、つまり単語順でソートされることになります。単語順でソートされていればその単語群に対する検索のアルゴリズムでアドバンテージが得られます。
これが、入力が不特定な順番で渡ってくるとなると、メモリに一度全部出力を溜めてから最後にソートする必要が出てきます。MapReduce で扱うようなデータは非常に膨大ですから、多くの場合単一のサーバーのメモリ内でのソートは難しい規模になるでしょう。このソートの必要性を排除するために、MapReduce は reduce ( ) 前に分散環境であらかじめソートを行います。
Hadoop Streaming の reduce ( ) への入力はソートこそされているものの、フラットな行入力です。つまり、
200 1 200 1 200 1 ... 304 1 304 1 ...
という具合です。このフラットな構造を単純に扱ったのでは
MapReduce の利点が一つ失われてしまいます。現に、先のログ解析ではメモリに結果を一度溜めてしまっています。また、カウンタをハッシュテーブルで実装しているため出力がキー順になっていません。

United Airlines plans to ground 100 of its older aircraft US carrier United Airlines is to ground 100 of its planes and cut between 900 and 1,100 jobs , in addition to 500 already announced lay - offs .
It blamed the decision on the need to cope with the spiralling cost of fuel and a weakening US economy .
It will also scrap its economy - class only Ted service and reconfigure those planes to include first - class seats .
The planes to be grounded will be 94 Boeing 737s and six of the larger Boeing 747s .
The plan will lead to a 17 - 18 % cut in its domestic capacity and international capacity will be scaled back by 4 - 5 % .
' Decisive ' action United recently shelved plans to merge with US Airways after months of talks about a cost - saving deal .
Many airlines have been struggling after oil hit a record $ 135 a barrel and aviation fuel prices surged 76 % in the past year .
" This environment demands that we and the industry act decisively and responsibly , " said Glenn Tilton , United 's chief executive .
" At United , we continue to do the right work to reduce costs and increase revenue to respond to record fuel costs and the challenging economic environment . "
Tough times
In April , the Chicago - based carrier announced it would cut some 500 jobs in an effort to save costs .
The latest move will make a number of salaried , contract and management workers redundant by the end of the year .
Last week , the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) warned the airline industry faced a " grim " outlook and passenger numbers would be affected by rising fuel costs and the deteriorating economic situation .
The number of airline passengers grew by 3 % in April , down from 5.4 % in the same month the previous year , it said .
And for the first four months of the year , growth was 5.6 % , compared to 6.7 % the previous year .
Cost - saving
The airline industry has already seen a number of carriers collapse in Europe , Asia and the US , and only last week UK airline Silverjet went into administration .
American Airlines recently said it would lay off workers and reduce its domestic flight capacity to 12 % after the busy summer period in a bid to keep finances under control .
Other airline companies have started charging passengers to check in bags .

A little - known police force that patrols state institutions and accompanies child welfare workers to potentially dangerous homes piled up $ 3.4 million in overtime last year , boosting the payroll 34 percent , according to a Star - Ledger review of state payroll records .
A total of 13 officers in the 157 - member Human Services Police Department racked up more than 1,000 hours of overtime last year .
And a dispatcher worked an extra 2,324 hours -- or an average of 45 overtime hours a week , the review found .
The $ 3.4 million in overtime marked the second consecutive year overtime topped $ 3 million -- and the fifth straight year it exceeded $ 1.5 million .
Police and state officials blamed the overtime on short staffing , saying they are hard - pressed to cover five state hospitals and seven developmental centers , and provide round - the - clock service to the Division of Youth and Family Services .
" In times we are dealing with now , with the financial problems , they are not going to hire more people , " said Senior Police Officer Ricardo Morales , president of PBA Local 113 .
" So we deal with needs the best we can . "
Overtime costs are common across state government .
For example , the Department of Corrections , which has about 6,500 officers , paid about $ 54 million in overtime during the 2007 fiscal year , according to budget documents .
That , however , amounts to less than half the average overtime pay taken home by Human Services Police Department officers .
Assembly Minority Leader Alex DeCroce ( R - Morris ) said the force is adequately staffed and oversight is needed more than extra bodies .
" They 've got to rein this spending in , " DeCroce said .
" There needs to be a lot more oversight and accountability here . "
The rising overtime costs also drew the ire of lawmakers during state budget hearings this spring .
The 2007 payroll documents reveal nearly 80 officers worked at least 500 extra hours ; 39 bumped their salaries by more than 50 percent ; and 52 made at least $ 30,000 in overtime .
Topping the overtime list is a communications officer who accumulated 2,325 overtime hours , nearly tripling her salary .
Imelda Richinsin - Moore , a 10 - year veteran whose normal pay is $ 46,784 , took home $ 125,000 , according to the review .
She did not respond to requests for comment .
Morales , the union president , was second on the 2007 overtime list , generating 1,413 hours and more than doubling his regular pay for a total of $ 135,197 .
Sgt. James Duca , a 19 - year veteran , also more than doubled his salary , making $ 154,592 , the department 's top earner , records show .
Morales strongly denied officers are taking advantage of the system to rack up large paychecks .
Overtime requests are approved by superiors after careful assessment of each situation , he said .
The officials who approve overtime pay either declined to be interviewed or did not respond to questions .
" It 's a matter of safety , for kids first and then case workers , " Morales said .
" If we do n't respond when called , what will happen ?
If a kid or case worker gets hurt , who will be to blame ?
When we 're called , we have to go . "
The force is run by the Department of Human Services and also serves the new Department of Children and Families , which oversees DYFS .
Spokeswomen for both departments said managers keep a close eye on overtime .
The overtime tab is rising even though the number of officers in the Human Services Police Department was boosted from 80 to 140 four years ago to provide protection for DYFS workers in difficult neighborhoods or in tense family situations .
There are also about a dozen civilian employees .
The 60 added officers were assigned to DYFS as part of a massive court - ordered reform of New Jersey 's child welfare system .
They also conduct background checks , locate missing parents and children , monitor field visits , transport kids to programs or court hearings , and act as liaisons with municipal police and prosecutors .
However , union officials contend the added hiring has not kept up with the reform 's extra demand .
They fear staffing levels will affect the safety of caseworkers .
" Being a field DYFS worker is a very dangerous job and that has been misunderstood and discounted by people safe in their buildings in Trenton , " Hetty Rosenstein said , president of CWA Local 1037 , which represents 3,000 DYFS workers .
Following questions from The Star - Ledger in the past week , Human Services Capt .
Brian Brady reissued a year - old directive to remind officers of the overtime policy , " which sets clear parameters and requires prior approval by supervisors , " said Ellen Lovejoy , a Human Services spokeswoman .
She said supervisors monitor so workers deliver " peak performance . "
Acting Children and Families Commissioner Kimberly Ricketts , appointed July 1 , has asked staff to work with the Human Services to review overtime costs , said Kate Bernyk , a DCF spokeswoman .
" There is a concern about overtime hours that have been earned , especially during these difficult fiscal times , " Bernyk said .
The total cost rose more than $ 267,000 in 2007 , even though actual overtime hours dropped slightly .
The reason : Officers got pay raises , Lovejoy said .
Artwork : Chip Taylor Windows Vista debuted to muffled applause , followed by lackluster sales .
Up until June 30 , cash - strapped businesses looking to avoid the cost of upgrading to new Vista - compatible hardware could still purchase trusty Windows XP .
Now , however , Windows XP is available only as a costly " downgrade " from Windows Vista -- if you buy a copy of Vista , you can install the 6 - year - old XP operating system using the Vista license .
If that feels like a waste of your small business 's precious IT budget , and you 're still looking for an alternative to Windows Vista , look no further than Linux .
The latest distributions are free , easy to install , and highly customizable ; they harness your existing hardware without overtaxing it ; and they include a wealth of productivity applications and utilities .
You may already have a closet Linux expert on staff , but if you do n't , paid support is usually available at rates far less than Microsoft's .
Making the switch from Windows to Linux will incur some costs as employees and support staff adjust to the new system 's configuration settings , utilities , and applications .
Even so , the savings in future hardware and software upgrades could be huge .
No License , No Fee , No Problem
Though you can purchase boxed commercial versions of Linux that include support , every Linux distribution is also available for free under the terms of the open - source Gnu General Public License , or GPL .
Once you figure out which distribution you 'd like to use ( see below ) , you can simply download , burn , and install it on as many systems as you choose .
Your software licensing fee is zero , compared with the $ 300 per seat for the full version of Windows Vista Business Edition .
And , another bonus , Linux lacks Microsoft 's intrusive activation requirements .
In addition to thousands of other free applications ( see " Linux Replacements for Your Favorite Windows Apps " for some of my favorites ) , most Linux distributions come with a copy of OpenOffice.org .
Though not a feature - for - feature substitute for Microsoft Office , OpenOffice.org definitely does the job , and for $ 500 less per workstation than the cost of Office Professional 2007 .
OpenOffice.org lacks an equivalent to Microsoft Outlook , but just about every Linux distribution includes Novell 's free Evolution PIM .
A few key Windows - based applications such as AutoCAD and Photoshop lack Linux replacements , but for many office workers the missing functionality hardly merits spending $ 800 more for Windows and Office .
Many Windows applications will run at native speed under Linux via the Wine utility included with most distributions .
For those that do n't work with Wine , two more options exist :
You can install a copy of Windows using one of the available free virtualization utilities , such as KVM ( Kernel - based Virtual Machine , built into the Linux kernel ) or VMWare Server , or you can install Linux to dual - boot with Windows .
For most distributions , the same disc will contain server applications , including the Apache Web Server , the MySQL database engine , virtualization , and support for leading commercial databases and CRM applications from companies like Oracle , Sybase , and SAP .
The Samba networking software emulates Windows Server 's networking features admirably , and for free , versus Windows Server 2008 's starting price of $ 999 .
You can even replace your costly Exchange server installation with the free , open - source Zimbra Collaboration Suite .
Whether you 're using desktop or server versions of Linux , the operating system is famous for one other important feature that Microsoft is still gradually adding to Windows : security .
Linux is not somehow magically immune to viruses , worms , and other Internet - based attacks .
However , the reality is that the vast majority of existing attacks target Windows and Windows applications .
Mostly by design , Linux is simply not subject to most of the Internet - based malware that threatens PCs .
The overwhelming majority of malware targets Windows .
Do n't Panic at the Distro
No two Linux distributions are the same , differing mainly in how user - friendly their installers are , how willing they are to include experimental or nonstable versions of software and utilities , and how they offer access to updates .
The two most popular Linux window managers , the software that controls the look and behavior of the X Window graphical user interface , are Gnome and KDE .
Most distributions default to installing one or the other -- Ubuntu opts for the former , for example , and OpenSuSE , the latter .
However , you could install both window managers ( and dozens more ) on your system , and choose which to use when you log in .
Several window managers , notably Xfce and Blackbox , require less memory and graphics processing than Gnome and KDE , making them a good choice for older hardware .
Lightweight Linux distributions , such as Puppy Linux , prune the OS down to its elements , breathing life into even the most ancient PC .
Linux distributions also differ in how well they support your particular hardware , especially wireless networking devices and display adapters .
Perhaps the easiest way to directly assess this support on your particular hardware without having to actually install Linux is to download , burn , and boot a live - CD distro .
Ubuntu , OpenSuSE , Gentoo , and literally hundreds of other Linux distributions come in live - CD versions .
Get Help , If You Need It
The reality of operating system support is that it costs a lot of money , whether it comes from Microsoft , Apple , Novell , or Canonical .
Your copy of Windows Vista comes with 90 days of technical support via phone , e-mail , or chat that starts the day you activate the product .
After that , Microsoft charges $ 60 per support incident .
Commercial Linux distributions offer similar , but less expensive , support options .
The $ 60 packaged version of Novell 's community - supported OpenSuSE 11.0 comes with 90 days of installation support .
For long - term support , choose SuSE Linux Enterprise Desktop ( currently in version 10 ) for $ 50 per year , or go with Ubuntu and buy a support contract from maker Canonical starting at $ 250 per year .
If you 're already doing without dedicated support staff for Windows , one year may be all the paid support you need for Linux .
Ubuntu users joke that simply googling for technical support usually results in the exact answer you 're looking for on Canonical 's forums .
Linux is different from Windows , but it is n't an alien life form .
The human investment you make in transitioning away from expensive Windows and Office licenses may pay for itself quickly .
More important , you 'll be free to run the desktop and server software of your choice , on hardware you can afford .

Externalities in the Classroom : How Children Exposed to Domestic Violence Affect Everyone ’s Kids
Many teachers believe that a “ few bad apples ” can spoil a whole classroom , reducing the learning of everyone in the room .
While this is part of the folk wisdom of teaching , it has been surprisingly difficult to find these effects in the data .
But a very convincing new paper , by Scott Carrell of U.C. Davis and Mark Hoekstra of U.Pitt , “ Externalities in the Classroom : How Children Exposed to Domestic Violence Affect Everyone ’s Kids ” ( available here ) , suggests that these effects can be pretty big .
The real difficulty in this style of research is to find a useful proxy for whether or not a classroom is affected by a disruptive student .
Previously researchers have used indicators like whether a student has low standardized test scores , but as any teacher knows , the under - performing kids may not be the disruptive ones .
And if you analyze only a weak statistical proxy for classroom disruption , you get weak estimates , even when the true effects are large .
The truly innovative part of the Carrell and Hoekstra study begins with their search for potentially disruptive kids : they looked for those coming from particularly difficult family situations .
In particular , they combed through court records and linked every domestic violence charge in Alachua County , Florida to the county schooling records of kids living in those households .
It ’s a sad story : nearly 5 percent of the kids in their sample could be linked to a household with a reported domestic violence incident .
( And given under - reporting , the true number may be much larger . )
The costs of this dysfunction are even more profound .
Kids exposed to domestic violence definitely do have lower reading and math scores and greater disciplinary problems .
But the effects of this dysfunction are not limited to the direct victims of this violence : kids exposed to kids exposed to domestic violence also have lower test scores and more disciplinary infractions .
Around 70 percent of the classes in their sample have at least one kid exposed to domestic violence .
The authors compare the outcomes of that kid ’s classmates with their counterparts in the same school and the same grade in a previous or subsequent year — when there were no kids exposed to family violence — finding large negative effects .
Adding even more credibility to their estimates , they show that when a kid shares a classroom with a victim of family violence , she or he will tend to under - perform relative to a sibling who attended the same school but whose classroom had fewer kids exposed to violence .
These comparisons underline the fact that the authors are isolating the causal effects of being in a classroom with a potentially disruptive kid , and not some broader socio- economic pattern linking test scores and the amount of family violence in the community .
You likely already believe there is an equity rationale for trying to help those kids subject to difficult family situations .
This research also suggests a compelling efficiency rationale , as the effects radiate well beyond the dysfunctional household .
Online footwear and lingerie sales grew faster than on the High Street
UK shoppers spent 17 pence in every pound online in the first half of the year , a report has said .
The total internet spend was £ 26.5 bn , up 38 % on the same period last year , according to e-commerce group IMRG and consultancy Capgemini .
Rising food and fuel bills and the credit crunch have forced shoppers to seek out bargains away from the high street stores .
Online sales have reached nearly 20 % of total retail spending , the report said .
The survey , based on figures from IMRG , Capgemini and the British Retail Consortium , said shopping in cyberspace had become more popular because consumers were being more cautious about their finances .
A sharp rise in living costs , fuelled by energy and food prices , and the rising cost of borrowing have put household budgets under considerable strain .
Convenience has a sharper edge in a world of soaring fuel prices
Mike Petevinos , Capgemini UK
The report added that the credit crunch and rising inflation had dented internet sales , compared with 2007 .
But web - based shopping continued to outperform the High Street , said James Roper , chief executive at IMRG .
Buoyant underwear
" Clothes and footwear sales were the biggest losers in physical stores in June , with sales either flat or lower than last year despite heavy and widespread discounting .
" Online , they were the big winners , " he said .
The report found internet clothing sales rose 32 % , lingerie sales rose 37 % and footwear was up 38 % .
In total , £ 1.76 bn was spent on clothing online in the first six months of 2008 , with a record amount spent in March .
Mike Petevinos , head of retail consulting at Capgemini , believes online shops are more resistant to tough trading conditions than bricks - and - mortar stores .
" Convenience has a sharper edge in a world of soaring fuel prices and the ability to research and make more informed choices in a time of heightened price sensitivity is a key advantage of the online channel , " he said .

Burger flippers rejoice !
The federal minimum wage will go up on Thursday to $ 6.55 from $ 5.85 .
Too bad the minimum wage is n’t rising as fast as gas prices .
Still , this is an improvement .
Congress went nine years without raising the floor for low - wage workers , finally boosting the minimum last year when its value hit a 51 - year low .
One more bump next year will bring the federal minimum wage up to $ 7.25 , a far cry from the $ 10.50 an hour paid in Santa Fe , New Mexico , but a step in the right direction .
Another decade , the minimum wage might actually lift someone above the poverty line .
Right now , 25 states have minimum wages higher than what the feds set , so the hike wo n’t have as much impact as it otherwise might , but it ’s a boon to low - wage workers in stingy states like Louisiana and Alabama that have no state minimum .
Now that Congress has come this far , the next step ought to be indexing the damn thing to inflation like many of the states do .
I ’ve never understood why poor working people should be made to suffer so much from political gridlock .
Making sure that work pays ought to be one thing people in both parties can agree on .

A teenage gang member was arrested Wednesday for allegedly spray - painting the face and body of a 6 - year - old boy who saw him vandalizing a wall , authorities said .
Another teenager allegedly restrained the child while the 15 - year - old who was arrested sprayed him with blue paint , said Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Capt .
James Hellmold .
The boy ’s mother found him covered in paint and crying , Hellmold said .
The incident occurred on the afternoon of June 25 in Willowbrook , an unincorporated area near Compton .

“ This actually shocks the conscience , ” said Hellmold , captain of the Lynwood sheriff ’s station .
“ You see a lot on things done by gang members , but even in gang crime terms this crosses the line .
This is horrendous . ”
He said he hoped deputies soon would also arrest the teenager who held the child down .
“ We are n’t about to let anyone get away with such a horrible act , ” Hellmold said .
He said the teenager in custody provided clues that helped police arrest him because he sprayed his gang affiliation and moniker on a nearby wall just before attacking the child .
People in the community also came forward and helped deputies identify him , Hellmold said .

The 15 - year - old was already in custody on suspicion of theft but was detained Wednesday on suspicion of kidnapping , assault with a caustic chemical and felony vandalism .
Hellmold said both suspects are considered gang members , but he declined to release the name of the gang , saying he did not want them to garner any claim to the area .
Because the suspects are juveniles , the Sheriff ’s Department is not releasing their names .
The victim , Hellmold said , was recovering from the assault but would not talk about it .

In the last 18 months , Los Angeles and Orange counties have seen a series of violent attacks by taggers and gang members spraying graffiti .
A Garden Grove man was shot in April after he surprised two men defacing a wall near his home .
A Pico Rivera woman , Maria Elena Hicks , 57 , was driving home Aug. 10 when she spotted a teenager tagging a wall near her home .
She honked and flashed the car lights at him and then followed him in her car when he walked away .
Then a car pulled up behind her and a gunman fired several shots through her car ’s rear window .
Hicks was struck in the head and died three days later .
Four suspects , ranging in age from 16 to 21 , were charged in her killing .
In February 2007 , a retired Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputy was stabbed and briefly hospitalized after he confronted a tagger behind a Huntington Beach pet store .
A 16 - year - old was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon .

There is a deep and abiding affection for the British people in America and a fascination with all things British that 's not going to go away any time soon . '
He wants , as he said in both France and Germany , some help with troops in Afghanistan , while wanting to get out of Iraq .
Again , the nuancing .
He also spoke , unheedingly , of the ' stalwart ' assistance given by British troops .
But , mainly , he simply appeared , and sprinkled that stardust .
Gordon Brown could be seen beaming .
In the dark .
The dark of the hall of 10 Downing Street .
Obama was n't allowed , through protocol , to grasp Mr B's hand outside for the cameras , as he is only a presidential candidate , and it was n't done for John McCain 's visit .
But there was an Obama arm swiftly around Gordon 's shoulders , and a ( rather fluid ) returning lower - back pat , before the door shut .
Asked , a little later , about Brown 's prospects , he said thoughtfully : ' You 're always more popular before you 're in charge .
Once you 're responsible , you 're going to make some people unhappy . '
Gordon and Barack walked together - a few minutes out at the back of Downing Street around St James 's Park .
Apparently they talked about economies , global warming , terrorism , Middle East stuff .
Obama had been up at about four in the morning to do the same thing at breakfast with a tired - looking Tony Blair .
Apparently Obama sleeps for four hours every night .
In the garden there was something going on .
Psychologists have a word for it - mirroring ?
Transference ?
Both had dark suits , done up with one button in the middle , and white shirts , and silky reddish ties , their left hands in their pockets , and their right hands gesturing , constantly .
Back in the garden , Gordon waved his right hand to show him various trees .
Nobody quite knows why .
Nor what he was saying .
The crueller watchers had it down pat .
' That tree 's going to vote for me ... that one 's dithering . '
That was possibly a little too cynical , because our Prime Minister did indeed seem to be genuinely , sunnily , smiling .
Twenty minutes later , Obama met David Cameron in the grounds of the Commons , and Cameron did the same .
Waved his arms and showed him shrubs .
Do n't they have trees in Illinois ?
Mr Obama is now the world 's most recognisable phenomenon .
There were , by 11 yesterday morning , hundreds of fans standing in King Charles Road , round the corner from Downing Street , cameras and phones held high .
There were banners : ' Mr B Obama you are a ray of hope 4 billions of young men and women around the globe ' .
There were tears , really .
Crying .
Logos .
Slogans .
Hope .
The woman on the Clapham omnibus quite literally rose to her feet .
A big old belching red number 88 was the first vehicle stopped at 12.44 as Obama 's convoy fled the gates of Westminster to head back to Illinois .
She stood up , earrings and sunglasses bouncing , shouting through the glass , furiously snapping away on her phone , ecstatic .
The woman on the Clapham omnibus is our ' How will it play in Peoria ? ' in America .
I almost tried to find her .
We like to have names .
But the bus was going , for once , too fast , leaving on the retina only the shimmering slick of an advertising flyer for , I assume , a film called Space Chimps Go Bananas .
There was a cartoon monkey .
Disappearing fast .
Perhaps you want to provide the Bush metaphor ?
And now Mr O , with his wickedly easy smile , has been flying , home , and very possibly listening to Leonard Cohen , and smiling .
First we take Manhattan .
Then we take Berlin .
It 's all gone rather well .
And you are going home , sir , very possibly to a historic victory on 4 November , and this was a canny little trip , so well - judged , and your aides will be enjoying a Scotch or two on the way .
Why would n't you want to smile ?
Every time a new research study around personal productivity and office culture appears , we dutifully post the " proof " that information overload , email distractions , and multitasking are keeping you from getting work done — but are they ?
Sure , many of these findings seem very feasible , but it 's hard not to think they 're published only as a crutch for a larger commercial or media message — either " the internet is destroying your life ! " or " you need to buy this product . "

Over the few years this site 's been in existence , studies have shown that email kills concentration more than smoking pot does , that you 've got 11 minutes before the next interruption , that dual monitors increase productivity , that no one understands the intended tone of your email , that email overload costs the American economy more than $ 700 billion a year , and that multitasking kills your ability to focus and get things done .
11 minutes before the next interruption Constantly - distracted workers in busy offices are able to focus on a task for an average of 11 … Read more

Ok , fine .
Most of these findings seem to be sensible ( except for the pot versus email one , which got way too sensationalized ) .
Even though a study that shows widescreen monitors increase your productivity was commissioned by Apple right around the time they were marketing their cinema displays , my personal experience has confirmed ( subjectively ) that more screen real estate does help spread out windows and make it easier to work .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Even so , the constant reappearance of these studies in mainstream media over the last few years do make one question what 's going on .
It 's the information and email overload studies that trip my BS detector the most .
While I agree that an overstuffed inbox and constant email monitoring can kill your day , this $ 700 billion a year cost to the American economy makes me raise one eyebrow high in doubt .
Did researchers factor in how much time email actually saves people who use it ?
I get dozens of messages per day and spend a good amount of time managing all of them .
I 'm the first to complain about what a time sink email can be .
However , if I had to get on the phone or mail a letter to Adam , Kevin , Tamar , and Jason every time I wanted to tell them something ?
Nothing would get done around here .
$ 700 billion a year lost after a gazillion gained leaves us in the black in the end .
Yet , research like this fuels productivity hucksters ' cannons with more ammo so we can fire off yet another productivity article or book that will solve this terribly widespread problem .
( I include myself in this . )
Software and hardware companies put out more products that track your time , measure your output , organize your stuff , and make you " more productive " in every which way .
" Social web " applications like Twitter and Facebook continue to be condemned in mainstream media as a giant waste of time — because we 've got so many other " unimportant " things like email eating up our time anyway .

Even though we 're very much a cog in this giant machine , I have my doubts .
The longer I do this , the more I suspect that a good part of the " information overload " story is a myth cooked up by folks who do n't know how to use the internet well in order to demonize something they do n't understand .
I get more done via email and surfing the web than my parents ever did using phones and libraries , even when I 'm having a bad day and switch to my email application the moment I see a new message notification .

At least three other well - seasoned internet veterans agree .
In chapter 5 of her book , Connect ! , Anne Zelenka argues against " firewalling your attention " to block out distractions and get things done .
That 's the old way of thinking ; Zelenka asserts that you can be productive by being open to tangents , distractions , and the riding the flowing river of news and information you 're exposed to on the web each day .
In defense of " wasted " time online , author Clay Shirky points out that interacting online is so much better than what we used to do with our free time ( that is , watch TV or get ripped ) .
Even Bill Gates said that we 're actually suffering from information underload , not overload .
( Though Gates , then head of a giant software maker , did say we need better products to manage the information we do get — and surely his company 's out to make them . )

In short , this post is our very belated disclaimer for any productivity research findings we publish on these pages .
Personal productivity is indeed personal , so always take study result findings around digital life and the ensuing prescriptive solutions with more than one grain of salt .
When you choose the solutions to implement in your life , make sure they resolve problems you have , not 98 % of faceless office workers somebody commissioned by some company polled somewhere .

Cosmologists are not your run -of - the - mill thinkers , and Max Tegmark is not your run -of - the - mill cosmologist .
Throughout his career , Tegmark has made important contributions to problems such as measuring dark matter in the cosmos and understanding how light from the early universe informs models of the Big Bang .
But unlike most other physicists , who stay within the confines of the latest theories and measurements , the Swedish - born Tegmark has a night job .
In a series of papers that have caught the attention of physicists and philosophers around the world , he explores not what the laws of nature say but why there are any laws at all .
According to Tegmark , “ there is only mathematics ; that is all that exists . ”
In his theory , the mathematical universe hypothesis , he updates quantum physics and cosmology with the concept of many parallel universes inhabiting multiple levels of space and time .
By posing his hypothesis at the crossroads of philosophy and physics , Tegmark is harking back to the ancient Greeks with the oldest of the old questions :
What is real ?
Tegmark has pursued this work despite some risk to his career .
It took four tries before he could get an early version of the mathematical universe hypothesis published , and when the article finally appeared , an older colleague warned that his “ crackpot ideas ” could damage his reputation .
But propelled by optimism and passion , he pushed on .
“ I learned pretty early that if I focused exclusively on these big questions I ’d end up working at McDonald ’s , ” Tegmark explains .
“ So I developed this Dr. Jekyll / Mr . Hyde strategy where officially , whenever I applied for jobs , I put forth my mainstream work .
And then quietly , on the side , I pursued more philosophical interests . ”
The strategy worked .
Today a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Tegmark travels among the world ’s top physicists .
Backed by this well - earned credibility , his audacious ideas are sparking fascination and taking flight .
These days Tegmark is a busy man .
With his wife , the Brazilian cosmologist Angelica de Oliveira - Costa , he balances science with the demands of raising two young boys .
Our interviewer , theoretical astrophysicist Adam Frank of the University of Rochester in New York , finally caught up with Tegmark as he made his way home to Winchester , Massachusetts , from a conference at Stanford University .
In a comic juxtaposition of the profound and the profane , they spoke about the nature of reality by cell phone for three hours as Tegmark jockeyed his way through an airport rental car return , security lines , and a long wait for a delayed flight .
A riff on reality would brake to a halt so Tegmark could avoid being hit by a rental - agency van .
Just as the conversation plunged into parallel universes , Tegmark would have to downshift the dialogue for the bewildered security guard checking his boarding pass .
Tegmark ’s infectious excitement over the big issues , from physics and philosophy to kids and cosmology , made for one hell of an afternoon ’s ride .
Max , you have gained a reputation for thinking far outside the box even for a cosmologist .
Have you always pondered deep questions of Life , the Universe , and Everything ?
No .
I was a very confused youth .
I came to it all pretty late , and there was no one I talked about philosophy with as a teenager .
I did have one friend in high school who did everything the opposite way from everyone else .
If people were sending letters in rectangular envelopes , he would make triangular envelopes and send letters in those .
I remember thinking , “ That is cool .
That is how I want to be . ”
Is that why you decided to go into physics ?
Actually , my dad is a mathematician , and he was always very encouraging about math , but physics was my single most boring subject in high school .
So I began as an undergrad in economics .
That was an interesting choice .... When did physics show up on your radar screen again ?
A friend gave me a book , Surely You ’re Joking , Mr. Feynman ! by the physicist Richard Feynman .
It was all about picking locks and picking up women .
It had nothing to do with physics , but it struck me how between the lines it said loud and clear , “ I love physics ! ” I could n’t understand how this could be the same boring stuff from high school .
It really piqued my curiosity .
How so ?
If you see some mediocre guy walking down the street arm in arm with Cameron Diaz , you say to yourself , “ I ’m missing something here . ”
So I started reading Feynman ’s Lectures on Physics and I was like , whoa !
Why have n’t I realized this before ?
So then you changed your major ?
Umm , no .
You do n’t pay for college in Sweden , so I was able to do this kind of scam where I enrolled in a different university to do physics without telling them I was already in college for economics .
You were in two colleges at the same time ?
Yeah .
You can see I was confused .
It got complicated at times .
I would have exams in both places on the same day , and I ’d have to bike really fast between them .
Was it in college that you started to think about the bigger questions ?
I was taking the one and only quantum physics class offered , and when I got to the chapter on measurement I felt sure that I was missing something .
After almost losing a leg for America , Benedict Arnold expected more .
Admired by revolutionary leaders , twice wounded in courageous fighting , Arnold could easily have seen his accomplishments chiseled onto every Revolutionary War memorial in the country .
Instead , his name is a historical sneer .
His unforgivable act of treason has often been attributed to a flawed character , but the real story is sadder and more complex .
After so many sacrifices , he became disillusioned with the war 's progress .
Perhaps even more important , he grew deeply mistrustful of the cause 's civilian leaders and , ultimately , Arnold himself felt betrayed .
" This was a man who began in 1775 as the most ardent of patriots , " says James Kirby Martin , a history professor at the University of Houston , " but he grew to feel that turning back to England would be the best course for the country . "
Arnold was the second of six children born to a close - knit and prosperous family in Norwich , Conn. , in 1741 .
His mother sought solace in religion and his father in alcohol after three of Arnold 's siblings died of diphtheria .
Expecting to attend Yale , the 14 - year - old was instead apprenticed to an apothecary in New Haven .
When his mother died and his father turned into the town drunk , Arnold had an early taste of the disgrace that would color the rest of his life .
Ambition and business acumen propelled Arnold from merchandising to international trade .
He had made enough money by 22 to buy back the family homestead sold to pay his father 's debts .
He resold it at enough of a profit to buy a fleet of ships .
In 1767 , he married the daughter of a prominent Freemason .
But soon squeezed by oppressive British taxes and policies , which imperiled his livelihood , the short and intense patriot devoted himself to resisting British tyranny by joining and then leading the local chapter of the Sons of Liberty .
Hannibal .
Untrained and poorly equipped troops frustrated Arnold , so he used his own money and time to train patriot forces .
In May 1775 , he helped launch an attack on the small British fort of Ticonderoga .
A bloodless victory whetted his appetite for military maneuvering and led to Washington appointing him commander of 1,100 men for a campaign against Quebec .
Three hundred fifty miles the troops trudged through rain , snow , and ice , reduced to eating candles , dogs , and shoe leather .
The Americans ' march through the Maine wilderness earned Arnold the undying respect of his men and the nickname " America 's Hannibal . "
During Arnold 's recovery from a musket ball to the leg , Thomas Jefferson praised him before the Continental Congress .
Yet Arnold never truly felt his nation 's grati-tude .
Petty jealousies kept his name off lists of promotions .
Inferior military officers generated rumors that pockmarked his reputation .
" Virtue is a key concept in the Revolution , " says Martin , author of Benedict Arnold , Revolutionary Hero : An American Warrior Reconsidered , " and Congress repeatedly insulted Arnold 's virtue . "
After the triumphant Battle of Saratoga in New York in 1777 , his sense of betrayal reached an unbearable pitch , says Dave Palmer , former superintendent of the U.S. Military Acad-emy at West Point and author of George Washington and Benedict Arnold : A Tale of Two Patriots .
The courage and stam-ina shown by Arnold and the Americans impressed the French enough to help convince them to join the war and provide critical support to the struggling rebels .
But Arnold received a near - fatal shot to the same leg wounded at Quebec and would never walk again without a limp .
While Arnold lay immobilized in an Albany hospital , his commander , Major Gen. Horatio Gates , peevishly claimed credit for the British surrender .
" Bedridden and helpless , Benedict Arnold gnashed his teeth at the distressing thought of ' Granny Gates ' receiving honors won by the blood and grit of better men , " writes Palmer .
Reassessing his sacrifices and rewards , Arnold grew bitter .
He was financially strapped , his wife had died during his absence , and his personal honor had been attacked .
" Poison may have stopped oozing from his leg , " Palmer writes , " but his heart remained full of rancor . "
Much of his anger focused on civilian leaders in Congress who stinted on supplies for the military and failed to acknowledge the contributions made by fighting patriots .
" How can Congress allow this army to starve in a land of plenty ? " he penned indignantly .
With popular support for the American cause waning , Arnold felt that the country was worse off than it had been before the Revolution .
Washington appointed Arnold military commander of Philadelphia in June 1778 , his disability preventing another field commission .
As he badgered Congress on behalf of veterans and families , Arnold 's contempt for the architects of the Revolution hardened .
He was infuriated by what he saw as politically motivated accusations that he had misused his military powers .
" Having made every sacrifice of fortune and blood , and become a cripple in the service of my country , I little expected to meet the ungrateful returns I have received from my countrymen , " he wrote to Washington .
Treason .
Unfairly convicted on and reprimanded for two misdemeanor counts of dereliction of duty , Arnold was disgraced at the hands of men he blamed for corrupting the Revolution .
Soon afterward , he wrote his first treasonous letter to British Maj .
John André .
" The only sensible course , in Arnold 's mind , was to return his political loyalty to the British parent nation before everything was lost , " says Martin .
Unaware of his deep unhappiness , Washington granted Arnold command of West Point , a crucial defense .
In secret code letters , Arnold plotted to sell West Point to the enemy for 20,000 British pounds ( as much as $ 3 million in today 's dollars ) .
But Major André was intercepted with plans to West Point in his boot .
Tipped off , Arnold escaped .
The nation quickly turned against its hero .
" Washington knew that they had to destroy this guy top , bottom , and sideways , " says Martin , " and forever associate him with treason . "
André was hanged and Arnold erased from military records .
With astonishing speed , his name was linked with Satan's , an example for anyone tempted to switch sides .
" The tragedy of Benedict Arnold is that his incredible acts on behalf of the cause of liberty have been washed away and basically forgotten , " says Martin .
Arnold received a commission from Britain , along with his 20,000 pounds , and he led raids on Virginia and New London , Conn. , before decamping with his new wife and baby to London , where he was not embraced .
" Nobody likes a traitor , even if he 's your traitor , " observes Palmer .
He died in 1801 , his war injuries dogging him to the end .
So lately I have been getting more contacts through my contact page on this site , and they are all directed at me to try out this new cool system .
The first guy , Cam , sent me a link to try out but it was via the tinyURL service , so I told him I do n’t click on such links , and he sent me a link that included an affiliate ID .
Never click on tinyURL links or any odd looking links , unless you know who they come from .
His e-mail is [ email protected ] , if you want to help sign the dirtbag up for spam .
The second person to contact me , Steve Walters , wanted me to sign up for a service as well , where I would make tiny bits of income on huge ad deals , that would most likely never happen , and in reality would only make the original ad company huge amounts of money .
His e-mail address is [ email protected ] , again , feel free to sign him up for spam .
The third person was Curtis Fullmer , who did n’t even try to hide that the link he was sending was a referral link .
Even worse , he did n’t send it correctly , meaning if I did click on it , he would not have gotten the referral from me .
He said how excited he was for this new program , and when I called him no being a spammer and sending me junk , he said sorry , and said he was new to the blogging world .
Two seconds later on Google , what do I find ?

He deserves some extra helpings of spam .
In his last e-mail to me , he said that he jumped to fast in e-mailing me , and I hope that this post , and any spam he receives will be a constant reminder for him .
None of these people tried to build relationships with me , they did n’t give me the option to sign up without using their referral ID , and they are just plain old spammers in my book .
Hopefully , none of you will be tricked by these people , and think twice before sending me any more of such spams .
I am a friendly person , and I love new programs , but if you try to profit off me , and you are n’t a friend and disclosing that fact , then you should n’t be allowed on the Internet .

Jet suits to the rescue on Britain 's mountains
Posted
A pioneering jet suit company is adding super - human power to the response of emergency services on Britain 's mountains .
WASHINGTON The Cuban government has finally blocked access to a Web log written by Yoani Sanchez , a young woman who has caused a sensation on the communist - ruled island with her daily postings about life in Havana .
But she says she has found a way to outsmart her censors .
In the spirit of Soviet - era samizdats and Czechoslovakias Charter 77 , her blog , www.desdecuba.com/generaciony, lives on .
Sanchez is a linguistics graduate in her early 30s , with a husband more than two decades her senior and a 12 - year old son .
Her parents sent her to a revolutionary school in rural Cuba , where she became a young communist pioneer . 
But once she graduated from college , she was unable to pursue an academic career because her thesis on dictatorships in Latin American literature sounded , to the authorities , like a chronicle of life at home .
She and her husband eke out a living by providing services to tourists .
In order to blog , Sanchez has been sneaking into Internet cafes in hotels reserved for foreigners .
A typical visit involves quickly uploading her blog entries from a flash memory card to her Web site , which is linked to a server in Germany .
Since only 200,000 Cubansout of a total of 11 million have access to the Internet , it is unclear how many of her compatriots read her postings .
But apparently many do .
Apart from legal users , mostly government employees and researchers , there are countless clandestine Internet links in homes around the country .
The blog has become so popular inside and outside Cuba that it received 1.2 million visits in February alone .
A measure of her popularity is how quickly the word spread that the government had blocked access to the blog last week .
 It will seem amazing that with such a limited access to the Internet , Cubans have noticed the censoring of these Web pages so quickly , but it was so ,  she wrote .
 After being warned by many nervous readers , I went to a cybercafe and confirmed the censorship . 
It is ironic that the clampdown should have taken place precisely when Raul Castro is lifting restrictions on the sale of computers , DVD players and cell phones .
After all , the brother of Fidel Castro has been encouraging Cubans to debate problems openly the reason why , in a famous incident depicted on YouTube and other sites , Eliecer Avila , a student from Havanas University of Computer Science , confronted Ricardo Alarcon , the head of the National Assembly , over restrictions on travel abroad .
With a straight face , Alarcon explained that there are 6 billion people in the world and that it would be impossible for all of them to fly at the same time .
Sanchezs blog has responded to the challenge in characteristic style :
 The anonymous censors of our famished blog have tried to lock me up in the room , turn my lights off and prevent my friends from coming in ....
However , the punishment is so useless that it invites pity and so easy to elude that it becomes an incentive . 
What has probably unnerved the regime is not so much her attacks on the Castro brothers as her vivid description of daily life how Cubans register their cows as oxen to avoid having to sell the milk to the government , how people get paid in worthless Cuban pesos but have to obtain convertible pesos on the black market in order to buy soap , and how the timid reforms put in practice by Raul Castro so far amount to the legalization of global technology that is beyond his control .
Still , she despairs the pace of reform .
In one entry , she says that the toaster will come in two years  time ... satellite dishes will arrive in the middle of the century and my grandchildren will get to know GPS in their teen years . 
Where does this woman get her courage ?
A little anecdote from a recent entry in her blog perhaps contains a clue .
Referring to her familys
Easter celebration , she regretted that there would be an empty chair because of a missing relative Adolfo Fernandez Sainz , one of the 75 independent journalists jailed by the Castro regime five years ago .
And she expressed the hope that no one would deserve the phrase hurled at her by her young son when he learned of those detentions :
 So , you are still free because you are a bit cowardly . 
It seems unlikely .
Having failed to seal a deal with Microsoft , Yahoo co-founder and chief executive Jerry Yang could face a shareholder revolt led by multi-billionaire investor Carl Icahn .
The New York Times has publicly harangued him for failing his fiduciary duty , and the Wall Street Journal has drawn up a list of potential successors .
Your online bookie could soon be calling the odds .
Meanwhile , Yang looks out of his depth .
He co-founded Yahoo with David Filo when they were Stanford University graduate students , but in 1995 , the two friends immediately hired an experienced chief executive officer in the form of Tim Koogle .
He 'd been president of Intermec Corporation in Seattle and spent nine years at Motorola .
Over the next half - dozen years , until May 2001 , it was Koogle , not Yang , who turned Yahoo into a leading internet company .
Terry Semel , a 24 - year veteran from Warner Brothers , then took over and took Yahoo further into the content business he knew well .
But ( incredibly ) he missed the opportunity to buy Google , and shareholders became fractious as the price of Google 's shares rocketed ahead while , during his six - year tenure , Yahoo's climbed only 5 % per year .
He resigned in June 2007 .
Replacing Semel with Yang was supposed to make the shareholders feel reassured .
They did n't know he was walking into a Microsoft - fanned firestorm .
In fact , being Yahoo's co-founder put Yang in a worse position than if he'd been a hired gun from Wal - Mart or Warner Brothers .
It enabled New York Times writer Joe Nocera to castigate him for failing to secure a deal .
" It does n't matter that you would like Yahoo to remain independent , or that you can't stand Microsoft , " Nocera thundered .
" Your feelings are n't supposed to get in the way of your fiduciary duty . "
But finding a replacement for Yang could be tricky .
Yahoo may have avoided being swallowed up by Microsoft , but Google is already eating its lunch .
Yahoo's last meal - its strength in display advertising - could soon come under threat .
The company needs a turnaround specialist who can capitalise on the good things Yahoo has bought ( Flickr , Delicious , Upcoming ) while doing something about the ones for which it paid billions ( GeoCities , eGroups , Broadcast.com etc ) .
Kara Swisher has put up a list of potential candidates at the Wall Street Journal 's All Things Digital , but none fit the turnaround bill .
Sue Decker ?
She 's Yahoo's president , and the crowd is baying for fresh blood , not just Yang's .
Meg Whitman of eBay fame ?
She 's a star , but why would she accept the poisoned chalice ?
Marc Andreessen , co-founder of Netscape ?
Sorry , we have n't forgotten what happened to them .
Suddenly , getting taken over by Microsoft might not sound such a bad idea ...
So we 've now plunged into the turbid waters of the age - old expediency versus principle debate .
Three times now in the space of a week , Barack Obama has departed from what would seem to be liberal principle : his refusal to accept public financing for the general election , his decision to vote for a bill that gives American telecoms retroactive immunity from prosecution for cooperating with the Bush administration 's surveillance initiatives and his statement siding with the supreme court 's conservative minority that on Wednesday voted to permit the death penalty for child rapists .
Denunciations are ringing across the blogosphere .
We 'll go through the issues individually .
But the larger question here is about how far a candidate for president can go to inoculate himself against likely attacks – attacks that have a proven track record of working – before he's no longer the candidate you believed in a year ago .
On the issues in question : With regard to public financing , I think that only serious campaign - finance wonks have really complained about Obama 's decision .
Most people understand that if he opted in , he'd be sacrificing probably at least $ 200 m , likely more .
In addition , Obama 's average contribution is $ 90 , so , while he obviously has raked in his share of fat - cat money , he 's also established , via the internet , a model of fundraising that 's far more democratic and open to regular people of regular means .
He should have been more honest in the way he talked about his decision , but , substantively , he did the right and necessary thing .
The other two matters get thornier .
Few issues have rankled liberals – and constitutionalists , of which Obama is clearly one – like the Bush administration 's arrogation of executive power , including its surveillance operations .
Intense negotiations on the question of telecom immunity – that is , whether innocent parties could sue them on grounds that their privacy was violated – have been a sticking point for months .
Democrats who wanted to remove immunity from the bill lost the fight , and last week the details of the final bill became public .
Obama announced then that he'd be supporting the bill , with the immunity provisions .
It passed the Senate today by 80 - 15 ( Obama was out campaigning and missed the vote but of course was already on record as for it ) .
Obama says the bill has its good points , notably that it " firmly re-establishes basic judicial oversight over all domestic surveillance in the future . "
The operative word there is " basic " , since the judicial review is mostly after - the - fact .
The improvements over current practice are on the margins .
It 's not a good bill all - in - all , but given that only 15 senators opposed it , the Democrats obviously did n't have anywhere near the votes to get a stronger bill .
On the Supreme Court decision , Kennedy v Louisiana , most liberals are implacably opposed to the death penalty , and the idea of extending it to non-murderers is abhorrent to many people .
So the sight of the Democratic nominee saying that the death penalty was an appropriate remedy in this case has been tough for some folks to swallow .
Tough for others to swallow is what Patrick Kennedy did .
He repeatedly raped his eight - year - old stepdaughter , causing massive internal injuries .
He left her to die , but her life was saved by multiple surgeries .
Substantively , Obama 's position is in keeping with past statements .
He 's never been a blanket opponent of the death penalty , supporting it in cases where " the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage . "
One can disagree with that position , and I do .
But it 's kind of hard to argue that a crime like Kennedy 's is n't deserving of the full measure of outrage .
But here 's the thing .
Kennedy is African - American .
It 's pretty easy to envision the attack ad that could be made against Obama if he'd taken the position here some liberals wanted him to take .
An image of Kennedy appears on the screen , photo - shopped to make him look terrifying .
Sinister music swells .
The voiceover intones : " Barack Obama wants criminals like Patrick Kennedy to have a chance to go free so they can rape children again . "
And so on .
That one ad , aired repeatedly in the right states , could in my view change the election .
We know that ads like that have worked wonders for the GOP in the past .
Yes , the political circumstances have changed since Mike Dukakis 's time .
But have they changed that much ?
I do n't think so .
And I can't blame people working in a campaign for deciding not to take that chance .
Liberals do n't have to be happy about these decisions , and those who want to attack Obama and hold his feet to the fire and so forth should do so to their heart 's content .
But it 's worth remembering that a presidential campaign is one of the worst contexts in which to expect or demand ideological consistency .
Obama has , in fact , taken a number of strong stands that might hurt him .
He did back the supreme court on habeas corpus rights for non-citizen detainees – not a popular position .
He 's against offshore oil drilling while polls are showing that majorities support it .
His is a position that could harm him in the crucial state of Florida , but he 's taken it .
He 'll presumably continue to stand his ground on opposing the federal gas - tax repeal , a position John McCain might choose to revive at some point .
And he will have to defend this fall his support for increasing the capital gains tax by up to 10 % , as he will assuredly be attacked for that .
He supports a large cap - and - trade scheme on carbon emissions that will surely be attacked as a tax on business .
And so on .
I 've always objected to setting up principle as a value that 's oppositional to winning .
To me , winning is a principle .
It 's the highest principle there is .
If you win the election , you can do at least some of the good things that will improve people 's lives in the country and around the world .
If you lose it , you can't do any of them .
People will naturally disagree on which compromises are necessary and which ones are n't .
What people should n't disagree on is that some are .
The man 's not running for president of Hyde Park .
A species of chameleon that spends most of its short life as an egg has been discovered by conservationists in Madagascar .
The unusual reptile , known as Labord 's chameleon , develops inside an egg for up to nine months , but after hatching lives only a few months longer , during which it rapidly matures , mates and dies .
Because the chameleons all hatch at the same time , the entire population is the same age , apart from a very brief period when adults are still alive after laying their eggs .
The life cycle is more akin to that of insects than reptiles or any other four - legged vertebrate , researchers said .
Kristopher Karsten , a zoologist at Oklahoma State University , working with scientists in Madagascar and at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , discovered the reptile 's unusual lifestyle during field studies over five seasons in the arid south - west of the island .
Hatchlings emerged at the beginning of the rainy season , around November , and reached sexual maturity within two months .
By the beginning of February the chameleons had already started to show signs of old age , becoming slower , losing weight and occasionally falling out of trees because their grip had weakened .
Some were found dead on the forest floor from unknown causes .
Writing in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the team says the animal may have compressed its lifespan to cope with extremes of weather in Madagascar .
" The notorious rapid death of chameleons in captivity may , for some species , actually represent the natural adult life span , " they said .
Compared with 2006 , there have been increases in fertility rates for all age groups except for women under 20 .
The highest percentage increase was observed for women aged 40 and over with an increase of 6 per cent compared with the previous year .
Firefox 3 , the long - awaited update of Mozilla 's open source web browser was released earlier today .
The download counter , which is projected on a large display screen here at Mozilla headquarters in Mountain View , CA , has been churning numbers at a rapid pace all morning .
The display shows that Firefox has now exceeded 1 million downloads , with between 5,000 and 14,000 downloads per minute .
The rapid pace at which the downloads are occurring makes it difficult to compute an exact total .
The counter appears to be lagging behind the actual count , and Mozilla 's statisticians say that the number could be as high as 3 million just four hours after Firefox 's official launch .
Users can follow along at home by watching the counter at the official site .
Firefox 3 downloads have already exceeded the total number of downloads that took place in the first 24 hours after the Firefox 2 release .
This is a significant milestone for Mozilla , which hopes that Firefox 3 will set the world record for the most software downloaded in a 24 - hour period .
The display shows a breakdown by country , which indicates that the highest number of downloads is coming from the United States , followed by Germany and Spain .
The US alone has reached over half a million downloads .
The Firefox team is in full celebration mode here at Mozilla headquarters .
People are watching the numbers and excitedly discussing plans for Firefox 3.1 , the next update .
I met up with Mozilla user experience designer Alex Faaborg , who shared some thoughts about potential user interface enhancements for the 3.1 update .
He says that privacy improvements , like the private browsing mode feature , are being considered for inclusion .
I also talked to Mozilla mobile director Jay Sullivan , who says that development on Firefox 's Fennec project is accelerating now that Firefox 3 is out the door .
The big focus now , he says , is on increasing pan and zoom performance .
The Firefox 3 launch has far exceeded the expectations of the Mozilla staff members with whom I have spoken today .
There is a strong sense of awe as they watch the climbing numbers validate their accomplishment .
Haters of the mainstream media reheated a bit of conventional wisdom last week .
Barack Obama , they said , was getting a free ride from those insufferable liberals .
Such pronouncements , sorry to say , tend to be wrong since they describe a monolithic media that no longer exists .
Information today cascades from countless outlets and channels , from the Huffington Post to Politico.com to CBS News and beyond .
But now there ’s additional evidence that casts doubt on the bias claims aimed -- with particular venom -- at three broadcast networks .
Advertisement
The Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University , where researchers have tracked network news content for two decades , found that ABC , NBC and CBS were tougher on Obama than on Republican John McCain during the first six weeks of the general - election campaign .
You read it right : tougher on the Democrat .
During the evening news , the majority of statements from reporters and anchors on all three networks are neutral , the center found .
And when network news people ventured opinions in recent weeks , 28 % of the statements were positive for Obama and 72 % negative .
Network reporting also tilted against McCain , but far less dramatically , with 43 % of the statements positive and 57 % negative , according to the Washington - based media center .
Advertisement
Conservatives have been snarling about the grotesque disparity revealed by another study , the online Tyndall Report , which showed Obama receiving more than twice as much network air time as McCain in the last month and a half .
Obama got 166 minutes of coverage in the seven weeks after the end of the primary season , compared with 67 minutes for McCain , according to longtime network - news observer Andrew Tyndall .
I wrote last week that the networks should do more to better balance the air time .
But I also suggested that much of the attention to Obama was far from glowing .
That earned a spasm of e-mails that described me as irrational , unpatriotic and . . . somehow . . . French .
But the center ’s director , Robert Lichter , who has won conservative hearts with several of his previous studies , told me the facts were the facts .
Advertisement
“ This information should blow away this silly assumption that more coverage is always better coverage , ” he said .
Here ’s a bit more on the research , so you ’ll understand how the communications professor and his researchers arrived at their conclusions .
The center reviews and “ codes ” statements on the evening news as positive or negative toward the candidates .
For example , when NBC reporter Andrea Mitchell said in June that Obama “ has problems ” with white men and suburban women , the media center deemed that a negative .
The positive and negative remarks about each candidate are then totaled to calculate the percentages that cut for and against them .
Advertisement
Visual images and other more subjective cues are not assessed .
But the tracking applies a measure of analytical rigor to a field rife with seat - of - the - pants fulminations .
The media center ’s most recent batch of data covers nightly newscasts beginning June 8 , the day after Hillary Rodham Clinton conceded the Democratic nomination , ushering in the start of the general - election campaign .
The data ran through Monday , as Obama began his overseas trip .
Most on - air statements during that time could not be classified as positive or negative , Lichter said .
The study found , on average , less than two opinion statements per night on the candidates on all three networks combined -- not exactly embracing or pummeling Obama or McCain .
But when a point of view did emerge , it tended to tilt against Obama .
That was a reversal of the trend during the primaries , when the same researchers found that 64 % of statements about Obama -- new to the political spotlight -- were positive , but just 43 % of statements about McCain were positive .
Advertisement
Such reversals are nothing new in national politics , as reporters tend to warm up to newcomers , then turn increasingly critical when such candidates emerge as front - runners .
It might be tempting to discount the latest findings by Lichter ’s researchers .
But this guy is anything but a liberal toady .
In 2006 , conservative cable showmen Glenn Beck and Bill O’Reilly had Lichter , a onetime Fox News contributor , on their programs .
They heralded his findings in the congressional midterm election : that the networks were giving far more positive coverage to the Democrats .
More proof of the liberal domination of the media , Beck and O’Reilly declared .
Advertisement
Now the same researchers have found something less palatable to those conspiracy theorists .
But do n’t expect cable talking heads to end their trashing of the networks .
Repeated assertions that the networks are in the tank for Democrats represent not only an article of faith on Fox , but a crucial piece of branding .
On Thursday night , O’Reilly and his trusty lieutenant Bernard Goldberg worked themselves into righteous indignation -- again -- about the liberal bias they knew was lurking .
Goldberg seemed gleeful beyond measure in saying that “ they ’re fiddling while their ratings are burning . ”
Advertisement
O’Reilly assured viewers that “ the folks ” -- whom he claims to treasure far more than effete network executives do -- “ understand what ’s happening . ”
By the way , Lichter ’s group also surveys the first half - hour of “ Special Report With Brit Hume , ” Fox News ’ answer to the network evening news shows .
The review found that , since the start of the general - election campaign , “ Special Report ” offered more opinions on the two candidates than all three networks combined .
No surprise there .
Previous research has shown Fox News to be opinion - heavy .
Advertisement
“ Special Report ” was tougher than the networks on Obama -- with 79 % of the statements about the Democrat negative , compared with 61 % negative on McCain .
There ’s plenty of room for questioning the networks ’ performance and watching closely for symptoms of Obamamania .
But could we at least remain focused on what ABC , NBC and CBS actually put on the air , rather than illusions that their critics create to puff themselves up ?

Semantics of IO : A Free Approach
The following is inspired by Luke Palmer 's post .
This only describes one possible semantics of IO a ; your actually implementation may vary .
The idea is to define IO as
data IO a = Done a | PutChar Char ( IO a ) | GetChar ( Char -> IO a )
For simplicity this an example of IO that only gives semantics for teletype IO .
Think of IO a as a tree whose leaves are Done a that holds the result of the program .
PutChar is a node that has one child tree and the node holds one character of data .
GetChar is a node that has many children ; it has one child for every Char , but GetChar holds no data itself .
This tree contains all the information needed to execute teletype interactions .
One interprets ( or executes ) an IO a by tracing a route from root of the tree to a leaf .
If a PutChar node is encountered , the character data contained at that node is output to the terminal and then its subtree is executed .
It is at this point that Haskell code evaluated in order to determine what character should be displayed before continuing .
If a GetChar node is encountered , a character is read from the terminal ( blocking if necessary ) and the subtree corresponding to the character received is executed .
If Done is encountered the program ends .
Done holds the result of the computation , but in the case of main :: IO ( ) the data is of type ( ) and thus contains no information and is ignored .
This execution is not done anywhere in a haskell program , rather it is done by the run -time system .
The monadic operations are defined as follows :
return :: a -> IO a return x = Done x ( >>= ) :: IO a -> ( a -> IO b ) -> IO b Done x >>= f = f x PutChar c x >>= f = PutChar c ( x >>= f ) GetChar g >>= f = GetChar ( \ c -> g c >>= f )
As you can see return is just another name for Done .
The bind operation takes a tree x and a function f and replaces the Done nodes ( the leaves ) of x by a new tree produce by applying f to the data held in the Done nodes .
The primitive IO commands are defined using these constructors .
putChar :: Char -> IO ( ) putChar x = PutChar x ( Done ( ) ) getChar :: IO Char getChar = GetChar ( \ c -> Done c )
The function putChar builds a small IO ( ) tree that contains one PutChar node holding the character data followed by Done .
The function getChar builds a short IO Char tree that begins with a GetChar that holds one Done node holding every character .
Other teletype commands can be defined in terms of these primitives
putStr :: String -> IO ( ) putStr = mapM_ putChar
More generally speaking , IO a will represent the desired interaction with the operating system .
For every system call there will be a corresponding constructor in IOTree of the form
| SysCallName p1 p2 ... pn ( r -> IO a )
BRUSSELS  European officials proposed scaling back drastically on their goal of increasing Europe ’s use of biofuels , a major about - face on a central environmental and energy issue .
At the same time , a new report by the British government cast fresh doubt on fuels made from crops as a way to the fight climate change .
Until recently , European governments had sought to lead the rest of the world in the use of biofuels , aiming to derive 10 percent of Europe ’s transportation fuels from biofuels by 2020 .
But the allure has dimmed amid growing evidence that the kind of goals proposed by the European Union are contributing to deforestation , which speeds climate change , and helping force up food prices .
“ I think when we will look back we will say this was the beginning of a turning point for Europe on biofuels , ” said Juan Delgado , a research fellow specializing in energy and climate change at Breugel , a research organization in Brussels .
“ It will be very difficult now for Europe to stick by its targets . ”
About 10 months have passed since the I - 35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River during afternoon rush hour , killing 13 people and injuring 145 .
Construction of the bridge ’s $ 234 million replacement may be finished in mid-September , three months ahead of schedule , earning builders a $ 20 million bonus .
The Minnesota Legislature and Gov. Tim Pawlenty have agreed on a $ 38 million state fund to help compensate the victims of the Aug. 1 disaster .
All ’s well , eh ? Perhaps for this bridge in this city .
But nationwide , all is not well .
Road , bridge and other important public - works infrastructure continue to age and deteriorate as Congress dithers elsewhere .
Only disasters move our representatives to act — and in an election year , even those actions seem spotty at best and disingenuous at worst .
The United States has much more than failing bridges to find , fund and fix .
The proposals of the remaining presidential candidates do little to inspire faith that they understand the breadth of the problem or have the political skill , will and courage to address it forthrightly .
In December , a commission established by Congress in 2005 under the Safe , Accountable , Flexible , Efficient Transportation Equity Actâ€ ” A Legacy for Users ( SAFETEA -LU ) provided the sobering statistics .
The United States needs to spend $ 225 billion annually — more than twice what it does now — for the next 50 years .
That ’s more than $ 11 trillion worth of fix-ups on surface transportation systems alone .
But at the moment , the only bill of significance floating through Congress is the National Infrastructure Bank Act written by Sens.
Chris Dodd and Chuck Hagel .
It ’s backed by the American Society of Civil Engineers because it “ would establish an independent entity of the federal government to evaluate and finance ‘ capacity - building ’ infrastructure projects of substantial regional and national significance [ emphasis added ] … ”
The word “ local ” is absent from the bill , so those potholes ruining your car ’s suspension will just have to wait .
( The bill has other problems as well . )
And what about the nation ’s dams , most of which are non-federal ?
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers newsletter , “ ASCE ’s 2005 Report Card for America ’s Infrastructure conferred a grade of D on the nation ’s dams , the same grade as that for U.S. infrastructure as a whole . ”
According to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials :
• There are more than 87,000 dams currently under state regulation
â€¢ 10,127 have been classified as high hazard , meaning they pose a serious threat to human life if they should fail
• Of those high hazard dams , 1,333 have been identified as structurally deficient or unsafe
• The average dam inspector in the US is responsible for more than 400 dams .
The ASDSO recommends that each inspector is responsible for fewer than 50 dams .
The Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act has passed the House and now has been parked in the Senate ’s Committee on Environment and Public Works since October .
But the bill only provides a total of $ 200 million through 2012 .
Erosion on a levee by the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet
And when the levee breaks ?
New Orleans is not the only political entity concerned with failures of levees , as happened during Hurricane Katrina .
And hurricanes are not the only threat to levee systems .
In Northern California , “ more than 1,100 miles of aging levees in the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta and its watersheds … contain the fuel that powers the world ’s 6th largest economy — water , ” according to the state agency that administers the system .
“ It has been estimated that the loss to California ’s economy could be $ 30 to $ 40 billion in the event of massive levee failures caused by a 6.5 magnitude earthquake in the Delta region . …
Over the past century , 140 levee failures have been recorded ” in the 100 - year - old levee system that traverses nearly 6,000 miles .
A National Levee Safety Program
Act has been introduced for three successive years but has failed to advance through Congress .
Presidential candidate Barack Obama ’s
Web site only indicates unspecified support for “ the Water Resources and Development Act , which will provide funding for modernizing the Mississippi and Illinois Riversâ€™ system of locks and dams . ”
President Bush vetoed the bill in November only to be over - ridden by Congress .
Still , this falls far short of needed levee and flood - protection system overhauls and repairs nationwide .
Flushed a toilet lately ?
There ’s what a PBS report called “ the invisible infrastructure .
These are the pipes buried underneath cities and towns that deliver clean water and carry away any waste water . ”
Sewerage infrastructure alone in the nation ’s cities is a half - trillion - dollar problem , the report says , and communities are trapped in a Catch - 22 : “ Federal grants for communities to improve their wastewater treatment infrastructure has dried to a trickle over recent decades .
Yet communities are compelled by the Clean Water Act , signed into law in 1972 , to treat and purify wastewater . ”
Without needed work on deteriorating wastewater plants , count on sewer overflows , polluted water and disease outbreaks to threaten local communities .
Now , an underfunded Clean Water
Act represents unfunded mandates on the states , which cannot afford the cost .
What ’s coming out of the faucet ?
The population of the United States has grown by about 100 million since the Clean Water Act was passed .
Americans dispose of more waterborne waste than ever .
Earlier this year , the Associated Press reported “ [ a ] vast array of pharmaceuticals — including antibiotics , anti-convulsants , mood stabilizers and sex hormones — have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans . ” 
But “ federal funding for clean water has been on a steady decline .
Overall the federal government contribution to total clean water spending has shrunk dramatically — from 78 % in 1978 to just 3 % today , ” according to Food and Water Watch .
The Clean Water Act of 1972 , written by Sens. Edmund Muskie and Howard Baker , has provided more than $ 72 billion over the past 35 years to allow states to fund local and regional water and wastewater treatment facilities .
According to Food and Water Watch , a consortium opposed to privatization of water facilities , President Bush has steadily cut funds for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund , which provides direct aid to states :
In 2007 , the U.S. House of Representatives took an important step to keep America ’s water clean and safe by authorizing $ 14 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund for the next four years .
This state revolving loan fund offers critical funds needed to close the 20 - year , $ 440 billion shortfall between available funds and what is needed to ensure that America ’s drinking water and water sources meet minimum standards established by the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act .
But that ’s only $ 3.5 billion a year for four years to resolve a $ 440 billion problem .
That ’s not all .
What about refineries , pipelines , mass transit systems , transmission lines for electricity , air traffic control , weather forecasting systems , and aging chemical and nuclear plants ?
Failure to address long - standing , critical infrastructure needs is a threat to national security .
But the political stances taken by the remaining presidential candidates , as evidenced by issues positions on their Web sites , do not reflect necessary urgency regarding the nation ’s infrastructure needs .
Their positions are vague , and financial proposals offer a scant percentage of what ’s needed .
Take , for example , Sen . Obama ’s issues statement under “ Keeping Our Drinking Water Safe “ :
He seeks “ $ 37.5 million over 5 years for drinking water systems to upgrade their monitoring and security efforts [ emphasis added ] . ”
But the long - term physical viability of those facilities is never mentioned .
To Sen .
Obama ’s credit , he says he will “ pursue a major investment in our utility grid to enable a tremendous increase in renewable generation and accommodate modern energy requirements , such as reliability , smart metering , and distributed storage [ emphasis added ] . ”
But that investment is unspecified , as most campaign promises of presidential candidates usually are .
It is merely a “ talking point . ”
Sen .
Obama does have an issues plank for “ transportation . ”
He seeks “ a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank ” to be funded by $ 60 billion over 10 years to supplant current federal spending .
Frankly , that ’s a pittance , and the senator ’s accompanying fact sheet does not explain how it will be funded .
The only references to infrastructure on the issues section of presidential candidate John McCain ’s
Web site are contained in his agenda on climate change : “ A Comprehensive Plan Will Address The Full Range Of Issues : Infrastructure , Ecosystems , Resource Planning , And Emergency Preparation ” and in his statement of stewardship of natural resources : “ Ensuring clean air , safe and healthy water . ”
On Aug. 8 , just seven days following the I - 35W bridge collapse , presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled her “ Rebuild America Plan ” in a speech in Rochester , Minn .
The plan would :
• establish a $ 10 billion “ emergency repair fund ” to address the backlog of critical infrastructure repairs .
( That ’s spread over 10 years , or only $ 1 billion a year . )
• provide $ 250 million in “ emergency assessment grants ” to the states to conduct immediate safety reviews of their high - priority , high - risk infrastructure assets .
( That ’s insufficient to deal with 50 states ’ needs . )
• appoint a commission to carry out a comprehensive assessment of our engineering review standards so to better prioritize needed repairs on bridges and roads .
( More study ?
Sure .
Why not ? )
It ’s worth wondering if this plan existed prior to Aug .
1 . It appears wholly inadequate to begin to address the nation ’s infrastructure needs .
Her plan also promises improvements to mass transit , modernization of ports ( in partnership with local governments and the private sector ) and congestion - reduction actions .
Her plan ’s cost ?
The total cost of Hillary Clinton ’s infrastructure agenda is approximately $ 3 billion per year .
Hillary will finance this cost without increasing the deficit by dedicating a portion of the revenue from her efforts to improve the efficiency of our government .
These efforts will include implementing the GAO ’s recommendations for reducing improper federal payments , which could save up to $ 4 billion per year [ GAO , 2007 ] ; better managing the federal government ’s surplus property , which could save $ 500 million – $ 1 billion per year [ CAGW 2006 ; GAO 2007 ] ; freezing the federal travel budget , which could save about $ 1 billion per year [ PPI , 2007 ] ; and streamlining the federal vehicle fleet , which could save about $ 500 million per year [ GAO 2007 ] .
[ emphasis added ]
Improve the efficiency of government ?
How often have taxpayers and voters been fed that unpalatable pablum ?
In the years to come , expect insignificant progress on repair , renovation and renewal of the means by which the nation cleans and distributes water , provides electricity , transports goods and people and protects against the insults of nature .
Why ?
Pick a reason .
Begin with a press that rarely reports on infrastructure — until disaster happens — and has failed to sufficiently prod candidates on the issue during the plentiful presidential “ debates . ”
Politicians need to get elected and stay elected , hence their choice of issues that play well in media .
They need issues with buzz .
Infrastructure has too little .
The cost is too high .
Politicians fear taking responsibility for tax hikes .
There ’s a war in Iraq , a country in which the United States has sunk about $ 520 billion to help Iraq make significant progress on repair , renovation and renewal of the means by which Iraq cleans and distributes water , provides electricity , transports goods and people and protects against the insults of nature .
Meanwhile , rust continues accumulate at home .

For nine years I lived in million dollar homes for free and it is something that anyone who is neat and conscientious can easily do .
My junior year in college , a professor who I had assisted received a year long sabbatical to live in a foreign country .
During that time , he needed someone to housesit his house and asked me if I would be willing to do it .
I paid no rent although I did need to pay for utilities .
All that was required of me was to do some basic house and garden maintenance and keep the place clean .
On the recommendation of the junior year house sitting job , I received another year of free rent my senior year from a professor doing a teacher exchange for a year .
Upon graduating form college , I ended up in the Lake Tahoe , CA area and using my two recommendations from college and a small advertisement in the local paper , landed a two year long stint in a beautiful home a stone ’s throw away from the lake .
It was the second home of a couple who had been transferred to Europe on business and needed someone to take care of the property while they were gone .
Even after I got married , my wife and I continued to live rent free in million dollar vacation homes as housesitters .
It was n’t until we decided to have children of our own that we decided to purchase a house after being able to live rent free for 9 years ( 5 while I was single and 4 more while married ) .
That 9 years of rent free living ( although I was always responsible for the utilities ) enable us to save over $ 100,000 toward a house purchase since I paid rent to myself during the entire time .
Getting started is the hard part
By far the most difficult part of housesitting is to get that first job and it ’s not that difficult to do .
I lucked into mine as mentioned above , but others ( you tend to meet others that are doing the same thing in your area when you housesit ) said it just took a bit of promoting themselves and getting the word out .
Once you get the first opportunity and do a good job , opportunities after that become much easier to secure through recommendations and word of mouth .
Being neat and responsible is essential
Once you have a job housesitting , being both neat and responsible are essential if you want to get more jobs in the future .
The easiest way to get a bad name is to leave the house a mess when the owners return or have them hear about parties or other events that took place while they were gone .
Being single helps
Being single helps since you will be moving on a yearly basis or so to new places .
It ’s possible to do it being married without kids as well , but both of you have to enjoy it and be willing to move frequently .
Once you have kids , it pretty much becomes impossible to do with the constant moving and the damage that kids can do to a house .
Basic maintenance skills help
What will be required to do as part of the housesitting can vary , but basically you will need to do regular maintenance and yard work .
As you move into higher end houses , you wo n’t even need to do yard work as most will have gardeners come by to do it on a regular basis .
You must live light
Since the houses are furnished and you will be moving often , you have to be willing to live light without a lot of your own stuff .
Even my wardrobe was fairly limited .
I never bought my own TV until we moved into a house of our own .
If you have a lot of stuff , there just is n’t room for it and it makes moving more difficult when it ’s time to switch housesitting jobs .
Liking pets will increase opportunities
If you like pets ( but do n’t have any of your own ) you will increase the chances of landing a housesitting job .
For those people that have been transferred overseas for a specific period , they often need someone to take care of their pets as well as housesit .
Location , location , location
There are definitely certain locations that make it a lot easier to secure these jobs than others .
Holiday vacation spots where people often buy a second home are a great place to find these opportunities as well as college and university towns .
Flexibility with work helps
Having a job that has some flexibility helps quite a bit .
There is never a guarantee where housesitting jobs are available so you may have to move a little out of the area to secure one .
Having a job that requires you live in a certain area can make that difficult while having a job where to can live anywhere can open up a lot of opportunities .
Programs are n’t worth the effort
Unless you have true flexibility to move anywhere to housesit , joining one of the many programs that help people find these jobs is not worth the cost .
That ’s because any advertisement will receive multiple offers making the competition for the jobs quite competitive .
Working to let your friends and family know that you are looking to housesit along with placing a small ad in the local paper give you a much better chance of landing your first housesitting opportunity .
Housesitting is a great way to reduce the cost of room and board while at college and a great way to save money when you are first making it on your own .
The more contacts that you make and the more references you have , the bigger and better houses that you will have an opportunity to housesit .
With a little time and effort , you can find you ’re saving thousands of dollars a year on rent .

BOSTON ( Reuters ) -
The largest contractor in Boston ’s $ 15 billion “ Big Dig ” road and tunnel construction project filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday , one business day after it was charged with liability in a 2006 collapse .
Construction workers inspect the ceiling inside the Big Dig tunnel on Interstate 90 after a portion of the highway 's ceiling collapsed , killing a woman in South Boston , Massachusetts , July 11 , 2006 .

Privately held Modern Continental Construction
Co said in a petition to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Boston that it faced debts of $ 500 million to $ 1 billion with an estimated 200 to 999 creditors .
Its assets totaled $ 100 million to $ 500 million .
The U.S. attorney on Friday charged Modern Continental in federal court with knowingly using the wrong epoxy to suspend concrete anchors that failed in the 2006 tunnel ceiling collapse that a crushed a car .
The collapse killed a woman passenger and damaged public confidence in the costliest public works project in U.S. history .
If convicted , Cambridge , Mass . - based Modern Continental faces criminal fines of up to $ 500,000 for each of 49 counts , or a total of $ 24.5 million .
The counts ranged from making false statements to wire fraud and submitting phony time and materials slips .
Modern Continental has said the charges were “ completely unfounded and without merit . ”
Court documents showed that the company ’s board of directors voted on June 11 to seek protection from creditors .
The company was also named in a November 2006 civil lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts attorney general against 15 companies that worked on the project .
With 7.5 miles of underground highway and a 183 - foot ( 56 - metre ) wide cable - stayed bridge , the “ Big Dig ” replaced an ailing elevated expressway to fix chronic congestion and reunite downtown Boston with its historic waterfront neighborhoods .
But cost overruns , leaks , delays , falling debris , criminal probes and charges of corruption plagued the 16 - year project that was formally completed in December .
Despite a “ stem to stern ” inspection that found it fundamentally safe after the 2006 collapse , many Bostonians still regard it with trepidation , citing years of mismanagement and stubborn problems such as leaks .
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board blamed the collapse on the wrong kind of glue used to hold up the concrete ceiling , and criticized the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority for poor oversight and noted mistakes by contractors .
He added in an interview on Algerian state radio that supply and demand was balanced and prices would remain high until year - end due to speculation , developments in the dollar and possible policy decisions by the European central bank .
" We can not raise output -- whether it 's OPEC producers or others -- unless there really is a demand on the world market , " said Khelil , who is Algeria 's energy minister .
" Now , you know that demand has shrunk this year and continues to shrink , and so demand is not there to absorb supplementary production .
" People will tell you , ' where is the demand so I can produce more ? " '
On prices , Khelil said : " It 's impossible to predict .
Anything could happen .
All I can say is that prices will be high , and will remain high until the end of the year . "
In answer to a question , he said he did not think oil would rapidly breach the $ 200 a barrel mark , adding prices would continue to perform their habitual " yo - yo " in relation to factors like geopolitical tensions and the dollar .
Oil prices hit a record near $ 140 a barrel last week and have doubled from a year ago , stoking inflation and triggering protests worldwide .
U.S. crude and London Brent crude futures rose more than $ 2 on Monday , spurred by disruptions in Nigerian crude output and supply worries stoked by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran .
Saudi Increase
Top exporter Saudi Arabia confirmed it will lift production for a second time to 9.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in July , its highest in more than 30 years , and pledged on Sunday to pump even more if the market demanded it .
But Khelil said the issue of extra supply was beside the point .
" The problem is not about pumping or not pumping .
If there is n't the demand , why would you want to pump ? " he said .
" Saudi Arabia is not going to pump for the sake of pumping .
They are going to pump to be able to respond to a demand .
There is no real demand ( for extra output ) on the market as we see it . "
" There is a balance between supply and demand and stocks are adequate -- currently at about 53 days of stocks , while last year they stood at 51 days . "
" There is no problem with fundamentals ... which in no way justify current high prices , which are due to speculation and the use of financial instruments and investments in oil commodities to generate profits that investors are unable to make in other sectors . "
Khelil said the only significant new oil market factors in the past year were the U.S. subprime crisis , the rise of biofuels , and tensions involving Israel and Iran - in other words nothing specifically to do with oil supply / demand .
Turning to world refinery capacity , Khelil said this could not be increased rapidly because major industrial investments were needed .
" It takes time -- increasing refinery capacities can not be done overnight .
It takes four to five five years , " he said .
" The problems of refining will be with us for a fairly long time . "
Algeria was investing in a $ 28 billion dollar , five - year programme to boost petrochemical and refinery capacity , he said .

Electricity is an immensely more powerful force than gravity , and far more complex in the ways it interacts with matter .
Yet modern astronomy remains wedded to a belief in gravity as the dominant mover and shaper of the universe , and seeks to explain new observations in terms that conceptually go back hundreds of years .
James Hogan describes an emerging alternative theory that recognizes the important role played by electricity on cosmic scales , offering explanations based on principles that are well understood and demonstrable in laboratories , without need of recourse to unobserved , untestable physics or speculative mathematical abstractions .
Humans have a wonderful ability for creating visions of ways to improve themselves , thereby making the world a better place ; and then , it seems , for losing track somewhere along the way of turning the visions into reality .
Take the business of science , for instance .
After several thousand futile years of fighting wars over whose revealed truth was really true , and attempts to impose truth by decree with the aid of rack and thumbscrew or deduce it via rigorous logic from self - evident premises that nobody could agree on , the idea finally emerged that a better way of finding out about the way things are in the world might be to stop fixating on how they ought to be , actually look at what ’s out there , and accept what it ’s telling you , whether you like it or not .
It works pretty well with such questions as figuring out why cannon balls and planets move the way they do , what heat is , and other matters that can be decided beyond argument according to whether your motor starts or not , or if your plane gets off the ground — all of which rapidly become engineering .
But when it comes to issues that are n’t settled so easily — the meaning and origin of life ; how the cosmos gets to be the way it is , and where it came from : areas where authority can still command and get away with it — things do n’t seem to have really changed that much .
Powerful establishments enjoying political favor and monopoly privileges in teaching and promotion rigidify into orthodoxies defending their beliefs tenaciously , with dissenting views being dismissed , ridiculed , and marginalized , even when supported by what would appear to be verifiable fact and simpler arguments .
In possibly an ultimate of ironies , in areas where hopes for science were at their highest , instead of showing the openness to alternatives and readiness to follow the evidence wherever it pointed that were supposed to characterize the new way of understanding the world , much of what we hear today seems to be taking on more the trappings of intolerant religion protecting dogma and putting down heresy .
More than ninety - nine percent of the observed universe exists in the form of matter known as plasma .
In the atoms that make up the planet we live on , equal amounts of positive and negative electric charge are confined together and cancel each other out , resulting in objects like rocks and cabbages that are neutral on balance and hence “ feel ” only the force of gravity .
Plasma , by contrast , consists , fully or in part , of charged particles — negative “ electrons ” and positive “ ions ” ( an atom missing one or more of its electrons ) — that are separated , and hence respond to electric and magnetic forces .
The electric force between two charged particles , which can be attractive or repulsive , is thirty - nine orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational attraction between them .
That ’s a one followed by 39 zeros .
Such a number boggles the imagination .
It is in the order of a millionth of a millimeter compared to 10,000 times the size of the known universe .
Even in a plasma comprising just one charged particle in 10,000 — which would be typical of the interstellar clouds of dust and gas from which stars are formed — electromagnetic forces will dominate gravity by a factor of ten million to one .
Yet , conceptually , the prevailing view of the cosmos remains essentially rooted in the work of such names as Kepler , Newton , and Laplace , whose laws describe a mechanical universe made up of neutral bodies moving in a vacuum under the influence of gravity .
And today ’s reigning cosmological model , founded on general relativity , is essentially a theory of geometry manifesting itself as gravity .
Gravity - based models were reasonable two hundred and more years ago , when Newtonian dynamics was shown to predict precisely the motions of the Solar System .
The plasma that permeates interplanetary space was unknown , along with its ability to organize spontaneously into isolating sheaths that , under stable and tranquil conditions like those prevailing in our locality at the present time , screen planets from electrical forces .
And not a lot was understood about electricity in any case .
But more recent advances in observational astronomy have revealed phenomena that do not lend themselves readily to explanation in familiar gravitational terms .
Pulsars — rapidly varying stellar objects conventionally interpreted as spinning neutron stars — have now been measured to fluctuate at rates that call into question even the power of postulated neutron matter to hold together .
Quasars , if accepted in accordance with the customary reading of red - shift as being the most distant objects known , radiate energy with intensities that defy explanation by any process involving conventional matter .
The way galaxies rotate , and their violent ejections of matter jets , do not conform to expectations based on gravity .
To account for these and other anomalies , such speculative devices as “ dark matter ” — at the last count numbering seven different varieties — “ dark energy , ” matter collapsing into black holes , and similar exotic mechanisms that have never been observed are introduced to make the theory fit the facts .
Seeking to explain new findings in familiar terms is natural and represents a desirable economy of thought .
Models that have become standard were not lightly arrived at and should not lightly be cast aside .
However , as was seen with the ever - more elaborate systems of epicycles contrived to keep the Ptolemaic system alive for long after a change of thinking was called for , such conservatism can be taken too far .
There comes a point where , “ We do n’t need another theory , because the one we ’ve got can be made to fit the data , ” is saying more about human inventive ingenuity than the accuracy of the theory .
Over the last two hundred years an enormous amount has been learned about electricity .
Technology has gone from Faraday motors and hand - cranked Wimhurst machines to super computers and satellite communications .
In parallel with these advances , electrical theorists have developed an alternative paradigm for interpreting astronomical observations , based on principles that are well understood and can be demonstrated in any electrical or plasma laboratory .
It requires none of the esoteric physics or ad - hoc inventions that the mainstream has had to resort to repeatedly when new observations failed to match expectations , or were never anticipated at all , and it is proving to be more powerful predictively .
Proponents refer to it as Electric Universe theory .
Its basic premise is that what we ’re seeing when we point telescopes at new stars being born or violently energetic events deforming distant galaxies are not results of gravity being intensified unimaginably and behaving in strange and unheard of ways , but electricity .
Where electrical forces are operating , gravity effectively ceases to exist .
A tiny magnet will snap a nail up effortlessly against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth .
You do n’t have to keep your coffee pot below the wall outlet to enable the electrons to fall down through the cord .
Around the turn of the nineteenth century , the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland studied the northern auroras and concluded that they are caused by charged particles from the Sun being directed to the polar regions by the Earth ’s magnetic field , where they excite atoms of the upper atmosphere to light - emission energies .
This was not favorably received by the theoreticians of his day , whose mathematical models treated the Earth as an isolated object in space , and his work was largely ignored .
Although satellite measurements have since confirmed the existence of interplanetary plasma and Earth ’s complex environment of fields , particles , and currents , there is still an entrenched reluctance to accept them as parts of electrical circuitry that not only connects the Earth to the Sun , but spans the entire Solar System .
Recognition of space as pervaded by plasma , and hence able to conduct electric currents , is what distinguishes the electrical model of the universe .
Electric currents create magnetic fields , which induce secondary currents , which in turn produce their own fields .
The complex interplays of forces that result can give rise to amazingly intricate structures and behaviors of matter .
Currents in plasma flow as elongated filaments , which can be visible in instances like auroral displays and lightning , where energies become high enough to initiate electrical discharge .
Parallel filaments are pulled together in an effect known as a “ pinch , ” which can be very powerful .
At shorter ranges , however , the net force between the filaments becomes repulsive rather than attractive , causing them to rotate and twist around each other into a braided structure as they approach , instead of merging .
The braid can interact with similar braids to form “ ropes ” on a larger scale , which might then repeat the process .
Electric currents in space .
The Double Helix nebula , located near our own galactic center .
Such braided structures are the signature of electric currents in plasmas .
They have been shown to scale up through an astonishing fourteen orders of magnitude .
Effects produced on a microscopic scale in laboratories can be observed unfolding at cosmological dimensions .

The standard model of star formation has stars condensing from an accretion disk of dust and gas as it contracts under self - gravitation .
It has remained essentially unchanged for two hundred years despite having a number of problems .
For a start , simulations and calculation indicate that peripheral matter in such a disk would disperse rather than coalesce into planetary clumps .
Then there ’s the question of how the angular momentum — the property that makes a flywheel want to keep turning — comes to be concentrated in the planets — 98 percent of it in the case of our Solar System .
A contracting disk should deliver most of its angular momentum to the central part , giving the Sun a rotation period of something like 13 hours instead of the 28 days that it has .
And further , where did it all came from to begin with ?
Dispersed matter initially moving randomly should contain very little net angular momentum .
Finally , for a star the size of the Sun , gravitational contraction wo n’t produce a high enough density at the core to generate the temperature necessary for igniting the fusion reactions generally believed to be the power source .
To make it work , various quantum mechanical improbabilities are wheeled in to allow things to happen that all the odds say should n’t .
Stars are concentrated along the spiral arms of galaxies , which is also where new stars come into existence .
The electric model proposes the arms to be the paths of currents traversing the galactic disk , and stars as the focal points of pinches occurring between them , strung like beads on threads .
Electrical forces offer a far more effective means than gravity for gathering , compressing , and heating dispersed material .
And , from what was said earlier , rotation is no longer an anomaly in need of explanation , but imparted naturally as a result of the process .
Here ’s an example of where you can see it happening .
The Butterfly nebula .
Embedded current cylinders converging and producing plasma glow discharge over a distance greater than the diameter of our Solar System .
The close - up of the neck shows a dusty toroid occluding the central star .
The physics of plasmas predicts such a torus .
On a larger scale , the same process explains galaxies .
Electric galaxies were first proposed by the Swedish Nobel laureate Hannes Alfvén in the middle of the last century , who envisioned immense rivers of electricity flowing through space , of intergalactic extent .
Sequence from a supercomputer simulation at Los Alamos National Laboratories of the structure arising from a pinch between two plasma currents .
Above , a real galaxy for comparison .
Galaxies do n’t rotate in the way that predictions from gravity - based cosmology say they should .
With the amount of observed mass and the velocities measured at the rim , they ought to be flying apart .
The solution of choice is to invoke “ dark matter , ” never actually observed , but which can be given just the right properties and put in just the right places to produce the desired results .
It has been called “ cosmic duct tape ” — capable of fixing anything .
By contrast , the electric model holds that , far from being isolated , passive accumulations of mass revolving under their own momentum after being spun up by some unexplained cause , galaxies are active components in enormous cosmic power circuits .
They ’re not flywheels , but motors , driven by forces easily able to hold them together without need of invisible glue .
Inventing unobservables to hold up failed predictions is usually the sign of a theory in trouble .
Galaxies are not distributed evenly through space , but concentrated in strings and “ walls ” around voids that can be thousands of light - years across .
According to the standard theory , structures of that size should n’t have had time to form in the 14 billion years since everything was supposed to have started with the Big Bang .
But it ’s what would be expected if galaxies result from cosmic electric currents , because currents flow in filaments and sheets of filaments — the veils of the polar auroras , for example .
The cosmology developed by Alfvén and his intellectual descendants proposes an earlier plasma epoch in the evolution of the cosmos , in which electromagnetic forces played the initial role of collecting matter together to create the densities that enabled gravity to become a significant factor only later , making the 14 billion years no longer an issue .
Many galaxies are found to be shooting out enormous jets of matter and energy in the direction of their axes , often on scales that dwarf the galaxy itself .
The rotating system of currents converging on the axis , along with its associated magnetic fields , stores enormous amounts of energy .
Releases due to instabilities or the need to shed excess from an accumulating buildup would manifest themselves in just this kind of way .
Radio Galaxy 1313 -192 .
Jets emitted by the visible galaxy power the x-ray emitting lobes .
Such lobes were predicted by Hannes Alfvén long before radio sources were discovered .
A gravitational explanation of such energies requires postulating black holes to concentrate to almost infinite density the weakest force known to physics , and the creation of jets through unclear processes involving acceleration and mechanical collisions in accretion disks of matter spiraling into them .
Despite widely repeated claims to the contrary , black holes have never been observed .
What is observed are enormously energetic events occurring in space .
Attributing them to black holes is part of the assumed basis for interpretation .
The way engineers and researchers produce x-rays is by accelerating charged particles with electric fields .
Your dentist does n’t do it by banging rocks together .
Jet emerging from galaxy M87 extends for thousands of light - years .
Electrical structures remain coherent over such distances , whereas neutral gas would rapidly disperse .
The glow is consistent with electrically accelerated electrons spiraling along magnetic field lines .
The term “ plasma ” was co-opted from biology in recognition of the eerily lifelike forms and changes observed in electrical discharge experiments with ionized gases .
Besides forming filaments , braids , sheets , and isolating layers , plasmas will organize into cellular structures bounding regions possessing different properties such as temperature , density , and chemistry .
The Cat ’s Eye nebula shows the kind of complexity that can result .
And this is the core region , with the star at its center .
So what are we seeing ?
Gravity , which produces formless coagulations of matter like clots in cream ?
Or electricity ?

IRVINE , Calif . --
Former mixed martial arts light
heavyweight champion Quinton " Rampage " Jackson has been
hospitalized for a mental health evaluation .
Irvine police went to Jackson 's home Wednesday after his friends
told authorities they were " concerned about his behavior and some
remarks he was making , " Lt. Rick Handfield said Thursday .
" Officers spoke to him to evaluate whether he was a danger to
himself or others , " Handfield said .
" He was detained and was taken to an area hospital for mental evaluation . "
Handfield declined to elaborate , citing privacy restrictions .
Jackson was arrested Tuesday in Costa Mesa after a 3 - mile chase
that began as the result of two freeway collisions and another
crash when he allegedly ran red lights in his 2008 Ford F250
pickup , police said .
During the chase , police said , Jackson drove over the raised median of the roadway , drove onto a sidewalk , causing pedestrians
to flee , and a tire on his truck disintegrated before he taken into
custody without incident .
Jackson was booked for investigation of felony evading , reckless
driving and hit and run , and released on $ 25,000 bail .
After the arrest , police said they learned that Jackson may have
been involved in two collisions on the freeway , which did not involve injuries .
Jackson lost his Ultimate Fighting Championship title July 5 in
Las Vegas to Forrest Griffin in an unanimous decision .
UFC spokeswoman Jennifer Wenk in Las Vegas declined comment on
the 30 - year - old fighter 's recent troubles .
For the second time this week , the Senate has voted to block progress on a bill designed to extend Renewable Energy Tax Credits .
Although the Bill , that enjoys broad cross-party support , gained a majority of 52 - 44 , Republican opposition meant that it fell just short of the 60 votes needed to proceed .
News that progress on the $ 17.7 billion package of tax breaks could now be delayed until after the presidential elections in November has been greeted with dismay by the renewables industry .
Rhone Resch , President of the Solar Energy Industries Association warned that if the tax credits were allowed to expire at the end of this year it will “ result in the loss of billions of dollars in new investments in solar . ”
In more cheering news , San Francisco mayor Gavin Newson will later today approve the largest city - wide solar promotion scheme in the U.S .
The program , set to run for ten years , will allow individuals to apply for rebates of between $ 3000 and $ 6000 , rising to $ 10,000 for businesses , to install photovoltaic systems .

( NewsTarget ) Prepare to say goodbye to bananas .
Do you remember back in the sixties when there was a change in bananas ?
It was n't announced , but those of us who love the fruit did .
They became less sweet and creamy -- just not as good .
There was no information about it .
The change seemed to slip under the radar and most of us forgot about it .
That change foretold what 's now coming -- the complete death of bananas .
No , this is not hyperbole .
Bananas are dying , and their death is a precursor of what 's to come if we continue to accept corporate farming .
But first , back to the impending loss of bananas .
We tend to think of bananas as a single species with no more than one or two variations on the theme -- something like oranges , lemons , limes , and grapefruits that are all variations of a single species .
That , though , is far from the truth .
Until the mid-eighteen hundreds , most bananas grew wild and local people ate them , though some local cultivation existed .
There was a huge variety .
Some were sweet and some sour .
Some were creamy , while others had a bit of crunch .
Some were yellow , but others were red or purple .
Today , most of that variety is lost .
During the 1870's , Minor Keith was a young man from a wealthy railroad company who went to Costa Rica to help build a national railroad .
He and other relatives accomplished the task at the cost of 5,000 workers ' lives .
He also started planting bananas , a crop that was gaining popularity in the U.S. , on the easements along the railway .
The Costa Rican government could not make payments on its railroad loans from British banks .
Because of his wealth and connections , Keith was able to raise the money to finish the job , largely by negotiating a significant decrease in the interest rate , from 7 % down to 2.5 % .
This put him in the debt of the dictator , whose daughter he had married , so he was granted 800,000 acres of tax - free land along the railroad , where he'd been planting bananas , along with a 99 - year lease on the railroad 's operation along that route .
Yes , it 's just amazing what can be accomplished through birth into wealth combined with an utterly unscrupulous nature .
The corporation that came out of this was United Fruit , now known as Chiquita .
It had an insatiable appetite for profits , which it was willing to satisfy at virtually any cost to the people , the countries it occupied , and nature .
Their typical modus operandi was , from the very beginning , to force their way into a poor nation , slash and burn to create banana plantations , and provide slave wages to the natives .
Virtually any means was used to lop off anything that got in the way of profits .
It was this -- the behavior of Chiquita -- that led to the term Banana Republic , coined by the novelist and short story writer , O. Henry .
It was not a term of derision for the countries , but a term of sympathy for their enslavement by United Fruit .
In the February 2008 issue of The Nation , the author states that United Fruit " was truly a terrorizing company -- a kind of Halliburton , McDonald 's , Nike , and Archer Daniels Midland all rolled into one .
United Fruit set the precedent for the propaganda , exploitation and imperialism of modern - day corporate plunderers .
" Then in 1903 , what should have brought these practices to a screeching halt , worsened the tale .
A fungus named Fusarium oxysporum , commonly known as Panama disease or Agent Green and sometimes called Sigatoka , started to attack the monoculture crop , the Gros Michael variety .
Since these crops were not grown from seed , but instead were all clones , the result of planting only from rhizomes ( underground stems ) , none of the plants stood a chance once one had been infected .
Of course , United Fruit did what any giant of monoculture would do .
They dumped tons of chemicals on the crops .
It did n't work .
The plants continued to die .
Though advised that the only real solution was to plant a wide range of banana varieties , United Fruit 's only real concern was the short term bottom line .
Their first solution was to find more impoverished nations with the right climate and repeat what they 'd done to Costa Rica , and by that time , many other nations .
The company 's own adherence to short term profit , even over its own long term survival , resulted in a refusal to engage in even the most basic techniques to avoid carrying the infection to previously - unaffected locations .
The chemicals slowed the progression on Panama disease , but did n't stop it .
Then , in 1935 , Sigatoka , an even more virulent fungus , showed up .
This was the death - knell of the Gros Michael banana .
By 1960 , the Gros Michael banana was extinct .
United Fruit , though , was lucky .
They found another variety , the Cavendish , that was resistant to the fungus infections .
Note , though , the word resistant .
They were not immune .
Naturally , Cavendish bananas replaced Gros Michaels .
United Fruit -- by then known as Chiquita -- did n't learn any good lessons .
They continued the same practices of monoculture clone planting , massive chemical use , and moving to new countries as the bananas in old ones died .
In 1928 , thousands of United Fruit workers went on strike , demanding a six - day work week , an eight - hour day , medical care , and payment in real money , rather than company scrip that could only be spent at the company store .
They demonstrated peacefully in a town square .
After a five - minute warning , the United Fruit - controlled Colombian government 's military opened up with machine guns , killing an unknown number .
United Fruit itself estimates at least 1,000 were killed , but the real extent of the massacre will never be known , since most of the bodies were probably dumped in the sea and buried deep in the forest .
In other words , the incident was covered up .
After the president , Eli Black , committed suicide in 1975 , the corporation , now called United Brands after a flurry of corporate buyouts and mergers , was subjected to an investigation , which resulted in a tale of bribery .
The puppet president of Honduras had been given $ 1.25 million and promised another equivalent amount in exchange for reduction of export taxes .
Then , it was discovered that European officials had received $ 750,000 in bribes .
In 1978 , United Brands admitted that it had given $ 2. 5 million to Honduras 's economy minister .
For that , they were fined $ 15,000 .
A nematode pesticide developed by Dow Chemical , dibromochloropropane ( DBCP ) , was banned in the U.S. in 1979 .
DBCP causes cancer , is a neurotoxin known even to cause birth defects , and causes severe reactions from contact with it .
It kills fish and many other aquatic creatures .
United Brands ' response was to continue using DBCP in other countries .
Throughout its history , United Fruit - Chiquita operated a scorched earth policy against anyone and anything that stood in the way of short term profits .
Nothing seems to have been too evil .
Encouraged by Chiquita , the CIA carried out a 1954 coup , which overthrew the legitimate Guatemalan government .
Jacobo Arbenz , the president , had implemented an act much like the United States ' Homestead Act , which allowed uncultivated portions of plantations -- code word for a monoculture banana tract -- to be appropriated for the people 's use .
His goal was the same as the Homestead Act , to create a nation of landowners .
The corporate landowners were paid the tax appraisal value of the land .
Colombia 's military government is propped up by the United States .
When the U.S. itself does n't take matters into its own hands , local paramilitary narcotics gangs do the job of murdering union leaders and workers who have tried to organize , especially in banana fields .
Since 1985 , at least 4,000 have been killed or have disappeared during strikes or while organizing workers .
Known collaborators of these gangs include Chiquita .
The attorney for a lawsuit filed in 2007 by some of the victims ' families stated , " It was about acquiring every aspect of banana distribution and sale through a reign of terror . "
Chiquita claimed that it had been paying protection money to protect its employees , who they claim had been threatened if they did n't pay .
The company does not explain how this makes sense when the only employees killed were those involved with union organizing .
One of the core techniques of any successful agribusiness corporation is propaganda .
United Fruit was a master .
For a nominal fee , in 1962 American schools were provided with packages that contained lessons about bananas , information about Central American countries ( obviously not delineating its own activities in destroying them ) , banana recipes nicely formatted into a folder , and teaching tools , including a wall chart , movies , and a teacher 's manual on how best to use them .
That same year , the Chiquita logo was affixed to bananas and an advertising campaign to convince the public of their superiority was launched .
Discarded bananas were turned into a profit center .
In 1966 , a factory was built in Honduras to produce banana puree from discards .
It took some time to realize a profit , but by the 1980 's banana puree started to show up in ice cream , yogurt , and other similar foods .
Just think -- that prepared food with the listed ingredient of banana was very likely made from rejected bananas .
In 1967 , after Del Monte entered the banana business , United Fruit gave 90,000 full color recipe cards , along with peanut butter sandwiches to U.S. schools .
Of course , when propaganda fails and bad PR is about to be produced , Chiquita falls back on the time - honored technique of suppression .
In 1998 , a particularly ugly bit of Chiquita 's activities were about to be exposed by the .
The investigative reporter , Mike Gallagher , dug up clear documentation showing :* Chiquita controlled several supposedly independent banana companies to hide assets .*
Chiquita continued to use banned pesticides , in spite of an agreement with environmentalists .*
Chiquita security guards used brute force against employees .*
Chiquita had the residents of a village evicted and their town bulldozed by calling in the Honduras military .
The technique used by Chiquita to get theto pull the story were to ruin the career of Mike Gallagher .
He was accused of hacking into their e-mails .
As a long term and well respected investigative reporter , one must wonder why he'd have used such a klutzy method .
It 's surmised that he likely got the information from employees , who could have been at risk had he told the truth .
Of course , this method of gaining information is time - honored by the profession .
One of Edward R. Murrow 's most significant documentaries , " Factories in the Field " , was produced through such techniques .
" History of the Standard Oil Company " by Ida Tarbell would never have been made , either .
By using the threat of lawsuit against a newspaper that had significantly less money to defend itself or its reporter , Chiquita was successful in keeping the story from the general public .
So , what solution is being bandied about for the coming tragic loss of bananas five to twenty years from now ?
This is even scarier than all that Chiquita has done to this point .
The primary suggestion offered is genetic engineering .
Scientists are already at work mapping the banana 's genome .
Already , there are genetic experiments to modify bananas with the hepatitis B vaccine and with fish .
That this sort of solution is nothing more than the next , utterly insane , step in a food system already mad with monoculture seems to be of no concern .

Karadzic and Mladic were the Bosnian Serbs ' wartime leaders
The two most wanted men in the Balkans may not be too well hidden to be captured , but too well protected , writes the BBC's Nick Thorpe .
" Look , is n't that your friend ? "
The Dutch journalist 's wife pointed through the glass window of the restaurant at a man sitting at an outside table .
Even from behind , the shape of the head and the greying salt - and - pepper mop of hair of one of the world 's most wanted men was easily recognisable .
And when he turned his head in profile , the journalist was absolutely sure .
Radovan Karadzic was drinking coffee at a remote restaurant on the Foca to Gacko road in southern Bosnia .
It was April 2005 .
A short while later , a nervous looking Karadzic and his female companion got up suddenly and left in a red Mercedes .
' Mafia ring '
Getting too close to Karadzic could cost a journalist his life , it seems Placing the interests of justice before those of his own fame and fortune , the journalist contacted the International War Crimes Tribunal .
The story leaked soon afterwards .
The Tribunal blamed the police .
Then the police blamed the International High Representative in Bosnia , Paddy Ashdown , for the disclosure .
After that , the journalist felt it was time to write his own story , under another name .
But first he made contact with Dutch military intelligence , to find out if there had been any follow - up to his information .
" Do n't write about it , if you value your life , " he was told , to his amazement .
" Several of our agents visited the restaurant .
On their return to the Netherlands , they needed protection . "
Such is the power , allegedly , of the mafia ring which protects the former Bosnian Serb leader .
CIA men
The story dovetails neatly with another which appeared recently in the Bosnian newspaper , Slobodna Bosna .
Radomir Ceranic , a senior employee of the Bosnian secret service , OSA , described the alleged murder of two CIA agents by Karadzic 's men when they got too close to him .
Their car and the tracking equipment they used was discovered .
The bodies of the CIA men , both US citizens , were never found .
Ceranic had just been fired from his job , so he may have borne a grudge .
Whatever the truth , it is another hint of the power and ruthlessness of Karadzic 's network .
So I asked well - informed sources in Bosnia and Serbia , if the arrest of Stojan Zupljanin , a former Bosnian Serb police chief and wartime adviser to Karadzic , three weeks ago , was a sign that the net is finally closing in on Karadzic and his military commander , Ratko Mladic ?
Or was he just a lamb , sacrificed to smooth the creases in a power - sharing agreement between the Democratic Party and the Socialists in Belgrade , as they cobble together a new Serbian government ?
" A lamb , " came a chorus of replies .
" They 'll never touch the big two .
" Brutal frankness Ratko Mladic is still a hero for Serb ultra-nationalists
There was a time in the early 1990s , before he started his war to prove that people of different cultural backgrounds cannot live together , when I interviewed Radovan Karadzic regularly , whenever I was in Sarajevo .
But I soon got bored by his answers .
We never seemed to get beyond 1941 , and his obsession with the murder of huge numbers of Serbs at the Jasenovac concentration camp in Croatia .
So I preferred to talk to Milorad Ekmecic , a professor of history at Sarajevo University , and the eminence grise behind Karadzic 's party .
With Ekmecic we could at least talk about the present , and the party 's brutally frank plans to create great swathes of " ethnically pure " Serb territory in Bosnia , based on the results of the 1991 census .
" We Serbs have to be exclusive , " the professor insisted , " in order to survive . "
' No political will '
Some years ago , I set out through the Serbian Republic in Bosnia .
The forestry workers at the bar hardly give him a second glance .
They have seen him so many times before .
He is with his wife , and the owner of the restaurant
We have heard from the victims of war crimes , I thought .
Now let us hear from the perpetrators .
But I deliberately left Karadzic and Mladic out .
And focused instead on men convicted by the Hague Tribunal and released after serving jail terms .
And on other war crimes suspects , still on the run .
It was not particularly hard to find them .
But I could not help hearing whispers about the terrible twins , Mladic and Karadzic .
The word was , that Western intelligence agencies knew roughly where they were , but that there was no political will in London or Washington to risk the lives of British , or US agents , in a bid to seize them .
Time passes .
My new map of the Balkans does not even list a town called Foca .
It is there under the name Karadzic 's men called it , after they drove out or killed its Moslem inhabitants : Srbinje .
And 38 km ( 24 miles ) down the road , on the edge of the Sutjeska national park , Radovan Karadzic has just got out of a red Mercedes .
The forestry workers at the bar hardly give him a second glance .
They have seen him so many times before .
He is with his wife , and the owner of the restaurant .
" Look - is n't that your friend , sitting over there ? " asked the Dutch journalist 's wife .

What are these ?
Shirky ’s
Law states that the social software most likely to succeed has “ a brutally simple mental model … that ’s shared by all users ” .
If you use social software like Flickr or Digg , you know what this means .
You can give friends a simple and compelling explanation of these sites in seconds : “ it ’s a website that lets you upload photos so your friends can also see them ” ; “ it ’s a community website that lets you suggest interesting sites ; the users vote on submissions to determine what ’s most interesting ” .
Of course , for each Flickr or Digg there are hundreds of failed social sites .
The great majority either fail to obey Shirky ’s Law , or else are knockoffs that do little not already done by an existing site .
To understand why Shirky ’s Law is important , let ’s look at a site where it ’s violated .
The site is Nature Network , one of the dozens of social networking sites aspiring to be “ Facebook for scientists ” .
Like other social networks , Nature Network lets you connect to other users .
When you make a connection , you ’re asked whether you would like to connect as a “ friend ” or a “ colleague ” .
Sometimes the choice is easy .
But sometimes it ’s not so easy .
Furthermore , if someone else connects to you , you ’re automatically asked to connect to them , but given no immediate clue whether they connected as a friend or as a colleague .
The only thing shared in the users ’ mental model at this point is acute awkwardness , and possibly a desire to never connect to anyone on Nature Network again .
I do n’t mean to pick on Nature Network .
It ’s the most useful of the social networks for scientists .
But it and most other social websites ( apart from the knockoffs ) do n’t even come close to obeying Shirky ’s Law .
Why is Shirky ’s Law so hard for developers to obey ?
I ’ll give three reasons .
The first reason is that developers often have a flawed mental model of their own software .
Imagine you ’re developing social software .
You spend hundreds or thousands of hours on the task .
In your mind ’s eye , you imagine the user interacting with your software , and reason that if the user is given more capabilities , they ’ll be happier .
There ’s an implicit mental model being used to make decisions here .
It ’s a mental model of a system with two parts – the software and the user .
A real user ’s mental model is quite different .
It ’s them , the software , and the entire network of other users .
How they use the software is strongly conditioned on their mental model of how other users use it .
If they lack confidence in that mental model , they have less incentive to use the software themselves , as the Nature Network example shows .
The more social the software , the stronger this effect .
Most developers are not stupid , and intellectually they know the user experience involves both the software and the network of other users .
But their own experience , day in and day out , is of being a single user working with the software .
At this stage the network of other users is a theoretical abstraction .
It ’s easy to get sucked into doing things that would make a single user ’s experience better , but makes the experience of a network of users worse .
This is a large part of why it ’s so important to build a base of beta users as quickly as possible , and to release early and often .
A second reason developers fail to obey Shirky ’s Law is the desire to do impressive - seeming things .
Software that looks complex is much more impressive to other hackers , venture capitalists , and non-hacker friends and family .
I ’ve heard hackers brag that they could have built Twitter over a weekend .
Underlying this boast is a misunderstanding of what is truly impressive .
Coming up with Twitter required only a small amount of technical knowledge .
The hard part was the social insight to realize such a tool would be useful .
This is a social insight the bragging hackers did n’t have .
It ’s no accident that many of the people who ’ve been most successful at building social software have strong interests outside computing .
Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook , studied both computer science and psychology at Harvard .
Alan Kay , arguably the father of modern computing , has a list of recommended reading .
There ’s barely a technical book on it .
It ’s all psychology , anthropology , philosophy , and so on .
A strange consequence of all this is that much of the most successful social software was invented by accident .
Ward Cunningham invented the first wiki because he was tired of responding to user ’s requests to update a website he ran .
To save himself time , he made the page editable , and told them to update it themselves .
He was shocked when this small change utterly transformed the dynamics of the site .
One of the first widely used pieces of blogging software , Blogger , was originally a small part of a much more ambitious project management system .
The project management system never caught on , but Blogger took off .
The team that developed Flickr was n’t originally building a photo sharing service .
They were building a multiplayer online game , and decided to let players share photos with one another .
When they realized the players were more interested in sharing photos than playing the game , they dumped the game , and built Flickr .
Shirky ’s
Law does not mean the software itself needs to be simple .
Social software like Digg and FriendFeed uses complex algorithms to rank the relative importance of submitted items .
But the complex parts of the software are hidden from the user , and so do not add to the complexity of the users ’ mental models .
There are some apparent exceptions to Shirky ’s Law .
For example , Facebook is now a successful and complex piece of social software .
But in the early days , Facebook was extremely simple , and this simplicity fueled their rapid growth : “ it ’s a site where you can connect to your friends , and show them what you ’re up to ” .
Complexity can only come later , when users are already confident in their shared understanding .
The third reason developers fail to obey Shirky ’s Law is that it ’s difficult to do .
The most successful social software starts out doing one task supremely well .
That task is simple , useful , and original .
It ’s easy to come up with a task which is useful and original – just combine existing ideas in a new way , perhaps with some minor twists .
But finding something that ’s also simple is hard .
It has to be a single task that ca n’t be reduced or explained in terms of existing tasks .
Inventing or discovering such a task requires either a lot of hard work and social insight , or a great deal of luck .
It ’s no wonder most social software fails .

Military Recruits Children : Game Violates Int Law
In May of 2002 , the United States Army invaded E3 , the annual video game convention held in Los Angeles .
At the city 's Convention Center , young game enthusiasts mixed with camouflaged soldiers , Humvees and a small tank parked near the entrance .
Thundering helicopter sound effects drew the curious to the Army 's interactive display , where a giant video screen flashed the words " Empower yourself .
Defend America ...
You will be a soldier . "
( 1 )
The Army was unveiling its latest recruitment tool , the " America 's Army " video game , free to download online or pick up at a recruiting station , and now available for purchase on the Xbox , PlayStation , cell phones and Gameboy game consoles .
Since its release , the " game " has gone on to attain enormous popularity with over 30,000 players everyday , more than nine million registered users , and version 3.0 set for launch in September .
" America 's Army " simulates the Army experience , immersing players in basic training before they can go on to play specialized combat roles .
Most of the gameplay takes place in cyberspace where virtual Mideast cities , hospitals and oil rigs serve as backdrops for players to obliterate each other .
As a " first person shooter , " the game allows players to " see what a soldier sees " in real combat situations - peek around corners , take fine aim , chose weapons that replicate those actually used by the US Army .
For the game 's commercial developers , realism is one its strongest selling points .
Console version programmers were shipped to military training facilities in Wyoming , where they ran boot camp obstacle courses , fired weapons at the shooting range and got whisked around on helicopters .
Back at hip , safe San Francisco Bay Area game companies , Army weapons specialists worked with developers to ensure aim , fire , sound and reload functions for all of the game 's weapons were as close to the real thing as possible .
The Army also ensured that players learn real weapons skills such as breath control and the reload time for a M4 carbine .
And in order to edge closer to the Army 's goal of " realism " and " authenticity , " several of the game 's missions are based on actual combat experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Even the training simulators and firing ranges are modeled on the real life versions at Ft. Benning , Ft. Lewis and Ft. Polk .
In a 2005 press release , Ubisoft , the multimillion - dollar publisher of the console version of the game , wrote that " America 's Army " is the " deepest and most realistic military game ever to hit consoles , " hoping that it gave players a " realistic , action - packed , military experience . "
( 2 )
But behind the fun and games is an attempt , in the words of a military booklet on " America 's Army , " " to build a game for Army strategic communication in support of recruiting . "
The Army spent $ 6 million to develop the game at the Modeling , Virtual Environments and Simulation Institute ( MOVES ) before handing it over to private companies for adaptation to the console formats in 2004 .
As the name implies , the MOVES Institute is the military center for creating virtual training environments and simulators .
A MOVES Institute booklet proclaims a later version of the game , " America 's Army : Special Forces , " was developed specifically to increase the number of Army Special Forces recruits .
" The Department of Defense want[ed ] to double the number of Special Forces Soldiers , so essential did they prove in Afghanistan and northern Iraq ; consequently , orders ... trickled down the chain of command and found application in the current release of ' America 's Army . ' " ( 3 )
Like so many aspects of contemporary military operations , the development of later versions of the game has been handed over to corporations for private profit .
Some of the biggest game companies have worked on the console , arcade and cell phone versions of " America 's Army . "
Ubisoft , the world 's seventh largest video game company , is the game 's exclusive producer and has recently publicized record profits for the first quarter of 2008 .
Ubisoft worked closely with San Francisco based Secret Level to develop the 2005 Xbox version .
Global VR , in San Jose , California , is preparing the release of the arcade version , and Gameloft programmed a version available for download to cell phones .
Getting in on the action are other more traditional military contractors , such as Digital Consulting Services ( DSC ) , a multimillion - dollar military tech company based in Newbury Park , California .
Among DCS 's other projects are the Encore II Information Technology Solution for the innocuous sounding Global Information Grid , " an all encompassing communications project for the Department of Defense , " worth $ 13 billion over five years .
Or the Navy 's Seaport - Enhanced - a $ 100 billion multicontract program to integrate Navy warfare operations .
The Army worked closely with these and other companies to produce " America 's Army , " the first and only officially licensed Army game .
It is this partnership and the close attention to technical detail that the Army and game companies claim gives " America 's Army " its realistic quality .
As Col. Casey Wardynski , director of the US Army 's Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis ( OEMA ) and director of the game project proclaims , " America 's Army " is " the most authentic console game about soldiering in the US Army . " ( 4 )
Yet , far from providing realism , " America 's Army " offers a sanitized version of war to propagandize youth on the benefits of an Army career and prepare them for the battlefield .
In the game , soldiers are not massacred in bloody fire typical of most video games , or for that matter , real combat .
When hit , bullet wounds resemble puffs of red smoke , and players can take up to four hits before being killed .
To further protect youth , concerned parents can turn on optional controls that sanitize the violence even more - shots produce no blood whatsoever and dead soldiers just sit down .
This presentation of war contrasts to the much more grisly reality unfolding every day in Iraq and Afghanistan , like a June suicide attack on the Fallujah City Council in which three Marines , two interpreters and 20 Iraqis , including young children , were killed .
Photos by American photojournalist Zoriah depict a horror scene in a small courtyard , dismembered body parts - ears , hands and pieces of skull - spot the ground ; one Marine 's head looks smeared into the pavement .
Zoriah writes of the scene , " There are dying people strewn around like limp dolls along with lifeless bodies of all ages .
People are screaming and crying and running as if they have something important to do , only they can't figure out what that important thing could possibly be ... people are literally frantic removing the dead , as if their pace may bring some of them back . "
It is this violent , realistic quality of combat that has been excised from the game .
( 5 )
Another ploy in the Army 's " realism " playbook is what the Army calls " America 's Army 's Real Heroes . "
On the " America 's Army " web site , visitors can explore the stories of eight combat veterans who received silver or bronze stars , purple hearts , or other awards .
Among them is Sgt. Tommy Rieman , an Iraq veteran who used his body to shield his gunner from incoming fire , miraculously surviving bullet wounds to the chest and shoulder .
He was selected to be a " Real Hero " and media celebrity for Army recruitment not solely for his courage , but also because he survived his experience .
Those who have made the " ultimate sacrifice " are unlikely to be chosen at all , like 22 - year - old Specialist William L. McMillan , who was killed on July 8 when his vehicle was destroyed by a roadside bomb .
Or 35 - year - old Sgt. Steven Chevalier , of Flint , Michigan , father of two , who joined the Army after high school in 1991 because he could n't find work in Flint .
On July 9 , in the midst of his third tour in Iraq , Sergeant Chevalier was destroyed by a grenade attack in Samarra .
Other Army nonheroes include those who have taken the courageous step of refusing orders in an illegal and immoral war , like Lt. Erin Watada or members of 2nd Platoon , Charlie Company , 1st Battalion , 26th Infantry Regiment who refused patrol orders in Adhamiya , Iraq .
What the game 's " realism " is attempting to do is to mask the violent reality of combat , and military experience in general , for very specific purposes .
At a minimum , the Army hopes " America 's Army " will act as " strategic communication " to expose " kids who are college bound and technologically savvy " to positive messaging about the Army .
Phase one of the propaganda effort is to expose children to " Army values " and make service look as attractive as possible .
The next phase is direct recruiting .
According to Colonel Wardynski , who originally thought up selling the Army to children through video games , " a well executed game would put the Army within the immediate decision - making environment of young Americans .
It would thereby increase the likelihood that these Americans would include Soldiering in their set of career alternatives . "
To make the connection between the game and recruitment explicit , the " America 's Army " web site links directly to the Army 's recruitment page .
And gamers can explore a virtual recruitment center through the " America 's Army Real Heroes " program .
Local recruiters also use the game to draw in high school children for recruitment opportunities .
Recruiters stage area tournaments with free pizza and sodas ; winners receive Xbox game consoles , free copies of " America 's Army " and iPods .
Game centers are also set up at state fairs and public festivals with replica Humvees and .50 caliber machine guns , where children as young as 13 can test out the life - sized equipment .
( 6 )
When players walk into Army sponsored tournaments , the government knows more about them then they may suppose .
The game records players ' data and statistics in a massive database called Andromeda , which records every move a player makes and links the information to their screen name .
With this information tracking system , gameplay serves as a military aptitude tester , tracking overall kills , kills per hour , a player 's virtual career path , and other statistics .
According to Colonel Wardynski , players who play for a long time and do extremely well may " just get an e-mail seeing if [ they 'd ] like any additional information on the Army . "
The " America 's Army " web site , however , is quick to point out that the Army respects players ' privacy .
The Army claims that player information is not linked to a person 's real world identity unless that person volunteers their identity to a recruiter .
But it is not clear that recruiters have to give any sort of discloser that a voluntary relinquishing of one 's name is also an invitation to a player 's statistical information .
Answering seemingly innocent questions from recruiters in " America 's Army " chat rooms or at state fairs about one 's screen name may divulge personal information without intending to .
( 7 )
Beyond its recruitment goals , the game serves as a training device for both military tactics and weapons , and to condition players for battlefield operations .
To this end , " America 's Army " game assignments are designed to simulate real world battlefield missions .
For example in one mission , " Special Forces fight alongside Indigenous Forces they have trained .
For this mission , [ players ] must rescue and escort a wounded resistance leader who 's escaped to a neutral hospital for treatment - or hinder the escape of a wounded enemy courier , depending which side you 're on . "
Missions like this shadow real world military actions such as the November 2004 seizure of a Fallujah hospital , a blatant violation of international law .
The Army justified the war crime by explaining the hospital was furthering enemy propaganda .
Other missions designed to acclimate players to warfare take place on an offshore oil rig or reenact the " Blackhawk Down " scenario .
The oil rig game environment mimics possible combat deployments like to the new military installation being built by the Navy on the Khawr al Amaya Oil Terminal in the Persian Gulf .
Interestingly , in these mission environments every gun-carrying character found online has a real person behind it .
Yet , all players perceive themselves as American Forces while their avatars may be represented as black masked " terrorists " to their opponents .
( 8 )
If this were n't enough , the Army has designed weapons systems and training simulators based on " America 's Army " simulations and gameplay and incorporated them into the game .
Players are organized into groups of Army units to learn to think , act and work together , a key component of basic infantry training .
With a system of honor points that can help or hinder a virtual career , players are rewarded for their teamwork and strategic thinking , and discouraged from acting like a lone Rambo .
Weapons training programs are also developed from the game or incorporated into " America 's Army . "
These include the Live Fire Virtual Targetry for Urban Combat , in which boot camp recruits fire live ammunition at huge screens with " America 's Army " simulations projected onto it .
Additionally , training software for the Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station , a remote control vehicle with automatic weapons , was incorporated into the 2.7 version of " America 's Army . "
The Army has also used the game to test new weapons .
The Army 's weapons research laboratory , the Armament Research , Development and Engineering Center ( ARDEC ) , uses " America 's Army " simulators to create virtual weapons testing grounds that are so lifelike ARDEC can " try out a new weapons system before any metal is cut . "
In " America 's Army " one can play and undergo real - world military training at the same time .
( 9 )
Most troubling of all , these recruitment and training techniques are targeted at children .
Apart from sanitizing the violence of war , the Army toned down the gore in the game to get a Teen rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board , the equivalent of a PG rating on movies , so that children as young as 13 could play " America 's Army . "
Chris Chambers , the game project 's deputy director explains that " we have a teen rating that allows 13 - year - olds to play , and in order to maintain that rating we have to adhere to certain standards .
We want to reach young people to show them what the Army does ...
We can't reach them if we are over the top with violence and other aspects of war that might not be appropriate .
It 's a choice we made to be able to reach the audience we want . "
( 10 )
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) has found that Army use of the game , and its recruiting practice in general , violate international law .
In May , the ACLU published a report that found the armed services " regularly target children under 17 for military recruitment .
Department of Defense instruction to recruiters , the US military 's collection of information of hundreds of thousands of 16 - year - olds , and military training corps for children as young as 11 reveal that students are targeted for recruitment as early as possible .
By exposing children under 17 to military recruitment , the United States military violates the Optional Protocol . "
The Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict , ratified by the Senate in December 2002 , protects the rights of children under 16 from military recruitment and deployment to war .
The US subsequently entered a binding declaration that raised the minimum age to 17 , meaning any recruitment activity targeted at those under 17 years old is not allowed in the United States .
The ACLU report goes on to highlight the role of " America 's Army , " saying the Army uses the game to " attract young potential recruits ... train them to use weapons , and engage in virtual combat and other military missions , " adding that the game " explicitly targets boys 13 and older . "
In June , at the 48th session of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child , the Committee noted US violations of the Protocol and urged the United States to " ensure that its policy and practice on deployment is consistent with the provisions of the Protocol . " ( 11 )
Four years after the game was introduced at the 2002 Los Angles E3 , and half way around the world in Mosul , Iraq , " America 's Army " was having an effect .
Sgt. Sinque Swales had just fired his .50 caliber machine gun at so - called insurgents for only the second time .
" It felt like I was in a big video game , " he said .
" It did n't even faze me , shooting back .
It was just natural instinct .
Boom !
Boom !
Boom ! Boom ! "
While Sergeant Swales found game training conditioned him for combat situations , other soldiers report " America 's Army " played a direct role in guiding them to the military .
Pvt. Doug Stanbro told The Christian Science Monitor in a 2006 interview that he " never really thought about the military at all before I started playing this game . "
An informal Army study of the same year showed that 4 out of 100 new recruits in Ft. Benning , Georgia , credit " America 's Army " as the primary factor in convincing them to join the military .
Sixty percent of those recruits surveyed said they played the game more than five times a week .
And a 2004 Army survey found that nearly a third of young Americans aged 16 to 24 had some contact with the game in the previous six months .

" America 's Army " is not a game ; it is a recruitment and training tool that the Army uses in violation of international law .
While soldiers and civilians continue to kill and die in Iraq and Afghanistan , private corporations like Ubisoft reap handsome profits from the Army 's project to train and recruit children .
Military game developers are very open about this role , as Colonel Wardynski proudly proclaims in article after article , " We want kids to come into the Army and feel like they 've already been there . "
In this sense , " America 's Army " is more than a recruiting tool ; it is an attempt to shift public perceptions about the Army and a conscious effort to militarize youth and video game culture .
Indeed , the Army has been largely successful , so long as we accept sophisticated propaganda , recruitment and training programs like " America 's Army " as simply games and entertainment .
In a statement that could apply to any of the military propaganda programs for youth , including popular movies like " Transformers " and " Iron Man , " Wardynski says , " If you do n't get in there and engage them early in life about what they 're going to do with their lives , when it comes time for them to choose , you 're in a fallback position . "
With the need for fresh recruits at an all - time high due to popular opposition to the murderous and illegal wars , the Army is hoping their game will keep them from stepping into a fallback recruiting position .
According to Colonel Wardynski , " today 's Soldiers are gamers , " and , we might add , the Army is hoping to make the statement true in the converse as well .
When this means the militarization and recruitment of our children , we should all take special notice .

Showcasing a game in an outdoor arena on New Year 's Day worked so well the first time , it appears the NHL is going to go for it again .
An announcement is expected later this month for the 2009 Winter Classic , the second one pitting the Chicago Blackhawks and the Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings at fabled Wrigley Field , the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on its Web site .
An announcement is expected next week before the " Blackhawks Convention " at the Chicago Hilton .
According to the Star Tribune 's report , the game was approved last week when NHL commissioner Gary Bettman met with the Blackhawks , Cubs and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley .
Last New Year 's Day , more people tuned in to see
the NHL play outdoors than any other regular - season game in more than a decade .
The Penguins - Sabres game in snowy Buffalo -- the first
regular - season outdoor NHL game in the United States -- drew a 2.6 overnight rating and a 5 share on NBC .
Each ratings point represents about 735,000
households ; the rating is the percentage watching a telecast among homes with televisions , and the share is the percentage tuned into
a broadcast among those households with televisions on at the time .
Overnight ratings measure the 55 largest TV markets in the United States .
The 2.6/5 were the best numbers
since a six - game regional telecast on Fox drew a 3.0 overnight rating and a 7 share on Feb.
3 , 1996 .
Pittsburgh won 2 - 1 in a shootout on a Sidney Crosby score
before a crowd of more than 71,000 at Ralph Wilson Stadium .
The Winter Classic ratings also surpassed Wayne Gretzky 's final game , which was broadcast on Fox on April 18 , 1999 , and drew a 2.5/6 .
The first outdoor NHL game , billed as the Heritage Classic , was played Nov. 22 , 2003 in Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton , Alberta .
The Montreal Canadiens beat the Oilers 4 - 3 .

Imagine you ’re using some library for interfacing with MySQL from python .
And MySQL is dying from under your application .
And you ’re not dealing with it gracefully .
So you get greeted with :
OperationalError : ( 2006 , ' MySQL server has gone away ' )
If you re-start your app , the problem will go away for a bit .
So how can you test ( unit test , even ) that you ’re degrading gracefully ?
Here ’s one example .
Rather more clean and generic and simple than what you typically do in something statically typed like java .

When I postulated in a short post last week that comedienne Kathy Griffin would have faced a more dire fate than being hectored by the Catholic Leauge ’s Bill Donohue had she made a joke about Muhammad rather than Jesus , Salon.com blogger Glenn Greenwald succumbed to his usual hysterics , running off a thousand - plus word screed grouping me alongside “ right - wing warmongers ” like Ann Coulter , Glenn Beck , and Mark Steyn , and calling my fears fantasies .
Not to needle the ever - excitable Greenwald , but in related news about the over - exaggerated Muslim threat that only exists in the minds of “ right - wing warmongers , ” the head of al Qaeda in Iraq , Abu Omar al - Baghdadi , has called for the death of Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks for — what else ? — drawing a picture of Muhammad .
Demonstrating a real entrepreneurial spirit , al - Baghdadi offered a “ 50 per cent bonus if Mr. Vilks was ‘ slaughtered like a lamb ’ by having his throat cut . ”
Swedish police have placed Vilks under their protection .
According to the Times ( London ) , a spokesperson for the Swedish phone company Ericsson says that it has instructed its employees “ to keep a low profile in Muslim countries and to take extra care in deciding where to go or park their cars . ”
The feckless Swedish ambassador to Saudi Arabia met with the head of the Organization of the Islamic Conference , offering his “ deepest apologies for the controversy created by the publishing of the hurtful depiction . ”
I must have imagined this , too , right ?
Fortunately , Mr. Vilks has responded to the bounty placed on his head with good humor , telling the Times , “ I suppose that this makes my art project a bit more serious .
It is also good to know how much one is worth . ”
Greenwald might want to consider emulating Lars Vilks ’s sense of humor .
All those tantrums have to be taxing .

A new USA Today / Gallup poll released today revealed that John McCain now leads Barack Obama 49 % - 45 % .
However the lead is among likely , not registered voters .
Among registered voters , Obama leads McCain 47 % - 44 % .
McCain did experience a ten point swing in this poll from last month when he trailed Obama by 6 points .
This is not the same poll as Gallup ’s daily tracking poll which currently shows Obama leading McCain 48 % - 40 % .
The USA Today poll has a margin of error of four points , so the race is actually a statistical tie .
The USA Today poll used a relatively small sample size of 791 people .
While other national polls show the race as within 5 points , there has been nothing to suggest that the race is tied or McCain is leading .
I think that there had to have been a problem with the sample used for this poll .
This looks like an anomaly , just as the polls that had Obama leading by 15 were outside of the range .
Advertisements
If nothing else these results should give McCain supporters something to feel good about , and Obama backers something to ponder .
It is my opinion that there are still a number of Obama supporters who think that this election will be a cake walk .
It wo n’t be .
In fact , this race is already turning negative and personal just like the elections in 2000 and 2004 .
If Obama does n’t convince the American people to elect him , we could see the nation split 50 /50 for a third straight election .
This question in this race is n’t about John McCain .
It is all about Barack Obama .
Because of close nature of the past two elections , I believe that these national polls mean nothing .
The real barometers are the state polls , which very few people seem to pay attention to .
Remember that according to the national polls one year ago Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani would be battling it out for the White House , so until we get closer to Election Day , these polls do n’t mean much .

Ryan sez , " Chicago is touting their new ' intelligent ' 700 + camera network as being able to flag suspicious activity without human intervention , based on operator - defined criteria within the video frame .
Video is archived for 30 days in a 60 terabyte storage vault .
Great . "
They 're everywhere .
They 're multiplying .
Several thousand cameras are now capable of sending live pictures into a room – the operations center at the city 's Office of Emergency Management and Communication .
There 's no way that human beings can effectively watch all those feeds , so enter video analytics .
By programming algorithms , you give the camera intelligence .
" We actually can tell the camera , ' This is precisely what we 're looking for . '
The camera will watch for that circumstance , and when that circumstance occurs , comes back to the human being whether they 're watching that camera or not – with an alert , " said OEMC director Jim Argiropolous .
Madonna Lebling , a researcher for the Washington Post , noted in reviewing President Bush ’s appearances and public statements , that the President has taken the Harry Potter approach to Senator Obama in that the President has uttered the senator ’s name but a handful of times since Obama began his bid for the White House last year .
And the last time Bush did so was an “ attempt at humor ” during the White House Correspondents Dinner where the President said that Senator Obama :
“ was unable to attend because he was ‘ at church . ' ”
It was a reference to the candidate ’s troubles with his controversial former minister .
Of course , the President has no such aversion to mentioning his desired candidate Senator McCain by name .
Nor does Bush have an aversion to fundraising for the presumptive Republican nominee .
One would assume that the current resident of the White House wants McCain to become the next resident .
But I question that assumption when the White House ‘ accidentally ‘ sends a Reuters story of an interview Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki gave to Der Speigel , a German news outlet , stating Maliki supports the 16 month US withdrawal plan of He Who Must Not Be Named ’s to “ an extensive distribution list . ”
As ABC ’s Jake Tapper reports :
The misfire comes at an odd time for Bush foreign policy , at a time when Obama ’s campaign alleges the president is moving closer toward Obama ’s recommendations about international relations — sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , discussing a “ general time horizon ” for U.S. troop withdrawal and launching talks with Iran .
Whoopsy .
The Washington Post says :
The mixup came after the White House announced Friday that it had agreed with Maliki to set a “ general time horizon ” for U.S. troop withdrawal .
Time Horizon ?
Which , of course is nothing like a timeline , timeframe , or any such thing , because we all know that :
the horizon is the line where the sky meets the earth — and thus can never be reached .
I am certain that this is the desired withdrawal date that the White House and Senator McCain have in mind ; one which can never be reached ( much like the elusive definition of Success in Iraq ) .
What does the McCain camp have to say about the Der Speigel article ?
Well , that it was mistranslated .
Too bad that the Iraqi government again stated their support of the He Who Must Not Be Named timeline .
It appears that there has been the adoption of many of Obama ’s policies of late .
Before we know it , the Republican ’s will be telling us that these were their policies all along .
And the most priceless quote of the day ?
This by Christopher Hayes over at The Nation ( about the Iraqi government ’s take on Obama ’s timeline ) :
What ’s truly amazing about this turn of events is that it more and more looks like the Prime Minister of Iraq is going to help engineer regime change back in the US .
For that , can I get an Amen ?!

I have a Rover , and use it .
I live in South Dakota , near a lake with little to no access .
I use the 4x4 every winter for essential purposes , and every summer for recreation .
So yes , there is a reason to own one .
Maybe not if you live in Los Angeles or NY , NY , but there sure is if you live anywhere that can have snow cover from September until May some years .
Further , I do love art / sculpture / etc more than my standard midwestern ilk , but really do n't feel that bolting a land rover to a large metal web is art .
It is just my opinion , but this certainly could have been done more artistically than it was .
Maybe it loses something on the net , and needs to be seen in person , but for some reason I just do n't see it .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Karl Rove , President Bush 's longtime political guru , refused to obey an order to testify before a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday .
Karl Rove 's lawyers says he is immune from a congressional subpoena .
Rove 's lawyer asserted that Rove was " immune " from the subpoena the committee had issued , arguing that the committee could not compel him to testify due to " executive privilege . "
The panel is investigating allegations that Rove and his White House allies dismissed U.S. attorneys and prosecuted officials who they saw as political opponents .
The panel subpoenaed Rove in May after his lawyer , Robert D. Luskin , made clear the former White House deputy chief of staff would not appear voluntarily .
Luskin responded immediately that Rove still would not appear , prompting a threat of prosecution from the Judiciary Committee chairman , Rep. John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , and Rep. Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat who chairs the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law .
" A refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject Mr. Rove to contempt proceedings , including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives , " Conyers and Sanchez wrote .
" We are unaware of any proper legal basis for Mr. Rove 's refusal to even appear today as required by the subpoena , " Sanchez said Thursday morning when Rove failed to show up .
" The courts have made clear that no one -- not even the president -- is immune from compulsory process .
That is what the Supreme Court rules in U.S. v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones . "
In May , Conyers contrasted Rove 's refusal to testify before Congress with his paid work as a commentator for the Fox News Channel and Newsweek magazine .
" Although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media , Mr. Rove and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate .
Unfortunately , I have no choice today but to compel his testimony on these very important matters . "
Rove 's lawyer cited a letter from the Justice Department saying Rove is " constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony . "
He said Rove is willing to submit to an " informal interview " or to answer written questions about the prosecution of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman , whose ouster Rove is accused of orchestrating .
" Threatening Mr. Rove with sanctions will not in any way expedite the resolution of the issue , " Luskin wrote in a letter to the panel on Wednesday .
Luskin noted in May that his client had already received a separate subpoena from the Senate Judiciary Committee .
" While the [ House ] committee has the authority to issue a subpoena , it is hard to see what this will accomplish , apart from a ' Groundhog Day ' replay of the same issues that are already the subject of litigation , " the lawyer wrote , referring to a movie in which a person lives the same day over and over again .
Luskin added that " issues of executive privilege and separation of powers " could limit Rove 's testimony .
In response , Conyers said the two committees are focusing on different matters , with the House committee delving into the prosecution of the former Alabama governor , a Democrat who lost his bid for re-election in 2002 and was convicted on corruption charges in 2006 .
Conyers also noted that other former White House officials have testified under subpoena in the past and have dealt with issues of executive privilege on a case - by - case basis .
" Mr. Rove should follow the same course , " he said .
Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , called the subpoena " a sham . "
The Democratic - controlled Congress has been battling for months to force the White House to disclose information about the firing of the attorneys and the prosecution of Siegelman .
Current and former White House aides have refused to testify , citing executive privilege .

とりあえず 、 「 クラウドコンピューティングが今後のトレンドだから」というのは却下で。なぜなら、同じように一般消費者向けのOSを提供しているAppleはGoogleを目の敵にしたりはしていない。
これを考えるには、それぞれの事業内容について分析しないといけなくて、本当は、年次報告とかじっくり読んで分析するところだけれど、今日は面倒なので雰囲気だけ。

Google ミドルエンドからローエンドの汎 用Webサービスを提供する
汎用っていうのは、OSとか認証とかデータベースとか検索とかメーラーとかオフィスソフトとかそういう何をするにも使うようなあたりという意味合いで。
AppleとMicrosoftは、同じようにOSを提供している企業で、WindowsかMacかという比較をされることが多い企業だけれど、事業内容としてはちょっとずれている。重なる部分も多く、お互い意識しているが、Microsoftはハードウェアを生産しないし、Appleは特殊な業界を除いてビジネスユースやサーバー用途には使われない。基本的にこの２社は、ユーザーベースがあまり競合しないと思われる。
それに対し 、MicrosoftとGoogleは、ソフトウェアとWebサービスという違いはあるが、提供する機能やユーザーベースを考えるともろに重なっているように思える。どちらもミドルエンドからローエンドの顧客をターゲットとしているし、どちらもユーザー体験よりも実用性を重視している機能が中心になる。
こうして考えると、MicrosoftがGoogleを非常に意識して、Yahoo!に買収を仕掛けるに至ったことは、とても自然に理解できる気がする。

About the author
( NewsTarget ) Transcending political controversy and stigma surrounding the subject , the second largest physician group in the country has endorsed the use , reclassification , and further study of medicinal marijuana .
In a position paper issued February 14th , the American College of Physicians ( ACP ) makes the case that the red tape surrounding the medical use of cannabis is obscuring good science and stifling research .
Several states including California have opened the door for legal use of medical marijuana , but this stands in opposition to the federal government 's Schedule I classification of the plant .
This discontinuity has led to legal obfuscation and obscurity as to what is actually legal .
Schedule I is a term used to describe drugs such as LSD and heroin , and translates to a substance having " no accepted medical use and being unsafe for use even under medical supervision .
" With their newly defined position , ACP now joins the ranks of dozens of other national medical groups urging an ease on cannabis regulation in the face of what many consider overwhelming scientific evidence of its medicinal usefulness .
" ACP urges review of marijuana 's status as a Schedule I controlled substance and reclassification into a more appropriate schedule , given the scientific evidence regarding marijuana 's safety and efficacy in some clinical conditions , " the paper states .
Supporters hope that this will be the long - awaited nudge needed to tip the American Medical Association ( AMA ) in favor of reclassification and legal protection for medical use of the drug .
The AMA urges further research , but so far it does not support reclassification of the Schedule I substance .
To date , the most serious argument for potential damage done by cannabis is harm to the lungs caused by smoking .
The paper notes that this problem has already been overcome by a technology known as vaporization , in which the active constituents are efficiently released into the lungs without burning the plant .
Another myth dispelled by the paper is that marijuana acts as a ' gateway drug , ' leading to the use of more harmful substances .
" Marijuana has not been proven to be the cause or even the most significant predictor of serious drug abuse .
Opiates are highly addictive , yet medically effective ...
There is no evidence to suggest that medical use of opiates has increased perception that their illicit use is safe or acceptable , " the group states .
The paper also cites significant evidence that cannabis relieves the nausea , vomiting and wasting that accompany cancer , AIDS and other diseases , while lessening the pain associated with multiple sclerosis and many other conditions .
Calling for further research , ACP points out that the period of validation has passed in more heavily researched areas .
In these cases , the group makes clear their position that the time has come to roll out trials designed to determine proper dosage and method of delivery -- a step currently being stonewalled by the drug 's legal classification .

His passion and dedication is in bringing the best ideas for self - empowerment through nutrition and nutraceuticals as well as alternative therapies , technology , and information to the public through various means .
The video lasts just more than three minutes .
But that ’s long enough to raise some nasty doubts about John McCain ’s reputation as a straight talker .
There ’s the Arizona senator arguing both sides of President Bush ’s tax cuts .
Here ’s the supposed foreign policy wizard flubbing the simple facts about which terrorists are being trained in Iran .
He ’s even ducking his own admission that he needs to learn more about economics .
The newsreel of McCain lowlights has zoomed up the YouTube charts in the last week , with more than 1.5 million views .
“ John McCain ’s YouTube Problem Just Became a Nightmare ” is the video ’s title , which might be dismissed as partisan hype but for one thing :
It ’s true .
The presumed Republican presidential nominee is taking a serious drubbing on YouTube , the most popular video - sharing service on the Internet and the virtual town square for millions of new young voters .
Search “ John McCain ” on YouTube and you ’ll find the latest broadside , by Brave New Films of Culver City , and a lot more that ’s not good for a candidate who ’s built his reputation on constancy and authenticity .
There ’s McCain stumbling over a debate question and , worse , his cringe - worthy answer wickedly paired with the hapless Miss Teen USA contestant who went blank on a query about Americans and geography .
There ’s McCain seemingly on the verge of swallowing his tongue , so great is his discomfort when Ellen DeGeneres asks him why women like her should n’t be allowed to marry other women .
Six of the top 10 videos returned by a “ John McCain ” YouTube search Thursday pegged the 71 - year - old as inconsistent , extreme , wooden or a combination of the three .
( The one clearly favorable piece came from the McCain campaign and focused on his Navy service . )
Contrast that with a YouTube search of " Barack Obama . ”
It ’s a swoon fest , with virtually all of the top entries featuring the Illinois senator at his eloquent , uplifting best .
The videos range from the pop-icon worship of Scarlett Johansson and John Legend & Co. in “ Yes We Can ” ( closing in on 13 million views ) to a clip of the candidate ’s speech on race after the explosion over the controversial sermons of his onetime pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.
That 37 - minute political speech has logged 4.5 million views , a phenomenal number in a Web world more fixated on " American Idol ” rejects and piano - playing cats .
With about five months to go before the general election , Obama will face his own uncomfortable video moments .
Elsewhere in the fractured media universe , say AM talk radio , he ’ll feel the heat .
But that does n’t mean Republicans are n’t worried about the YouTube imbalance .
“ This is another example of the generation gap that the Republicans are facing .
And that gap is morphing into a chasm , ” said Frank Luntz , a veteran GOP pollster .
Yes , many of the young video viewers are already committed to Obama , but watching and even making the short films has turned the merely amused into the deeply committed .
“ You activate them and engage them in a way you have n’t before , up to and including on election day , ” Luntz said .
“ I think this is a critical part of Obama ’s appeal . ”
Liberal filmmakers have become as aggressive in promoting their work as in making it .
Witness Brave New Films , formed by entertainment industry veterans who have enough time and financial security to devote themselves to political activism .
The outfit relies on an e-mail list of more than 400,000 , aggressive outreach to social networking sites and a full - time blog liaison specialist to help promote the films .
The organization ’s producer - director , Robert Greenwald , got a sense of how broad his reach had become when his 15 - year - old son giddily reported that the latest anti-McCain piece had hit a chat room for the online video game Wonderful World of Warcraft .
“ In his mind , ” Greenwald said , “ I could not have done anything better . ”
Online film has lowered the price of entry to political discourse and pumped new life into an ossified communications universe .
That does n’t mean it ’s brought greater accuracy or fairness .
So videos will continue to portray Obama as a fellow traveler of Louis Farrakhan , even though the candidate has denounced the firebrand minister .
And McCain will be accused a thousand times over of pining for a 100 - year war in Iraq , when he actually said he could see keeping military bases for that long , but only in a stabilized country .
So how do McCain & Co. get into the YouTube game ?
Woefully behind in support from young people , Hollywood luminaries and Web activists , it seems a little hopeless .
But the Republican standard - bearer might get himself a YouTube toehold by taking a page from Mike Huckabee .
The former Arkansas governor reached into his ( admittedly shallow ) pool of Hollywood supporters and fished out . . . Chuck Norris .
The tough guy and the wisecracking pol teamed in an irony - drenched ad .
( Huckabee staring earnestly from the screen : “ My plan to secure the border ?
Two words : Chuck Norris . ” )
That one spot was a bigger hit ( 2 million views ) than anything McCain has produced .
For similar results , it may be time for McCain to play his own , less - menacing Hollywood ace : Wilford Brimley .
Yes , it ’s been years since the portly , walrus - mustachioed actor appeared in “ Cocoon . ”
But he ’s got those Quaker Oats ads and that stolid , old - man cool .
And , yes , Brimley supports John McCain .
A few years ago , someone took a TV spot of Brimley hawking a diabetes test kit , set it to a dance groove and dredged up 736,000 viewers .
Now he ’s got a presidential candidate to sell .
How hard can this stuff be ?

James Rainey will keep watch on how the media , old and new , cover the election .
This is his first On the Media column .
I originally discovered the fiendishly addictive Tower Defense as a multiplayer game modification for Warcraft III .
It 's a cooperative game mode where you , and a few other players , are presented with a simple maze .
A group of monsters appear at the entrance and trudge methodically toward the exit .
Your goal is to destroy the monsters before they reach the exit by constructing attack towers along the borders of the maze .
As you kill monsters , you gain cash , which you use to purchase more powerful attack towers and upgrades for your existing towers .
The monsters keep increasing in power each wave , but if you 're clever , you might be able to survive all the waves and reach the end .
I can't explain exactly what makes Tower Defense so addictive , but man , is it ever .
Perhaps it 's the collaborative gameplay , along with the " just one more time " element of different tower arrangements and greater income to build ever more powerful towers .
Remember , this is a game mode not created by Blizzard , but invented by multiplayer game modders using the tools provided with Warcraft III .
It was completely unique -- I had never played anything like it .
After about six months , I completely stopped playing traditional multiplayer games of Warcraft III in favor of user modifications like Tower Defense .
As a hat tip to the community , Blizzard included their take on tower defense as a hidden mission in the Frozen Throne expansion .
I suppose it was inevitable that this new , addictive Tower Defense game mode would jump from the select audience of gamers with gaming - class PCs to simpler Flash implementations everyone can enjoy .
The low - intensity , puzzle - like gameplay of Tower Defense translates well to the broad audience of casual gamers .
And the most popular version , by far , is Desktop Tower Defense .
Warning : before clicking on that link , allow me to reiterate : tower defense is addictive !
Do n't blame me if you lose an hour or more of productivity .
But if you , like me , just have to make it through all 50 levels ( or 100 levels in challenge mode ) , I refer you to this collection of Desktop Tower Defense strategies .
And a word of advice : upgrade a few towers to the maximum ; do n't spread your upgrades across a fleet of towers .
You'd be surprised how much money you can make by creating a flash game and giving it away for free on the internet .
The Tower Defense game mode is a business opportunity for an enterprising programmer .
According to a recent interview , Paul Preese , the author of Desktop Tower Defense , is making around $ 8,000 per month .
So here 's a couple ways to a create successful game online :
Find an investor who 's crazy enough to give you millions of dollars
Put it on a distribution network and hope you get enough customers willing to buy it as a download Make a Flash mini- game , let people play it for free , and watch the ad revenue pour in when the site gets 20 million pageviews a month .
That 's the option Paul Preece took with his phenomenally popular Desktop Tower Defense , and though he has no professional experience with game development , the Visual Basic programmer is now making , by his estimate , high four figures monthly for his ferociously viral little game .
DTD 's main revenue source is AdSense , but with its avalanche of popularity , advertisers have approached Preece directly , leading to " Affiliate deals , sponsorship , custom versions for other companies etc .
The last two are in the pipeline but I thought I 'd add them in at a low level . "
Preece 's main expense is running the server .
" Hosting fees are negligible , " he says , " at $ 130 per month .
But I am getting very close to the 1200 GB bandwidth allocation ! "
That plus " the continuous supply of late night Red Bull " comprise the bulk of Desktop 's budget .
So minus the time he spent programming , and his nominal hosting fees , Paul Preese is clearing almost $ 100,000 " salary " per year with Desktop Tower Defense .
And he did it all on his own : he wrote the game , placed it on a public web server , hooked up AdSense , and then submitted it to a few social bookmark sites .
No selling his soul to a publisher , no middlemen , just pure income , controlled directly by him .
What 's truly exciting about this is how the internet has created economic opportunity for a single programmer working alone .
You might not get rich , exactly , but $ 100 k / year is an impressive salary in most areas of the United States .
Roller Coaster Tycoon was the last traditionally published game created by a single programmer working alone .
The author , Chris Sawyer , cleared $ 30 million for all the various version of the game released since 1999 , according to financial documents released by the publisher .
And just to put things in perspective , the publisher cleared $ 180 million .
That 's the " selling your soul " part .
Granted , $ 4 million per year is a heck of a lot more than $ 100,000 per year .
But the odds of you and I getting a publishing deal -- or writing a game in assembly language -- are pretty slim .
Paul 's success , on the other hand , is something that any programmer , with sufficient motivation and a little bit of luck , could potentially duplicate .
The word " pitch " is just an old fashioned name for " tar " .
The first Englishman to visit the lake was Sir Walter Raleigh , who used the pitch to seal his ship to prevent leaks .
Pitch Lake is a 95 acre lake of tar on Trinidad 's west coast , in the appropriately named " La Brea " district .
The guidebook I have says the lake is often a disappointment for tourists who drive down from Port of Spain , because it looks like a large parking lot .
Personally , I found the trip very worthwhile .
This is , after all , the largest deposit of naturally occurring tar in the world .
Jesse Ventura By Jim Mone , AP WASHINGTON ( AP )  Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura is declining to definitevely answer just yet whether he 's running for Senate .
National Public Radio on Wednesday reported that Ventura says he 's running for the seat , quoting him as saying " I run " because of Senator Norm Coleman 's support for the Iraq war .
But Ventura tells
The Associated Press he had been speaking hypothetically .
POLITICS BLOG : Ventura entering Senate ring ?
Ventura says in responding to the NPR reporter 's question about why he would run , " I gave him the reasons why I would run .
But I said ultimately , it will come down to whether I want to change my lifestyle and go to that lifestyle or not . "
ABC
News followed up with a blog item headlined , " Jesse Ventura To Run for Senate , " citing the NPR report .
Ventura says bluntly that no one knows whether he will run — not even his wife .
He says the decision wo n't be made until next Tuesday , the filing deadline .

Private First Class James Burmeister faces a Special Court Martial at Fort Knox on July 16 .
The charges are AWOL and desertion .
He returned to Fort Knox voluntarily in March , after living 10 months in Canada with his spouse and infant child .
He refused redeployment to Iraq while on leave in May 2007 .
In most such cases at Fort Knox , the Army has in recent years quietly dismissed the resister with a less than honorable discharge “ for the good of the military . ”
This time it ’s different .
The brass “ offered ” Burmeister a year in military prison and a dishonorable discharge if he agreed to plead guilty .
Burmeister refused the offer .
His father , Erich , says the Army is making an example of James for denouncing a secret “ bait - and - switch ” program he was forced to participate in while in Iraq .
In media interviews last year in Canada , James described the program as a war crime he was forced to commit .
Shortly afterward , the program ’s details came out in the Washington Post .
“ Baiting is putting an object out there that we know they will use , with the intention of destroying the enemy , ” the Post quoted Capt .
Matthew Didier , leader of an elite sniper scout platoon .
“ We would put an item out there and watch it .
If someone found the item , picked it up and attempted to leave with the item , we would engage the individual . ”
The Post reported that “ Eugene Fidell , president of the National Institute of Military Justice , said such a baiting program … raises troubling possibilities , such as what happens when civilians pick up the items .
…
‘ You might as well ask every Iraqi to walk around with a target on his back , ’ Fidell said . ” ( Sept. 24 , 2007 )
James had asked to be classified as a conscientious objector following his training in Germany , but his request was ignored by his commander .
Instead , he became a machine gunner .
“ Our unit ’s job seemed to be more about targeting a largely innocent civilian population or deliberately attracting confrontation , ” he wrote in his deposition seeking asylum in Canada .
“ These citizens were almost always unarmed .
In some cases the Iraqi victims looked to me like they were children . ” ( Eugene Weekly , May 22 )
In Iraq , Burmeister had been knocked unconscious and his face filled with shrapnel when his Humvee was hit by a roadside bomb .
The shrapnel wounds left him with a traumatic brain injury , and he suffers from severe Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder .
His parents insist that he urgently needs medical and psychological help , not jail time .
His parents have waged an unceasing struggle for the Army to release him .
They called on their representative , Peter DeFazio , to launch a congressional inquiry into James ’s case , but have so far heard nothing .
James ’ mother , Helen Burmeister , flew to Fort Knox in June , with help from anti-war ex-Colonel Ann Wright .
Helen spoke directly to the base commander there , demanding that her son be discharged in lieu of a court martial .
She then joined supporters from Veterans for Peace and Vietnam Vets Against the War demonstrating outside .
On July 8 the Army invited Helen to attend her son ’s court martial on July 16 .
This time both she and her husband Erich are going .
They ’re determined to keep James out of jail .
“ I bought a one - way ticket , ” Erich told Workers World .
“ I ’m not leaving without my son .
If I have to sit outside the base and wait for him , I ’ll do it .
Even if I have to go on a hunger strike , that ’s what I ’ll do .
My son does not deserve another day in jail . ”
In an interview with Courage to Resist , Erich said : “ [ James ] struggles with PTSD , yet he is quartered within earshot of the shooting range and tank training area , daily hearing the gunfire and explosions .
He has been prescribed a dangerous cocktail of anti-psychotic drugs and sleep aids by Army doctors , while the command decides if they want to send him to prison , as a coward , a soldier who faced death , and followed orders to ‘ shoot to kill . ’
The cowards — George Bush and Dick Cheney , those in Congress and the generals with the blood on their hands — why are they the punishers instead of the punished ? ” ( couragetoresist.org , May 12 )
Supporters can contact the Fort Knox post commander , General Campbell , to demand a speedy discharge and no further punishment for James .
Send email to knox.pao@conus.army.mil , or call the Fort Knox public affairs office at 502-624-7451 .
Ask that they discharge PFC James Burmeister now so that he can get the help that he needs .

Dean Baker points us to John McCain saying that
Americans have got to understand that we are paying present - day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today .
And that ’s a disgrace .
It ’s an absolute disgrace , and it ’s got to be fixed .
As Dean correctly points out ,
Of course present - day retirees have always been paid their benefits from the taxes paid by current workers .
That has been true from Social Security ’s inception .
I ’d guess that there are three things going on here .
First , McCain has no idea how Social Security works .
That may sound hard to believe , but not to anyone who has spent any time in or around the federal government .
Politicians , by and large , get where they are mainly by looking and sounding good ; this may or may not go along with any actual understanding of governing .
Second , McCain lives in the Washington bubble ; and as I wrote a while back ,
Inside the Beltway , doomsaying about Social Security — declaring that the program as we know it ca n’t survive the onslaught of retiring baby boomers — is regarded as a sort of badge of seriousness , a way of showing how statesmanlike and tough - minded you are .
Finally , McCain has surrounded himself with people who hate Social Security .
They probably tell him that it ’s a doomed Ponzi scheme , and he believes them .
The results are now in from the first sample of Mars regolith to be baked in Phoenix ’s oven .
It ’s not good news … there ’s no water .
After a difficult time of actually delivering the sample to the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) – a .k.a. the “ oven ” – scientists were hopeful for a clear science run .
They were finally able to sift the clumpy regolith through the TEGA screen last week .
However , the sample was waiting on the deck of Phoenix for some time until tests could be carried out on the sample ; it seems probable that any water ice will have sublimed into the thin atmosphere .
This first null result by no means suggests the area is devoid of water , Phoenix has many more water - finding tricks up its sleeves yet …
On June 11th , Phoenix mission control breathed a sigh of relief as they found a solution to the problem of getting the clumpy Mars regolith through the oven screen .
Over the weekend they were able to carry out the first tests on the sample and it appears that everything functioned as it should when the sample was heated to 35 °C ( 95 °F ) .
At this temperature any water in the sample will have melted .
In the second phase of the test , the sample was heated up to 175 °C ( 350 °F ) .
No water vapour was detected .
“ We saw no water coming off the soil whatsoever ” – William Boynton , TEGA team leader , University of Arizona .
Scientists are in no way surprised or discouraged about this early result .
The regolith sample sat atop the lander ’s TEGA hatch for several days whilst scientists tried to find an answer as to why no particles had fallen into the oven .
It is believed that any water ice in the sample will have quickly vaporized in the Martian sunlight and thin atmosphere .
As the atmospheric pressure is so low on Mars , exposed water ice cannot melt into liquid water , it will sublime straight to water vapour ( by - passing the liquid phase ) .
Over the coming days , scientists will instruct Phoenix to fire up the TEGA again to heat the sample to 1000 °C ( 1800 °F ) .
This will vaporize minerals that might be chemically bound to H 2 O , CO 2 or SO 2 and then use instrumentation to measure the vented gases .
Scientists are very confident that , although water has not been directly detected today , they will detect evidence of its existence in the next round of tests .
Whilst the drama unfolds in the lander ’s oven , Phoenix continues its excavation work on the surface with its robotic arm .
It has just expanded a trench ( a 3D visualization can be seen at the top of this post ) by linking the two trenches “ Dodo ” and “ BabyBear ” into a new united “ Dodo - Goldilocks ” trench .
This is the location where scientists noticed white sediment last Friday , so they will be keen to learn whether this is water or salt .

What does he see that others do not ?
What is his vision for one of America ’s most venerated dailies ?
Can he really grow TheJournal in such a hostile economic climate ?
And if he succeeds , might The Wall Street Journal as we know it , and as millions of readers have loved it , cease to exist ?
Murdoch has little patience for ceremony , and his words that takeover day in December were brief and to the point — pledges to make a “ great papah ” a “ bettah papah , ” assurances that “ we do know and understand the tremendous values of Dow Jones and particularly of TheWall Street Journal , and the very high bar -ah that you ’ve set yourselves , ” and optimistic talk about how the global economy , and the tremendous “ desiah for information ” that comes with it , offers TheJournal the chance to become “ the preeminent source of financial information and comment in the world . ”
After some polite applause , Murdoch introduced Robert Thomson , a lanky , stooped , Ichabod Crane–like figure in a black suit and skinny black tie , who , as Murdoch put it , “ will be the publisher , with the editors all reporting to him . ”
Murdoch explained that Thomson , a veteran of the rival Financial Times who had been editing TheTimes of London for him for almost six years , would have no “ business responsibilities ” as publisher , which meant that he was the paper ’s de facto new editor .
Thus crumbled , with Murdoch ’s first words as the new owner , the hopeful wall that had been erected with fanfare while the sale was going through to shield the paper ’s editorial content from the flamboyant magnate ’s meddling .
The paper ’s former top editor , Marcus Brauchli , was just a few paces away , his arms folded across his chest — a slight , amiable , balding man who had emerged victorious from a tumultuous management struggle the previous year , only to find himself presiding over someone else ’s newspaper .
His rise from the ranks of reporter had been so rapid that his nickname was “ The Rocket . ”
Feelings about Brauchli ( pronounced Brock - li ) contained the usual mix of admiration and envy that adheres to anyone who achieves remarkable success in a large organization , but overnight all jealousy had been replaced with hope .
The weight of TheJournal ’s proud traditions were draped across his slender shoulders .
He was the newsroom ’s champion , whose proven shrewdness and ambition would now be deployed in their defense .
And he seemed ideally suited to the task , given that he had been good friends with Thomson for years .
If anyone could skillfully navigate the treacherous waters ahead , it was Brauchli .
He would resign in four months .
Rupert Murdoch is , by most accounts , a delightful man .
Born to wealth that he has manifestly multiplied , he is a man who lives a globe - trotting lifestyle , a man who need never carry his own bags or stand in line at a security checkpoint at an airport , a man who moves through a string of fabulous residences ; it would be easy to assume that he is a coddled , petulant creature of privilege .
Yet Murdoch often flies commercial , carries his own bags , prefers a regular hotel room to a suite , uses taxis , and shops everywhere for bargains .
Bruce Dover , in his book , China Adventures , tells the story of how Murdoch , on the night of the formal handover of power in Hong Kong to the Chinese government , found himself by a series of accidents alone on foot in Kowloon , lost , trying to find his way back to his hotel with neither money nor cell phone .
He wandered for hours , melting in stifling humidity , unable to make himself understood , and when he did finally find his hotel , he was barred from entering by guards who were unimpressed with his protestations in English and his lack of an invitation or an ID .
Dover , one of his executives , was at long last summoned to the outer gate to investigate the stubborn imprecations of a damp , walletless old man .
Dover found Murdoch actually cheerful , or at least “ in surprisingly good humor . ”
Let ’s talk about DVCS
So , a few years ago all the cool kids were switching from CVS to Subversion .
These days , all the cool kids are switching from Subversion to some form of distributed version control ; git and Mercurial seem to be the ones with the largest market shares .
This switch is being accompanied by a simply deafening amount of hype about DVCS and how it ’s a revolutionary new paradigm and will completely change the way people work and … well , the usual stuff .
Over the past few months I ’ve tried out both of the popular DVCS tools : first I spent some time puzzling my way through git and realizing that , though I ’m fond of wiring together five dozen things with baling twine and duct tape to create a Rube Goldberg monstrosity , I ’m not yet ready to trust such a contraption with something like , oh , an important codebase .
It works for Linus because he wrote it , and that ’s great for him .
But it is n’t for me .
Then I tried out — and am still poking around with — Mercurial , which is on the whole a much friendlier and more humane tool .
But all of this poking and prodding has left me with a couple of nagging questions about which I am intensely curious , so I ’m going to write them up here and hope that someone smart can answer them for me .
OK , what ’s different ?
So , yeah , there ’s a lot of hype about DVCS .
And while I ’m prepared to dismiss a lot of the hyperbole as being simply the sort of thing you get in these situations , there ’s a lingering undercurrent of people suggesting that this is fundamentally different from how we ’ve been doing things up until now .
Which is kinda funny to me , because I look at why people get excited about DVCS and basically all I see are decent merging algorithms .
If I had to guess , I ’d say that 90 % or more of the claimed benefits of DVCS really do boil down to “ wow , it ’s easy to merge stuff ” .
While it ’s nice to have better merging than Subversion — and , really , what does n’t have better merging than Subversion ? — that does n’t exactly make for a brave new world .
The other big win people often claim for DVCS is offline commits .
At first I was kind of puzzled as to why offline commits would be such a great feature , and then I saw that mostly , the hype around them was about having a nice little local revision log you could step through before sending your changes off somewhere else .
So DVCS — as far as I can tell — is about better merging and offline commits .
Which is a problem if you ’re a DVCS advocate , because neither one of these seems to be intrinsic to the nature of distributed version control .
Let ’s take offline commit as an example .
Suppose that a new feature gets added to Subversion , such that you can sit at your computer and edit files in your working copy , and when you ’ve reached a logical stopping point you go and type something like :
$ svn waypoint -m " Finished refactoring the combobulator "
And suppose that this would make SVN record the current local changes and make a little local log entry .
Then , when you were ready to start committing back to the repo , you could step through your waypoints and decide which ones you want and which ones you do n’t .
Or , if you realized that your changes actually broke the combobulator , you could take out that waypoint even earlier and just roll back to where you ’d been previously .
I ’m willing to bet that this would cover practically every use case for offline commits in a DVCS , because ultimately it ’s the same thing : make some changes , note what they were .
The cycle of edit - commit - edit - commit in a DVCS would simply become edit - waypoint - edit - waypoint in this hypothetical SVN .
So this is n’t something that requires DVCS to implement ; you can do it just fine in an old - fashioned centralized VCS .
And the same is true of merging : there ’s no reason why the merging algorithm in a centralized VCS has to suck , and there ’s nothing intrinsic to merging algorithms which requires a DVCS to get them right .
Which leads to a question : what , then , is it that ’s so different about DVCS ?
Or , more pointedly : if Subversion pushed out a new release tomorrow which had a “ waypoint ” - style feature and a better merging algorithm , what features would be left to make the case for DVCS ?
I ’ve spent some time thinking this over and ca n’t come up with an answer .
Which is a problem for the DVCS folks , because if they do n’t have an answer they ’d better just give up now : sooner or later a popular centralized VCS will catch on and sprout these features , and DVCS will get sunk .
No , really , what ’s different ?
The other thing I do n’t yet understand about DVCS is how it actually changes the way software development will work .
Linux and Rails are two notable projects which have recently switched from centralized version control to DVCS ( git in both cases ) , and as far as I can tell the change went something like this :
Before the switch , people sent patches in for review by the core team , which then decided whether to commit those patches to the master tree .
After the switch , people send in patches for review by the core team , which then decides whether to commit those patches to the master tree .
In other words : it looks like the workflow has n’t actually changed at all .
For something that ’s purported to be a whole new paradigm of software development , that ’s not good .
What ’s worse , there ’s a nasty tendency to muddle the meanings of important words .
We ’re told that Rails , for example , switched away from a “ centralized ” system , but it ’s hard to see how the new setup is any less “ centralized ” than the old : there ’s still a single master tree that forms the basis of public distribution , and there ’s still a core team of privileged committers who act as gatekeepers to that tree .
Same goes for Linux ( and , even more confusing , when Linux used “ centralized ” version control people still routinely ran from branches maintained by core members of the project ) .
Which leads to another question , or perhaps a pair of questions : in the switch from “ centralized ” to “ distributed ” version control , in what sense exactly are things no longer “ centralized ” and what , precisely , has been “ distributed ” ?
Once again , I ca n’t come up with an answer .
And once again , that ’s not good for DVCS folks , because if I ca n’t puzzle it out there ’s no hope of winning over your pointy - haired boss .
I ’ve got questions .
You ’ve ( hopefully ) got answers .
I ’m not posting this to knock on DVCS in general or any individual tool in particular .
I ’ve been putting in some time to learn how this stuff works , and it seems neat , but if I ’m going to really commit to DVCS I ’ve got to know what it ’s going to get me .
If the answer is “ no real change to how your project is developed , and no features that could n’t be implemented in the next release of Subversion ” , well , I ’m probably not going to make the jump .
So : what am I missing here ?
There have to be answers to these questions , but I ’ve been exploring DVCS tools for months now ( ever since a certain co-worker started putting important things into a Mercurial repo ; you know who you are ) and I have n’t been able to find them .
In Opposition to the FISA Bill

Remarks as Prepared , Delivered 24 June 2008 Remarks as Prepared , Delivered 24 June 2008 212237 In Opposition to the FISA Bill Chris Dodd
Mr. President : I rise — once again — to voice my strong opposition to the misguided FISA legislation before us today .
I have strong reservations about the so - called improvements made to Title I .
But more than that , this legislation includes provisions which would grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that apparently have violated the privacy and the trust of millions of Americans by participating in the president ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
If we pass this legislation , the Senate will ratify a domestic spying regime that has already concentrated far too much unaccountable power in the president ’s hands and will place the telecommunications companies above the law .
I am here today to implore my colleagues to vote against cloture in the morning .
And let me make clear , at the outset of this debate , that this is not about domestic surveillance itself .
We all recognize the importance of domestic surveillance – in an age of unprecedented threats .
This is about illegal , unwarranted , unchecked domestic surveillance .
And that difference — the difference between surveillance that is lawful , warranted and that which is not — is everything .
Mr. President , I had hoped I would not have to return to this floor again under these circumstances – hoped that in these negotiations we would have been able to turn aside retroactive immunity on the grounds that it is bad policy and sets a terrible precedent .
As all of my colleagues know , I have long fought against retroactive immunity , because I believe , quite simply , it is an abandonment of the rule of law .
I ’ve fought this with everything I had in me — and I have n’t waged this fight alone .
In December , I opposed retroactive immunity on the Senate floor .
I spent ten hours on this floor then .
In January and February , I came to the floor time and time again to discuss the dangers of granting retroactive immunity .
Along with my colleague and friend Russ Feingold , who has shown remarkable leadership on this issue , I offered an amendment that would have stripped retroactive immunity from the Senate bill .
Unfortunately , our amendment failed and to my extreme disappointment , the Senate adopted the underlying bill .
Since passage of the Senate bill , there has been extensive negotiations on how to move forward .
Today , we are being asked to pass the so - called compromise that was reached by some of our colleagues and approved by the House of Representatives .
I am here today to say that I will not and cannot support this legislation .
It goes against everything I have stood for – everything this body ought to stand for .
There is no question some improvements have been made over the previous versions of this bill .
Title I , which regulates the ability of the government to conduct electronic surveillance , has indeed been improved .
Albeit modestly .
In fact , it is my hope that a new Congress and a new President will work together to fix the problems with Title I should the Senate adopt this new legislation .
But in no way is this compromise acceptable , Mr. President .
This legislation before us purports to give the courts more of a role in determining the legality of the telecommunications companies actions .
But in my view the Title II provisions do little more than ensure without a doubt that the telecommunications companies will be granted retroactive immunity .
Allow me to quote the Senate Intelligence Committee report on the matter .
It reads :
Beginning soon after September 11 , 2001 , the Executive branch provided written requests or directives to U.S. electronic communication service providers to obtain their assistance with communications intelligence activities that had been authorized by the President .
… The letters were provided to electronic communication service providers at regular intervals .
All of the letters stated that the activities had been authorized by the President .
All of the letters also stated that the activities had been determined to be lawful by the Attorney General , except for one letter that covered a period of less than sixty days .
That letter , which like all the others stated that the activities had been authorized by the President , stated that the activities had been determined to be lawful by the Counsel to the President .
Under the legislation before us , the district court would simply decide whether or not the telecommunication companies received documentation stating that the President authorized the program and that there had been some sort of determination that it was legal .
But , as the Intelligence Committee has already made clear , we already KNOW that this happened .
We already KNOW that the companies received some form of documentation , with some sort of legal determination .
But that ’s not the question .
The question is not whether these companies received a “ document ” from the White House .
The question is , “ were their actions legal ? ”
It ’s rather straightforward — surprisingly uncomplicated .
Either the companies were presented with a warrant , or they were n’t .
Either the companies and the President acted outside of the rule of law , or they followed it .
Either the underlying program was legal or it was n’t .
Because of this legislation , none of the questions will be answered , Mr. President .
Because of this so - called “ compromise , ” the judge ’s hands will be tied , and the outcome of these cases will be predetermined .
Because of this compromise , retroactive immunity will be granted and that , as they say , will be that .
Case closed .
No court will rule on the legality of the telecommunications companies activities in participating in the president ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
None of our fellow Americans will have their day in court .
What they will have is a government that has sanctioned lawlessness .
Well , I refuse to accept that , Mr. President .
I refuse to accept the argument that because this situation is just too delicate , too complicated , that this body is simply going to go ahead and sanction lawlessness .
We are better than that .
And if I have needed any reminder of that fact , simply look to all those who have joined this fight – my colleagues and the many , many Americans who have given me strength for this fight .
Strength that comes from the passion and eloquence of citizens who do n’t have to be involved , but choose to be nonetheless .
They see what I see in this debate – that by short - circuiting the judicial process we are sending a dangerous signal to future generations .
They see us establishing a precedent that Congress can — and will — provide immunity to potential law breakers , if they are “ important ” enough .
Mr. President , some may be asking – why is retroactive immunity so dangerous ?
What is this issue ?
Why should I care ?
Allow me to explain by providing a bit of context .
I want to remind my colleagues of what I said about this bill months ago , because the argument against providing retroactive immunity remains unchanged .
Mr. President , unwarranted domestic spying did n’t happen in a panic or short - term emergency , not for a week , or a month , or even a year .
If it had , I might not be here today .
But that is n’t the case .
What we now know is that spying by this Administration went on , relentlessly , for more than five years .
I might not be here if it had been the first offense of a new administration .
Maybe not if it had even been the second or the third .
But that is n’t the case either , Mr. President .
Indeed , I am here today because with offense after another after another , I believe it is long past time to say : “ enough . ”
I am here today because of a pattern — a pattern of abuse against civil liberties and the rule of law .
Against the Constitution — of which we are custodians , temporary though that status may be .
And I would add that had these abuses been committed by a president of my own party , I would have opposed them , every bit as vigorously .
I am here today because warrantless wiretapping is merely the latest link in a long chain of abuses .
So , why are we here ?
Because , Mr. President – it is alleged that giant telecom corporations worked with our government to compile Americans ’ private , domestic communications records into a database of enormous scale and scope .
Secretly and without a warrant , those corporations are alleged to have spied on their own customers – American customers .
Here ’s only one of the most egregious examples .
According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation :
Clear , first - hand whistleblower documentary evidence [ states ] … that for year on end every e-mail , every text message , and every phone call carried over the massive fiber - optic links of sixteen separate companies routed through AT&T ’s Internet hub in San Francisco — hundreds of millions of private , domestic communications — have been … copied in their entirety by AT&T and knowingly diverted wholesale by means of multiple “ splitters ” into a secret room controlled exclusively by the NSA .
The phone calls and internet traffic of millions of Americans , diverted into a secret room controlled by the National Security Agency .
That allegation still needs to be proven in a court of law .
But it clearly needs to be determined in a court of law and not here in Senate .
I suppose if you only see cables and computers there , the whole thing seems almost harmless .
Certainly nothing to get worked up about — a routine security sweep , and a routine piece of legislation blessing it .
If that ’s all you imagine happened in the NSA ’s secret room , I imagine you ’ll vote for immunity .
I imagine you would n’t see much harm in voting to allow this practice to continue either .
But if you see a vast dragnet for millions of Americans ’ private conversations , conducted by a government agency that acted without a warrant , acted outside of the rule of law — then , I believe , you ’ll recognize what ’s at stake here .
You ’ll see that what ’s at stake is the sanctity of the law and the sanctity of our privacy .
And you ’ll probably come to a very different conclusion .
Maybe that sounds overdramatic .
Perhaps some will ask , “ What does it matter , at the end of the day , if a few corporations are n’t sued ?
These people sue each other all the time . ”
Others may say , “ This seems a small issue .
Maybe the Administration went too far , but this seems like an isolated case . ”
Indeed , Mr. President – as long as this case seems isolated and technical , they win .
As long as it ’s about another lawsuit buried in our legal system and nothing more , they win .
The Administration is counting on the American people to see nothing bigger than that – “ Nothing to see here . ”
But there is plenty to see here , Mr. President – and it is so much more than a few phonecalls , a few companies , a few lawsuits .
What is at stake is nothing less than equal justice — justice that makes no exceptions .
What is at stake is an open debate on security and liberty , and an end to warrantless , groundless spying .
This bill does not say , “ Trust the American people ; Trust the courts and judges and juries to come to just decisions . ”
Retroactive immunity sends a message that is crystal clear :
“ Trust me . ”
And that message comes straight from the mouth of this President .
“ Trust me . ”
What is the basis for that trust ?
Classified documents , we are told , that prove the case for retroactive immunity beyond a shadow of a doubt .
But we ’re not allowed to see them !
I ’ve served in this body for 27 years , and I ’m not allowed to see them !
Neither are a majority of my colleagues .
We are all left in the dark .
I cannot speak for my colleagues — but I would never take “ trust me ” for an answer , not even in the best of times .
Not even from a President on Mount Rushmore .
I ca n’t put it better than this :
“ Trust me ” government is government that asks that we concentrate our hopes and dreams on one man ; that we trust him to do what ’s best for us .
My view of government places trust not in one person or one party , but in those values that transcend persons and parties .
Those words were not spoken by someone who took our nation ’s security lightly , Mr. President .
They were spoken by Ronald Reagan -- in 1980 .
They are every bit as true today , even if times of threat and fear blur our concept of transcendent values .
Even if those who would exploit those times urge us to save our skins at any cost .
But again , Mr. President :
“ Why should I care ? ”
The rule of law has rarely been in such a fragile state .
Rarely has it seemed less compelling .
What , after all , does the law give us anyway ?
It has no parades , no slogans .
It lives in books and precedents .
And , we are never failed to be reminded , the world is a very dangerous place .
Indeed , that is precisely the advantage seized upon , not just by this Administration but in all times , by those looking to disregard the rule of law .
As James Madison , the father of our Constitution , said more than two centuries ago , “ It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is to be charged to the provisions against danger … from abroad . ”
With the passage of this bill , his words would be one step closer to coming true .
So it has never been more essential that we lend our voices to the law , and speak on its behalf .
What is this about , Mr. President ?
It ’s about answering the fundamental question : do we support the rule of law …or the rule of men ?
To me , this is our defining question — indeed it may be the defining question that confronts every generation .
This is about far more than a few telecoms – it is about contempt for the law , large and small .
Mr. President , I ’ve said that warrantless wiretapping is but the latest link in a long chain of abuses when it comes to the rule of law .
This is about the Justice Department turning our nation ’s highest law enforcement offices into patronage plums , and turning the impartial work of indictments and trials into the pernicious machinations of politics .
Contempt for the rule of law .
This is about Alberto Gonzales , the nation ’s now - departed Attorney General , coming before Congress to give us testimony that was at best , wrong — and at worst , outright perjury .
Contempt for the rule of law – by the nation ’s foremost enforcer of the law .
This is about Congress handing the president the power to designate any individual he wants as an “ unlawful enemy combatant , ” hold him indefinitely , and take away his right to habeas corpus — the 700 - year - old right to challenge your detention .
If you think that the Military Commissions Act struck at the heart of the Constitution , you ’d be understating things — it did a pretty good job on the Magna Carta while it was at it .
And if you think that this only threatens a few of us , you should understand that the writ of habeas corpus belongs to all of us — it allows anyone to challenge their detention .
Rolling back habeas rights endangers us all : Without a day in court , how can you prove that you ’re entitled to a trial ?
How can you prove that you are innocent ?
In fact , without a day in court , how can you let anyone know that you have been detained at all ?
Thankfully , the Supreme Court recently rebuked the President ’s lawlessness and ruled that detainees do indeed have the right to challenge their detention .
Mr. President , the Military Commissions
Act also gave President Bush the power some say he wanted most of all : the power to get information out of suspected terrorists — by virtually any means .
The power to use evidence gained from torture .
I do n’t think you can hold the rule of law in any greater contempt than sanctioning torture , Mr. President .
Because of decisions made at the highest levels of our government , America is making itself known to the world for torture , with stories like this one :
A prisoner at Guantanamo — to take one example out of hundreds — was deprived of sleep over fifty five days , a month and three weeks .
Some nights , he was doused with water or blasted with air conditioning .
And after week after week of this delirious , shivering wakefulness , on the verge of death from hypothermia , doctors strapped him to a chair — doctors , healers who took the Hippocratic Oath to “ do no harm ” — pumped him full of three bags of medical saline , brought him back from death — and sent him back to his interrogators .
To the generation coming of age around the world in this decade , that is America .
Not Normandy , not the Marshall Plan , not Nuremberg .
But Guantanamo .
Think about it .
We have legal analysts so vaguely defining torture , so willfully blurring the lines during interrogations that we have CIA counterterrorism lawyers saying things like , “ if the detainee dies , you ’re doing it wrong . ”
We have the CIA destroying tapes containing the evidence of harsh interrogations — about the Administration covering its tracks in a way more suited to a banana republic than to the home of freedom .
We have this Administration actually defending waterboarding , a technique invented by the Spanish Inquisition , perfected by the Khmer Rouge , and in between , banned — originally banned for excessive cruelty — by the Gestapo !
Still , some say , “ waterboarding ’s not torture . ”
Oh really ?
Listen to the words of Malcolm Nance , a 26 - year expert in intelligence and counter - terrorism , a combat veteran , and former Chief of Training at the US Navy Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape School .
While training American soldiers to resist interrogation , he writes ,
I have personally led , witnessed and supervised waterboarding of hundreds of people ….
Unless you have been strapped down to the board , have endured the agonizing feeling of the water overpowering your gag reflex , and then feel your throat open and allow pint after pint of water to involuntarily fill your lungs , you will not know the meaning of the word … .
It does not simulate drowning , as the lungs are actually filling with water .
The victim is drowning .
How much the victim is to drown depends on the desired result …and the obstinacy of the subject .
Waterboarding is slow motion suffocation … usually the person goes into hysterics on the board … .
When done right it is controlled death .
Controlled death , Mr. President .
And that is not torture ?
Not according to President Bush ’s White House .
They have said waterboarding is legal , and that , if it chooses , America will waterboard again .
Surely then , Mr. President , our new Attorney General would condemn torture .
Surely , the nation ’s highest law enforcement officer in the land , coming after Alberto Gonzales ’s chaotic tenure , would never come before Congress and defend the president ’s power to openly break the law .
Would he ?
He would , Mr. President .
When he came to the Senate before his confirmation , Michael Mukasey was asked a simple question , bluntly and plainly : “ Is waterboarding constitutional ? ”
He replied : “ If waterboarding is torture , torture is not constitutional . ”
One would hope for a little more insight from someone so famously well - versed in national security law .
But Mr. Mukasey pressed on with the obstinacy of a witness pleading the fifth : “ If it ’s torture … .
If it amounts to torture , it is not constitutional . ”
And that is the best this noted jurist , this legal scholar , this longtime judge , a supposed expert on national security law had to offer on the defining moral issue of this presidency .
Claims of ignorance .
Word games .
Now - Attorney General Mukasey was asked the easiest question we have in a democracy :
Can the president openly break the law ?
Can he — as we know he ’s done already — order warrantless wiretapping , ignore the will of Congress , and then hide behind nebulous powers he claims to find in the Constitution ?
His response :
The president has “ the authority to defend the country . ”
And in one swoop , the Attorney General conceded to the president nearly unlimited power , just as long as he finds a lawyer willing to stuff his actions into the boundless rubric of “ defending the country . ”
Unlimited power to defend the country , to protect us as one man sees fit , even if that means listening to our phone calls without a warrant , even if that means holding some of us indefinitely .
That is , Mr. President , contempt for the rule of law .
And so , this is very much about torture – about “ enhanced interrogation methods ” and waterboarding .
It is also about extraordinary rendition — outsourced torture of men this administration would prefer we did n’t know exist .
Oh , but we do know , Mr. President .
One was a Syrian immigrant raising his family in Canada as a citizen .
He wrote computer code for a company called MathWorks and was planning to start his own tech business .
On a trip through New York ’s JFK Airport , he was arrested by U.S. federal agents .
They shackled him and bundled him onto a private CIA plane , which flew him across the Atlantic Ocean to Syria .
This man spent the next 10 months and 10 days in a Syrian prison .
His cell was three feet wide — the size of a grave .
Some 300 days passed alone in that cell , with a bowl for his toilet and another bowl for his water , and the door only opened so he could go wash himself once a week — though it may have been more or less , because the cell was dark and he lost track of time .
The door only opened for one other reason : for interrogators who asked him , again and again , about al - Qaeda .
Here ’s how it was described :
The interrogator said , “ Do you know what this is ? ” I said , “ Yes , it ’s a cable , ” and he told me , “ Open your right hand . ”
I opened my right hand , and he hit me like crazy .
It was so painful , and of course I started crying , and then he told me to open my left hand , and I opened it , and he missed , then hit my wrist .
And then he asked me questions .
If he does not think you are telling the truth , then he hits again .
The jail and the torturers were Syrian , but America sent this man there with full knowledge of what would happen to him — because it was part of the longstanding secret program of “ extraordinary rendition . ”
America was convinced that he was a terrorist and wanted the truth beaten out of him .
No charges were ever filed against him .
His adopted nation ’s government — Canada , one of our strongest NATO allies — cleared him of all wrongdoing after a year - long official investigation , and awarded him more than $ 10 million in government compensation for his immense pain and suffering .
But not before he was tortured for 10 months in a cell the size of a grave .
Did his torture make us safer ?
Did his suffering improve our security ?
I would note Mr. President , that our own government has shamefully refused even to acknowledge that his case exists .
We know about a German citizen as well , living in the city of Ulm with his wife and four children .
On a bus trip through Eastern Europe , he was pulled off at a border crossing by armed guards and held for three weeks in a hotel room , where he was beaten regularly .
At the end of three weeks , he was drugged and shipped on a cargo plane to Kabul , Afghanistan .
For five months , he was held in the Salt Pit — a secret American prison staffed by Afghan guards .
All he had to drink was stagnant water from a filthy bottle .
Again and again , masked men interrogated him about al - Qaeda , and finally , he says , they raped him .
He was released in May of 2004 .
Scientific testing confirmed his story of malnourishment , and the Chancellor of Germany publicly acknowledged that he was wrongly held .
What was his crime ?
Having the same name as a suspected terrorist .
Again , our own government has shamefully refused to even acknowledge that his case exists .
And so , we do know , Mr. President .
We know because there are n’t enough words in the world to cover the facts .
If you ’d like to define torture out of existence , be my guest .
If you ’d rather use a Washington euphemism — “ tough questioning , ” “ enhanced interrogation ” — feel free .
Feel free to talk about “ fraternity hazing , ” like Rush Limbaugh did , or to use a favorite term of Vice President Cheney ’s , “ a dunk in the water . ”
You can call it whatever you ’d like .
But when you ’re through , the facts will still be waiting for you .
Controlled death .
Outsourced torture .
Secret prisons .
Month - long sleep deprivations .
The president ’s personal power to hold whomever he likes for as long as he ’d like .
It is as if we woke up in the middle of some Kafka - esque nightmare .
Have I gone wildly off - topic , Mr. President ?
Have I brought up a dozen unrelated issues ?
I wish I had , Mr. President .
I wish that none of these stories were true .
But , we are deceiving ourselves when we talk about the U.S. attorneys issue , the habeas issue , the torture issue , the rendition issue , or the secrecy issue as if each were an isolated case !
As if each one were an accident !
When we speak of them as isolated , we are keeping our politics cripplingly small ; and as long as we keep this small , the rule of men is winning .
There is only one issue here .
Only one : the law issue .
Does the president serve the law , or does the law serve the president ?
Each insult to our Constitution comes from the same source ; each springs from the same mindset ; and if we attack this contempt for the law at any point , we will wound it at all points .
That is why I ’m here today : Retroactive immunity is on the table today ; but also at issue is the entire ideology that justifies it , the same ideology that defends torture and executive lawlessness .
Immunity is a disgrace in itself , but it is far worse in what it represents .
It tells us that some believe in the courts only so long as their verdict goes their way .
That some only believe in the rule of law , so long as exceptions are made at their desire .
It puts secrecy above sunshine and fiat above law .
Did the telecoms break the law ?
That , I do n’t know .
But pass immunity … and we will never know .
A handful of favored corporations will remain unchallenged .
Their arguments will never be heard in a court of law .
The truth behind this unprecedented domestic spying will never see light .
And the cases will be closed forever .
“ Law ” is a word we barely hear from the supporters of immunity .
They offer neither a deliberation about America ’s difficult choices in the age of terrorism , nor a shared attempt to set for our times the excruciating balance between security and liberty .
They merely promise a false debate on a false choice : security or liberty , but never , ever both .
I think differently .
I think that America ’s founding truth is unambiguous : security and liberty , one and inseparable , and never one without the other -- no matter how difficult a situation , no matter what threats we face .
Secure in that truth , I offer a challenge to immunity ’s supporters :
You want to put a handful of corporations above the law .
Could you please explain how your immunity makes any one of us any safer at all ?
The truth is that a working balance between security and liberty has already been struck !
In fact , it has been settled for decades .
For thirty years , FISA has prevented executive lawbreaking and protected Americans , and that balance stands today .
In the wake of the Watergate scandal , the Senate convened the Church Committee , a panel of distinguished members determined to investigate executive abuses of power .
And unsurprisingly , they found that when Congress and the courts substitute “ trust me ” for real oversight , massive lawbreaking can result .
They found evidence of U.S. Army spying on the civilian population , federal dossiers on citizens ’ political activities , a CIA and FBI program that had opened hundreds of thousands of Americans ’ letters without warning or warrant .
In sum , Americans had sustained a severe blow to their Fourth Amendment rights “ to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures . ”
But at the same time , the senators of the Church Committee understood that surveillance needed to go forward to protect the American people .
Surveillance itself was not the problem ; unchecked , unregulated , unwarranted surveillance was .
What surveillance needed , in a word , was legitimacy .
And in America , as the Founders understood , power becomes legitimate when it is shared , when Congress and the courts check that attitude which so often crops up in the executive branch — “ if the president does it , it ’s not illegal . ”
The Church Committee ’s final report , “ Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans , ” put the case powerfully :
The critical question before the Committee was to determine how the fundamental liberties of the people can be maintained in the course of the Government ’s effort to protect their security .
The delicate balance between these basic goals of our system of government is often difficult to strike , but it can , and must , be achieved .
We reject the view that the traditional American principles of justice and fair play have no place in our struggle against the enemies of freedom .
Moreover , our investigation has established that the targets of intelligence activity have ranged far beyond persons who could properly be characterized as enemies of freedom … .
We have seen segments of our Government , in their attitudes and action , adopt tactics unworthy of a democracy , and occasionally reminiscent of the tactics of totalitarian regimes .
We have seen a consistent pattern in which programs initiated with limited goals , such as preventing criminal violence or identifying foreign spies , were expanded to what witnesses characterized as “ vacuum cleaners , ” sweeping in information about lawful activities of American citizens .
The senators concluded : “ Unless new and tighter controls are established by legislation , domestic intelligence activities threaten to undermine our democratic society and fundamentally alter its nature . ”
What a strange echo we hear in those words !
They could have been written yesterday .
Three decades ago , our predecessors in this chamber understood that when domestic spying goes too far , it threatens to kill just what it promises to protect — an America secure in its liberty .
That lesson was crystal - clear 30 years ago .
Why is it so clouded now ?
And before we entertain the argument that “ everything has changed ” since those words were written , remember :
The men who wrote them had witnessed world war and Cold War , had seen Nazi and Soviet spying , and were living every day under the cloud of nuclear holocaust .
I ’ll ask this , Mr. President :
Who will chair the commission investigating the secrets of warrantless spying , years from today ?
Will it be a young senator in this body today ?
Will it be someone not yet elected ?
What will that senator say when he or she comes to our actions , reads in the records how we let outrage after outrage after outrage slide , with nothing more than a promise to stop the next one ?
I imagine that senator will ask of us , “ Why did n’t they do anything ?
Why did n’t they fight back ?
In June 2008 , when no one could doubt anymore what the administration was doing — why did they sit on their hands ? ”
Since the time of the Church Commission , Mr. President , the threats facing us have multiplied and grown in complexity , but the lesson has been immutable :
Warrantless spying threatens to undermine our democratic society , unless legislation brings it under control .
In other words , the power to invade privacy must be used sparingly , guarded jealously , and shared equally between the branches of government .
Or the case can be made pragmatically .
As my friend Harold Koh , the Dean of Yale Law School , recently argued , “ The engagement of all three branches tends to yield not just more thoughtful law , but a more broadly supported public policy . ”
Three decades ago , Congress embodied that solution in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA .
FISA confirmed the president ’s power to conduct surveillance of international conversations involving anyone in the United States , provided that the federal FISA court issued a warrant — ensuring that wiretapping was aimed at safeguarding our security , and nothing else .
The president ’s own Director of National Intelligence , Mike McConnell , explained the rationale in an interview last summer : The United States “ did not want to allow [ the intelligence community ] to conduct … electronic surveillance of Americans for foreign intelligence unless you had a warrant , so that was required . ”
As originally written in 1978 , and as amended many times since , FISA has accomplished its mission ; it has been a valuable tool for conducting surveillance of terrorists and those who would harm America .
And every time presidents have come to Congress openly to ask for more leeway under FISA , Congress has worked with them ; Congress has negotiated ; and together , Congress and the president have struck a balance that safeguards America while doing its utmost to protect privacy .
Last summer , Congress made a technical correction to FISA , enabling the president to wiretap , without a warrant , conversations between two foreign targets , even if those conversations are routed through American computers .
For other reasons , I felt that this past summer ’s legislation went too far , and I opposed it .
But the point is that Congress once again proved its willingness to work with the president on FISA .
Is n’t that enough ?
Just this past October and November , the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees worked with the president to further refine FISA and ensure that , in a true emergency , the FISA court would do nothing to slow down intelligence gathering .
Is n’t that enough ?
And as for the FISA court ?
Between 1978 and 2004 , according to the Washington Post , the FISA court approved 18,748 warrants — and rejected five .
The FISA court has sided with the executive ninety nine point nine percent of the time .
Is n’t that enough ?
Is anything lacking ?
Have we forgotten something ?
Is n’t all of this enough to keep us safe ?
We all know the answer we received .
This complex , fine - tuned machinery , crafted over three decades by three branches of government , four presidents , and 12 Congresses was ignored .
It was a system primed to bless nearly any eavesdropping a president could conceive — and spying still happened illegally .
If the shock of that decision has yet to sink in , think of it this way : President Bush ignored not just a federal court , but a secret federal court ; not just a secret federal court , but a secret federal court prepared to sign off on his actions ninety nine point nine percent of the time .
A more compliant court has never been conceived .
And that still was n’t good enough .
So I will ask the Senate candidly , and candidly it already knows the answer :
Is this about security — or is it about power ?
Why are some fighting so hard for retroactive immunity ?
The answer , I believe , is that immunity means secrecy , and secrecy means power .
It ’s no coincidence that the man who proclaimed “ if the president does it , it ’s not illegal ” — Richard Nixon — was the same man who raised executive secrecy to an art form .
The senators of the Church Committee expressed succinctly the deep flaw in the Nixonian executive : “ Abuse thrives on secrecy . ”
And , in the exhaustive catalogue of their report , they proved it .
In this push for immunity , secrecy is at the center .
We find proof in immunity ’s original version : a proposal to protect not just the telecoms , but everyone involved in the wiretapping program .
In their original proposal , that is , they wanted to immunize themselves .
Think about that .
It speaks to their fear and , perhaps , their guilt : their guilt that they had broken the law , and their fear that in the years to come , they would be found liable or convicted .
They knew better than anyone else what they had done — they must have had good reason to be afraid .
Thankfully , immunity for the executive is not part of the bill before us .
But the original proposal tells us something very important :
This is , and always has been , a self - preservation bill .
Otherwise , why not have the trial and get it over with ?
If the proponents of retroactive immunity are right , the corporations would win in a walk .
After all , in the official telling , the telecoms were ordered to help the president spy without a warrant , and they patriotically complied .
We ’ve even heard on this floor the comparison between the telecom corporations to the men and women laying their lives on the line in Iraq .
But ignore that comparison – which , frankly , I find deeply offensive .
Ignore for a moment the fact that in America we obey the laws , not the president ’s orders .
Ignore that not even the president has the right to scare or bully you into breaking the law , though it seems that tactic has proven surprisingly fruitful .
Ignore that the telecoms were not unanimous ; one , Qwest , wanted to see the legal basis for the order , never received it , and so refused to comply .
Ignore that a judge presiding over the case ruled that “ AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal . ”
Ignore all that :
If the order the telecoms received was legally binding , they have an easy case to prove .
The corporations only need to show a judge the authority and the assurances they were given , and they ’ll be in and out of court in five minutes .
If the telecoms are as defensible as the president says , why does n’t the president let them defend themselves ?
If the case is so easy to make , why does n’t he let them make it ?
It ca n’t be that he ’s afraid of leaks .
Our federal court system has dealt for decades with the most delicate national security matters , building up expertise in protecting classified information behind closed doors — ex parte , in camera .
We can expect no less in these cases .
No intelligence sources need be compromised .
No state secrets need be exposed .
After litigation at both the district court and circuit court level , no state secrets have been exposed .
In fact , Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker , a Republican appointee , has already ruled that the issue can go to trial without putting state secrets in jeopardy .
He reasonably pointed out that the existence of the terrorist surveillance program is a hardly secret at all : “ The government has [ already ] disclosed the general contours of the ‘ terrorist surveillance program , ’ which requires the assistance of a telecommunications provider . ”
As the state secrets privilege is invoked to stall these high - profile cases , it ’s useful to consider that privilege ’s history .
In fact , it was tainted at its birth by a president of my own party , Harry Truman .
In 1952 , he successfully invoked the new privilege to prevent public exposure of a report on a plane crash that killed three Air Force contractors .
When the report was finally declassified — some fifty years later , decades after anyone in the Truman administration was within its reach — it contained no state secrets at all .
Only facts about repeated maintenance failures that would have seriously embarrassed some important people .
And so the state secrets privilege began its career not to protect our nation — but to protect the powerful .
In his opinion , Judge Walker argued that , even when it is reasonably grounded ,
the state secrets privilege [ still ] has its limits .
While the court recognizes and respects the executive ’s constitutional duty to protect the nation from threats , the court also takes seriously its constitutional duty to adjudicate the disputes that come before it .
To defer to a blanket assertion of secrecy here would be to abdicate that duty , particularly because the very subject matter of this litigation has been so publicly aired .
The compromise between liberty and security remains a difficult one .
But dismissing this case at the outset would sacrifice liberty for no apparent enhancement of security .
And that ought to be the epitaph of this Administration : “ sacrificing liberty for no apparent enhancement of security . ”
Worse than selling our soul — giving it away for free !
It is equally wrong to claim that failing to grant this retroactive immunity will make the telecoms less likely to cooperate with surveillance in the future .
The truth is that , since the 1970s , FISA has compelled telecommunications companies to cooperate with surveillance , when it ’s warranted — and what ’s more , it immunizes them .
It ’s done that for more than 25 years .
So cooperation in warranted wiretapping is not at stake today , and despite claims by supporters of immunity -- never has been .
Collusion in warrantless illegal wiretapping is .
And the warrant makes all the difference , because it is precisely the court ’s blessing that brings presidential power under the rule of law .
In sum , we know that giving the telecoms their day in court — giving the American people their day in court — would not jeopardize an ounce of our security .
And it could only expose one secret : the extent to which the rule of law has been trampled .
And that is the choice at stake today :
Will the secrets of the last years remain closed in the dark ?
Or will they be open to the generations to come , to our successors in this chamber , so that they can prepare themselves to defend against future outrages of power and usurpations of law from future presidents , of either party ?
Thirty years after the Church Committee , history repeated itself .
If those who come after us are to prevent it from repeating again , they need the full truth .
And that is why we must not see these secrets go quietly into the night .
I am here because the truth is no one ’s private property — it belongs to every one of us , and it demands to be heard .
“ State secrets , ” “ patriotic duty ” — those , as weak as they are , are the arguments the telecoms ’ advocates use when they ’re feeling high - minded !
When their thoughts turn baser , they make their arguments as amateur economists .
Here ’s how Mike McConnell put it : “ If you play out the suits at the value they ’re claimed , it would bankrupt these companies .
So…we have to provide liability protection to these private sector entities . ”
To begin with , that ’s a clear exaggeration .
We are talking about some of the wealthiest , most successful companies in America .
Some of them have continued to earn record profits and sign up record numbers of subscribers at the same time as this very public litigation — totally undermining the argument that these lawsuits are doing the telecoms severe “ reputational damage . ”
Companies of that size could n’t be completely wiped out by anything but the most exorbitant and unlikely judgment .
To assume that the telecoms would lose , and that their judges would then hand down such backbreaking penalties , is already to take several leaps .
Opponents of immunity , including myself , have stated that we would support a reasonable alternative to blanket retroactive immunity .
No one seriously wants to financially cripple our telecommunications industry .
The point is to bring checks and balances back to domestic spying .
Setting that precedent would hardly require a crippling judgment .
It ’s much more troubling , though , that our Director of National Intelligence even bothers to speak to “ liability protection for private sector entities . ”
This is n’t the Secretary of Commerce we ’re talking about , but the head of our nation ’s intelligence efforts .
For that matter , how does that even begin to be relevant to letting this case go forward ?
Since when did we throw entire suits out because the defendant stood to lose too much ?
It astounds me that some can speak in the same breath about national security and bottom lines .
Approve immunity , and Congress will state clearly :
The richer you are , the more successful you are , the more lawless you are entitled to be .
A suit against you is a danger to the Republic !
And so , at the rock - bottom of its justifications , the telecoms ’ advocates are essentially arguing that immunity can be bought .
The truth is exactly the opposite — and it should be obvious :
The larger the corporation , the greater the potential for abuse .
No one suggests that success should make a company suspect ; companies grow large , and essential to our economy , because they are excellent at what they do .
But the size and wealth open the realm of possibilities for abuse far beyond the scope of the individual .
After all , if the allegations are true , we are talking about one of the most massive violations of privacy in American history .
Should there not be some retribution or penalty ?
If reasonable search and seizure means opening a drug dealer ’s apartment , the telecoms ’ alleged actions would be the equivalent of strip - searching everyone in the building , ransacking their bedrooms , and prying up all the floorboards .
The scale of these corporations opens unprecedented possibilites for abuse — possibilities far beyond the power of the individual .
What the telecoms have been accused of could not be done by one man or even ten .
It would be inconceivable without the size and resources of a corporate behemoth — the same size that makes Mike McConnell fear the corporations ’ day in court .
That ’s the massive scale we ’re talking about — and that massive scale is precisely why no corporation must be above the law .
On that scale , it is impossible to plead ignorance .
As Judge Walker ruled , “ AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal . ”
But the arguments of the president ’s allies sink even lower .
Listen to the words a House Republican leader spoke on Fox News .
They are shameful : “ I believe that they deserve immunity from lawsuits out there from typical trial lawyers trying to find a way to get into the pockets of American companies . ”
Of course , some of the “ typical greedy trial lawyers ” bringing these suits actually work for a nonprofit .
And the telecoms that some want to portray as pitiable little Davids actually employ hundreds of attorneys , retain the best corporate law firms , and spend multimillion - dollar legal budgets every year .
But if the facts actually mattered to immunity supporters , we would n’t be here .
For some , the pre-written narrative takes precedence far above the mere facts ; and here , it is the perennial narrative of the greedy trial lawyers .
With that , some can rest content .
They can conclude that we were n’t ever serious about law , or about privacy , or about checks and balances — it was about money all along .
There can no longer be any doubt :
One by one , the arguments of the immunity supporters , of the telecoms ’ advocates , fail .
I ’d like to spend a few moments reviewing , in detail , those claims and their failures .
[ Slide 1 ]
One : Immunity supporters argue that granting immunity is a presidential prerogative .
But the fact is that this case belongs in the courts , in cases where the outcome has not been predetermined .
The judiciary should be allowed to determine whether the president has exceeded his powers by obtaining from the telecoms wholesale access to the domestic communications of millions of ordinary Americans .
The courts should not simply be in the business of certifying that the companies received some form of documentation .
Rather they should be allowed to evaluate the validity of the legal arguments asserted in the document .
Was the request legal or not ?
Remember also that the administration ’s original immunity proposal protected everyone involved in the wiretapping program — not just the telecoms .
In their original proposal , that is , they wanted to immunize themselves .
Thankfully , executive immunity is not part of the bill before us .
But the origin of immunity tells us a great deal about what ’s at stake here : self - preservation .
[ Slide 2 ]
Two : Immunity supporters claim that only foreign communications were targeted — not Americans ’ domestic calls .
But the fact is that clear , first - hand evidence , authenticated by the corporations in court , contradicts that claim .
“ Splitters ” at AT&T ’s Internet hub in San Francisco diverted into a secret room controlled by the NSA every e-mail , text message , and phone call — foreign or domestic — carried over the massive fiber - optic links of sixteen separate companies .
[ Slide 3 ]
Three : Immunity supporters claim that a lack of immunity will make the telecoms less likely to cooperate with surveillance in the future .
But remember : Since the 1970s , FISA has compelled telecoms to cooperate with warranted surveillance , and it has immunized them .
The issue today is not wiretapping — it is warrantless wiretapping .
And the warrant is essential , because that is what brings the president ’s power under the rule of law .
[ Slide 4 ]
Four : Immunity supporters argue that the telecoms can’t defend themselves without exposing state secrets .
But the fact is that Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker has already ruled that the issue can go to trial without putting state secrets in jeopardy .
He pointed out that the existence of the warrantless surveillance program is a hardly secret at all : “ The government has [ already ] disclosed the general contours of the ‘ terrorist surveillance program , ’ which requires the assistance of a telecommunications provider . ”
[ Slide 5 ]
Five : Immunity supporters claim that the telecoms are already protected by common law principles .
But the fact is that common law immunities do not trump specific legal duties imposed by statute , such as the specific duties Congress has long imposed on telecoms to protect customer privacy and records .
In the pending case against AT&T , the judge already has ruled unequivocally that “ AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal . ”
Even so , the communications company defendants can and should have the opportunity to present these defenses to the courts , and the courts — not Congress preemptively — should decide whether they are sufficient .
[ Slide 6 ]
Six : Immunity supporters claim that leaks from the trial might damage national security .
But the fact is that our federal court system , in decades of dealing with delicate national security matters , has built up the expertise it takes to secure that information , behind closed doors .
If we ’re still concerned about national security being threatened as a result of these cases , we can simply get the principals a security clearance .
We can be increasingly confident that these cases will not expose state secrets or intelligence sources — because , after the extensive litigation that has already taken place at both the district court and circuit court level , no sensitive information has leaked out .
[ Slide 7 ]
Seven : Immunity supporters claim that litigation will harm the telecoms by causing them “ reputational damage . ”
But the fact is that there is no evidence that this litigation has reduced or will reduce the defendant companies ’ bottom lines or customer base .
These companies ’ reputations can only be harmed if they have done something wrong .
If they have not , they have nothing to worry about .
[ Slide 8 ]
Eight : Finally , immunity supporters claim that these lawsuits could bankrupt the telecoms .
But as we ’ve seen , such huge corporations could only be wiped out by the most enormous penalties — and also the most unlikely .
It takes several leaps to assume that the telecoms will lose , and then that they ’ll be slapped with such huge judgments .
But on another level , immunity supporters are staking their claim on a dangerous principle — that a suit can be stopped solely on the basis of how much a defendant stands to lose .
If we accept that premise , we could conceive of a corporation so wealthy , so integral to our economy , that its riches place it outside the law altogether .
And that is a deeply flawed argument .
We see , then , that none of the arguments for immunity stand .
There is absolutely no reason to halt the legal process , and bar the courthouse door .
And ultimately , Mr. President , that ’s all I ’m asking for : a fair fight .
In any other administration , it would be a humble claim : a day in court , for the companies that have been accused , and for the American citizens who have accused them .
To reject immunity would mean to grab hold of the closest thread of lawlessness we have at hand , and to pull until the whole garment unravels .
But ensuring a day in court is not the same as ensuring a verdict .
When that day comes , I have absolutely no investment in the verdict , either way .
It may be that the federal government broke the law in asking the telecoms to spy , but that the telecoms ’ response was innocent .
It may be that the government was within the law , and that the telecoms broke it .
Maybe both broke the law .
Maybe neither did .
But just as it would be absurd for me to declare the telecoms clearly guilty , it is equally absurd to close the case in Congress , without a decision .
That is what immunity does .
Throughout this debate , the telecoms ’ advocates have needed to show not just that they ’re right — but that they ’re so right , and that we ’re so far beyond the pale — that we can shut down the argument right here , today .
That is a burden they have clearly not met .
And they cannot expect to meet it when a large majority of the senators who will make the decision have not even seen the secret documents that are supposed to prove the case for retroactive immunity .
Mr. President , my trust is in the courts , in the cases argued openly , in the judges who preside over them , and in the juries of American citizens who decide them .
They should be our pride , not our embarrassment .
They deserve to do their jobs .
As complex , as diverse , as relentless as the assault on the rule of law has been , our answer to it is a simple one .
Far more than any president ’s lawlessness , the American way of justice remains deeply rooted in our character .
That , no president can disturb .
So I am full of hope , even on this dark day .
I have faith that we can unite security and justice — because we have already done it .
My father , Senator Tom Dodd , was the number two American prosecutor at the famous Nuremberg trials .
And I have never , never forgotten the example he set .
As Justice Robert Jackson said in his opening statement at Nuremberg : “ That four great nations , flushed with victory and stung with injury , stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that Power has ever paid to Reason . ”
Mr. President , what is the tribute that Power owes to Reason ?
That America stands for a transcendent idea .
The idea that laws should rule , not men .
The idea that the Constitution does not get suspended for vengeance .
The idea that this nation should never tailor its eternal principles to the conflict of the moment , because if we did , we would be walking in the footsteps of the enemies we despised .
The tribute that Power owes to Reason is due today .
I know that we can find the strength to pay it .
And if we can ’t ?
We will all have to answer for it .
There ’s a famous military recruiting poster that comes to mind .
A man is sitting in an easy chair with his son and daughter on his lap , in some future after the war has ended .
His daughter is asking him , “ Daddy , what did you do in the war ? ”
And his face is shocked and shamed , because he knows he did nothing .
My daughters , Grace and Christina , are six and three .
They are growing up in a time of two great conflicts : one between our nation and its enemies , and another , between what is best and worst in our American soul .
And someday soon , I know I am going to hear that question : “ What did you do ? ” I want , more than anything else , to give the right answer .
That question is coming for every single one of us in this body .
Every single one of us will be judged by a jury from whom there ’s no hiding : our sons , our daughters , our grandchildren .
Someday soon , they ’ll read in their textbooks the story of a great nation , one that threw down tyrants and oppressors for two centuries ; one that rid the world of Nazism and Soviet communism ; one that proved that great strength can serve great virtue , that right can truly make might .
And then they will read how , in the early years of the 21st century , that nation lost its way .
We do not have the power to strike that chapter .
No , Mr. President — we ca n’t go back .
We ca n’t un -destroy the CIA ’s interrogation tapes .
We ca n’t un-pass the Military Commissions Act .
We ca n’t un-speak Alberto Gonzales ’s disgraceful testimony .
We ca n’t un -torture innocent people .
And perhaps , sadly , shamefully , we cannot stop retroactive immunity .
We ca n’t un - do anything that has been done in the last six years for the cause of lawlessness and fear .
We can not blot out that chapter .
But we can begin the next one , even today .
Let its first words read : “ Finally , in June 2008 , the Senate said : ‘ Enough . ’ ”
I implore my colleagues to write it with me .
I implore my colleagues to vote against retroactive immunity and vote against cloture tomorrow morning .

The Question Is Simple , " Why Marry ? " Gather Ye Flowers Don't Buy The Garden
Toogood reports ^ | July 1 , 2002 | Fred Reed
Posted on by Stand Watch Listen
W ere a young man to ask me , " To marry perchance , or remain forever single ? "
I would , given the hostile circumstances today of law and love , urge caution .
" Marriage is a commitment of several years of your life , plus child support , " I would say .
" Do not make it rashly . "
The question is simply , " Why marry ? "
As a young man full of dangerous steroids , your answer will probably be , " Ah , because her hair is like corn silk under an August moon ; her lips are as rubies and her teeth , pearls ; and her smile would make a dead man cry . "
This amounts to , " I 'm horny , " with elaborations .
It is as it ought to be .
The race continues because maidens are glorious , and striplings both desperate and unwise .
Note , incidentally , that by the time October rolls around , corn silk is shriveled and brown .
Why marry , indeed ?
In times past , marriage occasionally made sense .
Life on a farm required two people , a woman to work herself ragged in the cabin while the man carried heavy lumpish things and shot Indians .
Later , come suburbia , the man did something tedious in an office and the woman did two hours housework and stayed bored for six .
It worked , tolerably .
In the Fifties , nobody expected much of life .
It generally met their expectations .
And there was sex , though not enough of it  the scarcity being the propellant behind matrimony .
Back then , before the miracle of feminism , women had not yet commoditized themselves .
A lad had to pop the question before he got laid regular .
Women controlled the carnal economy and , in a world that was going to be boring anyway , that was probably a good thing .
At least kids had parents .
Times change .
Some advice to young fellows setting forth : First , forget that her lips are sweet as honeydew melon ( though not , of course , green ) .
It does n't last .
One of nature 's more disagreeable tricks is that while men are far uglier than women , they age better .
Remember this .
It is useful to reflect in moments of unguided passion that , beneath the skin , we are all wet bags of unpleasant organs .
Soon you will be a balding sofa ornament and she will look like a fireplug with cellulite .
Once the packaging deteriorates , there had better be something to get you through the next thirty years .
Usually there is n't .
Prospects have improved for the single of both genders .
Sex is nowadays always available .
If you do n't marry Moon Pie , which would be wise , you may get another chance when she comes back on the market with the first wave of divorcees .
It 's never now - or - never .
Getting older does n't diminish your opportunities .
As you gain experience , you will recognize the tides , the eddies , the whirlpools of coupling  the urgency of the biological clock , the lunacy of menopause .
Men by comparison embody a wonderful clod - like simplicity .
As you ponder snuggling forever with Moon Pie , compare the lives of your bachelor and your married friends .
The bachelors come and go as the mood strikes them , order their apartments with squalid abandon , drive Miatas or Harleys if they choose , and live in such pleasant dissolution as is consonant with continued employment .
The married guy lives in a vast echoing mortgage beyond his means , drives sensible cars he does n't like , and loses his old friends because he is n't allowed to hang out with them .
Self - help books to the contrary , marriage does not rest on compromises , but on concessions .
You will make all of them .
Perhaps it does n't have to be this way .
But it is this way .
Moon
Pie has only one reason for marriage : to get her legal hooks into you .
She does n't think of it in these terms , yet , and she has no evil intentions .
She just wants a nice quiet home in the remote suburbs where she can live uneventfully , raise progeny , and keep her eye on you .
If you think surveillance is n't part of the contract , try going out late with your old buddies .
Marriage is an institution founded on mistrust .
If she thought you would stick around if not compelled , she would n't need marriage .
She wants monogamy , at least for you and , with some frequency , for herself .
She knows viscerally that you would prefer the amorous insouciance of an oversexed alley cat .
You know it consciously .
Marriage exists to control the male , until recently a good idea .
Now , however , she can support herself , and does n't need protection .
She does n't need you , or you , her .
She will , however , want to have children .
Women do .
At which point , G -d help you .
Given the schools , drugs , latch - keyism consequent first to working parents and then to divorce , and the cultural pressure on children to be slatterns and dope - dealers , reproduction is a gamble .
You may not even particularly like them , or they , you .
Nobody talks about this , but how many people do you know who hardly talk to their grown children ?
And you 've just tied yourself into twenty years of raising them .
The moment Junior enters wherever it is that we are , Moon Pie will have you screwed to the wall .
She wo n't think of it this way , yet .
She 'll be delighted with the cooing bundle of joy , his little fingers , his little toes , etc .
But divorce usually comes .
The chances are two to one that she will file : Women are more eager than men to enter marriage , and more eager to leave it  with the kids , the house , and the child support .
It wo n't be amicable , not after seven years .
You will be astonished at how ruthless she will be , how well she knows the law , and how utterly hostile to divorcing fathers the law is .
You do n't understand how bad the divorce courts are .
You probably do n't know what " imputed income " is .
You think that " joint custody " means " joint custody . "
Think again .
Quite possibly you will have to support her while she moves with your kids to Fukuoka with an Air Force colonel she met in a meat bar .
In short , marriage often means turning twenty - five years of your life into smoking wreckage .
Yes , happy marriages exist ( I personally know of one ) and there are the somnolent marriages of habitual contentment or , perhaps , of quiet resignation .
But the odds are n't good .
Permit me an heretical thought .
In an age when neither sex economically needs the other , in which women do not need protection from wild bears and marauding savages , not in the suburbs anyway , perhaps marriage does n't make sense , at least for men .
The divorce courts remove all doubt .
A young fellow might do well to stay single , keep his DNA to himself , pick such flowers as he might find along the way , and live his life as he likes .

I have to wonder what life gave Fred Reed in the package called marriage ?
Sounds like he got royally screwed and wants to believe everyone is going to receive the same raw deal .

AGYG <---- shaking head .... it does n't look good for our society when we leave young men with such advice .....
It is a sad outlook on life , but I resectfully submit that it is also the reality of today .
Sure , it 's a crummy way to view things .
But this view would n't be so prevelant if the laws and society did n't encourage the destruction of the family and the demonization of men simply because they have a " Y " chromasome and money that they can be fleeced out of .
It is a fact that more than half of all marriages today end in divorce .
It 's a fact that more than 2/3 of the time , women are the ones filing .
It 's a fact that if they have children , she will get custody of his children , be forced from his home , lose most of what he has worked for and a large portion of what he will earn for many years .
Perhaps you have been fortunate enough to not see this happen to many people around you .
I know many people who have been happily married for 20 , 30 , 40 , even 50 years .
Those people come from a time where divorce was nearly unthinkable , where when you had problems in the marriage , you worked them out .
Unfortunately , the generations that proceeded them live in a much different world .
It 's a world where a the laws and courts have been stacked in such a way that there is a financial incentive for one person , usually the woman , to have the other person in the marriage , usually the man , forcefully removed from his family .
I can't tell you haw many times I have seen this happen because I 've litterally lost count .
These men may pass on advice like the author of the article does to his friends and possibly even his sons not out of spite or malace .
When he sees how efficiently his life has been dismantled and how he HAD to take it , most men pass on this advice because they do n't want to see others , especially his children , put through the wringer for the financial gain of a multi-billion dollar industry that profits from destroying lives .

There is too much profit in divorce .
Changes that need to be made :
1. Visitation must be fanatically enforced the same way
failure to pay dollars is made .
2 . The defacto trade in value of the divoce must somehow be addressed .
If you divorce it is not the responsibility of the other party to ensure your standard of living .
( consequence of feminist attitutes , View the divorce as a financial bankruptcy of the relationship . )
3. Community property must be eliminated .
4. Infidelity must be a consideration of divorce proceedings .
Do not eliminate no fault , just consider the infidelity and its cause in that particular relationship .
I remember reading a case where witholding martital relations was intentional cruelty .
( she was pushing for him to have an affair to better her position ) Choices by both parties should have consequences .
5. Restrict judges and custodial spouses ablity to limit contact children have with the non custodial parent .
In other words require written consent and a written plan of how visitation will be conducted if the move is approved .
6 . The BIGGIE reward marriage .
Eliminate absurd tax penalty for marriage .
Reward married people with and without children .
Reward marriage for milestones , ie , every 5 or 10 years means some form of lower tax benefit .
Institute a surtax on single mothers who avail themselves of a spermbank .

I take a different view .
But then , I also believe in God , homeschooling , abstaining from sex before marriage , family , and a lifetime commitment .
And I know there are at least a few others out there who do as well .

4. Infidelity must be a consideration of divorce proceedings .
Do not eliminate no fault , just consider the infidelity and its cause in that particular relationship .
I remember reading a case where witholding martital relations was intentional cruelty .
( she was pushing for him to have an affair to better her position ) Choices by both parties should have consequences .
WRONG !
No fault divorce is the root of most of these evils .
Marriage is meant to be forever .
As such divorce should only be granted when adultery can be proven or when physical abuse can be proven to a jury .
The member guilty of abuse or adultery loses everything .
The children , home , assets and support go to the true spouse .
If we raise the penalty for abuse or adultery to a exceedingly painful level , then people will work to maintain their marriages rather than deserting them .
Right now marriage is a racket for the enrichment of evil women and divorce lawyers .
This insanity must end .
I do agree that marriage should be greatly encouraged but divorce must be just as greatly discouraged .
God Save America ( Please )

Hello all ,
Some of you may have been wondering about the future of PunBB and the current development team following Rickard 's announcement that he will not be actively involved with PunBB , at least for the time being .
To cut to the chase , Neal ( Smartys ) , Paul , Kristoffer ( Jansson ) and I have , with regret , decided that we are unable to continue our involvement with the development of PunBB .
We all became involved with PunBB largely because we shared Rickard 's vision of the project .
We were all happy to defer to his views on the future development of PunBB , especially since the project was his " baby , " so to speak .
Now that circumstances have changed with the inevitable shift of power within the project , we all feel that we need a degree of control over future development which is no longer possible .
We all share a desire to develop software for the benefit of the community and ourselves , without commercial concerns influencing the final product .
This is not a condemnation of PunBB 's current owners : we simply feel that this change is necessary so that we as developers can maintain full control over the development process .
Despite this change , we are not abandoning the PunBB community .
As we promised in the past , we have started our own fork of PunBB called FluxBB .
We are continuing to develop the 1.3 branch of PunBB ( re- branded as FluxBB ) and have released a new beta version of it along with some extensions .
We will also support and continue to provide security updates for the 1.2 branch of PunBB .
As a part of that promise , we have released FluxBB 1.2.18 , a stability update for 1.2 which fixes several known issues with 1.2.17 .
We hope that everyone can check out our site and that those who wish to do so will register and become a part of our new community .
Lalit 's technical blog ; thoughts and ideas on the structure and flow of computer programs , and related matters .
Oral ingestion of pomegranate extract reduces the production of chemicals that cause inflammation suggests a new study .
The findings indicate that pomegranate extract may provide humans with relief of chronic inflammatory conditions .
The group from the Department of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland Ohio , led by Tariq Haqqi , showed that blood samples collected from rabbits fed pomegranate extract inhibited inflammation .
Pomegranate extract is already used as a treatment in alternative medicine for inflammatory conditions , such as arthritis .
Although pomegranate extract has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions in experiments on isolated tissues , it is not known whether ingestion of it can produce the same anti-inflammatory effects in living systems , either because the active compounds are not absorbed from the gut or because the levels of these compounds in the blood are not high enough .
Pomegranate extract , the equivalent of 175mls of pomegranate juice , was given to rabbits orally .
The levels of antioxidants were measured in blood samples obtained after drinking the pomegranate extract and compared to blood samples collected before ingestion of pomegranate extract .
Plasma collected from rabbits following ingestion of pomegranate extract contained significantly higher levels of antioxidants than samples collected before ingestion of pomegranate extract ; the extract also significantly reduced the activity of proteins that cause inflammation , specifically cyclooxygenase - 2 .
It also reduced the production of pro-inflammatory compounds produced by cells isolated from cartilage .
The results of this study indicate the beneficial effects of pomegranate extract when ingested .
According to Haqqi " the use of dietary nutrients or drugs based on them as an adjunct in the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions may benefit patients " .
He adds that , " Current treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs can have serious side effects following long - term use .
Further research is needed , however , especially on the absorption of orally ingested substances into the blood . "
As we noted yesterday , one of the fondest dreams of the recording industry is to get Internet service providers to help them police the content flowing across their networks .
Now , British ISP Virgin Media has taken a halting step in that general direction by agreeing to work with the BPI , the UK equivalent of the RIAA which represents the interests of the recording industry in that country .
The agreement will have Virgin sending out warning letters to those who the BPI has identified as sharing copyrighted material .
Early reports of the negotiations between Virgin Media and the BPI had suggested that the ISP was considering adopting a draconian " three strikes and you 're out " policy , in which it would disconnect repeat offenders .
That approach , however , has since found limited support in the European Parliament , although the UK Parliament is apparently considering legislation that would compel its implementation .
For now , however , the two organizations will apparently settle for sending potential infringers nastygrams .
The Register claims to have obtained samples of the letters that will be sent by Virgin and the BPI ( both PDFs ) , and the possibility of disconnects is only mentioned obliquely ; the BPI letter simply indicates , " We do n’t want you to face legal action or risk losing your internet service . "
Most of the threats focus on legal action , but the majority of the text of both letters is appropriate for an educational campaign .
The BPI 's chief executive stated , " Education is absolutely key to reducing the extent of illegal downloading , and we are pleased to be working with Virgin Media on this campaign " in announcing the program .
The letters point out the differences between legal music purchases and copyright violations through file - sharing .
They also assume that users may not be aware that file - sharing is happening down their connection , suggesting that files may be shared through malware or by someone hopping on to an unsecured wireless router .
Both organizations offer the recipients access to antivirus and the other security software they host .
Given the relatively mild nature of the letters , the implications of the program are probably more important than the actions it entails .
The program suggests that at least some ISPs are beginning to take action on file - sharing that 's not directly related to the network congestion it involves .
Perhaps more importantly , it may lay the groundwork for the record industry to claim that education alone is n't sufficient should the program have a negligible impact on file - sharing at Virgin .
That could provide them exactly what they need to push through the harsher legislation being considered .
Of course , the entire program relies on the recording industry 's ability to accurately identify file - sharers .
No word yet on how the letters will be delivered to misidentified printers .
The show attracted 8,000 fans to the Royal Albert Hall
Thousands of Doctor
Who fans have seen a specially - filmed scene starring David Tennant at a BBC Proms concert dedicated to the sci - fi drama .
The concert featured music from the series , as well as classical favourites from composers including Holst and Wagner on the theme of space and time .
The panto - style scene , showing Tennant addressing the 6,000 - strong audience , was also shown on the show 's website .
Actress Freema Agyeman hosted Sunday 's event at London 's Royal Albert Hall .
She played Martha - the last - but - one assistant to Tennant 's Doctor .
' Brilliant time '
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We 've had a brilliant time , " Davies told BBC News .
" If you were in the Royal Albert Hall , you would have had a unique Doctor Who experience , " he said of the special scene 's airing .
" It 's fantastic because people queued in the heat and came a long way - I met someone who came here from Belgium . "
Davies paid tribute to the man who will succeed him at the helm of Doctor Who , Steven Moffat , calling him " a genius " .
" People do n't care about me , I 'll just be a bit of history and the show will continue like it has done for 45 years , " he added .
This was the first appearance of Doctor Who at the BBC Proms , although a concert dedicated to the series was held at Cardiff 's Millennium Centre in 2006 to raise money for Children In Need .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed the US - Czech deal in Prague Russia has said it will be forced to react with military means if the US and Czech Republic go ahead with plans for a missile shield .
The statement came hours after the US signed an initial deal to base part of Washington 's controversial missile defence system in the Czech Republic .
Moscow says siting the system near its borders could weaken its own defences .
It has previously threatened to aim its own missiles at any eventual base in Poland or the Czech Republic .
The deal , signed by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in Prague on Tuesday , allows a tracking radar base to be set up on Czech territory .
The Pentagon says the shield is designed to counter a threat from the Middle East , not Russia .
' Not our choice '
The Russian foreign ministry statement said : " If a US strategic anti-missile shield starts to be deployed near our borders , we will be forced to react not in a diplomatic fashion but with military - technical means . "
The plans are unpopular with many people in the Czech Republic
It said there was " no doubt that the grouping of elements of the strategic US arsenal faced towards Russian territory " would mean Moscow had to " take adequate measures to compensate for the threats to its national security " .
" This is not our choice , " it added .
The foreign ministry said it would continue to monitor developments but would remain open to constructive talks on issues of strategic stability .
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington cites Russia 's ambassador to the UN as suggesting that the phrase " military - technical means " does not mean military action , but more likely a change in Russia 's strategic posture , perhaps by redeploying its own missiles .
More likely still , our correspondent says , is that the Russians are trying to frighten the Czech parliament into backing out of the whole deal .
The next question , he says , is whether Poland will accept missile defence facilities as well , and how the Russians will respond to that .
' Growing threat '
The plans remain unpopular in the Czech Republic , while the US has failed to reach agreement with Poland on placing other parts of the system there .
The plans involve siting the tracking radar system in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in Poland .
The US wants the sites to be in operation by about 2012 .
Czech opposition parties have strongly criticised the plans and are calling for a national referendum .
The plans will have to be approved by the Czech parliament , where the government would need the votes of the opposition parties to get them through .
Speaking after signing , Ms Rice said that the US and its allies faced " a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper " from Iran .
The Russian news agency Interfax earlier quoted a senior Russian official as saying the deal " complicates " global security .
In talks on Monday , US President George W Bush , attending his last G8 summit , and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , attending his first , made little progress on the issue of the US missile defence system .

Former White House Press Secretary Succumbs To Cancer Posted by Pile ( 11395 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Beating Dead Horses ]
[ Liars ]
I got good news and bad news .
The good news is Tony Snow wo n't be spreading any more lies and misinformation as has been his career for the last decade .
The bad news is it 's not because he 's found some integrity .
It 's because he 's dead .
The NYT says , " Tony Snow , a conservative writer and commentator who cheerfully sparred with reporters in the White House briefing room during a stint as President Bush 's press secretary , died Saturday of colon cancer .
He was 53 . "
I remember when he first took the job he claimed that his credibility should n't be questioned because he took a pay cut to be White House Press Secretary .
Then when he left office , he cited as the reason for leaving , he was n't making enough money to be able to afford the lifestyle to which he was accustomed .
'' America has lost a devoted public servant and a man of character , '' President Bush said in a statement from Camp David , where he was spending the weekend .
'' It was a joy to watch Tony at the podium each day .
He brought wit , grace , and a great love of country to his work . ''
Let be real here ... this idea that " now someone is dead , let 's show a little respect " is BS .
" What difference does it make ?
Why malign the man now that he 's dead ?
He does n't care . "
True , but this is about whether or not the next five Tony Snows waiting in the wings to take his place think they can get away with the same thing and have an untarnished legacy .
No .
We cannot forgive the man who made a career out of whitewashing war crimes , invasions of human and constitutional rights , being a shill for corporate America , politicizing and polarizing the populace , and lying his ass off every chance he could get .
Is that in bad taste ?
Bad taste to me is pretending to respect someone whom you know did not make nary a single productive contribution to the world in which he lived .
To his family , I 'm sorry for your loss .
But Tony
Snow was part of the press machine that trumpeted war with Iraq and promoted the lies that Iraq was a threat to the United States and was involved in 9/11 and that has proven to be a lie .
A lie that has cost hundreds of thousands of people their lives .
Tony
Snow showed a consistent disrespect for everyone and everything that did n't pander to the special interests of his employers .
Check out Tony Snow 's first day on the job - he accuses Helen Thomas of working for Hezbollah :
Here are some high points of Tony Snow 's career :
From his statement that evolutionary theory is a " hypothesis " to his defense of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , Media Matters for America has documented numerous false and misleading claims advanced by Snow as a Fox News commentator :
* Snow falsely asserted that former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV said his wife , Valerie Plame , " was n't covert for six years " before she was exposed as a CIA operative by syndicated columnist Robert Novak .
* Snow put forward numerous falsehoods to argue that " [ e] volutionary theory , like ID [ intelligent design ] , is n't verifiable or testable .
It 's pure hypothesis . "
* Snow claimed that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the " most liberal justice in American history , " despite evidence to the contrary .
* Snow peddled the baseless Republican National Committee talking point that 2004 presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) had blamed U.S. troops for the explosives looted from the Al Qaqaa military installation following the invasion of Iraq .
Snow said , " [ T ]he Kerry campaign is not criticizing the president here .
They 're criticizing our troops . "
* Following President Bush 's lead , Snow distorted Kerry 's stated desire to reduce terrorism to a " horrible nuisance . "
Snow claimed Kerry had " called terrorists a nuisance . "
* Snow backed Swift Boat Veterans for Truth 's attacks on Kerry , falsely claiming , " [ T ] here has been no documentary contradiction of the Swift Boat stuff . "
* Snow falsely defended Bush from probing questions regarding his National Guard service .
Media Matters for America documented a number of Snow 's false or misleading claims when it was reported that he was on the shortlist .
Following are numerous additional claims advanced by Snow in print and on the air .
Warrantless domestic surveillance
* Suggested Democrats objected to Bush 's warrantless spying because they think the " government should not be able to listen to Al Qaeda " :
While speaking to Fox News political analyst Bob Beckel , Snow suggested that " Democratic opposition " to the warrantless domestic surveillance program arose from the belief that " the government should not be able to listen to Al Qaeda people talking to American citizens . "
Further , Snow claimed that the lack of additional domestic terrorist attacks was " a sign of [ the program 's ] success . "
As Media Matters has noted , this false claim was first made by White House senior adviser Karl Rove during an address to the Republican National Committee at its winter meeting and was quickly spread as a talking point by numerous conservatives .
But , contrary to Rove and Snow 's assertion , no national Democratic figure -- member of the Democratic leadership in Congress , Democratic governor , or Democratic Party official -- has said that the United States should not be intercepting calls suspected to involve Al Qaeda .
Moreover , Snow 's claims about the program 's effectiveness are not supported by the evidence .
* Claimed that Carter and Bush both authorized warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens : Snow asserted that former President Jimmy Carter had " signed an executive order that authorized the attorney general to approve electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information . "
Snow went on to claim that this represented " exactly what the president is doing . "
But Snow ignored a crucial difference : Carter , unlike Bush , prohibited such surveillance of U.S. citizens .
Indeed , Carter 's order specifically required the attorney general to certify that the surveillance will not contain " the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party . "
[ Fox News ' Weekend Live , 12/24/05 ]
* Claimed that the FISA probable cause standard kept the FBI from inspecting Moussaoui 's laptop : Snow said that FBI agents in possession of Zacarias Moussaoui 's laptop " decided not to go ahead and look at the contents because they ... had no definite proof that the guy was a terrorist " and , therefore , could n't meet the probable cause standard necessary for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
But Snow ignored the bipartisan finding by the Senate Judiciary Committee that the investigators had possessed sufficient evidence but that FBI attorneys had applied a too - stringent standard for establishing probable , preventing the investigators from petitioning the court for authorization .
[ Fox News ' Weekend Live , 12/24/05 ]
* Claimed that 2002 FISA review court opinion allowed for warrantless domestic surveillance : Snow stated that a 2002 opinion ( In re : Sealed Case No. 02-001 ) by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review " says the president 's inherent authority allows him " to eavesdrop on the international communications of U.S. residents .
But the claim misrepresents the 2002 decision , in which the court said only that the president has inherent authority to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance without a warrant .
The court did not rule on the question of whether a president has the constitutional authority to spy on people in the United States without a warrant , in apparent violation of FISA .
CIA leak investigation
* Falsely claimed that Wilson said Cheney had sent him to Niger : Snow claimed in his July 15 , 2005 , column that former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV said he " had been dispatched by [ Vice President ] Dick Cheney to conduct a secret mission to Niger . "
In fact , Wilson never claimed that Cheney sent him on the trip .
To the contrary , he wrote in his July 6 , 2003 , op - ed in The New York Times that the CIA requested he go on the mission " so they could provide a response " to questions raised by Cheney regarding allegations that Iraq had attempted to purchase uranium from the African country .
* Claimed that Intel Committee " discovered " that Plame recommended Wilson for the Niger mission :
In his July 15 , 2005 , column , Snow further claimed that the Senate Intelligence Committee , in its 2004 " Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community 's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq , " " discovered that Wilson 's wife , Valerie Plame , did indeed recommend him for the trip " to Niger .
But the committee did not officially conclude that she had been responsible for Wilson 's assignment .
Media Matters previously noted that Snow had falsely asserted that Wilson said his wife " was n't covert for six years " before she was exposed as a CIA operative by syndicated columnist Robert Novak .
Terrorism
* Falsely accused Clinton of rejecting bin Laden offer : Snow advanced the discredited claim that Sudan had offered to " hand over " Osama bin Laden to the United States in the 1990s , but that the Clinton administration responded , " Nah , do n't want to do it . "
But this claim is derived from an August 11 , 2002 , article on right - wing news website NewsMax that distorted a speech Clinton made in 2002 .
Indeed , the bipartisan 9 - 11 Commission found ( page 3 ) " no reliable evidence to support " the claim that Sudan offered bin Laden to the United States and determined that , based on Clinton 's testimony , in " wrongly recounting a number of press stories he had read , " Clinton had " misspoken " in his 2002 speech .
[ Fox News ' Weekend Live , 2/25/06 ]
* Claimed botched CIA attack on Ayman Al - Zawahiri " was a success " : Snow claimed the January 13 CIA drone attack in western Pakistan targeting top Al Qaeda official al - Zawahiri " was a success . "
Further , Snow and guest Richard Miniter both claimed the attack " knocked off four to five key Al Qaeda " figures .
In fact , the strike reportedly killed at least 18 civilians , sparking widespread Pakistani condemnation and protests .
Initially , U.S. officials claimed that , at minimum , some high level Al Qaeda officials were among those killed in the attacks , but this claim was never officially confirmed .
A January 20 Financial Times report ( subscription required ) noted : " Pakistani intelligence official confirmed the identities [ of alleged Al Qaeda officals ] were made on the basis of intelligence information and not ' facts gathered through DNA tests or any other means . ' " [ Fox News ' Weekend Live , 1/21/06 ]
* Deemed Gitmo " the most humane prisoner - of - war facility in history " :
In a June 15 , 2005 , column , Snow wrote that the Pentagon 's military detention facility at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , " may be the most humane prisoner - of - war facility in history . "
Immigration
* Called immigrants rights protestors " idiots " :
In response to Republican strategist Linda Chavez 's claim that the flying of Mexican flags by Mexican - Americans at a 1994 protest led to the passage of California 's controversial Proposition 187 , Snow said , " So , to quote the famous movie Napoleon Dynamite --' idiots . ' " [ Fox News ' Weekend Live , 4/1/06 ]
From the December 24 , 2005 , edition of Fox News ' Weekend Live :
SNOW : Shortly after its [ FISA 's ] passage , your then - president , Jimmy Carter , signed an executive order that authorized the attorney general to approve electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information without a court order and then , subject to having the attorney general sign off .
That 's exactly what this president is doing , corrrect ?
[...]
CHAVEZ : The president has the inherent authority under the Constitution .
There have been a series of Supreme Court rulings .
There 's been a most recent ruling by 2002 of the FISA appeals court .
SNOW : It was the FISA court -- something called In re : Sealed Case 2002 [ sic ] , where it says the president 's inherent authority allows him to do this .
[...]
SNOW : As a matter of fact , when they seized the laptop of Zacarias Moussaoui , FBI agents decided not to go ahead and look at the contents because they were afraid they could n't establish probable cause because they had no definite proof that the guy was a terrorist .
From the January 21 edition of Weekend Live :
SNOW : What seems also odd about this is that the tape was released just about a day after it became perfectly obvious that the CIA strike -- the Predator strike in western Pakistan -- was a success .
MINITER : A great success .
SNOW : They not only -- they not only hit a place where Zawahiri had met earlier with [ Abu Faraj ] al - Libbi -- who has since fallen into American clutches -- but also , it knocked off four to five key Al Qaeda guys .
MINITER : Right , including the head of the Kunar Province operations , which is the main battleground in Afghanistan against U.S. forces at the moment .
And their top bomb maker and poison gas maker .
You know , it 's a great hit from the " war on terror " perspective .
Also , they werevery careful to wait until the sun had set , because , by that time , the meal would have been put down , and men and women eat separately in that part of Pakistan , so the Predator waited , hoping to avoid civilian casualties -- a point that gets lost in all this coverage .
SNOW : Well , it does get lost in the coverage mainly because people do n't -- you know , they do n't understand the end of the eye -- they do n't understand any of that stuff .
[...]
SNOW : Bob , let me ask you a different question .
On the surveillance front :
You 've got a bin Laden tape -- there 've been people saying the government should not be able to listen to Al Qaeda people talking to American citizens .
What does that do politically to the Democratic opposition to the surveillance plan , if anything ?
BECKEL : Well , first of all , I 'll tell you , it obviously says more -- I do n't -- if you 've got a surveillance plan -- I have n't seen one single thing come out of this surveillance plan .
I would assume , by now , that somebody in the administration --
SNOW : But , wait a minute , is that not a sign of success ?
If you have surveillance and you do n't have crime , that would seem to be a sign of success .
From the February 25 edition of Weekend Live :
SNOW : You know also that some of those people who were lunching with bin Laden offered to hand him over -- to serve as the go - between between the government of Sudan and the U.S. -- during the Clinton years .
And the Clinton administration said , " Nah , do n't want to do it . "
So , it 's an interesting tale .
From the April 1 edition of Weekend Live :
SNOW : Give me your response to sort of pro-immigrant groups that are doing rallies like this and waving Mexican and other flags -- are they doing more harm than good to their cause ?
CHAVEZ : They 're doing a lot of harm .
And , in fact , back in 1994 , when California considered an anti-immigrant provision -- Proposition 187 -- that was -- that initiative was actually going down in the polls .
It was ahead a week before the election by only one point , then 70,000 Mexican - Americans took to the streets flying Mexican flags and -- guess what ?
-- it won by 59 percent .
So , these folks would do a whole lot better if they would only fly the Red , White , and Blue .
SNOW : So , to quote the famous movie Napoleon Dynamite --" idiots . "
Call to ' remove ' insults & my testimony for positive analysts
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-12 22:58:57 HONORING
PRESS SECRETARY Mr TONY SNOW FOR HIS SERVICES , AND OFFERING DEEPEST CONDOLEANCES TO THE WHITE HOUSE AS WELL AS HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT THEIR SUDDEN AND PAINFUL LOSS .
A branch , fruit and seed has been plucked from a tree - but the positive spirit will endure through eterneties , and all worlds , for all have to pass this test and challenge of life .....
To editorial workers at BSalert ( wherever they may be today , ) : I request a quick rectification - at the very least , or swift removal the title of the above article with editorial notes .
I condemn this tone of attack and lack of respect in strongest possible terms !
This needs some clear cut editorial ( or removals ) to ' rectify ' !
Where is the positive critical ' humor ' in this ????
Each issue needs due investigation , and misguided or misinformed anger causes needless upset to readers ( and the writer himself , who may realize , after the ' mental shots ' were fired
The title of this article is extremely cruel and inappropriate .
I advise you to consult with the moderator or responsible of the website BSalert ( btw also with IP Address : 66.240.226.164 )..... and advise that that above meditate deeply - as he may have been upset or mislead by other claims or iinense propagandas - but we must allow choirs to be done on behalf of cruel unspiritual terrorist hate crimes overseas ( and we must not allow partisan extremism divide people further into confusing issues ) .
Freedom of speech is not ' freedom to upset or harm ' - nor is it ' freedom to incite hatred or harm , .
We must all respect people in their grief and great loss !
Any Christian would know that Jesus cried out from Golgata , at His last moments ' Lord !
forgive them for they do not know what they do ' - and was a hint to Psalms Ch 22 .
Psalms 23 is my prayer for Tony Snow .
The world is cruel , - and we need not make it evermore cruel .
We can never be judges on the outcome or extent of reward for others - but we can be sure that Tony Snow was serving the American Nation to the best of his ability .
His conscience was assuredly white as Snow - for he did his duty as called for .
As worked very hard and gained experience through the years , he gained in humor and was recognized as carismatic spokesman for the White House .
I pray that the Almighty accept him even amongst those heavenly persons who served even at times when rest was needed , and did his calling and duty - and now he can rest where nobody can harm him .
My deepest respect and condoleance goes to his closest family and dear friends , and all true friends who appreciate the good in others .
Here are few comments , ( kindly requesting urgent security ramifications to be taken care of !! )
Skimming through a just a SMALL FRACTION of the above article I noticed that Mr Pile mentioned something about the Clinton administration as sited as ' not bothering ' to persue Osama bin Laden .
( We are already there where the core issue has been left behind , and mere mudslinging on who - said - what undermines the very serious realities !
Party conflict is wasteful - and people end up doing choirs for sly forces of evil intent - this made accessible all around the world .....)
Please let me put the record straight .
Historically , I clearly remember the time when the Sudanese government had in fact allowed terror training camps activities to take place there .
I do not believe anyone thought that ' Sudan ' had suddenly offered to help stop the terrorism brewing and fomenting .
Behind - the - scenes warnings and offers to help had apparently taken place from certain sides .
I can state that :
1 ) I remember hearing over the media that there was a report from contacts that were willing to assist in ' stopping ' of Osama bin Laden .
It was not prioritized apparently - and you would have to ask President Clinton himself for his reactions , was he was informed on a vast variety of issues .
The seriousness of the matters may have been underestimated - while , in those years , I was also doing my best to help explain extremist mechanisms and interaction in Europe , escalating , and all the end blame put on ' Americans ' etc
2 ) During those years , I tried to contact President Clinton at the White House .
I appreciate a senior security officer who was kind towards me .
I explained that I had a human rights dissident background that was a heavy burden on me , and at the same time , I struggling to warn about the surge of terrorism , and even the danger that my mother 's life could be in .
While I am testifying on this , my own life can be endangered - but I have the right to defend and encourage all good people !
......
I cannot blame the very busy President Clinton for not remotely being able to recieve my urgent call ..... he had other business to tend to , but I deeply appreciate the kindness of his White House staff .
I reported to a US airmen unit stationed in Germany that the war was not ' up in the air ' , but ' here on the ground ' as ultranationalist hate groups were further inflaming dangerous jihadi tendencies , and that would be taken further advantage of by terrorist groups - who would want to justify terror and recruit disenfranchized and hopeless ' lost souls ' in Europe .
Later on , on January 1998 , I noticed that Saddam was racheting and fomenting trying to gather his contacts from the region and around the world to help him in what he called ' the mother of all battles ' and his fight against USA and the West .
I told my local contacts that if I raised issues on Saddam , my mother could be vulnerable and killed in retaliation .
A couple of locals said ' Oh !
She is too far away !
they cannot hurt her - why worry so much ? '
The termendous danger was apparent , but I felt the responsibility to raise understanding - both by being frank to Saddam , and to help clarify issues - so I wrote an indictment fax letter on February 2nd 1998 addressed to Saddam through UN Headquarters fax and through the Embassies of the UN Security Council Permanent members , askign all to forward the message to Saddam .
I charged him for High Crimes and Genocide against original peoples of the Iraq region - and for his biochemical experimentation on Iranian prisoners ( amongst dissidents who were sent as ' mine sweepers ' by Ayatollah Khomeini - and never wanted to shoot anyone - of they turned back , they would be shot by the clerical moral blackmail regime ! (
I told Saddam - leave and present yourself to the International Courts at the Hague before too late !
25 days later , my mother was run over for the second time and killed on February 27th 1998 !
I have struggled to forewarn about horrific dangers , and I had been threatened and intimidated even locally !
Saddam was good business , and as they say , ' money does not smell - wherever it may come from ' .......
A few months later , the 2 US Embassies in East Africa were bombed - amongst them , one of the local embassies my mother told me she went to as she had been harassed .
I do not know how this You Tube side line thread will be considered - for breach International breach of ethics - despite great US hospitality and transparency .
We must remember that there are people out there who have been killed , and in greatest danger !!
I can refer to the words of Jacob in the New Testament who stated that people should guard their tongues , as the tongue is as a smouldering fire , just as a single flame can devour an entire forest .....
You can read those beautiful passages .
I leave it up to the Website to find a way of moderating that is best appropriate - perhaps through an official correction and special note .
I go for POSITIVE dialogue - and we must all be aware and weary of chains of excuses '
I heard that from another website - and here - is - the - link - and all reasoning runs in vicious circles !!
I would not advise anyone to step in a smelly puddle - but errors are for the learning , as long as people take the step to go ' into their thinking boxes ' and immediately suspend negativity - and we must show the greatest respect to all who serve , each and every with their own capacity and ability , and pay tribute to all authentical efforts and honesty in service .
May the Almighty and Saintly Souls everywhere accept our prayer and plea , that the stumbling and pain be transformed into relief and joy , the cruel hints and dirt puddles be transformed into sweet scenting flowers of kindness and forgiveness .
If the intent and zeal is burning truly to do good , and we all try , we shall ultimately succeed , sooner then too late ....
The Christian scriptures , according to letter to Jacob , state that if one has faith , one must needs do good - for faith without deeds is dead .
( litterally )
In the chaos the world is enveloped with , I could understand it if people get misled or provoke on a Saturday day of rest - but the Truth never sleeps - for the peoples truest devoted zeal for learning the truth and being fair , just and positive , is what all hope rests on .
A dawn will rise again , and certain people will discover their errors - while others will evend eny the warmth of the sun .
I for one , do not want to scoff at the stumblings of others , but am grateful whenever I could be inpsired positively or taught some .
Honoring Tony Snow , his family and friends , and all good people who may never have been recognized for their struggles in silence .
May Tony - along with the great Men and Women of ultimate sacrifice , find comfort and rest with the Almighty - and us who have the chance , let us honor others sufferings and sacrifice , by bringing joy through services and zeal for the truth , and to do the good we can , and while we can .....
Despite the chaos of cruelties , may good hearts be inspired to defend all good , and May the Almighty bless and protect !
From a non-political non partisan , & from a standpoint of jurisprudence and reason ,
Sincerely ,
P. Shahir

Thanks for taking the worst off - ALL have benefit of any doubt

Thanks so much for the big improvement !
We all are full of errors , and that is the challenge of life .
The title and another detail are within some reason .
I often have to improve on myself - and what I called my ' quick notes ' could always become better when they go into the ' review ' before adding .
Judging others is worst temtation - for 'he should have been asked before ' !! - and there could be all the information available for the public statements .
Afterall - we could all easily end up in a viscious circle of ' self information ' .
Thanks for the effort !
Mob-o-cracies or Street parliaments are not best judgements - specially the domino effect of cyberspace .
Easy for the street watcher to say - but what would WE do when extremists abuse Internet to send cryptic messages preparing to attack civil societies .
We thought oceans and mountains protected from all - and now we realize that the Internet is an entirely different ballgame - and for every naïve step we take , enemies of humanity and fanatics can try to outmanoevre faster then any illusions we may try to write .
Those who dare testify may endanger their lives unimaginably .
Thanks to those who understand and are concerned about proper protection !
BTW BS makes good fertilizer , lets spread it to grow things with - using it with care and away from all good people , - and with water distribution it can bring good crops .
The real reality is often almost incredible ( due to media unawareness ) - conflicts make honest investigation difficult .
We surely can strive to find common points and help resolve worse crisis .
We owe it to them who risk their lives , serve & many who made the ultimate sacrifice .
Improved investigation after the truth needs removing the preconceived - and ' the truth can set us free ' .
Thanks to all true seekers - for it is not in te stumbling - but the true earnest that counts , and brings a smile to peoples ' sufferings , and hope ( - for proper witness protection ) , for better bridgebuilding , peace and progress for you & me , and all good people .
There is so much to do ..... TY for those with a positive will , & a great weekend to all !

This is n't about negativity and hatred .
This is about whether or not a professional liar is to be remembered as something more than he was .
So Mr. Shahir , what is your story ?
You do n't sound like an American citizen .
Why are you so much of a fan of the current administration and their policies ?
Editorial partly changed back to negative sarcasm & ' jubilation '
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-13 17:58:15 (-
I have kept text copies of this URL through its changes .
Do lets keep it in a good tone ! )
I have no party political affiliation - & BTW I do sound perfectly American - sometimes even Canadian and British depending on whom I speak with .
I have great respect for all people .
Many felt hurt over some who jubilated when they heard Senator Ted Kennedy was ill - and the public reacted .
This is the same .
Even if some may not agree with the Senator , still both Republicans and Democrats and others showed respect and kindness .
I feel it is possible to discuss things in a good tone , and with greatest respect .
After all , Press Secretary Mr Tony Snow passed away FAR TOO YOUNG .
He apparently worked far beyond his capacity .
It is cruel to blame him for all ills - and I feel that people should have an honest dialogue with their President .
What should ANY President have done in face of repeated threats of terror attacks and a massive media hate campaign against the USA and friends ??
Sponsored hate - media flooding is like a hooting , cheering and jeering , and the public is overwhelmed and does no longer know what to believe .
Lets drop partisan extreme cheering , and keep ' our eyes on the ball ' instead of harshly criticizing persons who all did their duty confronted with tasks that no President had ever faced before !! ( but the heinous US Embassy bombings in 1998 were an 'utter surprize ' wake up call - and the same theme has continued smouldering to this very day ..... HOPEFULLY subsiding with improved global understanding )
It is crucial to take issues one by one , and ensure that people can be bothered , or even enjoy contributing with a dialogue .
With a deep interest in health and biochemistry , I was drawn to comment on your fine presentation of artificial coloring - but am totally new to BSalert and background , and having had eye problems , have been slow in exploring .....
My experiences and testimonies can come when I feel comfortable .
There are historical aspects was essential here to underline that President Clinton was informed about the possibilities of stopping Osama bin Laden - and the offer to help hand not come from the Sudanese leadership either .
There is evidence of massive arms shipments to Sudan through harbors of US allies .
Months before 9/11 , the brave Police Intelligence of one such country stopped and ' arrested ' the crew of one such ship ( at a European harbor ) - but some ultranationalist politians who had before defended Saddam , cried out that they did not want Police Intelligence to help with what they called ' doing choirs for the USA ' and US sanctions .
The shipment of arms was thus forced - released to its Sudanese destination .... while there were Al - Qaeda bases there - and now those , ( and other ) arms shipments are used against Darfurians )
We need to help people all around the world understand their shared civil responsibility when massacres take place and despots such as Saddam threaten to bribe the world , take Kuwait and others hostage , and ensue a world blackmail , trying to enforce hate policies and total control of the world economy .
Can you imagine what the world would have been like with Saddam still in power , and demanding excess of $ 150 per barrel of oil ??
Perhaps it would have already hit the $ 500 per barrel , for I remember Saddam stated that he wanted to ' pay in Euros ' and had amassed funds in Swiss banks for furthering his proxy war payments of various terror agents - as the ones uncovered in the Phillipines through Saddam 's embassies .
( statement by White House Press Secretary Mr Ari Fleicher )..
Saddam had repeatedly stated that he ' had come to finish what Hitler had left incomplete ' .
Many good people were horrified .
This is the Saddam the USA helped remove .
Was that wrong ?
What was lacking was global social consiousness and proper public information - and people are no better informed when mudslinging takes place against a President or a hardworking Press Secretary .
It was the USA was attacked - and the USA had even asked for a fair trial for the genocidal Saddam ( - disappointed , as I was , that vast issues on Kurds , Junta Shah of Iran , etc were not properly heard in courts )
I even heard reports that Saddamm had taken rejuvinating blood products from human babies ( in contrast to embryos ) .
Helpless prisoners as captured Iranians were made into guinea pigs for biochemical experimentation !!!!!
Still there are those brainwashed who brush off all , and call it an ' imperialist propaganda ' .
The US has even succeeded in punishing Osama bin Laden , for he has apparently become a zombie - from years of drug abuse , as he was basically a drug ' lord ' and his terror was aimed at legitimizing his market too .
I was personally told by a Intell person with close contact with Taliban , uncovering terrorists ideology , quoting them for saying , '
Sell them drugs and then buy the arms we need to fight them '.
Drugs obscure the mind - and I was well informed that even Laurent Kabila who fought side by side with Che Guevara in Congo , perused drugs on child soldiers , so they became fighting zombies .
30,000 were reported killed in one report .
Most horrific gencides took place in the Rwanda Congo regions .
The US bagan taking the stand in non-oil producing Balkans .
When Saddam began blackmailing the world and planning on a proxy war , HE IN FACT USED THE SAME TERMINOLOGY AS FANATICS AS AL - QAEDA !!
When injustices take place , ALL the people of the world should join hands across ALL party politics and backgrounds , regardless race , creed or religion .
ALL have a shared responsibility .
However , the tyrants feel the rod of US chastizement and now want to even buy off US enterprises , flood the strained society with toxic drugs , and even tried to buy off and blackmail journalists .
I have no ties with any politics , but I profoundly respect those Presidents who have struggled all they can to defend the American nation .
People have been too misinformed and naïve - and tyrannies with closed societies and their adepts have used the Internet to campaign against an hospitable and open society as the USA - taking advantage of free Internet hosting etc etc ......
This is not about a ' political issue ' but that of a legal issue and an emergency as to how to deal with a chaos of disenfranchized poor people - who had expected the USA to have unlimited funds that can help out with everything imaginable - while oil producing countries have been somewhat exuberant during catastrophe or crisis in ' paying off ' their present and future suppliers of cheap military hardware .....
It is not about ' supporting any administration ' but defending justice , and that people everywhere MUS HELP AND CONTRIBUTE SOMEHOW TOWARDS THE COMMON GOOD OF THE WORLD AND FREEDOM FROM TYRANNY AND CRUELTY .
As I wrote above , I feel that the article above is in its entirety a cruel attack after the passing of a hardworking public servant .
The editorial intro is still too harsh and too ' jubilant ' .
Why were these questions not raised while Mr Tony Snow was there and available - even to journalists - and bloggers could have followed up ????? -
Now , let us strive towards a better tone of public information , and also show respect to the US President across all party politics .
Do people remember that Hon President G.W. Bush had to undergo a 2 month Cipro treatment after exposure to Anthrax ??
Such a treatment is utterly exhausting for the system !!
Historically , no president has been put under SO MUCH strain !!!
He is after all the President for all Americans regardless partyu politics !
I always respect the President of the People .
We must not be allowed to be mislead by foreign hate propaganda .
( OR self hating ' insiders ' )
If good people feel ' forced ' to jump off a cliff or attack an administration , it does not alleviate the headache caused by hate movements and fanatics overseas .
In this global village , we could put our heads together and recognize that some people have lost the theme ever since the horrific attack on the WTC in 1993 .
THAT is where we have to look into for answers - in THAT event , and in those PREVIOUS years of the 1980s .
The title of this thread has improved - thanks - and now I hope that the editorial comment also further improves as to the sarcasm of ' good news - bas news ' - and others dispectfully not merely called liars when they no longer can reply .
One could call for an investigatory dialogue - and not merely call people liars posthumously !!
When this done , I could have more peace of mind if I were to write comments or take part freely in discussions .
Honor is in our constant rectification - for that is life - honor is not in persisting in a divided debate .
There are promising signs , and have respect for all who stumble in passionate misunderstanding - but there are those who feel they do ' honor killings ' by blowing themselves up and innocent men women and children .
Let us try and lead the way by pouring the fertilizers in the right places , and ALL good people will reap the fruits of joy .
Chins up !
- the US has still much to do - we all need unity and spirit of mutual respect - and only then , a positive investigative dialogue could thence ensue .....
Have a thoughtful sunday - best wishes to all ,
& and may the Almighty protect and all good people help inspire !

Great ... another wacko conspiracy theory nutjob .
Do n't you people have anything better to do ?
Like examine your head for RFID chips that were secretly implanted while you were sleeping by zombies hired by the CIA ?
Critic was about 2 sides of coin - 1990s non-persuing of OBL etc
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07 - 14 23:11:54 @ Pile - since you inquired ..... on Clinton 's role as regards OBL in the 1990s , and unbelievable horrors under Saddam Hussein and other tyrants .
My main theme was that the original headline on this discussion thread was FAR too harsh and cynically cruel over other 's personal tragedy , ( for anyone ) let alone for the many who loved Tony Snow for his carismatic personality !
After a period of peace to mourn , then there could be a dialogue on clearcut specific issues - one at a time .
Here we suddenly had a ' PILE ' of accusations post - humously !! - and I being non-political and not connected to any lobby whatsoever , have the right ( and duty ) to help clarify , where I can , on issues that I personally have experienced and know something about , or have had , at the very least , first hand accounts from people fleeing from those regions .
As I said , I skimmed over a TINY FRACTION of your list , and already stumbled over a single theme about ' who - said - what ' and ' why - did - others - conclude - that ' as regards to the Clinton administration not prioritizing the stopping of Osama bin Laden in the 1990s - alongside dealing with various interrelated extremist Jihadis that were known to be connected to the horrific 1993 attack on the WTC .
THAT is where I felt that I could clarify that there were those events related to shipments of arms to Sudan that were far from stopped by Europeans - ( prior to 9/11 ) while there were known terror training camps functioning in Sudan ....
This was important to clarify .
I then went on to clarify that I had raised alarm long before 9/11 - and already in August 1997 had explained to US airmen unit based in Germany , explaining to them that while ultranationalist hate extemists were ( certain European countries ) capitializing on the fact that there were no proper distinction between peaceloving refugees at risk of being persecuted and killed , and those who found it convenient to come to Europe and falsely claim being ' a near extinct and endangered species ' .
As misunderstandings grew in the 1980s ultranationalists hate proponents capitalized on the confusion , and on mixing all issues up , and used it as an excuse to blanket judging anyone different - regardless the authenticity of the persons involved , good people were marginalized .
I explained to those US airmen in 1987 , that the war is not 'up there ' but the harsh reality '' down here on earth ' - as extremism and further polarization and misunderstandings have thrived - and there an unpleasant and horrific symbiosis and mutual benefit from mental isolationism between the extremist ideologies .
I dubbed the word ' parallel societies ' which was a term litterally soon ' swallowed raw ' by many debators in Europe .
Each believed in their fixed preconceptions and were worlds apart .
( both isolated individuals and groups )
Small countries were not accomodated to such problems they poorly understood , - and often reacted with chauvinism and blanket discrimination and those ' on the other side ' with truly cruel mindsets developed a hateful ideology that profited from the ultranationalist hatred they met .
The rift of understanding grew , and honest authentical people were sidelined andmarginalized due to blanket judgements that hit media headlines .
BOTH EXTREMIST ANTI - POLES : JIHADIST EXTREMISTS AS WELL AS ULTRANATIONALISTS blamed all problems and evils on US dominance and conspiracy .
Persons on BOTH extremes claimed that the whole thing was a conspiracy by the USA - and both the extremist factions as Hezbollah AND the ultranationalists claimed that there was a ' Jewish conspiracy ' to control the parliament , banks etc
Saddam enjoyed this atmosphere of hatred , and was even praised by ultranationalists in Europe .
Saddam had stated that he wanted ' to complete the job Hitler had left incomplete ' .
It was in the late 1980s that I heard horror accounts from refugees .
Some refugees from Iran had escaped through mountains on the Turkish border , and some through Afghanistan - some by crossing the Persian Gulf into UAE , and some through Iraq .
It was from refugees from Iran that I heard many many horror accounts - ranging from biochemical attacks on civilians BOTH BY SADDAM AND THE IRANIAN REGIME ON IRANIAN KURDS - ALL THE WAY BACK IN AROUND 1986 - 1987 .
The account that refugees had heard that the doctors of BOTH Ayatollah Kohomeini AND Saddam Hussein had used experimental blood products to keep them in good condition , is a horrific issue and documented in medical litterature as regards to the rhesus flexibility of baby stem cells have also been documented more recently !! ( and the lack of anti-bodies )
This is as if from a horror , Dracula or Frankenstein movie ( or ' Coma ' ) and an ' unbelievable conspiracy theory ' for some ! (( but today we realize that people ARE kidnapped for their body parts even in other regions ) )
When I first heard refugees telling me this , I felt quite disbelieving and totally sceptical , until I learned about the superstitions and cruel and futile medical ' practices ' among people , both under the Iranian regime as well as in Iraq .
At first , this was something I thought that could happen in Iran , as the Ayatollahs had control over all funds and doctors were demanded things that would be against any Hippocrathic principles .
Some doctors were executed because of their secrecy , and others were forced to becoming monsters - as happened under the post depression Nazism that exploited dissidents and enemies to fulfil their supply of guinea pigs .
When I first heard about the use of new born babies blood used in rejuvinating treatment , refugees referred to Ayatollah Khomeini .
I later heard similar accounts about Saddam Hussein .
Some paid ' doctors ' would commit any crime ' to cure age and cancer ' in order to survive and feed their family .
In the 1980s the use of stem cells and experimentation on rejuvination was litterally unknown or undiscussed in medical circles in the West , understandably due to high moral standards .
However , the elite societies in both Iran and Iraq had access and demanded things that was reserved for the elite .
When I mentioned this issue at the spur of the moment , it was a simplistic example amongst MANY MANY OTHER horrors committed by both regimes as they BOTH sent dissidents to the front lines to be killed .
Iran was well renouned for luring school children into trucks and shipping them to the war front with Iraq and given a ' key to heaven ' around their necks .
They were very often children of dissidents and undesired endangered minorities .
I freeze with grief due to the horror accounts I heard first hand from refugees arriving from those regions .
This stereotype example was ONLY 'A TINY DISCRETE DETAIL ' ( epitomizing those regimes ) in contrast to much more blatant and visible attacks on humanity , such as the use of Chemical warfare in BOTH Iran and Iraq already apparent towards 1987 ( BEFORE the Halabcha massacre !! )
Iranian refugees told of Iranian Islamic Revolition forces aircraft bombing Kurds , and possibly colluding their extermination indirectly together with Iraq .
Saddam was a master of trickery , trying to scare Turkey and inciting desperate Kurds to cross the border - in order to get more support from Turkey for fulfilling Saddam 's own scheme .
Police authorities know well what I have already reported in 1987 , indicating possibilities of cross border use of biochemical agents possibly even into Europe ( - let alone speaking of the much later ' Gulf war syndrome ' - which was apparently not from vaccines according to recent British research , - but POSSIBLY mixture of chemical residues , pathogens , as well as traumatic stress )
What I found disgustingly racist , was the ingorance and similarity between both ultranationalists AND jihadist abusers of religion BOTH demonizing the USA and blaming everything on Americans , and ' zionist conspiracy ' .
On Since BEFORE 9/11 , I was on PalTalk struggling to war about problems and issues .
I had stated that Saddam wanted payment for oil in Euros and not Dollars , for he wanted the US economy to depreciate .
While the USA had assisted in defending UN food supplies in Somalia , and helped in hotspots with no oil , I kept on raising the issue that the abuses of natural resources by both Iran and Iraq ( ancient Capital province of Persia ) , could lead to a world economical crisis .
Oil could fuel uncontrolled spur of development and consumerism , and all of sudden , those despotic tyrannies would ' pull the noose ' and demand exuberant and ludicrous prices , and secure themselves all the finance they wanted to pay for their arms race !!
While on PalTalk , some will remember me , as the oil prices passed the $ 30 and even approached and passed the $ 40 point .
I stated that ' that is nothing !!
Oil will continue to rise even above $ 50 - $ 70 - $ 80 and even over $ 100 , $ 200 - I stated that with the effect it would could have on the US economy , oil can rise even up to $ 500 - and the world economy can be threatened by recession !!
- if people do not wake up .
It was then discussed that people would think of ulterior motives if US were to try to stop Saddam .
As I had tried to explain around ½989 - 1990 , the threat to world economy and escalation of armament financing and prospect of world chaos and destruction were and still are UNIMAGINABLE .
Hate populism under Hitler needed a microphone and open squares so all could hear .
The US were not aware of the Nazi agenda , and IBM supplied Germany with the first computers , which Hitler used to create simplified databases - and the ' enigma ' coding machine made it quite difficult for allies to forcast what plans the Nazi ' Axis ' alliance had .
I have repeatedly written in many letters and accounts that Hitler would be ' turning in his grave ' if he could have access to this kind of information technology we have today - and THAT TECHNOLOGY IS PRESENTLY USED FOR PROPAGANDA AGAINST THE US ( - let us be fair ! ) and opportunistic enemies of humanity as terrorists and tyrants have already reached epics of software development and have bought satellite services and at this very moment still dream of abusing satellite surveillance images for the sake of gaining control - and the worst blackmail of its kind is ' oil supply ' in addition to al other forms of proxy warfare etc etc
What we can be comforted with is that there are many of those good people all around the world who have grown to understand the plight of Americans , specially when they see what oil price blackmail can do to their lives and livelihood !!
We must needs encourage all good forces , without being naïve and too believing - as the US economy cannot function without trade - and yet US domestic needs must be protected from scornful preditor interests .
Many Google articles have been ' outdated ' and archives lost - as people buying shares try to control the board of directors ' decisions .
Standards of Corporate resonsibility in information protection and historical archiving must needs be reviewed and protected .
However , we must hurry and ask help from Intelligence experts to dig up reliable archives and restitute those people who have suffered in silence - for that is the pathway of progress ( - NOT prepaid populism and propaganda with confused rhetorics )
The horror accounts about certain perverted medical ' professionals ' is a ' tiny detail ' in comparison to how tyrannies raped and murdered people systematically in prisons in both Iran and Iraq .
People would simply ' disappear ' .
You can read about accounts of babies kept in refrigerators in Iraq .
Many of those doctors may have ' dropped off ' and many may have died since those baby blood transfusions and blood product applications since the mid 1980s !!
20 years ago !!!!!
And yet , I have heard reports about this being done in Iraq under Saddam .
Another chilling account is made available thanks to certain Japanese interest to keep old information accessible on the Internet .
You can read about INNUMERABLE Iraqi babies found kept in refrigerators in Iraq - it is reported , LONG before the oil for food & medicine program ( ( which BTW I had proposed in a fax to Hon President Clinton ) ) .
Here is the JapanToday URL on that part : http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/news/267199/all
Doctors testified that there were baby bodies refrigerated even BEFORE the sanctions - and that they used them in media stunts to blame the US sanctions ....
However , the main theme and angle I testified about was the issue of terrorists using Sudan ad a training camp ALREADY in the 1990s !! - and the air attack on positions there under President Clinton are also well known !!
That very single point is was a historical chronology I felt I could help elucidating from my very personal experience .
IMAGINE how the US economy would have fared under further blackmail from Saddam Hussein if he were there today !!!!!
What retaliation and proxy wars he had schemed !!
Sooner or later , what would have happened , as he continued his sick idea of ' mother of all battles ' vowing to conquer Jerusalem as his pseudo - neo - Babylonistic ideological delusion !?!!?
Where would human dignity and rights be then ??
He would have force sponsored a media lobby court to force the USA to worship HIS ideals of pseudoBabylonsim and state that HIS version of a ' glorious Babylon ' was right , and continue his arm twisting on all archeologists forced with oil finances !!
Meanwhile the endangered kidn hearted minorities in Iran and Iraq and their original heritage peoples the regions would have been even worse off !! - and cruelty extermination of those endangered minorities and peoples would have repercussions on all of Humanity , exactly in the same way as Nazism had intended in since after the depression of the 1930s .
We MUST WORK TOGETHER TO AVERT THAT !!
FROM NOW ( or procrastination can lead to even more unimaginable sufferings and injustices , and lies !! )
Therefore , JUST ONE POINT may need much more explanation - as the public see only the 'tip of the iceberg ' - and I felt that it would be very unjust to accuse White House Press Secretary Tony Snow of any failure of duty or dishonesty .
We need to understand those core issues first before judging persons that entered public service well over a decade later after those events !!
BTW even the New Yorker sticks to satire - not anywhere near the caricatures attacking the Prophet Muhammed , that really struck an upset chord among millions - ' freedom or not ' .
I respect moderate muslims who cannot be blanket judged ( - neither must any people be complacent about cruel prejudice against the USA !! ) - and find it a very inflaming issue even extremists tried to take adantage of !!
The Obama caricature may be very distasteful and unpleasant for many - but those who choose can take it as satire and just laugh it off - but satiric motives and intentions may need explaining , as others may want more clarifications as to whether there is a critic on relevant themes as can be seen on the New Yorker today generally on ' flip flopping ' escapism from harsh realities , and as ' sugar coated promises ' -
(( Non-political people have rights too , to understand and to choose !! ))

Back to the point , I deeply appreciate Foxnews tribute blogs that are rightfully well deserved , in my humble view , as Press Secretary Tony Snow was very hard working , and kept a sense of humor even in most difficult times .
Kindest wishes and blessings to all good people with kind layer of mind and wish for positive dialogue .
I remain , a ' neutral ' bird 's eye testimony above all party political interests ,

On URL info ' disappearing ' on Japan Today 's News website archive
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-15 00:45:46 ( PS on links and example of constantly threatened archives flooded by slices of share interests etc - crucial historical information pushed out )
The simple search was done , not many hours ago , on a simple search on Google using for example the following key words :
Saddam Hussein + Iraq + blood products + refrigerated babies + doctors + Japan Times
2 top results pointed to 2 URLs :
http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/news/271424/all
and at http://archive.japantoday.com/jp/news/267199/all
At the very least , one of the URLs had the article some hours ago , which I thoroughly investigated .
Two URLs showed on Google resulted in sample information with the following text :
Doctors said they were forced to refrigerate dead babies in hospital ...
The posting from around the year 2003 or 2004 was a personal testimony of an Iraqi doctor who stated that his life and that of his entire family could be in danger , because of that information .
He stated that the refrigeration of babies was not ' just ' due to the oil for food sanctions , as the Iraqi regime had claimed .
Earlier on , this was taking place - but when the sanctions took place , they just began wheeling the bodies out into public and showed them off to journalists .
They had ordered the parents to do their part in crying and mourning in front of the cameras , so that all blame could be placed in the US sanctions , while all money was covertly funneled to other schmemes directed by the Saddam elite .
( swift account by memory from hours ago , from a website statement by an Iraqi doctor - myseriously disappeared - perhaps overwhelmed by inquiries )
The alarming information was that the Iraqi doctors had been forced to have that routine of keeping babies in refrigerators long before the media stunts .
The doctor feared for his life and that of his family .
This is just one tiny example of macabre methods - and parents would just about do anything ' in national interest ' in order to survive and be promised a better treatment , were they one day in need of medical attention .
Typical despotic tyrannical regime blackmail conditions -
In Iran , moral religious blackmail and fear for one 's survival is a ' normalcy ' and accepted consequence , as people are brainwashed that it is the ' religious authority ' that has ' proven ' itself - as the holders of power can play ' God ' and claim to power as if they ( Ayato ' llah 's AND other dictators ) would have liked to be considered as ' kings ' - yet of no royal lineage , quality , magnanimity or conscience whatsoever .....

( btw Peoples existential ultimate realization of a dialectics between their powerlessness and obvious defined existence of the Almighty , is a matter of respect and issue for each individual .
An Almighty surpassing all can , by definition , never be limited to the pockets of ( , or imperical extortion measures of ) , ANY despotic clerical fanatic abusing people 's trust , or the denials of ultimate fate , through any number of injunctures )
Needless to remind you that you started this forum threat with an extreme and litterally demonising title line .
There were very upset feelings from a public member who went as far as coming with death threats - ALSO against the law inany country .
I wish to correct a typing error : Regarding to the fast accelerating dangers of terrorism , had contacted the White House prior to meeting members of the US airmen based in Germany took place towards and in August 1998 and not 1989 ( excuse typing error )
THIS was the core issue , as it was not just the matter of ' WHICH ' terror lead to persue .
There was a general lack of attention on the horrific escalation in danger - not only to the USA , but to the entire world , as Saddam was from as a figure from a dungeon of horror .
Again , it is good you understood the point that the medical abuse of babies for very cynical so called ' medical ' procedures , was only the least part of the horrors , as all civilized people know what it means to use biological poisons against ANY member of civilian population - let alone the MANY towns that were obliterated in Northern Iraq , predominantly the original people of the region .
These horrors took place also WELL BEFORE the publicly uncovered massacre in Halabcha using a cocktail of poison gases .
The main issue here is that I felt morally obligated to raise awareness to the escalation between ultranationalist hate crime lobbies , who LOVED to demonize even the most peaceful of refugees , calling them all ' immigrants ' even when they had been persecuted .
This in turn helped the jihadist islamists recruit even more people , and the cycle went on .....
When you mentioned points about President Clinton , and his dealings with terrorism and jihadists since the 1993 WTC heinous attack in New York , it is crucial to be fair and impartial , and not allow partisan extremist mudslinging , even as I spoke with US representation during President Clinton 's administration , requesting a message to Speaker of the House Honorable MR Newt Gindrich , to help ' tone down ' the cruel atmosphere against the President - which he did ( - whether he had heard me or not ) .
I respectfully remind you at it is YOUR article that had mentioned surrounding Hon. Pres. Clinton 's decisions in the 1990s vis a vis OBL activities in Sudan etc , and what ' certain people had said ' ....
( PS btw , re : oil prices , on PalTalk I had ALSO stated , many years ago , that oil could easily rise over $ 300 - and even could hit the $ 500 mark .
( recently after I wrote this Hugo Chavez of Venezuela stated that it could rise above $ 300 with a threat undertone - We must ALL wake up and unite against such threats - before far too late !!!!! -
Therefore ,
It would have been helpful too , if members of your lobby , from any flank of the Democratic party , could along and decried the extreme tone - one would only use when strongly upset about Saddam 's high crimes of cultivating Jihadi activities ( as among ' willing ' Iranian POWs as ' alternative activity ' )
Saddam went on to call for ' Jihad to conquer Jerusalem ' , calling it ' the mother of all battles ' - a term he also used when racheting and threatening attack against US and allies , if they did not let him get his way in taking over oilfields , and subsequently blackmailing the entire world !!
Essentially , I go for a decent , fair , impartial and friendly tone of reasoning and view exchange .
Following my efforts to raise awareness on the escalation of extremism , ultranationalism and abusive oil cartels linked to condoning and supporting jihadi terrorists , I experienced that horrific personal tragedy of my mother being killed , as she was not properly protected .
Here , while explaining my most horrific personal tragedy , as victim of terror and intimidation , the very best I can do is being honest and urging people towards a more positive dialogue .
On this board , everyone knows that there were a number of other postings , one of which was very angry with death threats against you - and while understanding his feeling of insult , I condemn any such threat ( website colleague of yours apparently posted his IP address here , but very often people use other IPs to mask their address - and it MIGHT even be someone living closer to your own area ... who knows ... )
You removed those postings , and my postings were left to stand alone .... with some reactions from you , which you also re-edited , as you may , as moderator ( ? or co-moderator ) .
However , while having appreciated your removing the demonising remark in the title line , I still feel that it is also up to Press Secretary Mr Tony Snow 's friends to demand further indemnity if they wish - something I could do too , since according to Internet ethics , the duty of a moderator is to protect posters from harassment , and not further unkindness to a poster , with rightful cause to request an ethical humane tone of discussion .
While you wish to statuate ' freedom of speech '
I personally would not like to hurt anyone 's feelings - for while one should treat others in the way one would like to treat one 's self , it is not a matter of leaving things to street parliamentarism .
Some like to provoke as last resort to draw attention - but , in my view , that is a wrong way of capitalizing on peoples ' feelings .
One should raise issues with a just cause , and be allowed to reply when one can .
I initially wrote a posting on this website at http://bsalert.com/news/2070/Know_Your_Food_Coloring.html , as I felt that I should share my little knowledge about health and biochemistry to forewarn and encourage .
Inever know what BSalert meant !!?!
I thought I had found someone who know something in biochemistry of foods I could discuss with ( sorry about that ....
However I appreciate any effort to raise public awareness in truth .
- and I then reacted naturally to other postings , some somewhat rather extreme )
I could understand your upset that there are not enough postings here - but an idea could be to be more positive and humoristic .
Perhaps I could suggest even a humorist change of face , calling this ' fertilizeralert ' ( but now that ismy Intellectual pruduct - and will only allow my ideas and inspiration to be used to encourage people in crisis and personal tragedy , and not insult them calling names ) .
If someone abuses the website ( even your own co-hosters or co-moderators ) , then , by law , you have the responsibility to report it , specially to protect posters from harassments and intimidation !
This is Internet code of ethics - so if the website were to improve and still be there tomorrow , I for one would encourage a kind layer of mind and fairness - and therefore felt a moral duty to speak for those who are no longer presently here amongst us to speak for themselves .
However , I feel encouraged that you could like to stand as a man of positived dialogue , and in these fleeting moments , while Internet is quandered , while people in Darfur are dying in the thousands from chronic disease , neglect and inustice , I try my utmost to do right here and now , and wish to cite the Very Honorable US President ( of all Americans - right to the end of his term of office ) for comforting the public , family , friends of Press Secretary Tony Snow , at the White House site , URL http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/07/20080717-1.html ( just copy and paste into browser address line )
As regards to any crimes you may feel have been committed in various offices , I suggest you contact the FBI who have the highest norms and values in defending human rights across all party politics and walks of life .
That goes for any corporate or white collar crimes you may have noticed or could document .
I deeply appreciate a new line of action statuated by President Bush on condemning corporate crimes as example of Enron and the cruelty that occured disenfranchising and robbing the consumers and the life savings of hard working American worker .
It was the USA ( and good people everywhere ) that was attacked in 1993 , and again on 9/11 2001 .
I deeply appreciate all who joined hands in face of the heinous horrors against Humanity , and struggled in public service , doing all the can , either as Press Secretary of the President , or as simple security guards or police officers in DC or in LA , who struggle to raise enough to feed a family and also to serve security and wellbeing in USA .
On the 100the Aniversary and on this Special Day declared as proclaimed as ' FBI Day ' , I wish to raise profound gratitude to the FBI and other related security forces and guards , who have risked their lives in service of public serive and struggle against all forms of crime .
The FBI is renouned for great services throughout the world towards security and fighting crime , ( and this goes too for the British Scotland Yard as well as some other devoted Police teams in Europe )
FBI have special Internet sections that work on cybercrimes , and I think all websites should work closely with that Highly Esteemed Office of Service to All Americans and All good people everywhere .
Here is the 100th Year Anniversary Birthday of FBI and website on this special FBI Day occasion .
Happy birthday & FBI Day to all of FBI !!!!!!!!!
For now , I thank you for your attention and interest and wish your website the progress and changes that could make your team and families happy and rewarded - through progressive thinking and positive dialogue .
Wishing joyful progressive thoughts and ever advancing hearts , minds and souls for all good people of consceince and progress .
Best wishes & blessings to all from P. Shahir PS thanking search engine experts re : Saddam 's Horrors
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-17 18:43:12 PS
I would like to thank various search engine experts , including Google , Yahoo , MSN and many other independent Internet advocates , that may have helped to improve the Internet and make search results available , and many other older archives seemed to be become available .
There are still some older sites that may have collapsed or lost their ability to host or to pay bills etc etc etc - and for those pieces of information , I could appeal to all to enter into a neutral sphere of positive respectful cooperation so that all archives AND search engines be devoted to preserving such historical documents and ensuring that nothing can be manipulated .
Now we all have th serious challange of protecting peoples Identities and works from ruthless envy , theft and even threat to security physical survival !!
Historical analysts and critical Intelligence contributors must needs work together , so that misunderstandings be overcome , people be honored & appreciated for their struggles , and victims of cyber- intimidation be exhonorated , and good works be statuated and encouraged .
Happy FBI
Day to all !
Huh ?
Posted by Confused on 2008-07-18 22:47:10 I thought this was about Tony Snow ...
@ Shahir , does this really long thing end in a dead baby joke , ' cause we 've already heard them all .
Press Secretary T.S. had both right & duty to defend just cause
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-20 18:41:23
Regarding the above & now 13th post :
Again , I had replied that ' refrigerated babies ' and horror experimental abuse of baby blood products , was a ' ridiculously ' little aspect , - in comparison to the use of poison gas to drive out and eliminate original peoples of Iraq , - long before the hard video documented Halabcha massacre of 1988 !!
Doctors who ever tried to report could simply disappear !
A public mislead about Saddam 's horrors , is only a tiny aspect of a globalized media jungle the Press Secretary had to deal with !!!!
I applaud good people across all party politics , who grown to understood what this Saddam horror was getting up to .
Fierce pro-Saddam propaganda , and blocking of relevant search engine historical records temporarily caused confusion for people with short memories and subject to biased misinformation .
Many had paranoid suspicions that Saddam 's massacre using poison gases was ' just a propaganda stunt '
This is a ' little ' example of the kind of harsh media lobbyist propaganda Mr Tony Snow had to deal among many other msiled lobbyist media propaganda problems - as many had thought , in the 1990s , that Saddam was ' still good to do business with ' - so cynical and masses rendered ignorant by prepaid propaganda .
DESPITE certain cartel interests ' financing of hate propaganda and wholesale personality assassination efforts ( as last resort for tyrants and corrupt interests ) , the memory of Press Secretary Mr Tony Snow has been revered in well over 100,000 Internet addresses ( according to Google ) !! , - many of which have hundreds of condolences and tributes each , to Tony Snow and grief stricken family .
This addes up to millions of tributes from people who have listened to and appreciated Mr Tony Snow 's carismatic personality !
People have also the right to raise issues about many cruel misunderstandings and misleadings !
Possibly things that Mr Tony Snow did not achieve while alive among us , seem to be gradually acheived through mysterious ways .
It is not the matter of what - so - and - so - said and who - was - upset etc - but a matter of dealing with humongous cruelties in the world , false propaganda , and the urgent need of a straight and candid Press Secretary who could deal with such pressures !
Well done Mr Tony Snow ! - and heartfelt sympathies to family , friends and colleagues !
sincerely , P. Shahir PS appreciating partners towards world free of tyranny & terror

This said , even though African Union hosted outside Africa , I wish to express profound appreciation as regards to the efforts of the Egyptian President Mubarak to help bring people together - , constructive dialogue with the US President , and the friendship of Egyptians growing towards USA .
Working partners who want to see peace in the region , know the value of a President who honestly stands up for his convictions - no matter what cruel mudslingings may have taken place about ' peoples great grandfathers ' , ALL present day living leaders have the right to struggle and statuate that there is no place for cruel repression and tyrannic support to terror cartels ....
Oops - this PS was meant in reply to criticism on President Bush
Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07 - 20 19:51:06 ( was meant for the other thread ) - but still related to one of Press Secretary Tony Snow 's many PR achievements in helping advance partnerships against terror and tyranny in the world .
- TY Tony Snow !

Pile - I love your BSAlerts !
I know you do n't want to tread on this guy 's free speech rights , but honestly he is clearly mentally imbalanced , and his incredibly long diatribes fail at any semblance of coherence .
He 's essentially spamming your forum and if it continues you really should just block him .
He 's making it more difficult for others to use the forums because he 's completely monopolizing the space .
Hey PILE , " Birds of a feather . . . "
Posted by guyfroml on 2008-07- 23 20:00:13
Hey PILE , you stated earlier , " ... This is n't about negativity and hatred .
This is about whether or not a professional liar is to be remembered as something more than he was . "
Well , from the sound of it , the way you talk and think , it appears when the day come for you to leave this world , you and Tony are going to be roommates ... he's waiting for you !
Posted by TheSimulacra on 2008-07-23 22:26:30 Ha !
Come on " guyfroml " ... is there really anything more hateful than condemning someone else to hell ?
Grow up .
Tony Snow was complicit in selling this war , bankrupting the American people , exploiting the public 's faith in both government and the media ... the list goes on and on .
We should all reserve our tears for people who die who actually led GOOD lives .

Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
DIGG THIS
The American people should be eternally grateful to Old Europe for having spiked the Bush - McCain plan to bring Georgia into NATO .
Had Georgia been in NATO when Mikheil Saakashvili invaded South Ossetia , we would be eyeball to eyeball with Russia , facing war in the Caucasus , where Moscow ’s superiority is as great as U.S. superiority in the Caribbean during the Cuban missile crisis .
If the Russia - Georgia war proves nothing else , it is the insanity of giving erratic hotheads in volatile nations the power to drag the United States into war .
From Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan , as Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , U.S. presidents have sought to avoid shooting wars with Russia , even when the Bear was at its most beastly .
Truman refused to use force to break Stalin ’s Berlin blockade .
Ike refused to intervene when the Butcher of Budapest drowned the Hungarian Revolution in blood .
LBJ sat impotent as Leonid Brezhnev ’s tanks crushed the Prague Spring .
Jimmy Carter ’s response to Brezhnev ’s invasion of Afghanistan was to boycott the Moscow Olympics .
When Brezhnev ordered his Warsaw satraps to crush Solidarity and shot down a South Korean airliner killing scores of U.S. citizens , including a congressman , Reagan did — nothing .
These presidents were not cowards .
They simply would not go to war when no vital U.S. interest was at risk to justify a war .
Yet , had George W. Bush prevailed and were Georgia in NATO , U.S. Marines could be fighting Russian troops over whose flag should fly over a province of 70,000 South Ossetians who prefer Russians to Georgians .
The arrogant folly of the architects of U.S. post -Cold War policy is today on display .
By bringing three ex-Soviet republics into NATO , we have moved the U.S. red line for war from the Elbe almost to within artillery range of the old Leningrad .
Should America admit Ukraine into NATO , Yalta , vacation resort of the czars , will be a NATO port and Sevastopol , traditional home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet , will become a naval base for the U.S. Sixth Fleet .
This is altogether a bridge too far .
And can we not understand how a Russian patriot like Vladimir Putin would be incensed by this U.S. encirclement after Russia shed its empire and sought our friendship ?
How would Andy Jackson have reacted to such crowding by the British Empire ?
As of 1991 , the oil of Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan belonged to Moscow .
Can we not understand why Putin would smolder as avaricious Yankees built pipelines to siphon the oil and gas of the Caspian Basin through breakaway Georgia to the West ?
For a dozen years , Putin & Co. watched as U.S. agents helped to dump over regimes in Ukraine and Georgia that were friendly to Moscow .
If Cold War II is coming , who started it , if not us ?
The swift and decisive action of Putin ’s army in running the Georgian forces out of South Ossetia in 24 hours after Saakashvili began his barrage and invasion suggests Putin knew exactly what Saakashvili was up to and dropped the hammer on him .
What did we know ?
Did we know Georgia was about to walk into Putin ’s trap ?
Did we not see the Russians lying in wait north of the border ?
Did we give Saakashvili a green light ?
Joe Biden ought to be conducting public hearings on who caused this U.S. humiliation .
The war in Georgia has exposed the dangerous overextension of U.S. power .
There is no way America can fight a war with Russia in the Caucasus with our army tied down in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Nor should we .
Hence , it is demented to be offering , as John McCain and Barack Obama are , NATO membership to Tbilisi .
The United States must decide whether it wants a partner in a flawed Russia or a second Cold War .
For if we want another Cold War , we are , by cutting Russia out of the oil of the Caspian and pushing NATO into her face , going about it exactly the right way .
Vladimir Putin is no Stalin .
He is a nationalist determined , as ruler of a proud and powerful country , to assert his nation ’s primacy in its own sphere , just as U.S. presidents from James Monroe to Bush have done on our side of the Atlantic .
A resurgent Russia is no threat to any vital interests of the United States .
It is a threat to an American Empire that presumes some God - given right to plant U.S. military power in the backyard or on the front porch of Mother Russia .
Who rules Abkhazia and South Ossetia is none of our business .
And after this madcap adventure of Saakashvili , why not let the people of these provinces decide their own future in plebiscites conducted by the United Nations or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ?
As for Saakashvili , he ’s probably toast in Tbilisi after this stunt .
Let the neocons find him an endowed chair at the American Enterprise Institute .
Patrick J. Buchanan [ send him mail ] is co-founder and editor of The American Conservative .
He is also the author of seven books , including Where the Right Went Wrong , and A Republic Not An Empire .
His latest book is Churchill , Hitler , and the Unnecessary War .

The Best of Patrick J. Buchanan
Chuck Todd and the First Read guys capture something that really stood out to me in that Nevada poll I wrote up yesterday : Obama 's much - buzzed - about shortcomings with Latinos do n't appear to be real .
In addition to our recent NBC / WSJ poll , which showed Hispanics breaking for Obama 62 % - 28 % , a new survey of 800 Latino voters from 21 states finds that 60 % of them plan to vote for Obama versus 23 % for McCain .
That is down considerably from the 40 % - plus Bush received in 2004 .
It ’s no longer fair to say that Obama has a problem with Latino voters ; McCain does .
This was a case of conventional wisdom that was never based on fact , just semi-informed speculation based on primary exit polling and bad stereotypes of Latinos .

Tomgram : Why Cheney Wo n't Take Down Iran
Reality Bites Back
Why the U.S. Wo n't Attack Iran
By Tom Engelhardt
It 's been on the minds of antiwar activists and war critics since 2003 .
And little wonder .
If you do n't remember the pre-invasion of Iraq neocon quip , " Everyone wants to go to Baghdad .
Real men want to go to Tehran ... " -- then take notice .
Even before American troops entered Iraq , knocking off Iran was already " Regime Change : The Sequel . "
It was always on the Bush agenda and , for a faction of the administration led by Vice President Cheney , it evidently still is .
Add to that a series of provocative statements by President Bush , the Vice President , and other top U.S. officials and former officials .
Take Cheney 's daughter Elizabeth , who recently sent this verbal message to the Iranians : " [ D ]espite what you may be hearing from Congress , despite what you may be hearing from others in the administration who might be saying force is n't on the table ... we 're serious . "
Asked about an Israeli strike on Iran , she said : " I certainly do n't think that we should do anything but support them . "
Similarly , former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton suggested that the Bush administration might launch an Iranian air assault in its last , post- election weeks in office .
Consider as well the evident relish with which the President and other top administration officials regularly refuse to take " all options " off that proverbial " table " ( at which no one bothers to sit down to talk ) .
Throw into the mix semi-official threats , warnings , and hair - raising leaks from Israeli officials and intelligence types about Iran 's progress in producing a nuclear weapon and what Israel might do about it .
Then there were those recent reports on a " major " Israeli " military exercise " in the Mediterranean that seemed to prefigure a future air assault on Iran .
( " Several American officials said the Israeli exercise appeared to be an effort to develop the military 's capacity to carry out long - range strikes and to demonstrate the seriousness with which Israel views Iran 's nuclear program . " )
From the other side of the American political aisle comes a language hardly less hair - raising , including Hillary Clinton 's infamous comment about how the U.S. could " totally obliterate " Iran ( in response to a hypothetical Iranian nuclear attack on Israel ) .
Congressman Ron Paul recently reported that fellow representatives " have openly voiced support for a pre-emptive nuclear strike " on Iran , while the resolution soon to come before the House ( H.J. Res. 362 ) , supported by Democrats as well as Republicans , urges the imposition of the kind of sanctions and a naval blockade on Iran that would be tantamount to a declaration of war .
Stir in a string of new military bases the U.S. has been building within miles of the Iranian border , the repeated crescendos of U.S. military charges about Iranian - supplied weapons killing American soldiers in Iraq , and the revelation by Seymour Hersh , our premier investigative reporter , that , late last year , the Bush administration launched -- with the support of the Democratic leadership in Congress -- a $ 400 million covert program " designed to destabilize [ Iran 's ] religious leadership , " including cross - border activities by U.S. Special Operations Forces and a low - level war of terror through surrogates in regions where Baluchi and Ahwazi Arab minorities are strongest .
( Precedents for this terror campaign include previous CIA - run campaigns in Afghanistan in the 1980s , using car bombs and even camel bombs against the Russians , and in Iraq in the 1990s , using car bombs and other explosives in an attempt to destabilize Saddam Hussein 's regime . )
Add to this combustible mix the unwillingness of the Iranians to suspend their nuclear enrichment activities , even for a matter of weeks , while negotiating with the Europeans over their nuclear program .
Throw in as well various threats from Iranian officials in response to the possibility of a U.S. or Israeli attack on their nuclear facilities , and any number of other alarums , semi-official predictions ( " A senior defense official told ABC News there is an ' increasing likelihood ' that Israel will carry out such an attack " ) , reports , rumors , and warnings -- and it's hardly surprising that the political Internet has been filled with alarming ( as well as alarmist ) pieces claiming that an assault on Iran may be imminent .
Seymour Hersh , who certainly has his ear to the ground in Washington , has publicly suggested that an Obama victory might be the signal for the Bush administration to launch an air campaign against that country .
As Jim Lobe of Inter Press Service has pointed out , there have been a number of " public warnings by U.S. hawks close to Cheney 's office that either the Israelis or the U.S. would attack Iran between the November elections and the inaugural of a new president in January 2009 . "
Given the Bush administration 's " preventive war " doctrine which has opened the way for the launching of wars without significant notice or obvious provocation , and the penchant of its officials to ignore reality , all of this should frighten anyone .
In fact , it 's not only war critics who are increasingly edgy .
In recent months , jumpy ( and greedy ) commodity traders , betting on a future war , have boosted these fears .
( Every bit of potential bad news relating to Iran only seems to push the price of a barrel of oil further into the stratosphere . )
And mainstream pundits and journalists are increasingly joining them .
No wonder .
It 's a remarkably frightening scenario , and , if there 's one lesson this administration has taught us these last years , it 's that nothing 's " off the table , " not for officials who , only a few years ago , believed themselves capable of creating their own reality and imposing it on the planet .
An " unnamed Administration official " -- generally assumed to be Karl Rove -- famously put it this way to journalist Ron Suskind back in October 2004 :
" [ He ] said that guys like me were ' in what we call the reality - based community , ' which he defined as people who ' believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . '
I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism .
He cut me off .
' That 's not the way the world really works anymore , ' he continued .
' We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality .
And while you 're studying that reality -- judiciously , as you will -- we 'll act again , creating other new realities , which you can study too , and that 's how things will sort out .
We 're history 's actors .... and you , all of you , will be left to just study what we do . ' "
A Future Global Oil Shock
Nonetheless , sometimes -- as in Iraq -- reality has a way of biting back , no matter how mad or how powerful the imperial dreamer .
So , let 's consider reality for a moment .
When it comes to Iran , reality means oil and natural gas .
These days , any twitch of trouble , or potential trouble , affecting the petroleum market , no matter how minor -- from Mexico to Nigeria -- forces the price of oil another bump higher .
Possessing the world 's second largest reserves of oil and natural gas , Iran is no speed bump on the energy map .
The National Security Network , a group of national security experts , estimates that the Bush administration 's policy of bluster , threat , and intermittent low - level actions against Iran has already added a premium of $ 30 - $ 40 to every $ 140 barrel of oil .
Then there was the one - day $ 11 spike after Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz suggested that an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities was " unavoidable . "
Given that , let 's imagine , for a moment , what almost any version of an air assault -- Israeli , American , or a combination of the two -- would be likely to do to the price of oil .
When asked recently by Brian Williams on NBC Nightly News about the effects of an Israeli attack on Iran , correspondent Richard Engel responded : " I asked an oil analyst that very question .
He said , ' The price of a barrel of oil ?
Name your price : $ 300 , $ 400 a barrel . ' "
Former CIA official Robert Baer suggested in Time Magazine that such an attack would translate into $ 12 gas at the pump .
( " One oil speculator told me that oil would hit $ 200 a barrel within minutes . " )
Those kinds of price leaps could take place in the panic that preceded any Iranian response .
But , of course , the Iranians , no matter how badly hit , would be certain to respond -- by themselves and through proxies in the region in a myriad of possible ways .
Iranian officials have regularly been threatening all sorts of hell should they be attacked , including " blitzkrieg tactics " in the region .
Oil Minister Gholam Hossein Nozari typically swore that his country would " react fiercely , and nobody can imagine what would be the reaction of Iran . "
The head of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , Mohammed Jafari , said : " Iran 's response to any military action will make the invaders regret their decision and action . "
( " Mr. Jafari had already warned that if attacked , Iran would launch a barrage of missiles at Israel and close the Strait of Hormuz , the outlet for oil tankers leaving the Persian Gulf . " )
Ali Shirazi , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's representative to the Revolutionary Guards , offered the following : " The first bullet fired by America at Iran will be followed by Iran burning down its vital interests around the globe . "
Let 's take a moment to imagine just what some of the responses to any air assault might be .
The list of possibilities is nearly endless and many of them would be hard even for the planet 's preeminent military power to prevent .
They might include , as a start , the mining of the Strait of Hormuz , through which a significant portion of the world 's oil passes , as well as other disruptions of shipping in the region .
( Do n't even think about what would happen to insurance rates for oil tankers ! )
In addition , American troops on their mega - bases in Iraq , rather than being a powerful force in any attack -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki has already cautioned President Bush that Iraqi territory cannot be used to attack Iran -- would instantly become so many hostages to Iranian actions , including the possible targeting of those bases by missiles .
Similarly , U.S. supply lines for those troops , running from Kuwait past the southern oil port of Basra might well become hostages of a different sort , given the outrage that , in Shiite regions of Iraq , would surely follow an attack .
Those lines would assumedly not be impossible to disrupt .
Imagine , as well , what possible disruptions of the modest Iraqi oil supply might mean in the chaos of the moment , with Iranian oil already off the market .
Then consider what the targeting of even small numbers of Iranian missiles on the Saudi and Kuwaiti oil fields could do to global oil markets .
( It might not even matter whether they actually hit anything . )
And that , of course , just scratches the surface of the range of retaliatory possibilities available to Iranian leaders .
Looked at another way , Iran is a weak regional power ( which has n't invaded another country in living memory ) that nonetheless retains a remarkable capacity to inflict grievous harm locally , regionally , and globally .
Such a scenario would result in a global oil shock of almost inconceivable proportions .
For any American who believes that he or she is experiencing " pain at the pump " right now , just wait until you experience what a true global oil shock would involve .
And that 's without even taking into consideration what spreading chaos in the oil heartlands of the planet might mean , or what might happen if Hezbollah or Hamas took action of any sort against Israel , and Israel responded .
Mohamed ElBaradei , the sober - minded head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , considering the situation , said the following : " A military strike , in my opinion , would be worse than anything possible .
It would turn the region into a fireball ... "
This , then , is the baseline for any discussion of an attack on Iran .
This is reality , and it has to be daunting for an administration that already finds itself militarily stretched to the limit , unable even to find the reinforcements it wants to send into Afghanistan .
Can Israel Attack Iran ?
Let 's leave to the experts the question of whether Israel could actually launch an effective air strike against Iranian nuclear facilities on its own -- about which there are grave doubts .
And let 's instead try to imagine what it would mean for Israel to launch such an assault ( egged on by the Vice President 's faction in the U.S. government ) in the last months , or even weeks , of the second term of an especially lame lame - duck President and an historically unpopular administration .
From Iran 's foreign minister , we already know that the Iranians would treat an Israeli attack as if it were an American one , whether or not American planes were involved -- and little wonder .
For one thing , Israeli planes heading for Iran would undoubtedly have to cross Iraqi air space , at present controlled by the United States , not the nearly air - force - less Maliki government .
( In fact , in Status of Forces Agreement negotiations with the Iraqis , the Bush administration has demanded that the U.S. retain control of that air space , up to 29,000 feet , after December 31 , 2008 , when the U.N. mandate runs out . )
In other words , on the eve of the arrival of a new American administration , Israel , a small , vulnerable Middle Eastern state deeply reliant on its American alliance , would find itself responsible for starting an American war ( associated with a Vice President of unparalleled unpopularity ) and for a global oil shock of staggering proportions , if not a global great depression .
It would also be the proximate cause for a regional " fireball . "
( Oil - poor Israel would undoubtedly also be economically wounded by its own strike . )
In addition , the latest American National Intelligence Estimate on Iran concluded that the Iranians stopped weaponizing parts of their nuclear program back in 2003 , and American intelligence reputedly doubts recent Israeli warnings that Iran is on the verge of a bomb .
Of course , Israel itself has an estimated -- though unannounced -- nuclear force of about 200 such weapons .
Simply put , it is next to inconceivable that the present riven Israeli government would be politically capable of launching such an attack on Iran on its own , or even in combination with only a faction , no matter how important , in the U.S. government .
And such a point is more or less taken for granted by many Israelis ( and Iranians ) .
Without a full - scale " green light " from the Bush administration , launching such an attack could be tantamount to long - term political suicide .
Only in conjunction with an American attack would an Israeli attack ( rash to the point of madness even then ) be likely .
So let 's turn to the Bush administration and consider what might be called the Hersh scenario .
Will the Bush administration Attack Iran If Obama Is Elected ?
The first problem is a simple one .
Oil , which was at $ 146 a barrel last week , dropped to $ 136 ( in part because of a statement by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad dismissing " the possibility that war with the United States and Israel was imminent " ) , and , on Wednesday rose a dollar to $ 137 in reaction to Iranian missile tests .
But , whatever its immediate zigs and zags , the overall pattern of the price of oil seems clear enough .
Some suggest that , by the time of any Obama victory , a barrel of crude oil will be at $ 170 .
The chairman of the giant Russian oil monopoly Gazprom recently predicted that it would hit $ 250 within 18 months -- and that 's without an attack on Iran .
For those eager to launch a reasonably no-pain campaign against Iran , the moment is already long gone .
Every leap in the price of oil only emphasizes the pain to come .
In turn , that means , with every passing day , it 's madder -- and harder -- to launch such an attack .
There is already significant opposition within the administration ; the American people , feeling pain , are unprepared for and , as polls indicate , massively unwilling to sanction such an attack .
There can be no question that the Bush legacy , such as it is , would be secured in infamy forever and a day .
Now , consider recent administration actions on North Korea .
Facing a " reality " that first - term Bush officials would have abjured , the President and his advisors not only negotiated with that nuclearized Axis of Evil nation , but are now removing it from the Trading with the Enemy Act list and the State Sponsor of Terrorism list .
No matter what steps Kim Jong
Il 's regime has taken , including blowing up the cooling tower at the Yongbyon reactor , this is nothing short of a stunning reversal for this administration .
An angry John Bolton , standing in for the Cheney faction , compared what happened to a " police truce with the Mafia . "
And Vice President Cheney 's anger over the decision -- and the policy -- was visible and widely reported .
It 's possible , of course , that Cheney and associates are simply holding their fire for what they care most about , but here 's another question that needs to be considered : Does George W. Bush actually support his imperial Vice President in the manner he once did ?
There 's no way to know , but Bush has always been a more important figure in the administration than many critics like to imagine .
The North Korean decision indicates that Cheney may not have a free hand from the President on Iran policy either .
The Adults in the Room
And what about the opposition ?
I 'm not talking about those of us out here who would oppose such a strike .
I mean within the world of Bush 's Washington .
Forget the Democrats .
They hardly count and , as Hersh has pointed out , their leadership already signed off on that $ 400 million covert destabilization campaign .
I mean the adults in the room , who have been in short supply indeed these last years in the Bush administration , specifically Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen .
( Condoleezza Rice evidently falls into this camp as well , although she 's proven herself something of a President - enabling nonentity over the years . )
With former Carter National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski , Gates tellingly co-chaired a task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations back in 2004 which called for negotiations with Iran .
He arrived at the Pentagon early in 2007 as an envoy from the world of George H.W. Bush and as a man on a mission .
He was there to staunch the madness and begin the clean up in the imperial Augean stables .
In his Congressional confirmation hearings , he was absolutely clear : any attack on Iran would be a " very last resort . "
Sometimes , in the bureaucratic world of Washington , a single " very " can tell you what you need to know .
Until then , administration officials had been referring to an attack on Iran simply as a " last resort . "
He also offered a bloodcurdling scenario for what the aftermath of such an American attack might be like :
" It 's always awkward to talk about hypotheticals in this case .
But I think that while Iran cannot attack us directly militarily , I think that their capacity to potentially close off the Persian Gulf to all exports of oil , their potential to unleash a significant wave of terror both in the -- well , in the Middle East and in Europe and even here in this country is very real Their ability to get Hezbollah to further destabilize Lebanon I think is very real .
So I think that while their ability to retaliate against us in a conventional military way is quite limited , they have the capacity to do all of the things , and perhaps more , that I just described . "
And perhaps more
That puts it in a nutshell .
Hersh , in his most recent piece on the administration 's covert program in Iran , reports the following :
" A Democratic senator told me that , late last year , in an off - the - record lunch meeting , Secretary of Defense Gates met with the Democratic caucus in the Senate .
( Such meetings are held regularly . )
Gates warned of the consequences if the Bush Administration staged a preemptive strike on Iran , saying , as the senator recalled , ' We 'll create generations of jihadists , and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in America . '
Gates 's comments stunned the Democrats at the lunch . "
In other words , back in 2007 , early and late , our new secretary of defense managed to sound remarkably like one of those Iranian officials issuing warnings .
Gates , who has a long history as a skilled Washington in - fighter , has once again proven that skill .
So far , he seems to have outmaneuvered the Cheney faction .
The March " resignation " of CENTCOM commander Admiral William J. Fallon , outspokenly against an administration strike on Iran , sent both a shiver of fear through war critics and a new set of attack scenarios coursing through the political Internet , as well as into the world of the mainstream media .
As reporter Jim Lobe points out at his invaluable Lobelog blog , however , Admiral Mike Mullen , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Gates 's man in the Pentagon , has proven nothing short of adamant when it comes to the inadvisabilty of attacking Iran .
His recent public statements have actually been stronger than Fallon 's ( and the position he fills is obviously more crucial than CENTCOM commander ) .
Lobe comments that , at a July 2nd press conference at the Pentagon , Mullen " repeatedly made clear that he opposes an attack on Iran -- whether by Israel or his own forces -- and , moreover , favors dialogue with Tehran , without the normal White House nuclear preconditions . "
Mullen , being an adult , has noticed the obvious .
As columnist Jay Bookman of the Atlanta Constitution put the matter recently : " A U.S. attack on Iran 's nuclear installations would create trouble that we are n't equipped to handle easily , not with ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Adm . Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , drove that point home in a press conference last week at the Pentagon . "
The Weight of Reality
Here 's the point :
Yes , there is a powerful faction in this administration , headed by the Vice President , which has , it seems , saved its last rounds of ammunition for a strike against Iran .
The question , of course , is :
Are they still capable of creating " their own reality " and imposing it , however briefly , on the planet ?
Every tick upwards in the price of oil says no .
Every day that passes makes an attack on Iran harder to pull off .
On this subject , panic may be everywhere in the world of the political Internet , and even in the mainstream , but it 's important not to make the mistake of overestimating these political actors or underestimating the forces arrayed against them .
It 's a reasonable proposition today -- as it was n't perhaps a year ago -- that , whatever their desires , they will not , in the end , be able to launch an attack on Iran ; that , even where there 's a will , there may not be a way .
They would have to act , after all , against the unfettered opposition of the American people ; against leading military commanders who , even if obliged to follow a direct order from the President , have other ways to make their wills known ; against key figures in the administration ; and , above all , against reality which bears down on them with a weight that is already staggering -- and still growing .
And yet , of course , for the maddest gamblers and dystopian dreamers in our history , never say never .

Two female NYPD cops did some serious damage to a Bronx man early Friday night , allegedly pistol whipping him during a road rage incident .
Michelle Anglin , 37 , and Koleen Robinson , 24 , were off - duty when they became enraged at 35 - year - old Marlon Smith for leaving the driver ’s door of his Suburban open , almost scraping Robinson 's SUV , the Daily News reports .
F bombs and A bombs were promptly fired at Smith by the cops .
When he responded with his own profanity , the policewomen approached his vehicle and Anglin allegedly blasted him with pepper spray .
A witness who tried to break up the brawl reportedly heard the women yell , " Do you know who you are f------ with ?
We are the police ! "
Apparently , Smith did n’t get the message fast enough , and tried to grab one of the cops , who retaliated with baton cracks to the skull and a pistol - whip to the face .
The rumble was n’t broken up until some uniformed officers arrived and arrested Anglin and Robinson ; they were suspended , stripped of their guns and arraigned Sunday on gang assault charges .
Smith is recovering from the incident with 25 staples holding together the three gashes in his skull .
He tells the Post , " I 'm not feeling so well right now , " with headeaches and blurred vision .
Smith also claims that Internal Affairs warned him “ to keep his mouth shut . ”
Maybe he should just be grateful that beat cops have n’t ( yet ) been issued submachine guns like in Jersey .
And Robinson ’s father defended her daughter to the tabloid , " She enjoyed police work as far as I know . "

The Environmental Working Group has shone light on what may be a falsely presumed protection from sunscreen .
The simple rule of sunscreen — the higher the SPF and the thicker the slather , the better — has come under doubt .
The Environmental Working Group ( EWG ) , a Washington - based research group and habitual gadfly to the business world , has found that 4 out of 5 of the nearly 1,000 sunscreen lotions analyzed offer inadequate protection from the sun or contain harmful chemicals .
The biggest offenders , the EWG said , are the industry leaders : Coppertone , Banana Boat and Neutrogena .
While 3 out of 3 industry leaders are rather upset with the EWG report , and while some dermatologists criticize it for hyperbole , the report does underscore several long - standing health concerns :
Sunscreens do not offer blanket protection from the sun and do little to prevent the most deadly form of skin cancer ; reliance on them instead of , say , a hat and protective clothing , might be contributing to skin cancer ; and the Food and Drug Administration has yet to issue any safety standards , mysteriously sitting on a set of recommendations drafted 30 years ago .
Subcutaneous homesick blues
Sunlight contains ultraviolet radiation , largely in two forms : UVA and UVB .
Aside from sunburn , UVB exposure causes the most common forms of skin cancer — basal cell carcinoma , which is rarely deadly and mostly only disfiguring , and squamous cell carcinoma , which can turn deadly about 1 percent of the time .
UVA penetrates the skin more deeply and causes wrinkling .
Recent research , however , has found that UVA exacerbates the carcinogenic effects of UVB and might cause skin cancer itself .
Most sunscreens block only UVB .
And the SPF system , short for Sun Protection Factor , refers only to UVB .
SPF provides an estimate of a lotion 's level of sunburn protection .
If you start burning in about 30 minutes , then SPF 15 will allow you to stay in the sun 15 times longer before getting burned , in theory .
SPF of 1 zillion
Total UV protection is within reach and has been used for millennia .
It 's called clothing .
Unfortunately this is n't so convenient when summertime fun calls for minimal clothing .
The EWG report takes an ax to the loose SPF claims .
Almost all sunscreen lotions contain chemicals that , perhaps counter - intuitively , breakdown in the presence of sunlight .
But in fact this is how they block UVB from penetrating the skin , like a castle wall protecting against cannonballs until the wall crumbles .
Notions of all - day protection , as some sunscreen products claim , or even several hours of protection are ludicrous , the EWG said , because most sunscreens start deteriorating in as quickly as 15 minutes .
This does n't even account for sweat and casual rubbing , further reducing protection .
Also , few sun-worshipers use the recommended shot - glass - amount of lotion with each application .
We merely think we are protected ; few really are .
Controversy , not just skin deep
The EWG also trashed any lotion containing harmful chemicals that can easily penetrate the skin .
Oxybenzone , which blocks UVA , is a main offender .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found oxybenzone in the urine of just about everyone tested .
This chemical can promote DNA damage in the presence of sunlight .
Oxybenzone and similar cancer - causing chemicals in sunscreens contribute to the minority view that sunscreens actually cause more and deadlier cancers than they prevent .
Several small studies have found an increased risk of malignant melanoma , by far the deadliest form of skin cancer , among regular users of sunscreens .
Many zinc - based protects appear to be safe , according to the EWG .
Until the FDA breaks its silence and offers some guidance , there 's the EWG list of recommendations at http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/special/sunscreens2008.

Engineering teams are conducting final checkouts of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , known as LCROSS , that will take a significant step forward in the search for water on the moon .
The mission 's main objective is to confirm the presence or absence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater near a lunar polar region .
A major milestone , thermal vacuum testing of the LCROSS spacecraft , was completed June 5 at the Northrop Grumman facility in Redondo Beach , Calif .
To simulate the harsh conditions of space , technicians subjected the spacecraft to 13.5 days of heating and cooling cycles during which temperatures reached as high as 230 degrees Fahrenheit and as low as minus 40 degrees .
Previous testing for the LCROSS spacecraft included acoustic vibration tests .
Those tests simulated launch conditions and checked mating of connection points to the Atlas V rocket 's Centaur upper stage and the adapter ring for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , known as LRO .
The satellite currently is undergoing final checkout tests .
After all tests are complete , the LCROSS spacecraft will be prepared for delivery to NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida for launch processing and integration onto the Atlas V as a secondary payload to LRO .
Both spacecraft are scheduled to launch from Kennedy in late 2008 .
" The spacecraft steadily has taken shape since Ames delivered the science payload in January , " said Daniel Andrews , LCROSS project manager at NASA 's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field , Calif .
" It is a testament to the hard work , perseverance and expertise of the NASA and Northrop Grumman teams that the spacecraft has completed these critical tests ahead of schedule . "
After launch , the LCROSS spacecraft and the Atlas V's Centaur upper stage rocket will execute a fly - by of the moon and enter into an elongated Earth orbit to position the satellite for impact on a lunar pole .
On final approach , the spacecraft and the Centaur will separate .
The Centaur will strike the surface of the moon , creating a debris plume that will rise above the surface .
Four minutes later , LCROSS will fly through the debris plume , collecting and relaying data back to Earth before impacting the lunar surface and creating a second debris plume .
Scientists will observe both impacts from Earth to gather additional information .
LCROSS is a fast - paced , low - cost mission that is leveraging existing NASA systems , commercial - off - the - shelf components and the spacecraft design and development expertise of integration partner Northrop Grumman Space Technologies .
The LCROSS and LRO missions are components of the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center , Huntsville , Ala .
The program manages pathfinding robotic missions to the moon for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington .

71 % of Children Killed by One Parent are Killed by Their Mothers ; 60 % of Victims are Boys By Mark B. Rosenthal In 1994 , Susan Smith 's murder of her sons Michael and Alex made national headlines for months .
A couple of factors explain why the Susan Smith case received such high - profile coverage .
One factor was Smith 's overt racism .
Smith initially made up a story about having been carjacked by an African - American man in order to explain the disappearance of her sons .
The media , all too ready to believe her horror story , had made it front page news all over the country .
Having covered the story of the " carjacking " and the boys ' disappearance for 9 days , the media could n't easily drop the story when it was discovered that Smith had actually strapped her three - year old and one - year old sons into their carseats and then driven her car into a lake to drown them .
Furthermore , when it came out that Smith 's reason for killing the boys was because she dreamed of marrying a wealthy man who had told her he had no interest in " ready - made " family , the resulting revulsion by the general public helped sell newspapers and increase media ratings .
But when a mother murders her children , it 's rare for the news media to react with such high - profile coverage .
It 's far more common for the press to do high - profile news stories on murdering fathers like Manuel Gehring , who in 2003 killed his children and buried them off an interstate in Ohio , or Mark Castillo , who in 2008 drowned his children in a Baltimore hotel room bathtub before attempting to take his own life .
TV shows and movies likewise hardly ever tell stories of abusive mothers or mothers who kill their children , leaving the viewing public with the misimpression that fathers are a far greater danger to their children than mothers .
TV shows and movies are also far more likely to portray girls as victims of maltreatment than boys .
However data from the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) tells a completely opposite story regarding who abuses children .
The DHHS publishes an annual report called " Child Maltreatment " , and each year 's report contains a table detailing the parental status of the perpetrator (s ) .
Shown below is an analysis of data drawn from the " Child abuse and neglect " and the " Child fatality " tables from each of the DHHS ' " Child Maltreatment " reports between 2001 and 2006 .
The DHHS calculates the percentages of perpetrators in various categories such as Mother , Father , Foster Parent , Daycare Staff , Friend or Neighbor , etc .
The percentages are often used to argue whether , on average , it is fathers or mothers that pose a greater risk of harm to their children .
But when trying to determine which parent , on average poses the greater danger , categories like Foster Parent , Daycare Staff , Friend or Neighbor , etc. are entirely irrelevant .
The calculations below factor out those categories to produce a more accurate picture .
The resulting calculations show the percentage of child abuse and deaths caused by one parent acting either alone or in concert with someone other than the child 's other parent .
The DHHS data shows that of children abused by one parent between 2001 and 2006 , 70.6 % were abused by their mothers , whereas only 29.4 % were abused by their fathers .
And of children who died at the hands of one parent between 2001 and 2006 , 70.8 % were killed by their mothers , whereas only 29.2 % were killed by their fathers .
Furthermore , contrary to media portrayals that leave the viewer with the impression that only girls are ever harmed , boys constituted fully 60 % of child fatalities .
( Table 4 - 3 , p. 71 , Child Maltreatment 2006 , http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/cm06/cm06.pdf, reports that 675 boys died in 2006 as compared to 454 girls ) .
The pervasive media bias cannot help but influence judges .
Thus the newspapers , TV shows , and movies that promote this bias must bear a significant part of the responsibility for child abuse and deaths of children at the hands of violent mothers .

Journey 3D , FX Artists of Former Meteor Studios seeking $ 1 Million in Back Pay
[ i] JOURNEY 3D - Unpaid , Digital FX artists seek back pay of $ 1 million from Discovery Communications and Evergreen Films [ / i ]
For Immediate Release HOLLYWOOD , Calif. / EWORLDWIRE/July 9 , 2008 --- When Journey To The Center Of The Earth Movie 3D , the blockbuster and ground - breaking 3 - D stereoscopic film starring Brendan Fraser , is released Friday , July 11 , a group of digital effects artists from former Meteor Studios who worked on the film will continue a half - year later to wonder where their paychecks are .
According to David Rand , special effects artists worked for Meteor Studios , a company established by Discovery Communications of Virginia ( Discovery ) ( owners of the Discovery Channel ) and Evergreen Films of Pacific Palisades ( Evergreen ) .
During October , November and December of 2007 , artists worked without pay ; some put in 100 - hour weeks and stayed loyal to the project with the promise of pay as soon as the accounting glitch was fixed .
Most of the artists who applied their talents to the creation of the film have families , and half are American freelance artists like Rand , whose hope for a bright Christmas was extinguished when all artists were laid off without pay in December upon delivery of the film .
Over $ 1 million is due from Discovery Communications of Virginia and Evergreen Films of Pacific Palisades .
Dave Rand's is particularly vocal about , what he calls an injustice , because accordding to Rand , he was asked to keep his crew working without pay .
" A million dollars is not money - money is what you take to the supermarket to buy some bananas .
A million dollars is power , and it shows a company 's true character .
Being a family - oriented network , Meteor , Discovery and Evergreen should be ashamed of themselves . "
Discovery and Evergreen initiated bankruptcy proceedings for the studio , formerly known as Meteor Studios of Montreal , leaving artists without jobs or back pay .
The action extended damage to other studios with less than deep pockets ; Canadian banks refused lines of credit or stopped existing ones .
Rand says many artists had to leave Canada and seek work in other countries .
Rand also reports a new company has been formed at the former Meteor Studios ' location named , " Lumiere VFX , " and that former Meteor Studios ' artists have reported being offered back pay to come on board at Lumiere .
He has discovered many of the same management team are in place or have become partners in the new studio , and Rand states that several artists have commented on work to be done for the former owners , Discovery or Evergreen .
" Although there are claims that Meteor 's payroll was insured , " said Rand , " this action - of hiring - may be interpreted by the insurance company as a reason not to pay .
The payroll insurance company is believed to be fighting the claim . "
The Meteor Studios ' artists have up to this point contacted : .
The Governor General of Canada responded six months later with a form letter that did not answer any of the questions asked . .
The Labor Board of Canada has been unable to get any results to date and cannot help foreign artists who worked on the film .
Statements have been made indicating that causing trouble for American companies is not in Canada 's best interest . .
Brendan Fraser .
Speaking with his manager 's office has not produced a response from Brendan .
Rand suggests that examining the timeline of the FX industry reveals that FX artists are going through the same problems the rest of talent in the industry experienced decades ago .
" This action ( by Discovery and Evergreen ) should receive the attention of the small animators unions and will hopefully see its ranks grow as it provides a perfect example for them , " stated Rand .
While viewers might imagine Journey 3D without Fraser , " you can not imagine it without FX .
We are very important to the product - all top - grossing films now contain extensive effects work .
However , we usually end up at the bottom of the credit list , if at all .
Meteor studios did extensive work on the film 300 , and not one of the artists received a credit .
Now , not getting paid seems to have become the practice , " added Rand .
Rand said one young writer with the Canadian Press reported on the story last week ( [ http://moncinema.cyberpresse.ca/nouvelles-et-critiques/nouvelles/nouvelle-cinema/4699-iVoyage-au-centre-de-la-Terre-3Di-coute-cher-aux-artisans-quebecois.html](http://moncinema.cyberpresse.ca/nouvelles-et-critiques/nouvelles/nouvelle-cinema/4699-iVoyage-au-centre-de-la-Terre-3Di-coute-cher-aux-artisans-quebecois.html)).
" We think this is news .
Unlike the recent writers ' strike where writers were looking for more money on the back - end , we just want to get paid for the work we performed .
We have been looking for a writer with influence who has not lost the nerve to write for change to this valuable part of the film and television industry .
" We want the public to buy tickets and see the film because we are extremely proud of the FX work done on the film .
It is a wonderful film exhibiting a new technology , " concluded Rand .

FORKS OF SALMON , Calif . —
The price of gas is n’t an annoyance here .
It ’s a calamity .
Peggy Hanley uses a generator that burns a gallon of diesel fuel every hour — at about $ 5 a gallon — to power Forks General Store , the only place to buy groceries for miles around .
There ’s no electric service , so Hanley , the owner , uses the generator to run eight refrigerators , nine freezers , lights and two ice machines for the store , which has been in a trailer since a fire destroyed the original building in 1994 .
There are no utilities and no public transportation in this unincorporated town of a couple hundred people along a narrow road that winds through the mountains 314 miles north of Sacramento .
Many people here buy gas for their vehicles and gas or diesel for generators that power their homes .

Hollywood goes with what works and , let 's face it , there are a few things audiences like to see again and again in their movies .

Why They Do It :
Deep down , we 're all scared of change and , by extension , technology .
In the '40s and '50s , the boogie man was atomic energy -- in those old monster movies , it was always some kind of atomic accident that started it all .
By the ' 80s , Hollywood needed something shiny and new for people to fear .
And low and behold , there were these newfangled things called computers showing up everywhere , and most people were made nervous by the way the inanimate boxes seemed to be able to outsmart them .
Starting wars on a rudimentary home computer is both fun and EASY !
Writers played off that fear , telling audiences that as computers get faster and stranger , it is only a matter of time before one of these things pulls an Asimov and becomes self - aware .
And when they do ... watch out .

So What 's the Problem ?
Keep in mind , none of these cautionary movies are based on real dangers .
They 're not talking about the difficulties in adapting the labor market to sudden improvements in automation , or the challenges of educating children who know computers better than you .
Mainly because that film would be approximately as exciting as watching sloths fuck .
The original plot for The Matrix .
No , to drum up the fear , they 've always had to invent a danger : " With a few keystrokes a team of hackers can blow up your house !
Once computers get smart enough , they 'll become sentient and start hating us !
Robots will eventually cause the extinction of mankind ! "
And so on .

The whole idea is to play off people 's ignorance on the subject .
And people give them a lot to work with .
Will They Ever Stop ?
It wo n't be long before the entire theater will be full of people who were raised with computers , and wo n't be all that scared of them .
But that 's OK -- all that 'll change is screenwriters will find new targets .
Soon you 'll have less talk of a robot apocalypse , and more talk of a nanotechnology apocalypse , or a worldwide disaster caused by genetic engineering .
As long as it's new and weird and unfamiliar , Hollywood scriptwriters will figure out a way to make it bring about the end of the world .

WASHINGTON --
The Senate overwhelmingly approved a measure to expand government spy powers , ending nearly two years of sometimes bitter clashes on Capitol Hill .
But the controversy will continue on the campaign trail .
Democratic Sen. Barack Obama , who voted for the bill , is taking hits from liberals in his own party , as well as from his opponent , Republican Sen. John McCain .
Four ...
Hillary 's List of Lies
The USA Today / Gallup survey clearly explains why Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) is losing .
Asked whether the candidates were " honest and trustworthy , " Sen .
John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) won with 67 percent , with Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) right behind him at 63 .
Hillary scored only 44 percent , the lowest rating for any candidate for any attribute in the poll .
Hillary simply cannot tell the truth .
Here 's her scorecard :
Admitted Lies
• Chelsea was jogging around the Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
( She was in bed watching it on TV . )
• Hillary was named after Sir Edmund Hillary .
( She admitted she was wrong .
He climbed Mt. Everest five years after her birth . )
• She was under sniper fire in Bosnia .
( A girl presented her with flowers at the foot of the ramp . )
• She learned in The Wall Street Journal how to make a killing in the futures market .
( It did n't cover the market back then . )
Whoppers She Won't Confess To
• She did n't know about the FALN pardons .
• She did n't know that her brothers were being paid to get pardons that Clinton granted .
• Taking the White House gifts was a clerical error .
• She did n't know that her staff would fire the travel office staff after she told them to do so .
• She did n't know that the Peter Paul fundraiser in Hollywood in 2000 cost $ 700,000 more than she reported it had .
• She opposed NAFTA at the time .
• She was instrumental in the Irish peace process .
• She urged Bill to intervene in Rwanda .
• She played a role in the '90s economic recovery .
• The billing records showed up on their own .
• She thought Bill was innocent when the Monica scandal broke .
• She was always a Yankees fan .
• She had nothing to do with the New Square Hasidic pardons ( after they voted for her 1,400 - 12 and she attended a meeting at the White House about the pardons ) .
• She negotiated for the release of refugees in Macedonia ( who were released the day before she got there ) .
With a record like that , is it any wonder that we suspect her of being less than honest and straightforward ?
Why has McCain jumped out to a nine - point lead over Obama and a seven - point lead over Hillary in the latest Rasmussen poll ?
OK , Obama has had the Rev. Wright mess on his hands .
And Hillary has come in for her share of negatives , like the Richardson endorsement of Obama and the denouement of her latest lie -- that she endured sniper fire during a trip to Bosnia .
But why has McCain gained so much in so short a period of time ?
Most polls had the general election tied two weeks ago .
McCain 's virtues require a contrast in order to stand out .
His strength , integrity , solidity and dependability all are essentially passive virtues , which shine only by contrast with others .
Now that Obama and Hillary are offering images that are much weaker , less honest , and less solid and dependable , good old John McCain looks that much better as he tours Iraq and Israel while the Democrats rip one another apart .
It took Nixon for us to appreciate Jimmy Carter 's simple honesty .
It took Clinton and Monica for us to value George W. Bush 's personal character .
And it takes the unseemly battle among the Democrats for us to give John McCain his due .
When Obama faces McCain in the general election ( not if but when ) the legacy of the Wright scandal will not be to question Obama 's patriotism or love of America .
It will be to ask if he has the right stuff ( pardon the pun ) .
The largest gap between McCain and Obama in the most recent USA Today / Gallup Poll was on the trait of leadership .
Asked if each man was a " strong , decisive leader , " 69 percent felt that the description fit McCain while only 56 percent thought it would apply to Obama .
( 61 percent said it of Hillary . )
Obama has looked weak handling the Rev. Wright controversy .
His labored explanation of why he attacks the sin but loves the sinner comes across as elegant but , at the same time , feeble .
Obama 's reluctance to trade punches with his opponents makes us wonder if he could trade them with bin Laden or Ahmadinejad .
We have no doubt that McCain would gladly come to blows and would represent us well , but about Obama we are not so sure .
The FCC , acting with unusual speed , has taken the regulatory lash to Verizon .
Last year , the company launched a " retention program " designed to keep customers who were thinking about switching from Verizon landline service to phone service from Comcast , Time Warner , or Bright House .
Those customers were then contacted and offered " discounts and American Express reward cards " to stay with Verizon .
That does n't sound so bad , except that Verizon contacted customers only after a phone number transfer request was in process from the new phone company .
As FCC Republican commissioner Robert McDowell put it for the majority ( PDF ) , " Today 's action underscores long - held Commission policy that using proprietary customer information for marketing efforts cannot take place during the window of time when a customer 's phone number is being switched . "
You do n't really want to
leave Verizon , do you ?
When customers attempt to switch a phone number , a complex industry - crafted process goes on behind the scenes .
As part of that process , Verizon gets tipped off that one of its customers is about to jump ship .
It contacts them , offers incentives , and tries to convince them to stay on — none of which it could have done without the notification .
The FCC notes that such retention marketing would have been fine if done before the customer tried to switch ; " win back " programs after a switch would have been acceptable , too .
But doing it in the middle of the process , using proprietary information provided to Verizon only for the purpose of smoothly switching carriers , crossed the line .
Unlike some important FCC decisions , today 's was a 4 - 1 that did n't break down along party lines .
Chairman Kevin Martin found himself the odd man out .
" Customer retention marketing is a form of aggressive competition that has the potential to benefit consumers through lower prices and expanded service offerings , " he said in a statement .
" Moreover , the cable companies engage in such practices to keep their video customers from switching to other providers .
I am therefore disappointed that the Commission would prohibit these practices , which promote competition and benefit consumers and particularly disappointed that they would do so and prohibit practices from only one class of companies . "
That statement , going as it does against the other four commissioners , wo n't do much to help Martin overcome the widespread perception in tech policy circles that he routinely favors the telephone companies .
Commissioner Michael Copps , a Democrat , characterized the decision differently ( PDF ) .
" There is nothing pro-consumer about allowing Verizon to wait until a customer decides to terminate service before making the company 's best and final offer , " he said .
" After today 's ruling , Verizon will have additional incentive to focus on making sure that all its customers are happy with their service , rather than reserving the red carpet treatment for those who have already decided to leave but whose transfer has not yet been technically implemented . "
The complaint , filed earlier this year by the cable operators , orders Verizon to halt the specific retention program in question .

Just because I always were curious about these chairs .
Always loved them and thought they were an artsy - deco-migration of the plain old childhood swing .

Italian architect David Fisher is building his first skyscraper , the Dynamic Tower , and it happens to be one of the most ambitious construction plans since the Pyramid of Khufu .
Every floor of the 80 - story self - powered building rotates according to voice command , and nearly the entire structure of the $ 700 million building is pre-fabbed .
I caught up with the architect in New York , and he blew my mind again and again .
Advertisement
Fisher was inspired to design the Dynamic Tower during a visit to a friend 's top - floor Midtown Manhattan apartment .
" I had a view of the Hudson River and East River at the same time , it was beautiful and I wanted to make that feeling accessible to more people . "
He loves the idea of seeing the sun rise and set in the same room , and considers the building to be four - dimensional .
" Time is always changing the shape of the building , " he told me .

The rotation takes up to 3 hours ( so you 're not always spilling your coffee ) , and gets power from photovoltaic solar cells and 79 wind turbines , one located between each floor .
The system is meant to create enough energy to power to the entire tower and still have juice to spare for some surrounding buildings .
According to Fisher , two of these $ 700 million futuristic scrapers are planned so far , one each in Dubai and Moscow .
They will be built using a truly radical technique .
Advertisement
Construction on the Dynamic Tower will be unlike anything that preceded it .
The only part of the tower built on site will be the skinny center core .
It is strong enough to hold the floors in place , and will contain the building 's elevators , which transport people and cars right to their door .
Each floor will be made piece by piece in a factory in Italy — a throwback to Fisher 's previous life in prefabricated bathroom design — and placed onto the core using a lift system .
With this method , each story is completed in about six days .
By comparison , traditional ground - up methods can take six weeks per floor .
Groundbreaking for Dynamic Towers in Dubai and Moscow is expected to happen in the fall , with construction reaching completion by the end of 2010 .
If you 're game — and very , very loaded — you can sign up now for a villa or office space .
The going rate is $ 3000 / sq foot .

Undeterred , Kucinich to introduce another impeachment article Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Resolution to be read by Clerk of House Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) will formally introduce another article of impeachment against President Bush Tuesday as House leaders indicate they 're willing to convene a hearing to consider the Ohio Democrat 's arguments .
Kucinich will move for a vote on a privileged resolution Tuesday , which likely will result in the impeachment article being referred to the Judiciary Committee .
The lawmaker warned he would keep coming back with the resolution if the House voted to dismiss it .
The House Clerk will read the resolution into the record Tuesday before the vote by the full House .
" If it is tabled , I will bring another impeachment resolution back this week , " said Kucinich .
" Our Constitution is being destroyed .
We are losing our nation to a war based on lies .
I am determined to get this bill to committee for a hearing , " he said .
" The President has conducted the affairs of the nation in a manner which cries out for justice and it is the Constitutional obligation of Congress to check his wanton abuses of U.S. and international law .
We have troops whose lives were put on the line because the President told them Iraq was a threat to the United States and it was not .
The loss of lives of our troops and of innocent Iraqi civilians is a direct result of the lies this president told to Congress .
He must be held accountable . "
Earlier this week , Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said he would let Kucinich discuss his arguments for impeachment during a hearing later this summer , but he indicated the committee likely would not act on impeachment .
 We re not doing impeachment , but he can talk about it ,  the chairman said .
The Article of Impeachment alleges that President Bush falsely told the nation that it had no other choice to go to war because Iraq was an imminent threat in possession of weapons of mass destruction , and that the President had repeatedly implied that Iraq had abetted al Qaeda in its devastating attack of 9/11 .
Kucinich , in his Article , cited documents which assert the White House knew the statements were false at the time they were made .
One of the areas which seem to have produced quite a few ideas this year is the future of HR , supporting the broader future of wor ...

Barack Obama is getting plenty of flak for not acknowledging that he was wrong about the " surge , " i.e. the wisdom of escalating a war we should never have started in the first place  and this is being compared to John McCain ’s stubborn refusal to admit that we need to get out ( although it appears McCain is n’t against timetables anymore ) .
In any case , the whole question of the " surge " is really just another one of those exercises in irrelevance that the American media use to fill the vast void of the cable news universe .
As Obama points out , anyone could have predicted that the sudden infusion of large numbers of American troops would reduce violence , albeit temporarily .
So where does that leave us ?
Well , as Antiwar.com reported yesterday ( Monday ) : " 87 Iraqis Killed , 288 Wounded . "
Okay , so that was an unusual day , in which four suicide bombers  all of them , interestingly enough , female  took the opportunity to strike at majority Shi’ite targets , and one Kurdish site in the northern city of Kirkuk .
Yet if you examine the pattern of the ongoing conflict  as painstakingly compiled and written up by the invaluable Margaret Griffis  large - scale explosions of violence are n’t all that rare .
Indeed , they occur with clock - like regularity , usually a week or two after relative quiet in which the daily toll amounts to two or three Iraqis killed and / or wounded .
Yes , but you have to admit  avers my imaginary interlocutor , the skeptical reader  that the situation on the ground has gotten better .
Well , no , I do n’t admit any such thing , because one has to ask : better than what ?
Better than before the war ?
Surely not  and that ’s the only standard that has real meaning to the Iraqis .
More than anything , they want a return to normalcy  and a low - level civil war punctuated by eruptions of shocking violence is anything but normal .
Alright then , my skeptical reader persists , but face facts : the level of violence has been reduced from the bloody chaos of last year .
There is no civil war , the Sadrists have retreated , and it ’s all because of the surge .
It ’s the surge - ists who have to face the fact that ethnic and religious violence in Iraq fluctuates like a flame feeding on underground gases : at times it burns low , and at other times it flares up , but is never quite extinguished .
The earth , it seems , has an inexhaustible supply of vapors to ignite these mystic beacons , and Iraq ’s sectarian ferment  like Lebanon ’s  is similar : perpetually simmering and always threatening to boil over .
The flame is burning low , at the moment , perhaps because the various sectarian groupings have each been driven into their own corners : once mixed neighborhoods of Baghdad , for example , are now exclusively Shi’ite , while , in the Sunni triangle , nary a Shi’ite dares raise his or her head .
This marks a lull before the storm , not an endpoint .
The sectarian passions unleashed by the fall of the Ba’athist regime are akin to those that bedevil the former Soviet Union in their intractability : US intervention has exacerbated rather than calmed the troubled waters , and rising tensions between the US and Iran have brought them to the surface .
If and when the US leaves Iraq , the American legacy wo n’t be " democracy , " or " liberation "  it will be the so - called Awakening of the Sunni tribes and clans succored by American arms and aid .
These groupings are a ticking time bomb that will explode soon after the American presence is reduced significantly , a booby - trap set by the " liberators " to explode in the faces of the " liberated . "
The whole aim of the surge has been obscured by the apparent stalling of the rush to confront Tehran , for that was its real purpose , and the real aim of the war itself , which was more war  this time with Iran .
I say apparent stalling because a slowdown is not a breakdown , and it makes good sense for the War Party to lay low at this point .
Not that they ’re keeping quiet  far from it  but the Bush administration , for its part , is making noises about negotiations , just like they did in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
Why , we ’ve even announced that we ’re re-establishing the American embassy in Tehran .
Peace seems to be breaking out all over  and yet , not so fast .
To begin with , the situation remains very precarious , with hundreds of possible flashpoints of conflict along Iran ’s border with Iraq , and an ongoing destabilization campaign carried out by Washington and several covertly - funded terrorist groups , mostly Kurds ( Pejak ) and al Qaeda - like groupings in the wilder eastern section of the country .
Secondly , think how easy it would be for a " rogue " group of " extremists " to take over the newly - established American embassy in Tehran , for example : we ’d be in for a replay of the Iranian hostage crisis .
Or how about a replay of the more recent capture of that British Navy patrol , only this time with Americans held captive and paraded before the television cameras ?
In short , it would take very little for the War Party to reassert its position of dominance and reprise its all - too - familiar narrative of " war before dishonor . "
John McCain would jump on this so quickly that it would make the Obama ’s head spin  and how , pray tell , would the Hopeful One respond ?
This is one of those " hypotheticals " that Obama tends to shy away from , but it is n’t hard to imagine he would n’t be talking about negotiating with the Iranian leadership .
I have to say , at this point , that the War Party is n’t above engineering just such a provocation : the phrase " War Party " is short - hand for a variegated bunch , including US neoconservatives , the arms industry , Joe Lieberman , and at least one foreign nation  Israel .
The Israelis have been urging Washington to attack Iran for months , if not years , and anyone who thinks they would n’t dare undertake a false flag operation does n’t know the story of the Lavon Affair .
The conquest and occupation of Iraq was never about oil , just as it was never about " liberation , " " democracy , " or any of the other rhetorical flourishes so beloved by the President ’s speechwriters .
It was and is an attempt to establish a forward base from which to launch further attacks on Muslim nations in the Middle East and Central Asia  and so it remains .
Obama , who is no dummy , never brings this up , because his position on Iran is deliberately vague , and a sore point with his backers and handlers : his antiwar base naturally opposes war with Iran , but his campaign  and , seemingly , he himself  is ambivalent .
On the one hand , Obama wants to negotiate directly with the Iranians  a bold proposal in Washington , which Pat Buchanan accurately describes as " Israeli - occupied territory . "
On the other hand he keeps talking about " big sticks " and how we ca n’t rule anything out .
Iran , he intones , is " the greatest strategic challenge to the United States in the region in a generation . "
Gee , what happened to the threat from al Qaeda , which supposedly has taken over half of Pakistan , at least if we take what Obama and his surrogates say at face value ?
Remember that , according to Obama , the invasion of Iraq diverted us away from the real threat , embodied by bin Laden and his followers : how come they are n’t " the greatest challenge to the United States in the region in a generation " ?
As always , the question of war and peace  of whether we are going to launch an attack on the biggest , most powerful country in the Middle East on Israel ’s behalf  is going to be decided , not by conditions on the ground , but by political considerations on the home front .
If neither major presidential candidate is opposed to the War Party ’s ultimate aims and purposes , and if the American people have no say and no voice in determining the foreign policy of this country  that is , if things continue as they have been going  then peace is not anywhere on the horizon , and the surge surges forward all the way to Tehran .
Let ’s face it , iPhone interfaces are awesome , but they can only cater to a fraction of the mobile market .
What are you to do if you want to satisfy the rest of the mobile world ?
Mobile
Fu helps to make this job much easier by automatically detecting mobile devices that access your Rails application .
People can access your site from a Palm , Blackberry , iPhone , Nokia , etc. and it will automatically adjust the format of the request from : html to : mobile .
Learn Mobile Fu
First off , just install the Mobile Fu plugin into your Rails application .
script / plugin install git://github.com/brendanlim/mobile-fu.git 1 script / plugin install git : //github.com/brendanlim/mobile-fu.git
Start by adding this one line to your ApplicationController .
class ApplicationController < ActionController :: Base has_mobile_fu end 1 class ApplicationController & lt ; ActionController :: Base has_mobile_fu end
Once this is in place , any request that comes from a mobile device will be be set as : mobile format .
It is up to you to determine how you want to handle these requests by creating the .mobile.erb versions of your views that are to be requested .
Also , I recommend that you setup a before_filter that will redirect to a specific page depending on whether or not it is a mobile request .
How can you check this ?
is_mobile_device ?
# =>
Returns true or false depending on the device 1 is_mobile_device ?
# =>
Returns true or false depending on the device
You can also determine which format is currently set in by calling the method below .
in_mobile_view ?
# =>
Returns true or false depending on current req. format 1 in_mobile_view ?
# =>
Returns true or false depending on current req .
format
If you want the ability to allow a user to switch between ˜ mobile ’ and ˜ standard ’ format ( : html ) , you can just adjust the mobile_view session variable in a custom controller action .
session [ : mobile_view ] # =>
Set to true if request format is : mobile and false if set to : html 1 session [ : mobile_view ] # =>
Set to true if request format is : mobile and false if set to : html
What About Custom Mobile Styling ?
Different devices need different styling .
Do n’t worry though , we ’ve got this baked in to Mobile Fu ( thanks to Intridea ’s own Michael Bleigh , who created Browserized Styles for letting me modify his code ) .
If you are including a css or sass file via stylesheet_link_tag , all you have to do is add _device to the name of one of your files to override your styling for a certain device .
The stylesheet that is loaded is dependant on which device is making the request .
Supported stylesheet override device extensions at the moment are : blackberry , iphone , mobileexplorer , nokia , palm
e.g. , Accessing a page from a Blackberry .
Ends up loading mobile.css , and mobile_blackberry.css if the file exists .
1 e . g . , Accessing a page from a Blackberry .
Ends up loading mobile .
css , and mobile_blackberry .
css if the file exists .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - British folk singer Yusuf Islam , formerly Cat Stevens , accepted libel damages and an apology on Friday from a news agency that reported he had refused to talk to women at an awards ceremony who were not wearing a veil .
The artist , who changed his name after becoming a Muslim in the late 1970s , will donate the “ substantial ” payout to Small Kindness , a U.N. - linked charity he chairs .
Adam Tudor , the singer ’s attorney , told London ’s High Court that the story behind the legal action was published by World Entertainment News Network and was used on Contactmusic.com , a website said to have 2.2 million page views a month .
The article appeared in March last year and suggested that the singer was “ so sexist and bigoted that he refused at an awards ceremony to speak to or even acknowledge any women who were not wearing a veil , ” Tudor said .
“ It went on to suggest that Mr. Islam ’s manager had stated ‘ Mr. Islam does n’t speak with women except his wife , least of all if they do n’t wear a headscarf .
Things like that only happen via an intermediary . ’ ”
Tudor said the article had embarrassed the singer , creating a false impression of his attitude to women and also casting serious aspersions on his religious faith .
World Entertainment News Network issued an apology , saying :
“ We now accept that these allegations ... are entirely without foundation , and that Mr. Islam has never had any difficulties working with women , whether for religious or for any other reason . ”
Islam , 59 , is still best known for his hits as Cat Stevens , including “ Wild World , ” “ Morning Has Broken ” and “ Moonshadow . ”
He sold an estimated 60 million albums as Stevens , but retired from showbusiness in 1978 after converting to Islam .
He released his first mainstream pop album since then in 2006 .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .

PRPG compatibility is n’t about keeping your core books .
One of the major problems with adoption of the new 4th Edition system is the fact that most , if not all , non -core books will be obsolesced by the new system .
As things currently stand , you can go buy the new three core books for 4E ( PHB , DMG , and MM , naturally ) and exactly one module .
That ’s it .
Considering the vast modifications to the system , expecting to get much rules - related use out of your 3.5 MM 2 - 4 , Expanded Psionics Handbook , and gameworld books is unrealistically optimistic at best .
Now consider the market involved .
New gamers will go to stores and buy new books .
New gamers will not just magically stumble across old copies of D&D 3.5 .
All the new blood goes to the new game books — which means 4E if we do n’t have something like Pathfinder as an alternative .
Of course , the rules in the 3.5 core books are distributed under the terms of the OGL , which means you can distribute them freely .
That ’s not quite good enough , though .
Gamers like having physical books , including gamers like me , so electronic distribution is n’t quite enough to support a significant fanbase .
Physical books , on the other hand , cost money to make .
Reprints of D&D 3.5 books do n’t make for much of a money - maker when 3.5 is “ obsolete ” .
On the other hand , D&D 3.6 , with improvements in some of the more flawed , complex systems of D&D 3.5 , might really catch on .
It ’s not just a retread : it ’s an update .
3.6 is , of course , Pathfinder .
The trick is to make it backward compatible .
If you ca n’t use the non -core books you already own with it , you ’re far less likely to get the new Pathfinder book .
Not only would you have to start rebuilding your collection of supplements all over again like you would with 4E , and not only would you have to wait until the additional books are actually published , but you would have the problem that Paizo ( or another publisher other than Wizards of the Coast ) probably wo n’t create the volume of supplementary books you already own if you already have a significant collection , nor is Paizo likely in the near future to build the kind of third - party publishing support that Wizards had .
Not only does Paizo need to attract people who already own a bunch of non-core books that they do n’t want to give up , but it needs its new Pathfinder update of D&D 3.5 to be compatible with those books so that there ’s a decent range of non-core books out there to support its new core book .
It does n’t get much easier than for customers to already own the books .
Better yet , with 4E out now , 3.5 books tend to be pretty cheap in a lot of places — so if you seek them out , non -core 3.5 books are really cheap .
News flash : Paizo is n’t doing this Pathfinder thing primarily to make money by selling a new game ( or , if it is doing it for that reason , it needs a refresher course in business sense ) .
It ’s creating and publishing this new Pathfinder RPG to maintain a user base for 3.5 compatible game modules and other materials Paizo publishes .
Some people complain that Pathfinder ’s Alpha releases are n’t really 3.5 compatible , though .
What they see is that the rules in Pathfinder differ from those in the core books .
What they ’re not seeing is that the rules are meant to be compatible — not identical .
In fact , the new Pathfinder book is in some respects meant to replace the core books .
They ’re meant to be compatible with everything other than the core books .
You have some choices :
You can just keep using your 3.5 core books , and watch the 3.5 gaming community die around you the way the 1st Edition , 2nd Edition , and 3.0 gaming communities have basically died off completely , then eventually move on to 4E — or not .
Maybe you ’ll stop playing .
Gaming groups are n’t eternal , though .
Campaigns end .
Eventually , something changes .
You can move on to 4E .
You might want to have a look at the books before you do so , though .
Depending on your tastes , you might not like what you see — especially if you ’re the type that thinks Pathfinder is n’t “ compatible ” enough .
On the other hand , maybe you really do prefer game systems like those in MMORPGs over game systems like , say , D&D ’s before 4E .
Whatever floats your boat , I guess .
You can give something like Pathfinder a shot , and realize that what Paizo is creating is an attempt to improve on the 3.5 system , to help you keep using your non-core books with a vibrant and growing gaming community rather than having to choose either replacing them all or sticking with a system whose gamer community is poised to start withering away .
You can give up .
I ’m okay with replacing three core books with a single new ( and improved ) core book , having Paizo and third - party new published materials available to me when I want new books , and keeping all my non -core books still relevant — rather than having to rebuild my D&D gamebook collection from scratch .
I ’m okay with having a strong and growing gamer community attached to my game of choice without having to use a system that , frankly , I do n’t much like ( such as 4E ) .
In general , I ’m okay with Paizo ’s definition of “ compatible ” .
I do n’t want things to stay the same just to have them stay the same .
I ’m not afraid of change — as long as the change is for the better .
Delving into a 3,000 - year - old mystery using astronomical clues in Homer ’s “ The Odyssey , ” researchers said Monday they have dated one of the most heralded events of Western literature : Odysseus ’ slaughter of his wife ’s suitors upon his return from the Trojan War .
According to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the wily hero who devised the Trojan Horse hefted his mighty bow on April 16 , 1178 BC , and executed the unruly crowd who had taken over his home and was trying to force his wife into marriage .
The finding leaves many perennial questions unanswered , such as whether the events portrayed actually occurred or whether the blind poet Homer was the author of the tale .
But it casts a new sheen of veracity on a story that has existed in a hazy realm of fantasy and history since it was first composed 400 years after the Trojan War .
Advertisement
“ They make a wonderfully persuasive case , ” said Scott Huler , author of a book about his efforts to follow Odysseus ’ journey .
“ I do find myself convinced that some of these events Homer described ” are based on actual history .
“ The Odyssey ” tells the story of the king ’s 10 - year journey home after the capture of Troy .
Odysseus spent seven of those years as a captive of the nymph Calypso , then was delayed another three by Poseidon , who was angered by the blinding of his son Cyclops .
When he finally arrived at Ithaca , he was angered to find 109 men urging his wife Penelope to accept that her husband was dead and marry one of them .
Spurred by Athena , Penelope declared an archery contest with Odysseus ’ bow , saying she would marry the winner .
Odysseus , in disguise , won the contest , then killed all of the suitors as well as a dozen maids who had slept with them .
Advertisement
The key passage in dating the tale is highly ambiguous .
As the suitors are sitting down for their noontime meal , the goddess Athena “ confounds their minds ” so that they start laughing uncontrollably and see their food spattered with blood .
Then the seer Theoclymenus prophesies their death and passage to Hades , ending with the phrase : “ The Sun has been obliterated from the sky , and an unlucky darkness invades the world . ”
The Greek historian Plutarch interpreted this as signifying a total solar eclipse , and many others have agreed .
But modern scholars tend to discount this interpretation , arguing that the passage is simply metaphorical .
Advertisement
Previous researchers have determined that a total solar eclipse occurred in the region over the Ionian Sea on April 16 , 1178 BC , which would be in agreement with recent data suggesting the fall of Troy around 1192 to 1184 BC .
To investigate , astronomer Marcelo O. Magnasco of Rockefeller University and Constantino Baikouzis of the Observatorio Astronomico de La Plata in Argentina read the text of “ The Odyssey ” carefully , looking for other astronomical clues .
They found three definitive events :
The day of the slaughter was a new moon -- a prerequisite for a solar eclipse .
Advertisement
Six days before the slaughter , Venus was visible and high in the sky .
Twenty - nine days before , the constellations Pleiades and Bootes were simultaneously visible at sunset .
They also identified a potential fourth event 33 days before the slaughter .
Homer wrote that Hermes , known to the Romans as Mercury , traveled far west to deliver a message and flew all the way back east again .
Magnasco and Baikouzis interpreted this to mean that Mercury was high at dawn and near the western edge of its trajectory .
Each of these astronomical events recurs at a different interval , so the precise sequence identified in their reading should be unique .
Advertisement
Using computer analysis , they searched for the sequence between 1250 and 1115 BC , roughly 75 years on either side of the putative date for the fall of Troy .
They found only one sequence , and it coincided with the eclipse of April 16 , 1178 BC .
Whether the events of “ The Odyssey ” occurred or not , the authors are interested , at least , in reopening the debate .
“ If we can get a few people to read ‘ The Odyssey ’ differently , to look at it and ponder whether there was an actual date inscribed in it , we are happy , ” Magnasco said .

A subscriber of Think Artificial wrote to ask me about games and AI .
In short , DF asked what my thougths are on AI in games and which ones I think are the most intelligent .
To answer this bluntly : Game AI is very different from it ’s non-game counterpart , and it ’s not my field of study .
I ’ve only compared modern games through a window .
However , Alex of AIGameDev has superb coverage of AI in games and the top AI games of 2007 , by community vote .
The top of the line are Half - Life - 2.ep. 2 and BioShock .
But regarding Game AI in general : modern games are horribly void of intelligence .
It depends on where you set the bar , certainly .
There ’s tons of AI in modern games compared to 5 years ago .
But the first thing to note is that Game AI is not the same as AI .
It ’s a subset of it .
Just like discrete mathematics are a subset of mathematics .
And moreover , Game AI is a very specialized subset — it has well defined goals , models for construction and limitations .
Games are governed by laws of commerce first , then innovation .
A game is governed by different laws than academic , general AI R&D .
It ’s a commercial product , and commercial products depend on older methods wherever possible — methods that have proven successful .
Most ( sane ) business men do not put all their money on a new and untried idea because they do n’t know if it will succeed .
So , most of commercial products are bulked up with a lot of things that ’ve been successful in the past and then leave a breadcrumb for innovation .
This is very different from academic AI research where the point is to do things that ’ve not been done before .
Now aside from these drastically different goals of commercial ventures and academic ones , a game ’s purpose is to entertain .
As long as the player is entertained it does n’t really matter what goes on under the hood .
Because of this , there ’s a certain witch hunt that takes place in the game industry :
A modern game developer is on a mission to slaughter innocent intelligent processes wherever possible .
A game AI developer tries as hard as he can ( usually at the bidding of a project manager ) to minimize intelligence .
One reason is that intelligent processes are massive processing - power hogs .
Thus , like an obese overeater the systems must forcibly give away every other meal to accommodate an average person ’s desktop PC — and those machines do n’t have much elbow - room to replicate the massive crimson jelly residing in the heads of animals .
Human or other .
And then there are graphics , another obese overeater , who also need a place at the table .
And because games are governed by the laws of commerce , Game AI must leave at least five chicken wings more than it ate itself for its obese , graphics rendering sibling .
Beautiful games get a lot of coverage and attention , and developing graphics is a question of engineering .
In a business plan it ’s therefore rational to emphasize graphics .
Both in terms of predicting the amount of effort required to implement it and the potential payoff .
Because of these severe limitations on how much processing power the intelligence is allowed , developers are forced to dumb - down the processing and make their AI appear intelligent instead .
To some it may not be clear what the difference is between making something appear intelligent and actually making it intelligent .
After all , there has to be some amount of intelligence if something ’s intended to keep its appearances .
Right ?
An intelligent system is expected to produce solutions to problems , uncertainty and often in complex situations .
Appearances , however , are concerned with making an observer believe they are intelligent .
To accomplish this in games the environment ( the input to the AI ) is kept controlled and limited .
For a vivid example of this :
NPCs in games do n’t use computer vision to perceive where the player is , instead they get fed ( X , Y , Z ) coordinates , giving the appearances of eyesight and visual processing capabilities .
The game designers tailor the environment and its limits to make sure that the intelligent processes can handle them , and vice versa .
It ’s the lifelike gatekeeper who does n’t need to know how to find his way home because he has no home .
It ’s the terrorist that can pull a trigger but could n’t count his fingers if you took his shotgun and held it to his head ( and you can ’t ) .
For a different and real - life example of appearances versus actual intelligence , to show how diversified the game AI “ trickery ” can get :
The developers of Halo 3 found a correlation between how smart the AI was and how tough it was .
If they made the NPCs smarter the game became tougher .
If they increased the health of the NPCs , making them tougher , the human players perceived them as more intelligent .
The first rule of AI in commerce is that you do n’t talk about AI in commerce
Like I ’ve stated in another post , the gaming industry is pretty much the only industry that dares market products using the term artificial intelligence .
The reason for that is complicated and I wo n’t talk about it from all perspectives .
But what I will tell you is that its partly due to people knowing what to expect from games .
The gaming industry builds from the sets of platform resources and devteam innovation .
These are sets that the consumers know .
It ’s the set that the elite gamer knows because he understands the nature of programs and what the required Hz ’s actually stand for .
And it ’s a set that the average gamer knows because he ’s fought space aliens so many times that he ’s learned what they ’re capable of .
With consumers that know what to expect , the term can be used without people boiling a can of hype .
In contrast , Academic AI builds with a set that appears to the consumer as one of infinite possibilities :
Because people do n’t know ( exactly ) how the mind works , they / we ca n’t evaluate how far we are from recreating it in machines .
It ’s unknown .
And because the average consumer can’t accurately evaluate the unknown , it does n’t matter if yesterday ’s AI was primitive ; most will still anticipate it advancing leap - years overnight .
Just like kids in the backseat of a car asking if it ’s : “ human now ?
it must be human now ? how about now ? “ .
Thus , when the term AI is used in areas where the limitations and previous products do n’t foretell the nature of the next , people start imagining Terminators all over again .
And then they get incredibly disappointed when they realize all the AI can do is answer questions about farm animals .
( And only when you begin a sentence with “ What is … ” ) .
That ’s obviously not a scenario a businessman would like to encounter , so it ’s best just to focus on something else when marketing , like Apple does when presenting its operating systems to the public .
In summary
Game AI is just one of many different subfields of AI and is governed heavily by the laws of commerce , entertainment value and modern desktop computing resources .
While it may seem it must intersect with other subfields , the truth is that its a somewhat isolated field with its own sets of tricks and tools .
( Mostly tricks . )
At times , games may also feel like they are the only commercial products successfully employing AI .
But this is largely because of too high consumer expectations to AI in other products , and the consequent fact that companies do n’t like mentioning that their product uses , what is by definition , artificial intelligence .
And finally , a difference between apparent intelligence and actual intelligence is that the latter figures out solutions to problems , while the former does n’t care about what happens under the hood as long as an observer thinks it ’s intelligent .
A lot of the times — that does n’t involve intelligence at all .

Link of the day - Who Is Shawn Casey ?
Is He For Real ?
According to salary information collected by new startup Glassdoor , Apple pays its engineers significantly less than competing companies in Silicon Valley .
Apple engineers make $ 89,000 a year , whereas Google engineers can buy four more Segways a year ( pre-tax ) with their $ 112,573 paycheck .
Microsoft and Yahoo are closer to Google : both companies pay their engineers $ 105,000 a year .
See TechCrunch ’s review of Glassdoor for the data .
I wondered how much of a difference this salary disparity made to Apple ’s bottom line , so I took a look at its annual 10 - K filings from 2003 to 2007 .
Each of these reports includes , buried among its 170 pages , Apple ’s net income and how much it spent on R&D .
For simplicity I assumed that the R&D budget was entirely spent on salaries ; this is n’t far off the mark in a hi-tech company like Apple .
If Apple were to pay its engineers the same salaries as Google then its R&D budget would increase by 26 % .
This amount ( 26 % of the R&D budget ) is how much Apple saves each year by paying below - market salaries .
I calculated what Apple ’s net income would have been if it had paid its engineers the same as Google , and these are the results :
Explanation :
All dollar values are in millions .
# Employees - from Apple ’s 10 -K .
R&D Budget - from Apple ’s 10 -K .
Adjusted R&D Budget - had Apple paid its engineers at the same level as Google , this would have been its R&D Budget .
Net Income - from Apple ’s 10 -K .
Adjusted Net Income - had Apple paid its engineers at the same level as Google , this would have been its Net Income .
Increase in Net Income - the magnitude by which Apple ’s net income was higher that year compared to what it would have been had it paid salaries at the same level as Google .
The Adjusted Net Income is a good estimate , but it ’s not completely accurate .
For example , the increase in Apple ’s R&D Budget would have meant that its expenses are higher , so it would have paid less taxes .
But the overall trend is clear .
Here ’s the Increase in Net Income in chart form :
In 2003 and 2004 , the effect of underpaying its engineers made a huge difference to Apple ’s bottom line .
In 2003 , these savings turned around Apple ’s year : from a loss to a small profit .
In 2004 , they doubled the profit .
However , once Apple ’s earnings began to skyrocket in 2005 , the effect of the R&D savings became much smaller : just 6 % of the net income in 2007 , for example .
Paying low salaries to its engineers was a lifesaver for Apple during its difficult times .
But now that Apple is immensely profitable there ’s no more excuse for this practice .
In the TechCrunch article mentioned previously , the site ’s owner Michael Arrington says : “ Apple software engineers make only about $ 89,000 , on average , but they get to create some of the most loved products on Earth . ”
I ’m sure this warms their hearts .
But an extra $ 20,000 a year would make their hearts downright toasty , and their spouses ’ as well .

GCC makes a suggestion
The build server CC ’d me on an ASBO email .
Good old GCC , grumbling about operator precedence again .
But Hey ! — at least it had a positive suggestion to make .
From : buildmaster@example.com
To : lem.e.tweakit@example.com
Cc : developers@example.com
Subject : Broken build
------------------------------------
Anti Social Build Order Version : svn://svnserver/trunk@999
Platform : Linux , GCC 4.0.1 Build Log : .... Warning : suggest parentheses around arithmetic in operand of ^
I looked at the code .
Here ’s a much simplified version which generates the same warning .
void unpack ( unsigned char const * bits , int n_bits , unsigned char * buf ) { unsigned char bit , byte , pos ; int b ; for ( b = 0 ; b != n_bits ; ++b ) { byte = bits [ b / 8 ] ; pos = 7 - ( b % 8 ) ; bit = byte & 2 ^ pos ; buf [ b ] = bit == 0 ? 0 : 255 ; } }
When compiling this function GCC warns about the line in bold type :
$ gcc - Wall - c unpack_bits.c unpack_bits.c :
In function `unpack ' : unpack_bits .c:12 : warning : suggest parentheses around arithmetic in operand of ^
Setting a precedent
Needless to say , the actual offending code was buried in a longer function , indented more deeply , and with a few more indirections — so it was indeed tempting to take GCC ’s advice and whack in a couple of brackets .
Clearly the author meant to write :
bit = byte & ( 2 ^pos ) ;
Why else omit spaces around the ^ ?
Fortunately I live by my own rule , to avoid unnecessary parentheses , so I was n’t about to add any here without asking why .
Worse than my stubborn principles , ^ , the exclusive or operator , has lower precedence than bitwise and , & , so to keep GCC happy and retain the original behaviour we ’d have to write :
bit = ( byte & 2 ) ^ pos ;
This last expression looks very bizarre .
Had it ever been exercised ?
GCC was right , the code was wrong , but its diagnostic showed the wrong way to right things .
On this occasion GCC should have been proscriptive , not prescriptive , and left the fix in the hands of the programmer [ 1 ] .
Do n’t mix bits and arithmetic
0000 0000 5589 e58 b 5508 89d0 d1e8 2555 5555 5529 c289 d0c1 e802 2533 3333 3381 e233 3333 3301 d089 c2c1 ea04 01d0 250f 0f0 f 0f89 c2c1 ea08 01d0 25 ff 00ff 0089 c2c1 ea10 01d0 25 ff ff00 005d c300 0000 5555 5555 3333 3333 0f0f 0f0f ff00 ff00
My personal rule of thumb is to avoid mixing bitwise and arithmetic operations .
Although integral types support both kinds of operation , it generally feels like a type - mismatch to combine them in a single expression .
An array of bits is n’t the same as a number , and vice - versa .
Of course there are some treasured bit - twiddling tricks which exploit the mapping between binary arithmetic and machine level register operations .
So we can , for example , calculate 2 raised to the power of 19 with a simple left - shift , 1 << 19 , or test if v is a power of 2 with !( v & ( v - 1 ) ) && v .
I ’m not suggesting we blacklist these ingenious hacks — in fact , anyone off to an interview for a programming job with an embedded systems company might do well to study them — but I would say their use requires thorough documentation .
On occasion , then , bitwise operations may legitimately be used for fast arithmetic ; but using arithmetic to pack bits is rarely necessary .
This line of code is probably wrong [ 2 ] :
r = h << 4 + 1 ;
The programmer probably intended the ( bitwise ) shift to happen before the ( arithmetic ) addition , like this .
r = ( h << 4 ) + 1 ;
If we stick to bitwise operations , things become clear .
I ’ve written the 1 in hexadecimal as a hint it ’s being used as a bit pattern — sadly there ’s no way of writing a binary literal directly in C .
r = h << 4 | 0x1 ;
Anyway , the problem line in unpack ( ) adheres to my rule of thumb : & and ^ are indeed both bitwise operations .
But after some puzzling I realised the author of the code intended 2 ^pos to mean 2 to the power of pos , not for its arithmetic value , but for its bit pattern — which , as every programmer knows , is a 1 followed by pos 0 s .
That is , a 1 left shifted pos times .
Here ’s what I thought the fix should be .
Note , incidentally , that I ’ve used ~0 rather than 255 , because it clearly says “ set every bit ” .
I ’m also using unsigned integers throughout — always a good idea when working with bits .
Some programmers might prefer to parenthesise the expression byte & 1 << pos , but I prefer the form shown : it ’s easy enough to remember that & groups with the logical operators and << with the ( higher precedence ) arithmetic ones .
void unpack ( unsigned char const * bits , unsigned n_bits , unsigned char * buf ) { unsigned char bit , byte ; unsigned b , pos ; for ( b = 0 ; b != n_bits ; ++b ) { byte = bits [ b / 8 ] ; pos = 7 - b % 8 ; bit = byte & 1 << pos ; buf [ b ] = bit == 0 ? 0 : ~0 ; } }
Despite the absence of documentation , this is now at least a coherent function .
It ’s a “ biterator ” which steps through a collection of bits ( packed into bytes , the smallest memory units C offers ) .
Each time it encounters a set / clear bit , it sets / clears all the bits in the next byte in the output buffer .
That is , it expands each bit value to fill a whole byte .
This is exactly the kind of function which is surprisingly fiddly to write but simple to unit test .
As already mentioned , though , the function did n’t actually exist in the form shown , and the tests were all at the module level .
The responsible way for me to proceed was to create a module test which exposed the defect , then make my candidate fix , confirm it did indeed fix the defect , then check the change in .
Unit Test
Here ’s how simple a unit test for unpack ( ) could be .
It may be longer than the function it ’s testing , but it ’s less complex .
And with just a couple of test cases , it manages to cover several interesting corners of the functionality .
Better still , it passes [ 3 ] !
void test_unpack ( ) { //
Start with a varied bit - pattern .
//
Ensure each byte differs from its reversed self .
unsigned char const bits [ 2 ] = { 1 << 7 | 1 << 5 | 1 << 4 | 1 << 0 , // 10110001 binary 1 << 6 | 1 << 5 | 1 << 3 | 1 << 0 , // 01101001 binary } ; //
The expected output expands bits to bytes ( 0 => 0 , 1 => ~0 ) unsigned char expected [ 2 * 8 ] = { ~0 , 0 , ~0 , ~0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ~0 , 0 , ~0 , ~0 , 0 , ~0 , 0 , 0 , ~0 } ; unsigned char buf [ 3 * 8 ] = { 0 } ; unsigned char buf_copy [ 3 * 8 ] = { 0 } ; size_t const buf_size = sizeof ( buf ) ; //
Fill the buffer with a pattern of 1s and 0s. //
Unpack nothing and check nothing changes .
memset ( buf , 0xa5 , buf_size ) ; memcpy ( buf_copy , buf , buf_size ) ; unpack ( bits , 0 , buf ) ; assert ( memcmp ( buf , buf_copy , buf_size ) == 0 ) ; // Unpack some of the bits and check the results .
//
Also check the remainder of the buffer is undamaged .
unpack ( bits , 13 , buf ) ; assert ( memcmp ( buf , expected , 13 ) == 0 ) ; assert ( memcmp ( buf + 13 , buf_copy + 13 , buf_size - 13 ) == 0 ) ; }
This is white - box testing : the test knows enough about the implementation of unpack ( ) to expose potential problems .
In this case , there ’s something unusual about the way the pos counter goes down as the bit counter b goes up , so we make sure that the bits we ’re unpacking form asymmetric patterns .

Should we extract this tested unpack ( ) function from its surrounding , larger , more complex function ?
Is it safe to do so ?
Have we time to spend making changes with no externally visible results ?
Should we tweak unpack ( ) for efficiency ( after all , it does n’t need to use the division and modulus operators each time round the loop ) ?
These are important questions .
eXtreme Programmers refactor mercilessly , confident their extensive test frameworks will provide a safety net .
Java programmers select the code block in their IDE then click the “ extract method ” button .
C and C++ programmers have less advanced tools , but Michael Feathers ’ “ Working Effectively with Legacy Code ” offers practical advice on how to transform code safely — that is , how to put it under test .
In the real world , we judge each case on merit .
A nag email from the build server should n’t trigger mass refactoring , even if the test infrastructure is in place .
I think Feathers is right though , that poorly tested code is on its way to becoming legacy code : hard to adapt , unpleasant to work with , and a drag on continuing development .
Lessons
This new story repeats the same old lessons , and I think they bear repeating :
Set up a build server .
Listen to it .
Compile on multiple platforms .
Think !
Compilers are concerned with syntax , not semantics .
A C compiler reads your code in order to rewrite it for the machine ’s benefit ; understanding the code is your job .
Write small functions .
Unit test them .
Integers and bit arrays are different .
Take care when using bitwise operations as arithmetic shortcuts .
Avoid using arithmetic for bit packing .
Oh , and in C , do n’t mistake ^ for exponentiation !
This article was originally published in CVu , a print journal for ACCU members , and I would like to thank all at CVu for their help with it .
I ’m not complaining about GCC which did an outstanding job of flagging a genuine problem in perfectly well - defined and valid code .
The other compiler frequently used on this project , MSVC V8.0 , compiles this cleanly , at the same time warning standard C string functions are unsafe and deprecated !
I ’ve taken this example directly from Andrew Koenig ’s “ C Traps and Pitfalls ” .
This is a nice little book which expands on the ideas presented in a paper of the same name [ PDF ] .
One thing I recommend , though , is to temporarily reverse the logic in the assertions and check they then fail .
Unit test frameworks often provide hooks to do this reversed - result test , which confirms the test cases are actually being run .
Yesterday morning I listened to a segment on the Brian Lehrer show about street harassment ( cat- calling ) in NYC .
Lehrer interviewed three women : Latosha Belton and Ashley Lewis , two Brooklyn teenagers who worked with Girls for Gender Equity to create “ Sisters in Strength Strikes Back : Our Struggle with Street Harassment , ” a city - wide summit this past May ; and Maggie Hadleigh - West , maker of the anti-street - harassment film War Zone .
The three women talked about their extensive experiences with street harassment directed at them from men of all ages .
Ashley Lewis described how she feels like her new way of responding to street harassers is better than staying silent :
The approach I ’m taking now , I feel like it ’s better ’ cause I ’ll ask a man something , “ Do you really think it ’s appropriate to come at me in the street ? ”
And they ’re so taken aback by the question that they ’re stunned , they do n’t know what to say .
So instead of answering it , they kind of walk away from me , so it kind of helps .
Hearing that , I could n’t help worry that the girls would encounter some men who would do far more and far worse than run away .
Maggie Hadleigh - West described some of those more violent responses when discussing how she came to make her film :
… I realized that I actually had a weapon that I could turn on the men exactly in the same way that they were harassing me …
I would turn the camera on the men , and I would ask them , ‘ Why are you looking at my breasts ?
Why did you just say what you said to me ? ’… I got an abundance of responses .
Sometimes men were angry , a number of times men tried to hit me , sometimes they ran away from me , sometimes – very , very rarely , in fact twice out of about a thousand interviews , they were apologetic .
Brian Lehrer commented on Maggie ’s turning the camera on the men , saying “ It ’s really funny because they were invading your space , and what you did was turn around and invade their space . ”
Maggie responded by making an important point : “ Right – but they ’re accustomed to the privilege of being able to do that without there being any consequences whatsoever . ”
The phone lines were opened to callers , both women who experience street harassment and men who perpetrate it .
The caller was Shane from Queens , who attempted to justify his cat - calling : “ Just acknowledging a woman that , how do I say this , she wore something that she was obviously looking for attention for , so I said , ‘ Ok , you look nice . ’
What ’s wrong with that ? ”
Comments like that make it clear that this sort of street harassment is just another point on the continuum of violence against women ; this guy ’s b.s. sounds a lot like the “ she was dressed like a slut , she was asking for it ” type of justification that ’s so often given for rape and sexual assault .
Even if it ’s admitted that the rapist ’s actions were wrong , blame can also be directed towards the victim if she was wearing or acting in any way that could be labeled as “ provocative ” or “ sexual ” in the least .
Of course , the women were well - prepared for that sort of garbage rationale , probably having heard it before .
Latosha put it quite well when she said , “ The main flag that flew up in my mind was when he said she ’s obviously looking for attention .
We are not mind readers , nor are we psychics .
You have no idea whether or not she was looking for the attention , or maybe it ’s just a hot day , and I feel comfortable in shorts .
It is n’t up to you to decide whether or not she wants you to talk to you . ”
Shane was still on the line , so Brian asked him if he felt differently after hearing the women ’s comments .
The unrepentant jerk ’s response ?
“ No , not at all . ”
Clearly , I overestimate the ability of some guys to understand what sexist assholes they are , because I was flabbergasted that he was so convinced utterly of his correctness .
Brian then asked Shane , ” So if you see a beautiful woman walking down the street , an unbelievably hot , sexy woman walking down the street , but not in what you would call provocative clothes , then you wo n’t do it ? ”
Shane replied , “ No , not at all .
She ’s not looking for that kind of attention . ”
This comment makes evident the fact that Shane ’s not just a well - meaning but misguided appreciator of female beauty ; he ’s only “ complimenting ” women who he decides are “ asking for it , ” who are easiest for him to sexually objectify .
His stupidity continued : “ You can go into certain neighborhoods and see high shorts or lots of cleavage , and that ’s a sign of , okay , that person wants to be complimented . ”
Well , damn .
“ Certain neighborhoods ? ”
How much do you want to bet that there was a whole lot of racism and classism going on there ?
After that guy got off the line , Maggie responded to some more to what he ’d said .
She talked about how about how she thinks that all people want to be acknowledged for their attractiveness but that “ that does not mean that we want our space to be invaded at all , or that we are dressing for that particular man . ”
That part got me thinking about the strongly heterosexual framing of this and many other conversations about street harassment .
Maybe some women are n’t dressing for any man at all ?
Maybe some women are dressing for other women , or – gasp – just for themselves ?
These discussions rarely include queer voices or even the possibility that some women are n’t looking for any sexual attention from men , be it respectful or not .
Since I ’ve started to present as a genderqueer butch – keeping my hair cut quite short , dressing only in “ men ’s ” clothing , that sort of thing – I ’ve still gotten some street harassment .
Not nearly as much as my more femininely - presenting queer friends and lovers , but some .
I ’m always a little bit baffled by it , to tell the truth .
I always assume that guys will look at me and assume that I ’m off limits because I ’m fairly easy to read as queer .
( Since , you know , some people can’t fathom that a masculine , queer , female - bodied person could possibly be into guys . )
Some guys will try to talk to me specifically about my gender presentation ; I ’ve gotten a whole lot of “ I like short hair !
I like women with short hair !
I do n’t mind ! ”
Oh yeah , thanks , random - ass dude , I was really worried that you might mind !
Really , though , I think that cat - calling is n’t just about thinking a woman looks good or being sexually attracted to her .
I think a possibly larger motivation is simply to assert control and dominance over women , to display a man ’s sense of privilege to do whatever the hell he wants to a woman that Maggie spoke of in her interview .
Yeah , sometimes maybe it ’s genuine and very mis-expressed attraction , but I do n’t think that most guys really expect to attract a woman with their cat - calling .
It ’s about the power trip , the ability to say some fucked - up thing to a woman and get a response , any response , be it positive or negative .
Sometimes , when I ’m getting harassed in that way , I think that the guys definitely assume that I ’m queer and not interested in them , but they do it anyway just to demonstrate that , however I dress , however I define and express my gender and my sexuality , I ’m still just a woman to them ; I ’m still below them ; they can still fuck with me and , ultimately , they think they could still fuck me , if they wanted to .
That knowledge is probably what makes me feel so disrespected , sickened and violated on those rare occasions that I do attract street harassment .
It does n’t really matter if I just stay quiet , speed away , or yell back – I always feel pretty shitty and enraged afterwards .
And then I always think – how do visually feminine women , who get way more of this than me , deal ?
How do femmes and other feminine queer women handle that on the daily ?
I ’d like to hear from all folks on this topic , but I ’d especially like to hear what other queer , genderqueer , and trans folks who experience this sort of street harassment think .
How do you deal ?

... bluenorway said on 5/2/2008 @ 6:59 am PT ...
Mark Krotoski : I must strongly advise your department and CCIPS review thoroughly the
international law on human and intellectual rights .
Moreso , 100 % of
your " press releases " from USDOJ have been severely inaccurate and
erroneous and do not accurately reflect the case presented .
Your
public documentation is intentionally misleading , fraudulent , and
makes lead for your departments to make illegitimate profit on false
criminal persecution of intellectual rights when illegitimately
intermixed with criminal prosecutions .
In the latest case , your press release does not properly distinguish
the diverse categories related to non-intellectual media ( games ,
music , non-educational video ) from the UN protected intellectual
rights of humanity in regard to what your press release phrases as
" utility software " .
Your presentation is blatantly flawed , the court
data has not been presented accurately , and your ( criminal ) attempts
to include intellectual and human rights material distribution
( without profit ? ) in the same proceedings as distribution of mass
media is explicitly illegal by international law .
One should note that the International courts and bodies have made
public their discontent with the profiteering of the Connecticut and
California " organized crime " entities known as the US DOJ District
attorneys .
In the last obvious case , the prosecuting and investigating
authorities from CT - New Haven and Hartford were immediately promoted
to head of department on the basis of their fraudulent and
unsubstantiated claims .
Your salaries and their bonus raises are
correlaries to and more criminal than the cases in which they have
entrapped , framed , and illegitimately charged children with crimes
that were never physically instantiated .
My primary concern is your inconsistent public presentations across
the USDOJ proceedings , continued support of organized crime syndicates
like mass media , and blatant disregard for international laws and
policy on the non-suppression of medical , intellectual , and human
rights content ( such as that which facilitates operation of a physical
device or infrastructure ) in the context of " software " or " machine
code compilations " which does not include adequately valid copyright
on artistic productions or personalized media .
Please forward these concerns to all branches of your criminal
institution .
Your conduct when facilitating systemic organized crime
in the American commerce system must be remedied ; a pursuit of
financial crimes ( sales of media ) , unsubstantiated distribution of
mass media content , unrelated physical or asset gains ( free car for
software distribution where the car is unrelated ) , and related true
crimes must be enforced legitimately , however your combination of
unrelated and non-criminal proceedings on the basis of casual
relationship with an activity of concern MUST BE CORRECTED AND
PUBLICLY ADDRESSED .
I will suggest a comprehensive rewrite of your fraudulent and
misleading public presentations , thoroughly policy review and prior
case re-assessment , and a thorough audit of invalid pleads ,
entrapment , and explicit misleading of the public with criminal intent
by the US DOJ and others , so as to facilitate legitimate and honest
proceedings to maintain integrity of both your " justice " system and
the public at large .
You should be aware of the implications of " DieBold " , however your
cases , especially those in CA and CT , have gross errors and invalidity
intrinsic in their wrongful misrepresentations , exploitation , and
their contrast and contradiction of international law .
You should be
pursuing valid and legitimate criminal activity and not invalidating
all of your cases with invalid findings .
Please respond via email your receipt of this message , and forward
this to all associated parties .

Brad , ( note : time lines jump around )
Officially , started with the black and yellow wildcat ( wildcat 1 or 2 ? ) trial , then spitfire + FD ( fidonet ) + Lakota ( SPITFIRE QWK Packet network ) ( Mike Woltz ) , then iniquity + FD + Spitfire ( hidden as a door . )
All this ran on anything from 8086 , 8088 , 80286 , 80386 , 80486 , 80586 , Pentium , PI , PII , P3 Unofficially , I Tried a * most * others just to learn how they all worked , or to just see if I could set them up and learn them .
In the 1980's I briefly messed with coding in basic on TRS - 80 , and some other single board computer which I do n't remember what it was but I remember the power cable used to come out and dump the whole program .
Later in 90's I had to learn word perfect for college and then got back into computers and chips and electronics , and programming nearly anything I could get my hands and and make work or hack or use or test or ratwire , or code .
I still have all my junk , I still have weird boxes wired up with god knows what inside anything from a digital audio delays to modulators to cb's to custom made test equipment .
I wo n't keep this off topic any more .
Except to say that anybody that was a hacker / cracker KNOWS damn well that electronic tabulation devices are in fact an abusive use of electronics , and should have NEVER been allowed into our elections .
A Constitutional and National Security nightmare from HELL .
And that the corporate fascist mainstream media still has this all blacked out , and most people do n't know anything about electronics to understand these dirty little secrets or they would be protesting every day in millions in the streets .
Ignorance is bliss , but it wo n't last much longer .

Strider is his second incarnation .
He was originally " No 1 " , the best :
FairLight are a legendary Swedish demo and cracking group , born in april 1987 by two members of the West Coast Crackers ( WCC ) , No.1 and Galahad .
They decided they wanted new names , and thus became known as Strider and Black Shadow , respectively .
They almost immediately recruited another Swedish cracker , Gollum .
The next two members recruited were coder and cracker Woodo ( ex Razor Express ) from Denmark and Belgian graphician The Hobbit .
The first months of FLT were spent cracking LOTS of games .
Towards the third quarter of 87 , they opened their first BBS , ' THE PLEASURE DOME ' in Sweden .
Black Shadow got more and more active on the amiga , but still found time for a few cracks on the c64 now and then .
( Defacto2 ) .
Thus , in only it 's second morph , it bacame international and very potent .
The next morph was USA " United Software Association " ( American Flag Background ) , which was a morph not only in cracker ability , but political saavy :
USA started the ' 0 day wares craze ' by ordering from distributors and getting members inside the software companies .
( ibid , emphasis added ) .
And that led to infiltrating political parties , which would put them right next to all the evoting machine hardware and software they could handle .
And they can handle it with ease .
Back to the story , they got into financial problems and did the neoCon thingy :
they resorted to risky and illegal means to obtain titles .
( ibid , emphasis added ) .
Things got hot , so Strider did the next morph :
USA / Fairlight disbandend and Strider took the remaining members and created Fairlight PC .
A cracking group that survived in various forms right up until 2004 .
( ibid , emphasis added ) .
Wow !!!
WOW !!!
WOW !!!

But stick to the drama here .
It sells Read the character closely .
What does his emotional DNA look like ?
He is damn good .
He puts people inside .
He plays the game to advance himself because he needs recognition .
His parents did not make him a solid .
He is a shape shifter .
Once in , he will see the possibilities .
It is n't limited to a presidental race that draws the heat .
It could apply to many house and senatorial races , state races , where for a mere million we will do you righteous .
Do n't think to big or too small .
He is n't .
BTW I noticed that Brad sedd " Raw Story Did It " ( not me Strider ) I laughed my ass off Brad , because we ( Brad included ) all know Raw Story is going to take a hit for this .
Strider et al will hack their site in a nasty way because those are the rules .

California Republican Party Leadership Journal April 14th , 2008 Republicans Recognize Longtime Voter Registration Volunteer San Diego Republicans tonight recognized longtime Republican volunteer Trinie Bowling , and made her the first recipient of a new award created in her name --- the Trinie Bowling Award for Leadership in Voter Registration .
Trinie is an immigrant from the Phillipines who came to this country 55 years ago .
For decades she has consistently attended the new citizen swearing in ceremonies in San Diego to encourage the newest American citizens to register and join the Republican Party .
When I was the San Diego County Chairman , Trinie was a tremendous example of Republican volunteerism in action .
Trinie is facing a health challenge now , and our prayers are with her as she wages that battle .
Demonstrating that the Republican Party truly is a party of immigrants , Trinie was presentedwith her award tonight by county Republican Chairman Tony Krvaric , who is not only an immigrant himself , but was registered to vote by Trinie when he took his citizenship oath .

Just a thought if anyone thinks it would be worth some digging :
Figure out some numbers that would be meaningful to this Krvaric and associates like birthdates etc and compare those numbers to some election results that are under doubt .
My theory is that people like this would use numbers that are meaningful to them when fixing results as a signature .
Wouldnt necessarily prove anything if found out but would be at least interesting .

I wrote about " Canoeing With the Cree " last week when its author , the late newsman Eric Sevareid , was honored with a postage stamp .
And I told you his great book about his canoe trip to Hudson Bay inspired generations of Minnesota outdoors lovers .
The newest generation set out on chilly waters Monday morning .
Sean Bloomfield and Colton Witte are best bud 18 - year - olds who accelerated their studies so they could graduate from Chaska High School six weeks early and embark upon a summer adventure to remember all their lives .
Over the next 10 or 11 weeks , they plan to follow in the wake of Sevareid and Walter Port , who canoed from Fort Snelling to Hudson Bay as teens in 1930 .
The boys , who grew up near each other on Chaska 's Lake Grace , have dreamed of Canoeing with Eric Sevareid ever since they read his book in seventh grade .
They talked about it for five years .
And for five years , their parents half - hoped they 'd set the dream aside , like you 're supposed to do when you grow up .
" I kept thinking they 'd change their mind , " said Sean 's mom , Pat , as the boys and their friends gathered on the banks of the Minnesota River in Chaska 's Winkel Park Monday morning .
" But they never did . "
" We questioned them pretty heavy , " said Sean 's dad , who is also named Pat .
" We resisted their plans pretty hard , until we realized that the more we resisted , the more they were resolved to do this thing .
So then we backed off , but that did n't work , either . "
In the end , the two families put their hopes in Nature .
Not the Nature of the rivers and the woods , but the nature of things between boys and girls .
Girlfriends , the families hoped , might keep the boys from embarking on months of hardships and hazards .
" We came close , " Colton 's dad , Dan Witte , said with a laugh , Monday , while Colton 's mom , Kathy , took pictures of the preparations .
" There have been some tears the last few days . "
Sean 's girlfriend , Erin Sattervall , and Colton 's girlfriend , Courtney Leinen , were on hand to wish the guys bon voyage , looking scared and sad .
The last to show up was Colton , who was in charge of bringing the 18 - and - a - half - foot canoe , " The Bloomitte " ( a contraction of Bloomfield and Witte ) in the Beast , his 1986 pickup .
The Beast had begun the day with a flat tire , so The Bloomitte got to the river just a few minutes before the trip was supposed to start .
" We just always have wanted to get away from the world -- the civilized world , at least , " Sean said while Colton loaded the canoe .
" Everyone was skeptical that we really were going to do this .
But we really were . "
" Living day to day outdoors , " Colton added .
" Being out in nature -- that 's the lifestyle we always wanted . "
The boys took their first canoe trip with their dads when they were in fourth grade , a weeklong trip to the Boundary Waters .
Over the past couple of years , as they prepared for the Sevareid trek , they started pushing themselves , taking long trips through the Boundary Waters and on the St. Croix , and along the Minnesota River bottoms , in heat and cold and wind and rain .
At the river , Paul Holmes , a counselor at Chaska High , offered tobacco to the four directions so the boys would have good spirits on the journey through the homelands of the Dakota and the Cree .
" I 'm not worried about them , " Holmes said .
" They 've got the youthful exuberance , and they 've got the skills . "
The boys also have the advantage of maps far better than the ones Sevareid had .
But they are traveling without most modern conveniences , except for a satellite messenger -- a device that can send a signal telling friends their map coordinates .
It also has an emergency signal to call for help in case of illness or mishap .
The time had come : 7:30 on the last Monday morning in April , 30 degrees and snowflakes falling as Sean and Colton kissed their girlfriends goodbye .
It was a long farewell .
The Chaska High prom had been Saturday night , and the boys and their dates had been among a group of friends who went to the dance in a cozy limo .
Dear Congress :
Gag orders ( Patriot Act , National Security Letters ) .
Unilateral and whim - based FBI powers of arrest / seizure without judge 's intervention ( Patriot Act ) .
No due process of law ( habeas corpus nixed , Military Commissions Act ) .
Immunity from war crimes prosecution granted the Prez for torture ( Military Commissions Act ) .
Telecom immunity : Secrecy is the cornerstone of government abuse .
Endless wars based on lies , death of our own soldiers based on those lies .
Congress , must we PAY for this with our own tax dollars ?
Must we PAY for the Telecoms to have immunity while we PAY double with our phone bills , triple with our internet bills , etc ?
Do you really expect us to fund our own abuse ?
Get real , Congress .
We the People are the FIRST Branch of government .
The Government of the People , By the People and For the People is going to fix this situation and fast too .
We the People are going to publicly expose YOUR voting record in Congress , telling the public that YOU voted for gag orders , undermining the power of the Judiciary whose role is to put a " check " on random government power , whim - based FBI / police powers , unilateral and whim - based torture powers for the Prez with no jail in sight , etc . .....
We the People are going to let it be known that YOU , our local U.S. Congressperson , voted for this and more .
We will urge our readers to vote you out of office .
We will urge readers to spread word as widely as they possibly can .
We the People will also see to it that the public sees right through your War OF Terror :
We will expose the fact that , according to the ACLU , there are only Democrats in public office but no Republicans on the no-fly list .
We will let it be known that almost one million people are on that list , based on names like Joe Smith matching another " terrorist 's " name on the database .
Of course , the fact that the Patriot Act defines " Terrorist " in what is unanimously agreed on by more than one dozen legal entities across the partisan spectrum to be " over - broad " and to include activists in the " Terrorist " definition , means that really your " terrorist " witchhunt is deliberately targeting vocal people .
And , what of the fact that according to former FBI agent Mike German , only ONE terrorist was caught due to National Security Letters since 2001 ?
What of the fact that out of 200,000 such gag order - containing National Security Letters served between 2001 - 2008 , 53 % were for Americans ?
We the People will not be silenced !
We will not be cowed !
This is America , you know , the land of the free and the home of the BRAVE !
If anything , we are going to be more vocal and vociferous than ever before .
You can count on that !

Say you 're an executive of a cruise company , the demand for cruises is growing rapidly and you want to increase the passenger capacity of your ships .
What would you do ?
You can , of course , order new ships , but it takes 3 or more years to build them .
How about something quicker ?
How about you take one of your huge 12 - story ships , cut it in half at the middle and add a huge block of new rooms ?
Well , that 's exactly how the executives at Royal Caribbean decided to proceed .
They took one of their ships - Enchantment of the Seas - and expanded it to accommodate for increased demand for cruises .
Initially , the construction crew used circular saws and torches to cut the ship at the middle .
They cut through everything - the outer hull that was made from steel , the watertight inner hull , cables , pipes , even ventilation system .
The swimming pool on the ship 's top deck was also cut .
The whole cutting process took 2 days , and after it was finished , a narrow line of light could be seen traveling from the top of the ship all the way to the bottom .
After that , the construction crew moved the two halves of the ship away from each other , and positioned a huge 73 foot , 2,500 ton section ( which contained 151 furnished rooms ) between them .
Then came the final part - reattaching cables , pipes and everything else - a process that took two weeks .
The enlargement of the cruise ship took about one month , during which the ship grew from 916 feet to 990 feet .
This process , which took place on a shipyard called Keppel Verolme in Rotterdam , Netherlands , cost about $ 60 million , just a fraction of the cost it takes to build a new ship .
Now the ship - Enchantment of the Seas - is able to enchant 300 more vacationers on each of its trips .

“ I reckon this will avoid tens of millions of deaths in my lifetime and hundreds of millions in my kids ’ lifetimes , ” he said .
Catherine Armstrong , a spokeswoman for British American Tobacco  one of the Western tobacco companies that focuses on sales to the third world  would not comment directly on the new initiative .
But she said , “ We have no problem with government organizations educating people on the risks of tobacco . ”
A spokesman for Philip Morris , which makes Marlboro , the world ’s most popular cigarette brand , said the company agreed that children should be kept from smoking but thought that raising cigarette taxes promoted smuggling and counterfeiting .
Mr. Bloomberg , founder of the financial news company bearing his name and creator of the Bloomberg Family Foundation , has long been known for his antipathy to tobacco .
During his administration , New York has adopted several antismoking measures , including a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants , and significant increases in cigarette taxes .
The global campaign promises to be a struggle .
Cigarettes not only are highly addictive and supported by huge advertising campaigns , they are also an important source of income for many foreign governments .
In China and other countries , tobacco is a state - owned monopoly , and low - and middle - income countries collect $ 66 billion a year in tobacco taxes .
Only about 5 percent of the world ’s countries have any antismoking measures like those the campaign envisions .
But Dr. Peto said antismoking campaigns were already having some effects , even in countries where no -smoking signs are often ignored .
He surveyed thousands of tobacco users in China in the 1990s  “ before the government was taking it seriously , ” he said  and found 4 percent who identified themselves as former smokers .
Now , he said , 20 percent do .
In India , where people have long chewed tobacco but widespread smoking is more recent , Dr. Peto said he found almost no one who had quit .
“ India is where China was in the mid-1990s , ” he said .
Cheney reportedly wanted cuts in climate testimony Associated Press
Published : Tuesday July 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney 's office pushed for major deletions in congressional testimony on the public health consequences of climate change , fearing the presentation by a leading health official might make it harder to avoid regulating greenhouse gases , a former EPA officials maintains .
When six pages were cut from testimony on climate change and public health by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last October , the White House insisted the changes were made because of reservations raised by White House advisers about the accuracy of the science .
But Jason K. Burnett , until last month the senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson , says that Cheney 's office was deeply involved in getting nearly half of the CDC 's original draft testimony removed .
" The Council on Environmental Quality and the office of the vice president were seeking deletions to the CDC testimony ( concerning ) ... any discussions of the human health consequences of climate change , " Burnett has told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
The three - page letter , a response to an inquiry by Sen. Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , the panel 's chairwoman , was obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press .
Boxer planned a news conference later in the day .
Burnett , 31 , a lifelong Democrat who resigned his post last month as associate deputy EPA administrator because of disagreements over the agency 's response to climate change , describes deep political concerns at the White House , including in Cheney 's office , about linking climate change directly to public health or damage to the environment .
Scientists believe manmade pollution is warming the earth and if the process is not reversed it will cause significant climate changes that pose broad public health problems from increases in disease to more injuries from severe weather .
Senate and House committees have been trying for months to get e-mail exchanges and other documents to determine the extent of political influence on government scientists , but have been rebuffed .
The letter by Burnett for the first time suggests that Cheney 's office was deeply involved in downplaying the impacts of climate change as related to public health and welfare , Senate investigators believe .
Cheney 's office also objected last January over congressional testimony by Administrator Johnson that " greenhouse gas emissions harm the environment . "
An official in Cheney 's office " called to tell me that his office wanted the language changed " with references to climate change harming the environment deleted , Burnett said .
Nevertheless , the phrase was left in Johnson 's testimony .
Cheney 's office and the White House Council on Environmental Quality worried that if key health officials provided detailed testimony about global warming 's consequences on public health or the environment , it could make it more difficult to avoid regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , Burnett believes .
The EPA currently is examining whether carbon dioxide , a leading greenhouse gas , poses a danger to public health and welfare .
The Supreme Court has said if it does , it must be regulated under the Clean Air Act .
Nowhere were these White House concerns more apparent than when CDC Director Julie Gerberding , the head of the government 's premier public health watchdog , testified about climate change and public health before Boxer 's committee last October .
The White House deleted six of the original 14 pages of Gerberding 's testimony , including a list of likely public health impacts of global warming .
The White House , at the urging of Cheney 's office , " requested that I work with CDC to remove from the testimony any discussion of the human health consequences of climate change , " wrote Burnett .
" CEQ contacted me to argue that I could best keep options open for the ( EPA ) administrator ( on regulating carbon dioxide ) if I would convince CDC to delete particular sections of their testimony , " Burnett said in the letter to Boxer .
But he said he refused to press CDC on the deletions because he believed the CDC 's draft testimony was " fundamentally accurate . "
Burnett , in a telephone interview , said he opposed making the extensive deletions because " it was the right thing to do . "
He declined to elaborate about White House involvement beyond his July 6 letter to Boxer .
As a Democrat , Burnett , seems to have been an odd choice as a senior policy adviser and key liaison with the White House in Bush administration 's EPA .
Over the last eight years , he has contributed nearly $ 125,000 to various Democratic politicians , starting with Al Gore 's 2000 presidential campaign , according to the Center for Responsive Government .
He supports Democrat Barack Obama for president .
Burnett caught the attention of Bush administration insiders as a researcher at the Center for Regulatory Study , a joint effort by the American Enterprise Institute and the Brookings Institution , where he co-authored a number of reports on regulation including one criticizing a ban on using cell phones while driving and another criticizing the EPA regulation of arsenic as too expensive with limited benefits .
Ba -ba - ba booom : it 's a musical motif so familiar , so distinctive , we recognise it written out in baby words .
Did Beethoven realise , when he composed the opening bars of the first movement of his Fifth Symphony , that he had come up with a riff that spoke of fate knocking at the door , the dawn of German Romanticism , a people 's search for a national identity , genius standing up against the world ?
And similarly , did Ritchie Blackmore realise , when he jammed the introduction to Smoke on the Water ( duh duh duuuh , duh duh de- duuuh ) , that he had come up with a riff as emblematic for his generation as the opening of Beethoven 's Opus 67 ?
As a former member of a pop band ( the Communards ) and now chaplain to the Royal Academy of Music , I am relatively well - placed to ask what makes a riff a riff , and if there 's any real difference between ba - ba - ba booom and duh duh duuuh , duh duh de-duuuh .
A catchy motif serves the interests of Beethoven or Debussy just as nicely as Deep Purple or Kylie .
Most composers , certainly those working within tonality and patterned forms , would love to come up with something that is not only arresting and recognisable , but leaves the hearer wanting more .
The opening of the Fifth Symphony is a brilliant example .
The first few bars , the ba - ba - ba booom ... ba -ba - ba booom , seem to come out of nowhere , as startling and as unexpected as a violent knock on the door .
( In fact Beethoven 's pupil , Karl Czerny , maintained that the motif was inspired by the song of a yellowhammer heard in Vienna 's Prater Park . )
The whole of the first movement could be described as a development of that motif , which , in the imagination of Beethoven , produces extraordinary richness and complexity .
I am not so sure Deep Purple would make a similar claim .
The merit of their riff lies in doing nothing much .
It is just there , like a dependable friend , so persistent , so dogged , that nearly four decades after it was first heard , you cannot walk down Denmark Street in London without hearing it clumsily reprised from every guitar shop .
It does not generate complexity and richness - but who would n't give their right arm to have come up with it ?
Or the little guitar hook in the James Bond theme ?
Again , not much on its own - there is a lot more technical stuff happening with strings and horns - but it is the guitar figure that tells us what we need to know about Bond , and it is the guitar figure everyone recognises .
Why do certain riffs work so well ?
Is it the patterning of pitch and rhythm , or the means by which the sounds are made ?
In Verdi's opera Don Carlos , the Grand Inquisitor 's entrance is marked with a marvellously sinister theme .
It is extremely simple , involving no complex chords or suspensions , and could quite properly be described as pedestrian ( the blind and feeble Inquisitor is not fleet of foot ) ; but growling basses and haunting horns turn it into something much more than an everyday arrangement of pitch and pulse .
It works the other way on a track such as the Smiths ' This Charming Man. Johnny Marr plays an ordinary little figure on the guitar , nothing special , but it adds something I would describe as irresistibly perky , if perky did n't sound so awful .
Hearing a good riff once makes you want to hear it twice ; there are those you crave like cigarettes .
I remember being so taken with a figure in the Prince track Alphabet Street , I replayed it obsessively all weekend ; by Sunday afternoon , I was the only person left in the house .
The most innocent or artless of things can , with repetition , sound significant and compelling .
The composer Jocelyn Pook , who 20 years ago played viola in the Communards , is best known now for her work with film - makers such as Stanley Kubrick and Peter Kosminsky .
Her piece Portraits in Absentia began when she replayed messages left on her answerphone .
Something about the pitch and timbre and rhythm of people saying hello and goodbye impressed her so she re-recorded them , looped them , edited and played and replayed them until they acquired a kind of pathos , or hopefulness .
Perhaps we cannot now hear people saying hello and goodbye on an answerphone without thinking of 9/11 .
But Portraits in Absentia was made in 1999 and sounded significant then .
Pook was already alert to the potential of taking sound from one genre and exporting it into another .
She once recorded a Romanian priest singing a passage from his church 's liturgy , looped it , played it backwards , and made a piece out of it that was chanced upon by Kubrick , who invited her to use it in the music she composed for the masked ball scene in his last film , Eyes Wide Shut .
It is extraordinarily affecting , like a refugee lost in an incomprehensible world trying to sing his way back to a comprehensible world and not doing too well .
At its best , a riff has the power to express a feeling , or a sense of nostalgia , or a sense of community , with such economy that it takes on a life of its own .
I remember an edition of Face the Music when Joseph Cooper played a single note on the piano , which Joyce Grenfell correctly identified as the beginning of Debussy 's piano prelude La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin .
How did she know from a single note ?
Was it a lucky guess , or a memory of something half - heard at a rehearsal ?
Was Debussy 's riff so deeply imprinted that the merest hint caused it to emerge fully formed in the conscious mind ?
Whoever works out the answer to that will never be out of the top 10 .

Thanks for waiting :)
Here you go .
[ appears to be down for now , we took link down until we can revive the poor wounded server ]
We ’ll be releasing a more official announcement soon , but we wanted to get the tool out there .
We sincerely hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it :)
Update 1 : Just to clear up some confusion over what this actually does : yes , it jailbreaks and unlocks older iPhones , and jailbreaks iPhone 3Gs and iPod Touches .
We only support the 2.0 firmwares .
Update 2 : It looks like there are n’t enough TCP ports on that server , so _BigBoss_ has generously offered to it .
Update 3 : If you get Error 1600 from iTunes ( or if you see in your log a failure to prepare x12220000_4_Recovery.ipsw ) , try : mkdir ~/ Library / iTunes / “ Device Support ” ; if that directory already exists , remove any files in it .
Then re-run PwnageTool .
Update 4 : Here ’s another mirror
Update 5 : If DFU restores are giving you trouble , another route to pwned 2.0 for 1G owners is to use our first pwnage at 1.1.4 .
Once you are pwned there , you can do a normal recovery - mode restore to your custom 2.0 ipsw .
BTW the iPhone does * not* need to be pre-pwned to be able to DFU - restore into a pwned ipsw – it needs to be pre-pwned only for normal recovery - mode restores of custom ipsw’s .
Update 6 : Mail application not working at 2.0 ?
Please restore to your custom ipsw ( you do n’t need to DFU restore if you are pwned , normal restore will work now too ) but then select “ Set up as a new iPhone ” when iTunes asks .
Your first sync will bring back all of your settings anyway .
UPDATE : PLEASE USE 2.0.1 INSTEAD which is here

An A - grade student from one of the poorest areas in the country has had an offer of a place on a prestigious medical course withdrawn after admissions officers ruled that a spent criminal conviction meant he could not be trusted to become a doctor .
Majid Ahmed , 18 , from Little Horton in Bradford , lost an appeal against the decision by Imperial College London to bar him from its medicine degree , a move that youth justice charities labelled discriminatory and MPs called unfair .
Ahmed was convicted of burglary in 2005 and ordered to serve a four - month referral order for community service .
His conviction is spent and he has moved schools , volunteered with disability charities and won four A grades at A - level .
Imperial offered him a place for study this academic year , an offer which was withdrawn after he wrote to tell the college of his conviction .
The university said the decision had been made to uphold trust in the medical profession .
Ahmed appealed , presenting evidence from his school , charities and doctors with whom he has undertaken work experience , but last week the appeal was turned down .
Ahmed said : " I had the place and then it was taken off me .
I am overwhelmed by anger that I have let something like this affect my life .
I 'm a kid who has grown up surrounded by violence and drugs .
Give me a chance and I 'll show the universities that I 'm not a bad guy .
I wo n't risk their reputation . "
Last night Bill Rammell , the minister for higher education , refused to comment on the case , saying that student selection was a matter for individual universities .
However , he added : " Universities should not turn away talented individuals ... when convictions are spent or when they have made positive steps to change their lives and improve their futures . "
The decision comes as ministers consider new strategies to encourage more people from the poorest backgrounds to go to the elite universities .
Imperial is ranked sixth in the country for medical degrees .
Only 4 % of its intake is made up of students from the poorest backgrounds .
The General Medical Council yesterday confirmed that people can still become doctors if they have a criminal record .
A candidate could be barred if thought to pose a risk , but evidence including references would be considered .
Paul Cavadino , chief executive of Nacro , the crime reduction charity , said : " This is an appalling way to treat a young man with the potential to become an able and dedicated member of the medical profession .
This kind of discrimination can have devastating consequences for individuals . "
Stephen Williams , the Liberal Democrat spokesman on universities , said : " To be rejected in this way , having apparently been open and honest with the university , seems very unfair . "
Imperial said : " The college requests information on a candidate 's ' unspent ' convictions only ... medicine , however , is focused on preparing students for a career that has particularly demanding requirements .
Medical practitioners hold a position of responsibility in society , and must often deal with vulnerable people .
The public must have confidence in the integrity and probity of its doctors .
" Imperial believes that by carrying out and acting upon the CRB [ Criminal Records Bureau ] checks of potential medical students , it plays an important role in helping to uphold this trust . "
Some time ago I promised to create a small tutorial about live fulltext search .
A fulltext search , that gives you results as you type .
Ingredients :
Ruby on rails
ferret gem ( gem install ferret )
acts_as_ferret gem ( gem install acts_as_ferret )
auto_complete plugin ( from the application root : ruby script / plugin install auto_complete )
What we will do
Create an empty application – simple book database
Add fulltext search capabilities Create the live search Create search pane partial – the one that will display the search box Create the search results partial – that will render the hints ( search results )
Modify controller to respond to the search pane
Create a book database application
We will create a small application for book management .
It will store , list , update books and it will also provide the live search .
So , lets create the skeleton of the aplication :
# Create the rails application rails books # create database books echo " create database books " | mysql -u root -p cd books
Configure database login and password in app/ config/database.yml .
development : adapter : mysql database : books username : root password : password host : localhost port : 3306
Create skeleton of the application .
From root of the application run :
ruby script / generate scaffold
Book title : string abstract : text
Create the books table
rake db: migrate
Start up the development server
ruby script / server
Now , browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000/books and type in some data .
Add fulltext search capabilities
Change the app / models / book.rb to support fulltext search
require " acts_as_ferret " class Book < ActiveRecord :: Base acts_as_ferret end
You can check in the console , that the fulltext is enabled .
Just start the console via
ruby script / console and put there
Book . find_by_contents ( " book " ) .
It should return a result set , similar to this :
=> #< ActsAsFerret:: SearchResults:0x2540f54 @results=[#< Book id : 2 , title : " Book secondo " , abstract : " Book about book " , created_at : " 2008-07-07 23:16:38 " , updated_at : " 2008-07-07 23:16:38 " > , #< Book id : 1 , title : " First book " , abstract : " This is a first book " , created_at : " 2008-07-07 23:16:23 " , updated_at : " 2008-07-07 23:16:23 " > ] , @total_hits=2 >
Create the live search
Finally , create the live search .
Create search pane partial
The search_pane will be used to display search box .
Create a partial _search_pane.html.erb in app / views / books and put there simple tag .
The tag create Ajax Autocompleter that calls auto_complete_for_search_query method of the default controller ( in our case it will be books )
<%= text_field_with_auto_complete : search , : query %>
Add javascript include and partial rendering to the books template app / views / layouts/books.html.erb .
Do not forget !
The javascript include must be in the head of the template .
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > < meta http-equiv= " content - type " content = " text/html;charset=UTF - 8 " /> < title > Books : <%= controller.action_name %></title > <!-- HERE --> <%= stylesheet_link_tag ' scaffold ' %> <%= javascript_include_tag : defaults %> </ head > < body > <!-- AND HERE --> <%= render : partial= >" books/ search_pane " %> < p style = " color : green " >< %= flash [ : notice ] %></p> <%= yield %> </ body > </html >
Create the search results partial
The search_results will format the results of the full text search and will “ offer ” the resulting records .
Create a partial app/ views / books/_search_results.html.erb and add there the formatting code :
< ul > < % for book in @books %> < li ><%= link_to h( book.title ) , : controller= > " books " , :action= > " show " , :id= > book %></li > <% end %> </ul >
Modify controller
Add the following line at the beginning of the books_controller .
protect_from_forgery :only => [ : create , :update , : destroy ]
Create a method in books_controller that will search for the books
def auto_complete_for_search_query @books = Book . find_by_contents ( params [ " search " ] [ " query " ] + " * " , { : limit => 5 } ) render : partial => " search_results " end
We do not want to generate the whole page layout , so it is necessary to specify it in the books controller :
layout ' books ' , : except => [ :auto_complete_for_search_query ]
And now , navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/books and start searching .
As soon as you start typing into the search box , it shows results .
Click on one of the proposed links to see what happens .

In its first chemical analysis of soil from Mars ’ northern plains , NASA ’s Phoenix lander has turned up no evidence of water , scientists said Monday .
Still , researchers remained confident that the craft is in the right place to uncover veins of ice believed to lie only inches beneath the surface .
A soil sample was cooked twice in one of Phoenix ’s eight ovens over the last few days , according to William Boynton , lead scientist for the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer , or TEGA .
The first test reached 95 degrees , the second 350 degrees .
“ Had there been any ice , it would have melted , ” Boynton said .
“ We saw no water in the soil whatsoever . ”

The instrument detected carbon dioxide , hardly a surprise since the thin Martian atmosphere is primarily made up of CO2 .
The goal of the $ 420 - million Phoenix mission is to find out whether Mars is , or ever was , suitable for rudimentary life forms .
Phoenix landed near Mars ’ north pole May 25 .
The science team at the University of Arizona and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge were not disappointed by the failure to turn up water on the first test sample .
Phoenix ’s nearly 8 - foot - long robotic arm has only dug 2 to 3 inches into the soil , at a region named Dodo - Goldilocks .
The ice layer , they said , is probably farther down .
The latest images of the trench from which the soil was taken show light - toned material that the scientists think could be ice protruding from the trench ’s side .

“ It looks like we clipped the edge of the top of a polygon , ” said Ray Arvidson , the lead scientist for the lander ’s robotic arm .
The polygonal land forms -- small mounds bounded by shallow trenches -- are similar to features that scientists have seen in the Arctic on Earth caused by subsurface ice .
“ This could be the tip of the iceberg , ” Arvidson said .
The science team will next turn its attention to a nearby region called Wonderland , where it thinks the ice layer is close to the surface .

The TEGA ovens are designed to reach 1,800 degrees , because different elements burn off at different temperatures .
Tests over the next few weeks should help uncover any water bound up with the minerals , if not water itself , scientists said .
NASA ’s twin Mars rovers , Spirit and Opportunity , have found evidence that water was once plentiful in the form of standing lakes and streams on Mars ’ surface .
Scientists now hope to find and test water to help determine whether present - day Mars could be habitable .
The last NASA landers to test for habitability on Mars were the twin Viking probes , which landed in 1976 .
Neither found any organic molecules that would be a good indicator of Mars ’ suitability for life .

That caused planetary scientists to virtually abandon Mars for two decades , until a new generation of scientists proposed that life - sustaining conditions might be found underground at the poles .
Scientists were encouraged by findings from the gamma ray spectrometer on the orbiting Mars Odyssey spacecraft , which in 2002 detected a large concentration of hydrogen in the top few feet of soil at the pole .
Scientists believed that indicated vast quantities of ice underground .

There can no longer be any doubt about the consequences of any U.S. and / or Israeli military action against Iran .
Armchair warriors , pundits and blustering politicians alike have been advocating a pre-emptive military strike against Iran for the purpose of neutralizing its nuclear - related infrastructure , as well as retarding Iran ’s ability to train and equip “ terrorist ” forces on Iranian soil before dispatching them to Iraq or parts unknown .
Some , including me , have warned of the folly of such action , and now Iran itself has demonstrated why an attack would be insane .
I ’ve always pointed out that no plan survives initial contact with the enemy , and furthermore one can never forget that , in war , the enemy gets to vote .
On the issue of an American and / or Israeli attack on Iran , the Iranian military has demonstrated exactly how it would cast its vote .
Iran recently fired off medium - and long - range missiles and rockets , in a clear demonstration of capability and intent .
Shipping through the Strait of Hormuz , regional oil production capability and U.S. military concentrations , along with Israeli cities , would all be subjected to an Iranian military response if Iran was attacked .
The Bush administration has shrugged off the Iranian military display as yet another example of how irresponsible the government in Tehran is .
But the Pentagon for one has had to sit up and pay attention .
For some time now , the admirals commanding the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf have maintained that they have the ability to keep the Strait of Hormuz open .
But the fact is , the only way the United States could guarantee that the strait remained open would be to launch a massive pre-emptive military strike that swept the Iranian coast clear of the deadly Chinese - made surface - to - surface missiles that Iran would use to sink cargo ships in the strategic lane .
This strike would involve hundreds of tactical aircraft backed up by limited ground action by Marines and U.S. Special Operations forces which would involve “ boots on the ground ” for several days , if not weeks .
Such a strike is not envisioned in any “ limited ” military action being planned by the United States .
But now that it is clear what the Iranian response would entail , there can no longer be any talk of a “ limited ” military attack on Iran .
The moment the United States makes a move to secure the Strait of Hormuz , Iran will unleash a massive bombardment of the military and industrial facilities of the United States and its allies , including the oil fields in Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar .
American military bases in Iraq and Kuwait , large — fixed and well known — would be smothered by rockets and missiles carrying deadly cluster bombs .
The damage done would run into the hundreds of millions , if not into billions , of dollars , and hundreds , if not thousands , of U.S. military personnel would be killed and wounded .
To prevent or retard any Iranian missile attack , the United States would have to commit hundreds of combat sorties , combined with Special Operations forces , to a counter - missile fight which would need to span the considerable depth of the Persian landmass from which missiles might reach potential targets .
While there has been some improvement in the U.S. military ’s counter - missile capability , one must never forget that in 1991 not a single Iraqi Scud missile was successfully interdicted by any aspect of American military action ( airstrike , ground action or antiballistic missile ) , and in 2003 the U.S. military had mixed results against the far less capable Al - Samoud missiles .
Israel was unable to prevent Hezbollah from firing large salvos of rockets into northern Israel during the summer 2006 conflict .
There is no reason for optimism that the U.S. and Israel have suddenly found the solution to the Iranian missile threat .
There is virtually no chance the U.S. Navy would be able to prevent Iran from interfering with shipping through the strait .
There is every chance the Navy would take significant casualties , in both ships lost and personnel killed or wounded , as it struggled to secure the strait .
There would be a need for a significant commitment of ground forces to guarantee safe passage for all shipping , civilian and military alike .
The longer ground forces could operate on Iranian soil , the better the chances Iranian missiles would not be able to effectively interdict shipping .
Conversely , the longer ground forces operated on Iranian soil , the greater likelihood there would be of decisive ground engagement .
With U.S. air power expected to be fully committed to the missile interdiction mission , any large - scale ground engagement would create a situation in which air power would have to be redirected into tactical support , and away from missile interdiction , creating a window of vulnerability which the Iranians would very likely exploit .
Iran has promised to strike targets in Israel as well , especially if Israel is a participant in any military action .
Such Israeli involvement is highly unlikely , since to do so in any meaningful fashion Israel would need to fly in Iraqi air space , a violation of sovereignty the Iraqi government will never tolerate .
The anti-American backlash that would be generated in Iraq would be immediate and severe .
In short , virtually every operation involving the training of Iraqi forces would be terminated as the U.S. military trainers would need to be withdrawn to the safety of the fortified U.S. bases to protect them from attack .
U.S. civilian contractors would likewise need to be either withdrawn completely from Iraq or restricted to the fortified bases .
All gains alleged to have been made in the “ surge ” would be wiped away instantly .
Worse , the Iraqi countryside would become a seething mass of anti-American activity , which would require a huge effort to reverse , if it ever could be .
Iraq as we now know it would be lost , and what would emerge in its stead would not only be unsympathetic to the United States but actually a breeding ground for anti-American action that could very well expand beyond the boundaries of Iraq and the Middle East .
The chances of preventing an Iranian - Israeli clash in the event of a U.S. strike against Iran are slim to none .
Even if Iran initially showed restraint , Hezbollah would undoubtedly join the fray , prompting an Israeli counterstrike in Lebanon and Iran which would in turn bring long - range Iranian missiles raining down on Israeli cities .
Neither the Israeli nor the American ( and for that reason , European and Asian ) economy would emerge intact from a U.S. attack on Iran .
Oil would almost instantly break the $ 300 - per - barrel mark , and because the resulting conflict would more than likely be longer and more violent that most are predicting , there is a good chance oil would top $ 500 or even more within days or weeks .
Hyperinflation would almost certainly strike every market - based economy , and the markets themselves would collapse under the strain .
The good news is that the military planners in the Pentagon are cognizant of this reality .
They know the limitations of American power , and what they can and cannot achieve .
When it was uncertain how Iran would respond to a limited attack , either on their nuclear facilities or bases associated with the Revolutionary Guard Command , some planners might have thought that the U.S. could actually pull off a quick and relatively bloodless attack .
Now that Iran has made it crystal clear that even a limited U.S. attack would bring about a massive Iranian response , all military planners now understand that any U.S. military attack will have to be massive .
Simply put , the United States does not now have the military capacity in the Middle East to launch such a strike , and any redeployment of U.S. forces into the region could not go undetected , either by Iran , which would in turn redeploy its forces , or the rest of the world .
Because a U.S. attack against Iran would have such horrific detrimental impact on the entire world , it is hard to imagine the international community remaining mute as American military might is assembled .
Likewise , despite the disposition of Congress to either remain silent on the issue or actively facilitate military action against Iran , it would become increasingly difficult for American lawmakers to ignore the consequences of a military strike on Iran , economically and politically .
The same can be said of both major presidential candidates .
The decision by Iran to show its hand on how it would respond to any American aggression has cleared the air , so to speak , about what is actually being discussed when one speaks of military action against Iran .
In many ways , the Iranian missile tests have made it less likely that there will be a war with Iran , simply because the stakes of any such action are so plainly obvious to all parties involved .
Iran continues , based upon all available intelligence information , to pursue a nuclear program which is exclusively intended for peaceful energy purposes .
Any concerns which may exist about the dual - use potential of Iran ’s uranium enrichment programs can be mitigated through viable nuclear inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
IAEA inspections should be improved upon by getting Iran to go along with an additional inspection protocol , rather than pursuing military action which will destroy the inspection process and remove the very verification processes which provide the international community with the confidence that Iran is not pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
The reality is that Iran ’s nuclear program is here to stay .
Iran has every right under international law to pursue this program , and regional and global tensions would be greatly reduced ( along with the price of oil ) if American policies , and in related fashion U.N. Security Council mandates , were adjusted accordingly .
Israeli paranoia — derived not so much from any genuine Iranian threat but rather an affront to Israeli nuclear hegemony in the Middle East — must in turn be subdued .
This can be done through a mixture of international pressure designed to punish Israel diplomatically and economically for any failure to adhere to international norms when it comes to peaceful coexistence with its neighbors , and international assurances that Israel ’s sovereignty and viability as a nation - state will forever be respected and defended .
Of course , there can be no meaningful international pressure brought to bear on Israel without American participation , and herein lies the crux of the problem .
Until the U.S. Congress segregates legitimate national security concerns from narrow Israeli - only issues , the pro-Israel lobby will have considerable control over American national security policy .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ’s continued push for congressional action concerning the implementation of what is tantamount to a naval blockade of Iran ( and as such , an act of war ) by pushing House Resolution 362 and Senate Resolution 580 is mind - boggling given the reality of the situation .
Congress must stop talking blockade , and start discussing stability and confidence - building measures .
There has never been a more pressing time than now for Congress to conduct serious hearings on U.S. policy toward Iran .
Such hearings must not replicate the rubber - stamp hearings held by the U.S. Senate and House in the summer of 2002 .
Those hearings were simply a facilitating vehicle for war with Iraq .
New hearings must expand the body of witnesses beyond administration officials and those who would mirror their policy positions , and include experts and specialists who could articulate a counter point of view , exposing Congress to information and analysis that might prompt a fuller debate .
This is the last thing AIPAC and the Bush administration want to see .
But it is the one thing the American people should be demanding .
Only an irrational person or organization could continue to discuss as viable a military strike against Iran .
Sadly , based upon past and current policy articulations , neither AIPAC nor the Bush administration can be considered rational when it comes to the issue of Iran .
It is up to the American people , through their elected representatives in Congress , to inject a modicum of sanity into a situation that continues to be in danger of spinning out of control .

That 's the message from Dallas scientists who predict that as the planet warms during the coming century people will sweat more , not drink enough water to compensate , and therefore develop more kidney stones .
The prevalence of kidney stones may rise by 30 percent or more in some U.S. areas if global temperatures rise as forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the scientists found .
" This is really the first direct human health impact of climate change that has been demonstrated , " said the study 's lead author , Tom Brikowski , a University of Texas at Dallas professor of geosciences .
The study , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , has some caveats .
It assumes the world will indeed warm , a trend contested by at least a handful of scientists .
It also assumes that computer model predictions for regional warming , such as a 4 - degree average temperature increase for the southeastern United States by 2050 , are reliable .
More scientists question the validity of such regional predictions .
Some global warming skeptics also note that the U.S. southeast has actually cooled during the last century .
" I am immediately suspicious of the assumed severe temperature change in the next decades , which is a multiple of what we have seen in the last half - century , man-made or not , " said Rob Bradley , chairman of the Houston - based Institute for Energy Research .
More for you News Global warming will bring more kidney stones , study warns
However , a leading expert on global warming 's impact on human health , Dr. Paul Epstein , of Harvard Medical School , called the new study " an elegant piece of work . "
Epstein says that as more physicians consider the impact of global warming — doctors from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center collaborated on the new study — he expects more studies of this kind will highlight unknown perils of a warming world .
" We can probably expect more unexpected findings like this , " said Epstein , associate director of Harvard 's Center for Health and the Global Environment .
Many scientists already believe global warming will increase the reach of tropical diseases such as malaria .
Kidney stone disease occurs in about 12 percent of U.S. men and 7 percent of women .
The disease is as much as 50 percent more prevalent in the Southeast than the Northwest , a difference scientists say is largely due to the fact that average temperatures in the south are about 14 degrees warmer .
Low urine volume increases the risk of kidney stones because the lower flow raises the likelihood that salt will clump together and form stones .
Scientists have found that the annual risk of kidney stone disease rises sharply when the average temperature of a location exceeds 57 degrees .
The new work , therefore , suggests the highest growth in kidney stone risk will be found in middle America , from Kentucky to California , where average temperatures are forecast to rise above that threshold .
Rising temperatures would have less of an effect in a city such as Houston , where the average annual temperature is already nearly 70 degrees .
" The take - home message from this , with the caveat that you have to believe their models and that global warming will continue , is that stone disease is a big problem in the United States , and it 's only going to get bigger , " said Dr. Richard Link , a professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine .
The problem could also be eased , he said , if Americans in warm climates drank about eight cups of water a day to ensure a healthy urine flow .
" The solution to this problem sounds simple , for people to monitor their fluid intake , " said Brikowski , the lead author .
" I know people will continue to drive their Hummers and just tell others to drink more water .
" But with global warming it 's not going to be any single thing that is a crisis or will destroy society .
It 's kind of like living in an old house where everything slowly stops working over time .
At some point you 're living in a crumbling home . "

Obama and Bill Clinton finally speak Associated Press
Published : Monday June 30 , 2008

Print This Email This Barack Obama and Bill Clinton ended their mutual silent treatment Monday , with the Democratic presidential candidate reaching out and asking his former Democratic nemesis to help him win the White House .
In their first conversation since the end of the heated primary , former President Clinton agreed to campaign for the candidate he portrayed as inexperienced for a presidential run .
Obama had said Bill Clinton 's harsh criticisms led him to wonder which Clinton he was running against sometimes .
The 20 - minute conversation was the latest step in bringing together the two warring camps .
While Hillary Rodham Clinton has been publicly behind Obama , hard feelings remained between the former Democratic president and the candidate hoping to become the next one .
They had n't spoken until Obama called Monday after landing in Missouri for a campaign stop .
Both sides later issued statements about the conversation , an important public display of how Obama needs to have both Clintons on board moving into the general election .
Bill Clinton is still popular with voters even if his stock went down , especially among blacks , after his angry outbursts against Obama during the primary .
But Obama could use the former president to help win over voters , especially the working - class whites who fondly remember better economic times under the Clinton administration and who overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton during the primaries .
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama asked Clinton to campaign with him and on his own .
Obama " has always believed that Bill Clinton is one of this nation 's great leaders and most brilliant minds , and looks forward to seeing him on the campaign trail and receiving his counsel in the months to come , " said Obama spokesman Bill Burton .
Clinton spokesman Matt McKenna said the former president renewed his offer _ expressed in a one - sentence statement last week _ to do whatever he can to ensure Obama wins the presidency .
" President Clinton continues to be impressed by Senator Obama and the campaign he has run , and looks forward to campaigning for and with him in the months to come , " McKenna said .
" The president believes that Senator Obama has been a great inspiration for millions of people around the country and he knows that he will bring the change America needs as our next president . "
Bill Clinton was in Europe last week and did not attend last Friday 's rally with his wife and Obama in the symbolic town of Unity , N.H. Obama said it was appropriate that he appear alone with his former rival since they waged the hard - fought race .
Anatomy of Linux flash file systems
Options and architectures
Solid - state drives are all the rage these days , but embedded systems have used solid - state devices for storage for quite some time .
You 'll find flash file systems used in personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , cellphones , MP3 players , digital cameras , USB flash drives ( UFDs ) , and even laptop computers .
In many cases , the file systems for commercial devices can be custom and proprietary , but they face the same challenges discussed below .
Flash - based file systems come in a variety of forms .
This article explores a couple of the read - only file systems and also reviews the various read / write file systems available today and how they work .
But first , let 's explore the flash devices and the challenges that they introduce .
Flash memory technologies
Flash memory , which can come in several different technologies , is non-volatile memory , which means that its contents persist after its source of power is removed .
For a great history of flash memory devices , see Related topics .
Two of the most common types of flash devices are defined by their respective technologies : NOR and NAND .
NOR - based flash is the older technology that supported high read performance at the expense of smaller capacities .
NAND flash offers higher capacities with significantly faster write and erase performance .
NAND also requires a much more complicated input / output ( I/O ) interface .
Flash parts are commonly divided into partitions , which allows multiple operations to occur simultaneously ( erasing one partition while reading from another ) .
Partitions are further divided into blocks ( commonly 64 KB or 128 KB in size ) .
Firmware that uses the partitions can further apply unique segmenting to the blocks — for example , 512 - byte segments within a block , not including metadata .
Flash devices exhibit a common constraint that requires device management when compared to other storage devices such as RAM disks .
The only Write operation permitted on a flash memory device is to change a bit from a one to a zero .
If the reverse operation is needed , then the block must be erased ( to reset all bits to the one state ) .
This means that other valid data within the block must be moved for it to persist .
NOR flash memory can typically be programmed a byte at a time , whereas NAND flash memory must be programmed in multi- byte bursts ( typically , 512 bytes ) .
The process of erasing a block differs between the two memory types .
Each requires a special Erase operation that covers an entire block of the flash memory .
NOR technology requires a precursor step to clear all values to zero before the Erase operation can begin .
An Erase is a special operation with the flash device and can be time - consuming .
Erasing is an electrical operation that drains the electrons from each cell in an entire block .
NOR flash devices typically require seconds for the Erase operation , whereas a NAND device can erase in milliseconds .
A key characteristic of flash devices is the number of Erase operations that can be performed .
In a NOR device , each block in the flash memory can be erased up to 100,000 times .
NAND flash memories can be erased up to one million times .
Flash memory challenges
In addition to and as a result of the constraints explored in the previous section , managing flash devices presents several challenges .
The three most important are garbage collection , managing bad blocks , and wear leveling .
Garbage collection
Garbage collection is the process of reclaiming invalid blocks ( those that contain some amount of invalid data ) .
Reclamation involves moving the valid data to a new block , and then erasing the invalid block to make it available .
This process is commonly done in the background or as needed , if the file system is low on available space .
Managing bad blocks
Over time , flash devices can develop bad blocks through use and can even ship from the manufacturer with blocks that are bad and cannot be used .
You can detect the presence of back blocks from a failed flash operation ( such as an Erase ) or an invalid Write operation ( discovered through an invalid Error Correction Code , or ECC ) .
After bad blocks have been identified , they are marked within the flash itself in a bad block table .
How this is done is device - dependent but can be implemented with a separate set of reserved blocks managed separately from normal data blocks .
The process of handling bad blocks — whether they ship with the device or appear over time — is called bad block management .
In some cases , this functionality is implemented in hardware by an internal microcontroller and is therefore transparent to the upper - level file system .
Wear leveling
Recall that flash devices are consumable parts :
You can perform a finite number of Erase cycles on each block before the block becomes bad ( and must therefore be tagged by bad block management ) .
To maximize the life of the flash , wear - leveling algorithms are provided .
Wear leveling comes in two varieties : dynamic wear leveling and static wear leveling .
Dynamic wear leveling addresses the problem of a limited number of Erase cycles for a given block .
Rather than randomly using blocks as they are available , dynamic wear - leveling algorithms attempt to evenly distribute the use of blocks so that each gets uniform use .
Static wear - leveling algorithms address an even more interesting problem .
In addition to a maximum number of Erase cycles , certain flash devices suffer from a maximum number of Read cycles between Erase cycles .
This means that if data sits for too long in a block and is read too many times , the data can dissipate and result in data loss .
Static wear - leveling algorithms address this by periodically moving stale data to new blocks .
System architecture
So far , I 've explored flash devices and their fundamental challenges .
Now , look at how these pieces come together as part of a layered architecture ( see Figure 1 ) .
At the top is the virtual file system ( VFS ) , which presents a common interface to higher - level applications .
The VFS is followed by the flash file system , which will be covered in the next section .
Next is the Flash Translation Layer ( FTL ) , which provides for overall management of the flash device , including allocation of blocks from the underlying flash device as well as address translation , dynamic wear leveling , and garbage collection .
In some flash devices , a portion of the FTL can be implemented in hardware .
Figure 1 . Basic architecture of a flash system
The Linux kernel uses the Memory Technology Device ( MTD ) interface , which is a generic interface for flash devices .
The MTD can automatically detect the width of the flash device bus and the number of devices necessary for implementing the bus width .
Flash file systems
Several flash file systems are available for Linux .
The next sections explain the design and advantages of each .
Journaling Flash File System
One of the earliest flash file systems for Linux is called the Journaling Flash File System .
JFFS is a log - structured file system that was designed for NOR flash devices .
It was unique and addressed a variety of problems with flash devices , but it created another .
JFFS viewed the flash device as a circular log of blocks .
Data written to the flash is written to the tail , and blocks at the head are reclaimed .
The space between the tail and head is free space ; when this space becomes low , the garbage collector is executed .
The garbage collector moves valid blocks to the tail of the log , skips invalid or obsolete blocks , and erases them ( see Figure 2 ) .
The result is a file system that is automatically wear leveled both statically and dynamically .
The fundamental problem with this architecture is that the flash device is erased too often ( instead of an optimal erase strategy ) , which wears the device out too quickly .
Figure 2 . Circular log before and after garbage collection
When a JFFS is mounted , the structural details are read into memory , which can be slow at mount - time and consume more memory than desired .
Journaling Flash File System 2
Although JFFS was very useful in its time , its wear - leveling algorithm tended to shorten the life of NOR flash devices .
The result was a redesign of the underlying algorithm to remove the circular log .
The JFFS2 algorithm was designed for NAND flash devices and also includes improved performance with compression .
In JFFS2 , each block in the flash is treated independently .
JFFS2 maintains block lists to sufficiently wear - level the device .
The clean list represents blocks on the device that are full of valid nodes .
The dirty list contains blocks with at least one obsoleted node .
Finally , the free list represents the blocks that have been erased and are available for use .
The garbage collection algorithm can then intelligently decide what to reclaim in a reasonable way .
Currently , the algorithm probabilistically selects from the clean or dirty list .
The dirty list is selected 99 percent of the time to reclaim blocks ( moving the valid contents to another block ) , and the clean list is selected 1 percent of the time ( simply moving the contents to a new block ) .
In both cases , the selected block is erased and placed on the free list ( see Figure 3 ) .
This allows the garbage collector to re-use blocks that are obsoleted ( or partially so ) but still move data around the flash to support static wear leveling .
Figure 3 . Block management and garbage collection in JFFS2
Yet Another Flash File System
YAFFS is another flash file system developed for NAND flash .
The initial version ( YAFFS ) supported flash devices with 512 - byte pages , but the newer version ( YAFFS2 ) supports newer devices with larger page sizes and greater Write constraints .
In most flash file systems , obsolete blocks are marked as such , but YAFFS2 additionally marks blocks with monotonically increasing sequence numbers .
When the file system is scanned at mount time , the valid inodes can be quickly identified .
YAFFS also maintains trees in RAM to represent the block structure of the flash device , including fast mounting through checkpointing — the process of saving the RAM tree structure to the flash device on a normal unmount so that it can be quickly read and restored to RAM at mount time ( see Figure 4 ) .
Mount - time performance is a great advantage of YAFFS2 over other flash file systems .
Figure 4 . YAFFS2 mount - time optimization through checkpointing
Read - only compressed file systems
In some embedded systems , there 's no need to provide a mutable file system :
An immutable one will suffice .
Linux supports a variety of read - only file systems , two of the most useful are cramfs and SquashFS .
Cramfs
The cramfs file system is a compressed read - only Linux file system that can exist within flash devices .
The primary characteristics of cramfs are that it is both simple and space - efficient .
This file system is used in small - footprint embedded designs .
While cramfs metadata is not compressed , cramfs uses zlib compression on a per-page basis to allow random page access ( pages are decompressed upon access ) .
You can play with cramfs using the mkcramfs utility and the loopback device .
SquashFS
SquashFS is another compressed read - only Linux file system that is useful within flash devices .
You 'll also find SquashFS in numerous Live CD Linux distributions .
In addition to supporting zlib for compression , SquashFS uses Lembel - Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm ( LZMA ) for improved compression and speed .
Like cramfs , you can use SquashFS on a standard Linux system with mksquashfs and the loopback device .
Going further
Like most of open source , software continues to evolve , and new flash file systems are under development .
An interesting alternative still in development is LogFS , which includes some very novel ideas .
For example , LogFS maintains a tree structure on the flash device itself so that the mount times are similar to traditional file systems , such as ext2 .
It also uses a wandering tree for garbage collection ( a form of B+tree ) .
What makes LogFS particularly interesting , however , is that it is very scalable and can support large flash parts .
With the growing popularity of flash file systems , you 'll see a considerable amount of research being applied toward them .
LogFS is one example , but other options , such as UbiFS , are also growing .
Flash file systems are interesting architecturally and will continue to be a source of innovation in the future .
