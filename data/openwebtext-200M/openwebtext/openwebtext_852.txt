NEW YORK -- Transit officials voted today for a package of steep fare hikes that will increase the cost of a single subway or bus ride from $ 2 to $ 2.50 .
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority 's finance committee approved the measure as state lawmakers sought to reach a compromise on a bailout plan that would avoid the worst of the planned fare increases and service cuts .
Under the proposal , the price of a monthly MetroCard would rise by $ 22 to $ 103 , and a weekly unlimited - ride MetroCard would jump by $ 6 to $ 31 .
The full MTA board will vote on the fare increases Wednesday following today 's vote by the finance committee .
The fare hikes and service cuts would take effect June 1 .
The MTA adopted a budget in December designed to close a $ 1.1 billion gap in its operating budget by raising fare and toll revenues by 23 percent .
The board also approved sweeping service cuts , including eliminating 21 local bus routes .
Gov. David Paterson and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver support a bailout for the MTA in which transit riders , motorists and businesses would share the pain .
Under that plan , crafted by a state commission headed by former MTA Chairman Richard Ravitch , fares would rise 8 percent on average , drivers would pay to use the free East and Harlem River bridges and businesses in the MTA 's 12 - county region would be charged a payroll tax .
State Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith was still seeking a compromise to the Ravitch proposal today .
Negotiations were continuing .
The MTA is a state agency that runs New York City 's subways and public buses , the Metro - North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road , the Long Island Bus system and several bridges and tunnels .
It has $ 27 billion in debt .

" You were dead , you were sleeping the big sleep .
...
You just slept the big sleep , not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell . "
– The Big Sleep
It seems fitting to quote Raymond Chandler about the death of Roger Simon 's dream , since Simon fancies himself a mystery and screenwriter .
Pajamas Media – the network of conservative and rightwing blogs that Simon cofounded in 2005 – will cease operations as of March 31 , and its death can't have come a moment soon .
It not only died a nasty death , to quote Chandler , it lived a nasty life .
Could it be that its demise , along with Barack Obama 's ascendancy , signals a kinder , gentler era upon us ?
I would n't hold my breath .
But there is something to this passing of a neocon media icon .
It was hopelessly out of synch with the new political trends in our country .
We knew Pajamas Media had jumped the shark when it sent Joe the Plumber to Israel during the Gaza war to urge it to kill more Palestinians better .
Joe reached his journalistic apotheosis when the " war correspondent " called for journalists to be barred from war zones .
I thought that was biting off one 's nose to spite one 's face .
And let 's not forget some of Pajamas ' other greatest hits , provided by eminent bloggers like Pam Geller of Atlas Shrugs , who never seems to have met a Muslim who did n't want to exterminate Jews .
She returned the favour in a blog post that featured a cartoon of a B - 52 with the caption " Take back Jerusalem .
Send in the B - 52s , " referring , of course , to Arab East Jerusalem .
Then there 's Michael Totten , described by Simon as a " hard - headed liberal " ( which in itself tells you a lot about the extremism of Simon 's views , who wrote Lebanon and Iraq : Partners in Freedom .
Totten was so incensed that his anti-Syrian , anti-Hezbollah , anti-Islamist politics provoked suspicion from Lebanese that he might be a CIA spy , that he penned this indignant , and unintentionally comic , rejoinder :
I am not a spy .
Got that ?
I. Am. Not. A. Spy .
Almost every frigging day in this country someone accuses me ... of being a spy .
...
When Muslims do it the sense of humour in their voice is notably lacking .
When Hezbollah does it I know good and goddamn well they are n't joking .
The flaming eyes , the screaming and the physical belligerence kinda sorta gives that away .
I could n't help thinking of Dennis the Peasant , who dogged Simon from day one , nipping at his heels like a pesky terrier .
Dennis called it from the beginning .
He knew there was no business model .
He knew it could n't work .
The only thing Dennis got wrong was the date of the enterprise 's demise .
He thought it would die much sooner .
I 'm guessing that the venture capitalists were having too much fun with their media playtoy and could n't bear to pull the plug when they should have .
The losers were Aubrey Chernick , a Los Angeles internet entrepreneur and flag - waving pro-Israel type who parlayed his fortune in software development into new business opportunities hardening American targets for the upcoming war between Islam and the west .
After his life as a software guru , his new business mined the rich opportunities posed by the Bush - era homeland security gold mine .
I 'm guessing that he 's taken a hit since the rise of a new administration , which will likely downplay the war on terror and other disaster " opportunities . "
Chernick and Levi-Strauss heir Jim Koshland initially invested $ 7 m in their Pajamas Media venture .
Given that Chernick was worth nearly a billion a year or two ago , he probably did n't lose much ; that is , if the recent Wall Street debacle has n't wiped him out entirely .
My , but Koshland does have egg on his face after making this triumphal statement back in 2003 :
We are pleased to be involved with Pajamas Media in an era when the demand for new and unique channels of information grows and the convergence of blogging , news coverage and advertising begins . …
We anticipate that Pajamas Media will have a profound and positive market impact due to its outstanding team and unique business approach .
We believe successful industry trends such as AOL 's acquisition of weblogs validates the emergence of blogging as an important new media market .
This financing will allow the company to accelerate its growth and solidify its market position .
How is it that a " local yokel " from Ohio like Dennis knows more about perils of investing in blogs than a Silicon Valley entrepreneur like Koshland ?
In truth , Dennis knew what they should have and what any political blogger can tell you :
It 's very , very difficult to monetise political blogs .
You have to have a huge audience before you can earn any serious income .
And if you go into blogging expecting that you can or will earn from it , you 're probably fooling yourself .
A political blog features ideas as content .
As such they are far different than other types of blogs featuring entertainment , lifestyle or products .
Readers are far less likely to make major purchases online via a political blog than they might at other types of blogs .
So it becomes harder to earn serious revenue from political blogs .
That 's probably why Pajamas Media failed and why Koshland , Chernick and Simon miscalculated in such a fundamental way .
I had so much fun ragging on the Pajamaphiles , though , that it 's a shame their piggybank has broken .
Where will I find such rich targets ?
Oh and let 's not forget some of the other forlorn rightwing has - beens left hanging out to dry .
It could n't have happened to a more deserving crew : former Clinton - lib turned Bush booster , Ron Silver ; UN whistleblower and John Bolton acolyte , Claudi Rosset ; aging commie hunter , Ron Radosh ; Israeli neocon , Allison Kaplan Sommer ; Michael " Throw - some - small - crappy - little - country-up- against- a - wall " Ledeen ; and possibly the world 's only ex-radical feminist turned Likudist neocon , Phyllis Chesler .
No , they wo n't go away since they 'll have their own online soapboxes from which to yammer .
But they 'll have one less venue from which to trumpet their discordant notes .
What annoyed me most about Pajamas Media was that it was a major online base for the über - Israel crowd .
One of the themes of the site was waving that blue and white flag through every war and skirmish .
That was no doubt a result partially a reflection of the views of founders like Charles Johnson ( Little Green Footballs ) and Chernick 's own support for rightwing groups like Stand With Us .
I thought that planting Pajamas Media 's flag squarely on the Israeli side of the conflict and making it a major part of the portal 's identity would have guaranteed it niche status .
But Obama 's election , a rising tide of progressivism in US politics , the receding of the neocon monolith seem to have all contributed to the final big sleep of Pajamas Media .
When I visited Australia in 2003 , I had an incredible time .
Australians are my kinda folks : loud , blunt , funny , and they have those silly accents .
One aspect that shocked me , though , was how popular homeopathy is there .
We went into a pharmacy so I could get decongestants ( this entire planet irritates my sinuses ) , and the homeopathic garbage was everywhere .
Richard Saunders , my host ( and arguably Oz 's most famous skeptic ) , told me that the homeopaths spend a lot of money to get their stuff into pharmacies there , including paying for attractive displays to make their diluted water more eye - catching .
There was an entire wall devoted to homeopathic placebos in one place we went .
Richard and the Australian Skeptics have taken it on themselves to fight this sort of flim - flam .
They created a one - page PDF ad taking the pharmacies to task for it .
Richard created a JPG version which I uploaded to my Flickr page as well :
Feel free to use this to promote on your own site , blog , whatever .
Print the PDF version and send it to local papers , or to local pharmacies .
It 's written for Australia , but it applies universally .
Truth always does .
Xfce making great strides with version 4.6
A little more than two years after version 4.4 was released into the wild ( on 21 January 2007 ) , the Xfce development team has announced the availability of the new version of the Xfce desktop environment yesterday ( yes I ’m late to the party … ) .
In an email , release manager Stephan Arts announced the new version 4.6 ( only even numbers are used for stable releases ) , which has already been picked up in various articles all over the web ’s darkest corners .
Xfce is an integral part of Xubuntu .
In its role as the desktop environment it provides vital applications such as the panels , the desktop , the file manager and the window manager ( i.e. the thing that paints the borders around your windows and handles how they are placed in your screen ) , among others .
In fact , it is the primary reason for Xubuntu ’s existence – when Jani Monoses founded the project he did so because he wanted to combine the features of Xfce with the advantages Ubuntu brings .
So what ’s new ?
Due to technical problems , I have n’t been able to run Xfce 4.6 on my personal computer as of yet ( something which I hope to change in the coming week ) , so I ’m going to base myself on the excellent Xfce tour prepared by Xfce developer and previous Xubuntu developer Jérôme Guelfucci and my experiences while running Xubuntu from my USB drive .
I ’ll also be using the screenshots provided by Xfce developer and Xubuntu - Xfce Liaison Jannis Pohlmann because I ’m lazy .
First of all , Xfce ’s panel ( xfce4 - panel ) has received some love with lots of bugs fixed that especially the proud owners of multiple monitors wo n’t mind to miss .
It also comes with updated panel plugins .
This adds nifty new features to e.g. the system tray , which now allows you to hide certain icons .
This is quite useful to hide , for example , that NetworkManager icon that always sits there yet is almost never needed after your network has been set up .
Although not part of the release , the screenshot plugin has been developed into its own application by Jérôme Guelfucci ( and David Collins added some nice new features , too ) and is now named Xfce4 Screenshooter .
It , among other features , allows you to capture a region of the screen or a single application .
Now the keyboard shortcut for PrtScn can be set by default :) .
The desktop manager , xfdesktop , now includes an oft - requested feature : rubber banding , or the ability to click and drag to select multiple icons to manipulate .
Furthermore , the Xfce menu is now a submenu of the context menu when you have icons on your desktop – something that some people have expressed dissatisfaction about .
On the xfce4 - mixer front , Jannis Pohlmann has rewritten it to sport a more polished interface , and to use Gstreamer .
Some refer to this as bloat , but it really makes for a more maintainable application that supports multiple sound systems more easily , is better tested and will work on the systems of more people ( although it will undoubtly not work on the systems of some others , namely those who ca n’t get Gstreamer to work ) .
With the new mixer also comes a panel plugin that allows you to change the volume with a mere scroll over the panel icon , which is very useful unless you do n’t have a scroll wheel .
The session manager has also received some love .
Based on code in Xubuntu , originally written by Jani Monoses , but almost entirely rewritten , Xfce now supports suspending and hibernation by default .
Though the Suspend and Hibernate buttons might attract a bit too much attention with their size , considering how often they ’ll be used , it ’s a useful addition nonetheless .
A feature that will help out a lot of users and will save me a lot providing support , is its ability to automatically restart important applications if they just so happen to crash .
The reason this is so useful is because the panel has a habit of occasionally crashing seemingly without reason , with people left not knowing what to do .
Of course , the Xfce Window Manager , xfwm4 , was also updated , mainly thanks to the work of the Xfce project founder Olivier Fourdan , from France .
It can now see when an application is busy and wo n’t respond , and offer you to force it to quit .
It also offers a useful new “ Fill ” option that allows you to resize a window to use as much space as possible that is left unused by other windows .
This can come in handy when working with applications such as the Gimp .
Besides these improvements there are some other tweaks and stability and performance improvements .
Xfce ’s file manager that Benedikt Meurer developed for Xfce 4.4 , Thunar , has received attention from Nick Schermer and Jannis Pohlmann .
Being one of Xfce ’s show - off applications , it just got a little better with many bug fixes and performance improvements coming in .
It also ships a new plugin to set an image as your wallpaper from within Thunar , and now follows the XDG user directories specification , which basically means that it provides you with folders for Music , Videos , Pictures , etc. and translates their names if you use another language .
Furthermore , connected drives that have not been mounted ( i.e. prepared for reading by the computer ) will be distinguishable by their translucent icons .
Encrypted devices are now supported as well .
As for Xubuntu , word has it that we may get folder sharing in 9.04 , which many people have been clamouring for .
Jannis Pohlmann and Jasper Huijsmans have been working on a rewrite of the AppFinder .
It now has a cleaner interface and updates in real - time , as always allowing you to easily find installed applications and , by dragging them to the Launcher - creation interface , easily create panel shortcuts .
The Xfce menu has also been updated to really comply with the freedesktop.org standard ( perhaps you noticed that the menu in previous versions was structured a bit oddly ) .
Unfortunately , no menu editor is included and , with menu merging not being supported yet , using an alternative menu editor like Alacarte wo n’t work either .
It ’s manually editing the files or making do with the menu as - is , for now .
And last but certainly not least , one of the biggest new features : xfconf .
Admitted , you wo n’t ( should n’t ) notice much of this , but it ’s quite the improvement .
Basically , it provides a new , central configuration system for Xfce similar to , but simpler than , GNOME ’s gconf .
It does offer some nifty new useful applications though .
For example , there ’s now one central place to edit the settings of all applications that use xfconf – the Settings Editor ( xfce4 - settings - editor ) .
It also includes a command - line tool , and it is this that looks extremely valuable to me .
Not because I like to type commands , but because you can bind them to keyboard shortcuts .
Yep – editing preferences with a simple key combination .
For example , if you ’re a programmer , it can be very useful to switch your keyboard layout on - the - fly – use dead keys when doing normal stuff like writing a blog post , and stop using them when you ’re programming and want your quotes to appear directly .
With xfconf , this can be done very easily .
For example , the command to set your keyboard layout to the US layout without dead keys , you ’d use :
xfconf - query -c keyboard - layout -p / Default / XkbLayout -s " us " && xfconf - query -c keyboard - layout -p / Default / XkbVariant -s " altgr- intl "
Similarly , if you wanted to change the layout to US with dead keys , you ’d use :
xfconf - query -c keyboard - layout -p / Default / XkbLayout -s " us " && xfconf - query -c keyboard - layout -p / Default / XkbVariant -s " intl "
Now all you need to do is bind them to a keyboard shortcut and you ’ll be set !
Of course , this is some pretty advanced stuff , but it ’s there when you need it and hardly noticeable when you do n’t .
Plus , it might make for a good blog post in the future , so if you have any more useful applications of this , do tell me :) .
With the new settings backend comes a new Settings Manager which allows you to edit many of the settings in one window and is more neatly organised and better suited to small monitors in general .
Furthermore , a lot of the settings windows have been redesigned and options have been added – I ’ll kindly refer you to the excellent tour for an overview .
So how do I get it ?
You can download Xfce in source code form or using the oft - praised graphical installers .
Packages for several distributions will without doubt already be available .
However , the easiest and recommended way is to wait for your distribution to provide the packages .
Xubuntu 9.04 will have Xfce 4.6.0 and already has Release Candidate 1 .
If we ’re lucky , version 4.6.1 will even make it in time which will contain the first important bugfixes and translation updates .
If you ’re running Xubuntu 8.04 “ Hardy Heron ” or 8.10 “ Intrepid Ibex ” , then you ’re lucky , because Jérôme Guelfucci has prepared packages with help of the Debian Xfce group and Lionel Le Folgoc .
So what is ahead ?
The Xfce development team is already looking forward to version 4.8 .
The plan is to do a shorter release cycle this time , with one ( probably optimistic ) guess targeting a new release in about a year .
Some excellent features have already been developed to be included in 4.8 , such as my pet peeve drag ‘n drop support for panel icons ( no more messing with commands in launchers ! ) , menu merging so you can actually use a menu editor , and several improvements to Thunar .
All in all , this has shaped up to be a very nice release with some excellent new features , some of them nowhere to be found in other desktop environments , which demonstrates once again why I like Xfce for more than performance alone .
With some of the improvements for 4.8 already checked in and many more waiting in line , I ’m already excited .
I ’ve fallen far short when it comes to attributions , failing to name Xfce ’s excellent translation team , the people behind the Xfce distros , the various communites , Brian Tarricone , Mike Massonnet , - I guess I should stop naming people because I ’m bound to forget many more , or even people of whom I do n’t even know they ’ve contributed .
To whomever contributed to Xfce in any way : thanks ! 🙂
Automobile Industry Crisis Opel Seeks to Become Independent GM Unit
German carmaker
Opel says it will seek greater independence from US parent company General Motors .
With a restructuring plan presented on Friday , the company aims to become a mostly autonomous unit that would remain part of GM .
To implement the plan , though , Opel would require 3.3 billion euros in fresh capital .

Boy , that Tyler Perry sure is popular .
While all eyes were focused on the big Jonas Brothers :
The 3D Concert Experience release , holdover Madea Goes to Jail snuck by with the box - office crown for the second week in a row .
The comedy grossed $ 16.5 million , significantly more than Jonas ’s $ 12.7 million .
Fox Searchlight ’s decision to expand Slumdog Millionaire paid off , allowing the Oscar - winning film to gross $ 12.2 million , up 45 % from last week .
I just wish it could have gotten over the hump to unseat Jonas from the number two spot .
Next on the list was Taken at number four with just under $ 10 million .
The pic was down just 12 % this week .
At number five was Warner Bros .
He ’s Just Not That Into You with $ 5.9 million .
Street Fighter : The Legend of Chun Li came in at number eight with $ 4.7 million … fairly disappointing , but bad word - of - mouth , a lack of pre-release screenings , and Fox ’s utter lack of faith in the pic make its debut numbers more understandable .
The rest of the top ten included Paul Blart : Mall Cop at number six with $ 5.6 million , Coraline at seven with $ 5.3 million , Confessions of a Shopaholic at nine , and Fired Up ! at ten .
Jindal 's Response ...
Awful .
He walked out like an earnest dork and has a weird inflection , trying to sound upbeat and sunny when it 's clearly not his natural metier .
It sounds false , and he looks false .
I do n't care how much of a star Jindal is , America does n't elect somewhat - off dorks as president .
Key quotes :
Gee , I think all I got is acetylsalicylic acid , generic .
See , I can get six hundred tablets of that for the same price as three hundred of a name brand .
That makes good financial sense , good advice .
Hey , this is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia , Canada , $ 24.95 a pound !
It only cost me $ 14.12 after tax , though .

You havin ' a good time , Mark ?

Morgan Tsvangirai , the Zimbabwean opposition leader , has agreed to join a unity government with President Robert Mugabe amid intense regional pressure and warnings that the deadliest cholera outbreak in Africa for 15 years threatens to get worse .
Tsvangirai made the announcement after a meeting of the Movement for Democratic Change 's national council , which had been divided on whether to accept a settlement proposed this week by the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) .
" We are unequivocal , we will go into this government , " Tsvangirai told reporters in Harare .
" The SADC has decided and we are bound by that decision . "
Tsvangirai is due to be sworn in as prime minister on 11 February , with ministers taking office two days later .
While the mistrust between Tsvangirai and Mugabe remains , and a number of contentious issues have yet to be decided , the political thaw will raise hopes that the country 's disastrous economic and health situation can now be eased .
The World Health Organisation said yesterday that 69 Zimbabweans had died of cholera in the previous 24 hours , taking the number of deaths to 3,161 since August .
The total number of infections was more than 60,000 , surpassing the organisation 's " worst - case scenario " .
On Thursday it emerged that the United Nations is to halve its food rations to 7 million Zimbabweans , about 70 % of the country 's remaining population .
The World Food Programme says it cut the ration to meet increased demand and cope with a shortfall in donations .
International donors have refused to provide financial aid until a unity government is in place .
The MDC and Mugabe 's ruling Zanu - PF party originally agreed to share power on 15 September after controversial elections that saw Tsvangirai win the first round of the presidential poll but abandon the run -off due to state - sponsored violence .
The agreement soon fell apart when Mugabe , who has held power since 1980 , refused to divide the key ministries fairly .
Police then arrested dozens of MDC activists and officials on dubious grounds , and many of them remain in custody .
With the effects of Zimbabwe 's meltdown spilling into neighbouring countries , SADC leaders have been desperate to get a coalition government in place .
Analysts say that if Tsvangirai had walked away from the power - sharing option , he could have faced domestic criticism for putting his own interests ahead of the country .
Lance Armstrong 's broken collarbone may not improve his chances of winning the Tour de France this year .
But his aspirations for the race have gone farther than a record eighth victory .
In 2006 , Mr. Armstrong embarked on an effort to overhaul professional cycling that , in some scenarios , would involve him owning a stake in cycling 's most prestigious race .
The race is owned by a family - run French company that says it has been approached by numerous entities looking to buy the race over the years .
It says the Tour de France ...
Colbert calls Hannity 's praise for Rush ' obsequious crack - licking ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday March 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Seeing a pattern in the rush by Republicans to compliment Rush Limbaugh immediately after they have offended him and been castigated for it on his radio show , Steven Colbert theorized that FOX's Sean Hannity must have said something truly horrendous to warrant such " obsequious crack - licking " as the praise he poured on to Limbaugh earlier this week .
Sean Hannity complimented Limbaugh on his March 3 Hannity program by saying , " Rush is by far the most articulate , defining voice of conservatism in America today , the most articulate voice of raging conservatism in the country .
Rush is a powerful voice .
I would argue that Rush is the leader of the conservative movement in the country . "
Comedy Central 's Colbert sees a pattern from conservatives who praise Limbaugh .
He noted on The Colbert Report Thursday , " These days you only hear gushy praise and shameless grovelling like that right after someone pissed off Rush . "
RNC Chairman Michael Steele and Georgia Republican Congressman Phil Gingrey have both issued public apologies to Limbaugh after earlier criticizing his harsh and extremist views .
" I mean to warrant obsequious crack - licking like that , he must have said something terrible , " theorized Colbert of Hannity 's praise .
" I mean -- something like the vacuum in Republican leadership has allowed a mean - spirited , lard - assed talk radio host to become the de facto leader which is turning an already crippled party into a bickering laughingstock . "
Colbert also mocked Limbaugh for his criticism of the unconstitutional 
Troubled Assets Relief Program at his speech to C - PAC last Saturday  the same speech which also contained a fumbling reference to life , liberty , freedom and the pursuit of happiness .
Limbaugh incorrectly attributed that to the preamble of the Constitution when it was actually in the Declaration of Independence , though there was no mention of freedom in that particular line .
For this feat , Colbert gave a  Tip of the Hat to Limbaugh for changing the Constitution . 
 The liberals all want it to be a ' living document ' , well Rush just took it one step further and made it a Wikipedia entry ,  Colbert said .

On 1 - 27 - 10 , the San Francisco Commonwealth Club nationally syndicated NPR Program featured John Yoo Author of the notorious " Torture Memos " promoting his book about presidential power " Crisis and Command " - was shut down five times by WORLD CAN'T WAIT protesters throughout this program .
This NPR program is currently being replayed around the country on NPR radio affiliates .
Throughout the evening , many protesters engaged attendees coming in and out of the prestigious Commonwealth Club .
The program was moderated by Stanford Law School professor Alan Wiener who was also protested for legitimizing Yoo by participating ... regardless of a few hard ball questions at the end of the program .
Below are transcriptions of the protesters comments .
Protesters start times are indicated because each was spaced 5 - 15 minutes apart throughout the program .
Each protester was quickly and peacefully escorted out by police .
This Minnesota Public Radio audio program begins with a brief commentary and is briefly interrupted for commentary .
1:49 John
Yoo is a war criminal .
He is directly responsible for the torture of thousands of people , thousands of innocent people all over the world .
John
Yoo is a war criminal .
He should be in prison .
He should n't be teaching at UC Berkeley .
He should be fired , disbarred , prosecuted for war crimes ...
13:51 John
Yoo is a war criminal .
War Criminal !
The Nuremberg judgments say attorneys who assist in the commission of war crimes are war criminals .
You are a war criminal .
Torture is a war crime .
A war crime .
19:20 Professor Wiener , you may be a good person .
You may be an ethical professor .
But , why are you giving John Yoo legitimacy ?
What you have to make a decision whether you think torture is okay or not .
Torture is never okay .
It is not okay to torture .
He is a war criminal .
John
Yoo is a war criminal .
He should be prosecuted to the fullest ...

To sit here politely with the most important torturer on earth is wrong .
Ehrich sez , " Alton Towers , the UK theme park and gardens ( where , fun fact , my father was stationed during WWII ) , has an exciting offering for the whole family .
They 're offering to track you via RFID and sell you ( what I 'm assuming is ) CCTV footage of your day at the park , both on and off rides .
They do say ' We delete any unclaimed footage at the end of your visit so , if you do n't buy your personalised DVD before you leave , the moment will be gone forever . '
The program is voluntary , but it strikes me as strange that they 'd ask you to pay for tracking your movements through the park .
I understand that much of the footage you pay for is prerecorded .
I 'm not sure how much of ' you ' one actually gets to see on the DVD . "
It 's YourDay and you 're the star
( Thanks , Ehrich ! )

As if it was n’t bad enough , that CNBC ’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer took what is widely perceived to be a beating at the hands of The Daily Show host Jon Stewart on Thursday .
Now word comes out that some at CNBC are furious with Cramer for not defending the business network .
As Howard Kurtz reported in today ’s Washington Post , “ Cramer has told colleagues he felt blindsided by Stewart ’s hostile approach .
But many CNBC staffers were furious with Cramer yesterday for failing to defend the network ’s reporting or to criticize Stewart ’s video clips as selectively edited or out of context .
CNBC declined all interview requests , saying in a statement : “ CNBC produces more than 150 hours of live television a week that includes more than 850 interviews in the service of exposing all sides of every critical financial and economic issue .
We are proud of our record . ”
Seriously , Cramer felt blindsided ?
Apparently Cramer really meant what he said , before he went on The Daily Show , on Today about Stewart being a comedian .
If this is the case then Jim Cramer was lazy and did n’t do his homework before he sat down with Stewart .
Anyone who has ever watched Jon Stewart throughout his career could have told Cramer that is a capable and adept interviewer .
His capacity to do a serious interview is what separates his from other more entertainment based late night talk shows .
There was no blindsiding here .
In his previous segments about CNBC , Stewart used comedy , but also revealed his entire line of criticism of the business network .
Advertisements
Kurtz ’s report today confirms what I posted last night about NBC banning discussion of the interview .
Cramer had no duty to defend CNBC .
What he tried to do was defend himself and the system at large .
It looks like CNBC is trying to scapegoat Cramer which is completely unfair .
I know people who do n’t watch CNBC might not believe this , but Cramer is one of the moderate voices on the channel , especially compared to the Santellis and Kudlows of the CNBC universe .
I do n’t think that NBC is realizing that their reaction is keeping a story that should have had a 24 hour shelf life alive .
How can such a large media organization be so blind , and in the dark ?
If CNBC wanted this story to go away , they could have talked about it on Friday , perhaps put out a press release stating that they are always striving to improve their business coverage , and the story would have died .
NBC has moved to damage control to blaming Cramer , but the network better be careful because despite a week of bad publicity , they need Cramer more than he needs them .

I 'm a petite girl , slim with long red hair and brown eyes .
The plan :
We spend a day together , probably a full 8 hours or so .
I spend the entire day either naked or wearing a short skirt and no panties as you prefer .
You spend the day playing video games , watching anime ( whatever it is you 'd like to do ) and watching hentai as often as you feel inclined .
I 'll be hanging out close by reading a book .
Every time you get turned on you tell me you want sex and tell me whether you want it missionary or doggy style .
I put down my book and get into the position you request in such a way that you can still see the hentai you were watching , lubing myself a little if necessary .
You put your dick in me , watch the hentai ( this is important , no sex without watching hentai ) , and thrust until you cum .
NO foreplay is involved with the exception of a little groping if you wish .
You do n't need to worry about lasting long or making me cum because the idea is that this is as much like masturbation as possible except you use my pussy instead of your hand because pussies feel better .
Experience and penis size are also not important .
What IS important though is frequency - you need to be able to do this at least once an hour .
This is a very important part of what I want , just a couple times is not enough .
There is no maximum amount , you can fuck me as many times as you want within the agreed upon timeframe .
To encourage you to do this as often as possible only vaginal penetration is allowed until you 've done that at least 12 times at which point you can use my ass if you like .
If you think you 're the guy I 'm describing please send me a message and tell me a little about yourself - hobbies , your favourite anime / games , why you like hentai , whether you 've had sex before , what the most you can cum in a day is , things like that - and include a few screen shots of your favourite hentai so I know what you like .
A picture of yourself would be nice but it 's not mandatory .
Also , if you like the sound of this but think you would n't be able to have sex that much then I 'm open to you and a friend sharing the job .
Obama ’s approval rating has been well above 60 % in tracking polls .
Public still sky - high on Obama ' brand '
With Barack Obama ’s victory in passing a massive stimulus package marred by days of bad press — as not a single House Republican backed the bill , his health czar went down in flames and his second pick for commerce secretary walked away — the administration has been cut down to size , and lost some of its bipartisan sheen .
Such , at least , has been the beltway chatter , but so far the numbers do n’t back it up .

Obama ’s approval rating remains well above 60 percent in tracking polls .
A range of state pollsters said they ’d seen no diminution in the president ’s sky - high approval ratings , and no improvement in congressional Republicans ’ dismal numbers .
And that ’s before the stimulus creates billions of dollars in spending on popular programs , which could , at least temporarily , further boost Obama ’s popularity .
“ It ’s eerie — I read the news from the Beltway , and there ’s this disconnect with the polls from the Midwest that I see all around me , ” said Ann Seltzer , the authoritative Iowa pollster who works throughout the Midwest .
That ’s a perception treasured by Obama ’s aides , who spent a two - year presidential campaign safeguarding “ the brand , ” as they called it , of a new , post - partisan sort of political figure .
With the stimulus safely passed , they say they ’re relying on the steady support of a populace that , after a closely watched election , is tuning out the Washington cut and thrust , and views Obama as a high - minded reformer and his Republican rivals as bitter partisans .
“ You should n’t judge his success in reaching out by the vote count in either chamber of Congress — you ’ve really got to judge it based more on what people in the country are thinking and saying , ” said John Del Cecato , a media adviser to Obama ’s campaign and former partner of Obama aide David Axelrod .
“ If you look at any number of public polls , and private polls support this , it ’s not just Democrats and independents who support the way he ’s gone about advancing the stimulus plan — it ’s a certain amount of Republicans too . ”
A CBS News poll released February 5 , for instance , found 81 percent of Americans said Obama is reaching out to congressional Republicans , while just 41 percent said the congressional Republicans were looking for bipartisanship .
“ There have been a number of different surveys that have shown that Americans perceive that Obama is extending a hand of cooperation , a hand that the Republican leadership is not reciprocating — that ’s very striking in the data , ” said Mark Blumenthal , the editor of Pollster.com , who also noted that Obama has managed to remain popular even with some Republicans .
“ Everyone ’s talking about spending , spending , spending and — 20 to 30 percent of Republicans approve of his performance , ” said Blumenthal .
“ How is that bad ? ”
Republican leaders make the case that the reassertion of partisan reality will , in time , take the sheen off the new president .
“ What ’s regrettable is that Republicans are being cast as the partisans as a way to deflect attention away from Congressional Democrats ’ failure to craft an effective — and bipartisan — economic stimulus bill , ” said a spokeswoman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner .
“ But we do n’t control anything in Washington , so using us as a political whipping boy is laughable .
At some point , the American people will expect the results and action rather than blame and deflection .
Only time will tell when their patience will run thin . ”
There ’s another possibility , however : That In opposing en masse a stimulus bill that means instant , massive national spending , the GOP is cast as the Grinch to Obama ’s Santa Claus .
And outside Washington , Obama ’s aides anticipate , the spending will drown out the chatter about recent White House stumbles .
“ Let ’s be honest : Will the economic recovery or Judd Gregg be a bigger discussion point a week from now ? ”
Obama ’s chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , asked reporters Thursday .
Pollsters almost universally agreed with Emanuel .
“ I do n’t think he ’s lost anything in terms of overall job approval or favorability , ” said Andy Smith , a pollster at the University of New Hampshire .
“ That ’s just the a perception inside the Beltway that everybody outside Washington pays attention to politics and eats and lives politics the way you guys do down there . ”
As he builds up a record in office , pollsters agree that the value of Obama ’s brand will have more to do with his results , and less with his atmospherics .
“ Over time , the kind of disputes showed themselves in the final vote on the stimulus package — that kind of partisanship will become apparent to voters around the country , ” said Quinnipiac University pollster Peter Brown .
“ But whether that will be good or bad for Obama will mostly be a factor of whether people think their lives are getting better . ”

The big six energy companies in Britain are investing on average only £ 30 per year from each customer in renewable energy projects .
If this continues , the UK may miss its 2020 green targets by 50 % .
The findings , compiled for independent green power group Ecotricity , will be published ahead of the government 's biggest test yet on commercial confidence about wind power , the Tuesday deadline for bids on the third offshore licensing round .
Ecotricity claims that British Gas parent Centrica has spent £ 397.3 m on renewables over the last five years , only £ 13.28 per customer per year .
E.ON , the German - owned group at the centre of the Kingsnorth coal - fired power station controversy , spent just £ 210.5 m , £ 5.37 per customer .
" It is a scandal that the average investment in new build by the big six over the past five years does not even amount to £ 30 per customer .
This £ 30 is roughly what it would take for each company to meet the bare minimum legal obligation to grow renewables by about 1 % per year , " said Dale Vince , Ecotricity founder .
" While the big six are performing badly , more surprising perhaps is the lack of investment by two green independent companies .
With a zero investment in the last five years , they are contributing nothing to the urgent need for new build .
By contrast , Ecotricity has invested an average of over £ 450 per customer a year over the last five years , " he added .
The Ecotricity figures show the worst performing of the big six suppliers was EDF Energy , the French group , which is leading the charge to build nuclear reactors in Britain .
It is estimated to have invested £ 89.6 m on renewables in this country , or £ 14.14 per customer .
Green Energy and Good Energy have invested nothing , according to Ecotricity , but are purely supply companies which do not generate power , instead buying it on the open market .
Centrica hit back at the findings , saying the Ecotricity figures gave no indication about the level of future spending .
" If all the projects we are currently working on come to completion we could spend £ 3.5 bn building 1,500 megawatts of wind power over the next few years , " said a spokesman for the group .
The government 's renewables advisory board suggests that wind should provide us with a minimum of 31,000MW by 2020 , yet 2008 investment levels will generate less than half of the target , 13,849MW , or a 55 % shortfall .
Ecotricity says the energy regulator 's new green tariffs , issued earlier this month , are likely to make matters worse .
Ecotricity will not sign up to Ofgem 's guidelines as it predicts they will make green tariffs more confusing and expensive for consumers and will do nothing to encourage energy companies to build new renewable energy .
Accompanying updates to Apple 's line of desktops Tuesday is a new compact , wired keyboard with no numeric keypad .
It 's included with each new iMac by default , but can be swapped out for one that does include a numeric keypad at no additional cost when ordering online .
A rundown of Apple keyboards
Previously Apple offered just two keyboards : the wired version known as the Apple Keyboard and the Bluetooth - connected Apple Wireless Keyboard .
Today 's new compact keyboard adopts an appearance similar to its wireless counterpart as both lack a numeric keypad .
Both wired keyboards are flanked by USB 2.0 ports on each side .
The move gives Apple customers three keyboards to choose from : a wireless model , a wired keyboard with numeric keypad or a wired " compact " keyboard sans numeric keypad .
The new iMac ships with the compact wired keyboard by default , but customers can still build to order with the numeric keypad version included for no extra charge .
Meanwhile , Mac mini customers can also choose any of the three keyboards in a bundle with a Mighty Mouse .
Both wired keyboards come with a Mighty Mouse for $ 98 while the wireless keyboard is joined by the Wireless Mighty Mouse for $ 129 .
The full - size Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad comes standard with each new Mac Pro order , but the Cupertino - based Mac maker also offers the compact and wireless versions as swappable build - to - order options .

In an apparent , but by no means guaranteed , victory for pro-democracy forces , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was forced to reinstate Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry and other judges dismissed by the Musharraf regime in 2007 .
Chaudhry , a lightning - rod for opposition to military rule , resumed his duties March 22 , when supporters “ of the reinstated jurist raised the Pakistani flag at his residence , in keeping with a vow made by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto before her assassination 15 months ago , ” the Los Angeles Times reports .
Last week ’s announcement by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani was a major climb down for the Zardari administration and followed an escalating revolt against his authoritarian rule .
The move however , came after intense behind - the - scenes pressure by the United States and the Army ’s General Headquarters in Rawalpindi .
More than a thousand activists , including lawyers , party workers , left - wing and labor organizers had been arrested when the crisis accelerated February 25 .
The Pakistan High Court barred former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) and his younger brother Shabaz , toppled as the Governor of Punjab , from holding elected office , sparking outrage among citizens who believed Zardari had engineered the move .
The government has ordered that arrested protesters be released from jail and house arrest .
Ali Ahmad Kurd , a leader of the protesting lawyers , told The New York Times , “ No country can progress without an independent judiciary and the government–by restoring the chief justice and other judges –has also realized it , and we think it is a big success . ”
Among the lawyers ’ most prominent demands , now realized , was the restoration of Chief Justice Choudhry .
Toppled by the Musharraf dictatorship , Choudhry had championed the rights of the dispossessed and disappeared , some of whom were “ rendered ” to the Guantánamo Bay detention facility and CIA “ black sites . ”
In addition to hauling intelligence officers into court and demanding that illegally detained citizens receive a proper hearing , the Chief Justice enraged the country ’s venal ruling class by blocking the privatization of the Pakistan Steel Mills Corporation .
Despite a pledge to restore the Court when he assumed the presidency in September 2008 , Zardari reneged on that pledge , sparking the political crisis that ended in a route for the President .
Fearful that Choudhry would overturn the shameful National Reconciliation Ordinance ( NRO ) , an unprincipled agreement brokered by the criminal Bush regime , President - General Musharraf and the late Benazir Bhutto , Zardari imposed executive rule in Punjab .
As part of the U.S. - brokered deal , Musharraf had agreed to drop corruption charges against the Bhutto clan .
The die for Zardari was cast March 15 , after several hours of pitched battles in Lahore between activists and police .
After cruelly beating demonstrators and hurling tear gas grenades at peaceful protesters , police cordons melted away leaving the city center to triumphant pro-democracy activists .
The New York Times reported March 16 , that Saturday ’s Lahore clash transformed into a giant antigovernment protest when “ phalanxes of riot policemen here in Lahore melted away rather than continue to confront protesters who had rallied around the opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , when he defied a house arrest order early Sunday . ”
Additionally , “ party workers armed with cranes ” began dismantling roadblocks by police “ at junctions along the route to the capital . ”
One of the senior officials of the Lahore government , chief magistrate Sajjad Bhutta , “ told reporters he refused to carry out what he called the illegal acts of the police crackdown .
He appeared among the crowds on the mall , surrounded by cheers and waving flags , ” according to the Times .
Top police officials in Lahore , Punjab and even nationally , refused to carry out Zardari ’s orders and resigned .
The World Socialist Web Site reported , these “ included the Deputy Inspector General and the Superintendent of Police for Lahore .
In quitting his post as Pakistan ’s Deputy Attorney - General , Abdul Hai Gilani accused police of torturing protesters . ”
With the situation spinning out of control , Aitzaz Ahsan , a former PPP official and leader of the lawyers ’ movement declared , “ The writ of the government has ended .
Nobody can stop us from reaching Islamabad . ”
Meanwhile behind the scenes , frantic phone calls from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , President Obama ’s special envoy Richard Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson demanded Zardari bring the crisis to a halt .
Dawn reported that “ US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told President Zardari and opposition leader and PML - N chief Nawaz Sharif over the weekend US aid could be at risk unless they defused a crisis over a top judge , US officials said on Monday . ”
U.S. efforts , according to the Karachi - based newspaper , were “ coordinated with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband ” and “ had exerted strong pressure for a deal . ”
In the aftermath of the crisis , Clinton told journalists that the decision to reinstate Chaudhry “ was a first step for much - needed reconciliation and political compromise in Pakistan ” –on U.S. terms .
According to The New York Times Holbrooke said the United States applauded “ the statesmanlike act by President Zardari and hope that it will help defuse a dangerous confrontation so that Pakistan , with the help of its many friends , can address the nation ’s pressing and urgent needs . ”
Pivotal to resolving the situation , the Pentagon had repeated consultations with Army Chief of Staff General Asfaq Pervez Kayani .
While the Times claimed that “ General Kayani has said he wants to keep the army out of politics , ” after prodding by Washington Kayani reportedly laid down the law to Zardari and Gilani after meetings on Sunday .
Dawn revealed Wednesday that “ Pakistan ’s army chief played a crucial role behind the scenes to resolve the long march crisis , illustrating how a military with a record of seizing power could use its influence in the future , analysts said . ”
After nearly a decade of incompetent and corrupt rule under Musharraf , the Army now prefers to control political events from the shadows .
Security analyst Ikram Sehgal said the army was reverting to the sort of role it played through most of the 1990s , when it declined to take power but exerted its influence discreetly during periods of political turmoil .
“ The army wants desperately to keep out of the situation .
They realise they do not have the capabilities to run a government , ” Sehgal said .
“ One will definitely see the army playing a role behind the scenes …
If they stepped back in it would probably be on a Bangladesh model : set up a technocratic government and run the people who run the government , ” he said .
( “ Pakistan military helped broker end to long march , ” Dawn , March 18 , 2009 )
This is a “ model ” the Global Godfather in Washington will likely exploit , especially as the Obama administration seeks to expand U.S. military operations –including increased drone attacks and commando assaults by CIA paramilitary officers and U.S. Special Forces–into Baluchistan , according to The New York Times .
America ’s Role
It is no secret that the United States , first under Bush , and now under Obama , view Pakistan as the “ central front ” in imperialism ’s oxymoronic “ war on terror . ”
For decades , the U.S. has viewed Pakistan as little more than a “ strategic asset ” to advance America ’s geopolitical goals in Central - and South Asia .
While “ terrorism ” and “ stability operations ” in Afghanistan are the pretexts for increased military intervention across the region , resource extraction and pipeline politics are the unspoken reasons for military escalation .
Amid a backdrop of global capitalist economic meltdown and crisis , imperialism is playing a desperate hand to gain control over the region ’s vast oil and gas reserves from their geopolitical rivals , Russia and China .
Despite the crisis inside the country , CIA drones killed 24 people in tribal area of Kurram March 13 , in a demonstration that come what may , the United States will do as it pleases .
50 other people were wounded in the attack , said to have targeted a “ training center ” run by the Taliban .
The World Socialist Web Site reports ,
On Thursday , US Central Command chief Gen. David Petraeus and Richard Holbrooke , the US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan , delivered a closed - door briefing to leading members of the US Senate in what was apparently part of the preparation for the public presentation of the new strategy for waging the war that was first launched by the administration of George W. Bush nearly seven and a half years ago .
In an appearance on PBS Television ’s “ Charlie Rose Show , ” Adm .
Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said that the strategy review would focus on “ the safe haven in Pakistan , making sure that Afghanistan does n’t provide a capability in the long run or an environment in which Al Qaeda could return or the Taliban could return . ”
( Bill Van Auken , “ U.S. missiles kill 24 in Pakistan , ” World Socialist Web Site , March 14 , 2009 )
While the Zardari government has mendaciously called on the U.S. to halt attacks by CIA Predator and Reaper drones in NWFP and FATA , as I reported February 22 , the CIA and Special Forces have been using the Shamsi airbase in Baluchistan for more that a year as a launching pad for drone attacks .
The New York - based whistleblowing intelligence and security website Cryptome published a series of satellite images as part of their “ Eyeball ” series on February 18 .
One image , captured in 2006 before construction of a huge hangar meant to conceal America ’s robot killing machines was completed , show Predator drones on the Shamsi air strip .
According to Cryptome ’s anonymous correspondent , “ This is a very capable base facility with a large hangar in addition to the two Predator support hangars .
Nearby is a large secured compound ( appears empty ) which could support up to a battalion of special ops and associated command and control .
The large parking area inside the compound is perfect to land choppers and leave with relative security .
All security measures seem fresh . ”
( “ Surging Towards Disaster in the ‘ Afpak Theatre ’ , ” Antifascist Calling , February 22 , 2009 )
Despite Zardari ’s compliance with the Global Godfather ’s demands to use his nation as a launching pad for attacks on Pakistan ’s citizens , the question remains : how long will the Army ’s General Headquarters in Rawalpindi continue to support his discredited regime ?
Army Chief of Staff Kayani , a former ISI director under Musharraf , is the current darling of the political and military elite in Washington , one with whom they can “ do business . ”
With Obama ’s “ Afpak ” policy review nearing completion and after Zardari initially rejected the “ compromise ” brokered by Prime Minister Gilani and Kayani–with active “ encouragement ” by the U.S. Pentagon and State Department –will the United States , ever - fearful that a democratic alternative will “ send the wrong message ” to Pakistan ’s oppressed workers and farmers , opt for the military “ alternative ” ?
Meanwhile , the “ Old Mole ” Reemerges
In Pakistan , the struggle for civil liberties and basic democratic rights , is inextricably tied to “ the severing , ” as the World Socialist Website points out , “ of the Pakistani - US strategic alliance , and the dismantling of the vast Pakistani military apparatus . ”
One sign that the grip of the discredited PPP and PML - N , neoliberal parties that adhere to World Bank - IMF dictates , may be loosening up is the emergence of left - wing alternatives after decades of right - wing domination .
Farooq Tariq , general secretary of the socialist Labour Party Pakistan ( LPP ) , told researcher Ron Jacobs that “ what is transpiring in Pakistan is mass power . ”
While conceding that the Lawyers ’
Movement could not have emerged victorious without the rightist PML - N and the far - right Islamist Jamaat - e - Islami ( JI ) , which had hitched their political wagons to the movement for opportunist ends , leftist forces have garnered new supporters based on the political reemergence of the trade unions and militant farmers ’ organizations .
According to Tariq , some 5,000 new supporters have joined LPP since January .
While the corporate media in Europe and the United States portray Pakistan as a nation in need of rule by a strong hand to stem the jihadi tide , the socialist and labor movements are reemerging with a vengeance , though you would n’t know if you only read The New York Times or watched CNN .
As the situation heated - up , leftists ’ and labor leaders fell victim to particularly brutal attacks by the police and security services across Pakistan .
The LPP reported that Nasir Mansoor , the organization ’s national labor secretary , was beaten up by Karachi cops and whisked away in an ambulance March 12 to an unknown location .
Dozens of LPP members and other left - wingers had been seized by police .
In addition to LPP , a founding organization of the radical leftist Awami Jamhoori Tehreek ( People ’s Democratic Movement , AJT ) , members of the National Workers Party , Awami Tehreek , Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party ( CMKP ) , Pakistan Mazdoor Mehaz ( PMM ) and the Inqalabi Workers Committee had been seized .
Opposed to IMF - dictated economic “ reforms , ” religious sectarianism and state repression , AJT has pledged “ to strengthen the workers and peasants organization and special attention will be given to the issues of women and minorities .
It calls for the abolition of all discriminatory laws against women and minorities .
It has discussed the draft programme of the AJT which is mainly an anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist and feudal programme . ”
A threat to the existing set - up in Pakistan , the AJT was formed as a principled left - win response to the military bureaucracy and feudalist oligarchs who rely on the Army and jihadists ’ to maintain their rule .
According to the AJT ’s founding document ,
We consider that the religious extremism and militancy has grown beyond proportion , and is a new form of fascism .
These forces blunt the people ’s social consciousness and keep them out of political process that resultantly facilitates exploitative forces to maintain an unjust and oppressive social order .
The world imperialist forces have time and again used the religious extremists for their objectives .
The ruling establishment in Pakistan has deep relationship with these forces , which have been extensively deployed within and beyond Pakistan by them .
This anti-people lobby is responsible for promoting aggressive religious sectarianism in the country and they havoc played on Pakistan society in the name of religion .
They are responsible for permanent military infiltration in our constitution and administrative structure .
Their collaboration with the military junta has seriously prejudiced national independence and democratic image of the Pakistan state .
( Programme of the AJT )
Asked by Jacobs to define the current situation in Pakistan , Tariq said :
There are multiple reasons for the constant unrest in Pakistan .
The foremost reason is the inability of the ruling classes in Pakistan to solve all the basic problems faced by the masses .
There exists a feudalistic relationship and land is not distributed to peasants .
This brings a very feudal culture and atmosphere in Pakistan .
Both the main bourgeois parties , PPP and PMLN , do not speak about it anymore .
The major parts of the main leadership in both parties are from the feudal class .
They use the ownership of land for political purposes and to win the elections .
Sixty - one years of independence have brought no real independence for the majority of the people .
This is the real crisis of leadership in Pakistan .
Both main parties rely on the military generals .
Even in this ( most recent ) crisis over the days from 12 - 16 March 2009 , the army chief was mediating between the president , prime minister and the Nawaz brothers .
The Nawaz brothers ( said they ) were very thankful to the “ positive ” role of the army chief .
The failure of reformist parties like the PPP paved the way for the growth of religious extremism .
The extremists were and are supported by a major section of the army .
It is a very complex relationship between the rich , the army and religious extremists .
It changes and adjusts all the time .
9/11 made an indispensable difference to this relationship .
The fact is that the support of the ruling class for religious extremism is not open as was the case in the past , but the presence of the American forces in the region has given a real momentum for the growth of the religious fundamentalists .
( Ron Jacobs , “ An Interview with Farooq Tariq : Pakistan in Turmoil , ” CounterPunch , March 20 - 22 , 2009 )
Neither Zardari , Sharif nor other capitalist grifters are capable of resolving Pakistan ’s systemic crisis .
Despite decades of harsh , merciless rule by oligarchs and the military , the Pakistani people are flexing their democratic muscles .
Their struggle for basic economic and social rights despite the odds stacked against them , serve as an inspiration to all those who believe “ another world is possible ! ”
It 's a problem , as a reader notes :
Larison is right about decriminalized marijuana .
And you are right about decriminalized marijuana .
The argument " duuuude , I want to get wasted all the time " is written off by most people .
The argument " I would never touch the stuff but we can save money sick people libertarianism blah blah blah " is cold .
We need credible people to stand up and say " I contribute to society , I work hard , I love my family , and I smoke pot .
This is the only way I break the law .
The law is wrong . "
And we need a lot of them .
There are a lot of people that could make this argument .
Unfortunately , society being what it is , a lot of people , myself included , are ( excuse the metaphor ) in the closet .

Here are some good ways to research your website and its audience .
Clicky
Clicky has the advantage of providing real - time analytics , unlike Google Analytics .
Areas to look out for are :
What do people look at when they visit my website ?
What are my most popular pages ?
What pages do people stay on the longest ?
What keywords do they use to find my website ?
With this knowledge , you can develop a picture of what interests your visitors and what kinds of advertisers would pay for access to people with those types of interests .
Here are some other analytical tools :
Piwik : Open - source analytics that you install on your server .
Woopra : Real - time analytics .
The free plan is limited to 30,000 page views per month .
W3Counter : Free hosted website analytics .
Poll Your Traffic
To delve even further into your visitors ’ interests , put together a quick poll to find out what makes them tick .
With a polling service , you can quickly put together a questionnaire that sheds further light on where your advertising focus should be .
To get the best results from your survey , make it short , and perhaps even give away a gift to make it worth the respondents ’ time .
People rarely fill out surveys without an incentive .
Polling services include the following :
If you would rather not go this route , a simple request for feedback might work .
Just put the word out that you are looking for input and then ask for comments .
Keep Your Ear to the Ground
Here , in the Smashing Magazine Team , we are monitoring all mentions of our products and services and reply to our customers when they have problems , ask for support or just share their opinions .
Another great way to find out what interests your audience is to track what people say about you on social networking websites such as Twitter and Facebook .
Twitter lets you track mentions of your website or a particular phrase in tweets .
See which of your posts gets a lot of retweets or what people are saying about your website .
Also , watch for articles that get bookmarked on Pocket and other social bookmarking websites .
Searching for your domain name reveals articles that have been the most interesting to your visitors .
Finding Advertisers
Now that you have a good understanding of your website ’s traffic , it ’s time to get out there and find advertisers .
Is there a minimum number of visitors you should have before approaching advertisers ?
While nothing is set in stone , 500 to 1000 unique daily visitors is probably a good starting point .
However , numbers below these can still be workable , especially if your audience is highly targeted .
Here are some places to find advertisers :
What websites link to yours ?
One place to look for advertisers is in your own analytics .
Look for websites that currently link to yours and that offer a service or product you could advertise .

If you run Google AdWords , make note of which advertisements come up .
After all , they are already spending money with Google , and Google is saying that your website is a good match for theirs .
Approach them with an advertising opportunity that would give them greater visibility than what Google AdWords can deliver .

How to Approach Advertisers
Now that you know about your website ’s visitors , you will want to draft an advertising package to present to potential advertisers .
Here are a few things you may want to include :
Demonstrate visitor interest . .
List the interests of your website ’s visitors .
Advertisers want to know that what they ’re selling will appeal to your visitors .

Track outbound links . .
You certainly do n’t want to overpromise the number of clicks an ad will receive .
If you ’ve been tracking outbound links with a service such as Google Ad Manager , you will have pretty concrete numbers to work with when approaching advertisers ( assuming , of course , that you have already run at least one test advertisement on your website ) .

Keep it personal ..
Do n’t blanket email advertisers with a cut - and - pasted pitch .
Advertisers will more likely respond if they feel you have personally researched their product and matched it carefully to your website .
These statistics will be a great help when you are ready to approach your first advertiser .
Your goal is to show how you ’ll be able to leverage your audience to deliver a highly targeted customer to them .
Doing that successfully will show value even if your traffic is relatively low .
To give you a real - life example , I recently ran some advertising on a website that averaged 92,000 daily page views , along with one that had only 2,000 .
The website with less traffic brought in 41 clicks , while the bigger website brought in only 2 .
Which website do you think I would spend my advertising dollars on ?
Traffic is one thing , but conversion numbers are much more important .
Keep Advertisers Happy
So , you ’ve landed your first advertiser .
Good work !
But getting the advertiser is merely the first step .
If you want to develop a long - term relationship with your advertisers , you ’ll need to know how to keep them happy :
Give them the information they want . .
Conversation rates are king .
To keep advertisers happy , deliver information on how their ads are doing .
The good news is that most ad - management services have built - in reporting that sends advertisers updates on how their ads are doing .

You want all of your ads positioned so that they can take advantage of that new traffic .

They ’ll appreciate that you care , and you will receive a heap of useful information that you can use to improve your ad strategy .
Sell Ads Yourself Or Join A Network ?
Handling your own advertising or joining a large advertising network each has its pros and cons .
Some large networks may not give you the time of day if you do n’t have enough traffic to begin with .
Here are some ways to sell advertising ; you can mix and match methods to come up with your own solution .
Sell Directly
If you prefer the hands - on approach , then you ’ll probably want to sell your advertising spots directly to advertisers .
Using one of the following programs will alleviate some of the stress that comes with selling directly :
OpenX OpenX is an open - source advertising server that is licensed under the GNU General Public License .
OIO Publisher A WordPress and standalone ad manager .
Random / Rotating Ads
Ad plug - in for WordPress
Easy Ad - Manager
A standalone ad manger .
For more options and management tips , check out the article Ad Management Plug - Ins And Tutorials For Your Website .
Remember , handling your own ad sales will net you the biggest slice of the profit , but it also requires the most work .
Limit your offering . .
No advertiser wants to see 10 different “ Advertise Here ” boxes on your website .
Start small by offering one advertising slot , and then increase as you sell them .

Partner with websites with similar interests . .
If your traffic is too low to attract the kind of advertisers you ’re interested in , why not partner with other websites that share your interest ?
Start your own mini-network , and then offer advertisers the opportunity to pay one price to advertise on multiple websites .
.

Start a promotion ..
In the beginning , you may have to give away ad spots for nothing or next to nothing .
So , offer a promotion to get advertisers in the door .
If you ’ve done your research and you deliver high - quality traffic , those advertisers will be much more willing to pay when the promotion runs out .
Remember to track outbound traffic on these links because it contains valuable information that you can use when you contact your next advertiser .
Selling Through Ad Networks
Ad networks can put you in touch with many more advertisers , but they also take a chunk of your bottom line .
Often this chunk will be negligible , considering the network will allow you to sell more ad space .
Here are a few good networks to try :
BuySellAds
Unless you live in a cave , you ’ve probably already heard of BuySellAds.com .
Though a relative newcomer to the advertising scene , BuySellAds.com has achieved great market penetration .
One caveat is that it focuses on websites for designers and developers .
So , if your website falls beyond this category , you may want to try elsewhere .
Project Wonderful Project Wonderful is a great place to start your advertising campaign because its prerequisite to join is relatively low .
The idea behind the website is to allow potential advertisers to bid on your ad spots .
The more that advertisers want what you offer , the higher your daily advertising rate .
While Project Wonderful promises to bring advertisers to you , you may find yourself sitting in the $ 0 per day budget range as you build traffic or until an advertiser decides to take a chance on you .
Chitika Chitika is a little different than other ad networks because it scans the search strings of people who are directed to your website and then serves up ads that match those search strings .
Think of it like Google AdSense with a twist .
Whichever ad network you choose , make sure it pays per click ( i.e. pays money for every click the ad gets ) rather than uses CPM ( i.e. money for every thousand views your website gets ) .
Here are some additional ad networks :
Be Careful With Your Advertising
Not all advertisers will be a good fit for your website , and you may be forced to decide whether to run an ad that falls beyond your website ’s objectives .
For example , you ’ve probably seen hundreds of websites lately that advertise teeth whitening and weight loss services .
While the revenue from such ads is probably good , would the ads be appropriate for your audience ?
Ask yourself these questions before deciding to run an ad :
Does this ad fit the content of my website ?
Would the ad offend or annoy my visitors ?
Would it distract visitors from the content ?
Would it call into question the integrity of my website ?
Always remember that any advertisement that drives away traffic from your website , even if it pays wells , will ultimately hurt rather than help .
You will hear loud and clear from your community if it thinks you have sold out for advertising dollars .
Do n’t let it get to that point ; set firm advertising standards ahead of time .

Summary
Selling advertising on a low - traffic website does n’t have to be mission impossible .
With the right research and pitch , you ’re well on your way to landing your first advertiser .
Figuring out what works for you and your website does n’t mean picking one strategy and sticking with it .
Try multiple approaches , and track the results .
Whether you prefer to sell your own ad spots , partner with other websites or join a network , mix and match methods to create a strategy that works for you .
Advertising on your website is an ongoing organic process that takes research , patience and time .

Additional Resources to Sell Ads

Political reporter , BBC News
Did David Cameron 's father buy him the Conservative Party ?
Has Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg slept with 3,000 women ?
Wikipedia vandals tend to be anonymous
Of course not , but in the crazy , alternative world of Wikipedia vandalism - the term the site uses for deliberately false information being inserted into entries - anything is possible .
The popular online encyclopedia 's great strength - and critics say its greatest weakness - is that the vast majority of its 2.7 million entries can be instantly edited by anyone .
And in the never - ending battle to gain political advantage , that can prove irresistible .
The Conservative Party was caught out last month tampering with an entry on the painter Titian .
An over - enthusiastic researcher altered the age of the artist 's death in an attempt to help leader David Cameron win an obscure political argument with Gordon Brown .
This could be seen , at a stretch , as part of the normal editing process that goes on all the time on Wikipedia , with contributors battling it out until a common form of words is agreed .
But some contributors have more mischievous intent .
He should become a stand - up comedian because his face just makes you laugh
Vandalism on David Cameron 's Wikipedia page
Log on to the site at various points in the past few weeks and you will have read that Mr Cameron , whose page was visited 72,441 times last month , is a typical product of aristocratic " inbreeding " , was nearly recruited by British Telecom when he was a student ( he was in fact approached by the KGB , proving that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction ) and that his daddy bought him the Conservative Party .
You will also have read that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg , whose page was viewed 8,589 times last month , is a " namby pamby liberal " and a " sanctimonious straw man " yet despite these apparent handicaps has slept with up to 3,000 women and become a member of hip - hop collective the Wu Tang Clan .
Balance
On a few occasions , the entire text of Clegg and Cameron 's respective pages , running to several thousand words each , were deleted and briefly replaced by a single lewd - or just plain surreal - line of text , in most cases far too libellous or offensive to be repeated here .
Comments have also been added to biographical information , such as the observation that Mr Cameron " first and foremost , tries to be really cool .
He should become a stand - up comedian because his face just makes you laugh .
Look at it ..... see , you can't help but chuckle ! " .
I think it would be in Wikipedia 's own interest to maintain its impartiality and crack down hard on acts of political vandalism
Martin Horwood , Lib Dem MP
Obviously false , malicious or biased material like this is normally removed within minutes by other contributors or Wikipedia 's team of volunteer administrators , who work round - the - clock to try and improve its credibility as a source of information and its commitment to balance and consensus .
Occasionally they will take more drastic action , such as blocking contributors or placing a lock on a page .
The site administrators were forced to place temporary editing restrictions on Mr Cameron 's page on 11 February , the day of the Titian row , " due to excessive vandalism " .
Gordon Brown 's Wikipedia page , which was viewed 145,513 times last month , by contrast , enjoys " semi protected " status all the time , meaning it cannot be modified by anonymous users .
This is a privilege accorded to only a handful of figures , such as US President Barack Obama and his predecessor George Bush , whose Wikipedia pages have been subject to " heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy " .
Subtle alterations
As a result , the edits to Mr Brown 's page tend to be restricted to minor factual or style points or the ongoing search for a more flattering picture .
But even this does not protect the prime minister from vandalism entirely .
In January a very long and bawdy poem appeared without warning in the middle of a passage on Mr Brown 's political accomplishments .
" Sorry , could not resist , " wrote the person responsible , who had a previously blameless record of contributions to the site : " This guy has really got to me , lost my job today . "
This kind of vandalism , mostly carried out by people who are identified only by their computer 's unique IP address number , may be a source of irritation or amusement for web users searching for information .
What is more worrying , for MPs and other elected representatives , are the subtle alterations and additions made to their Wikipedia pages , which the passing voter might take as fact .
' Responsibility ' Liberal Democrat MP Martin Horwood was alarmed to discover his Wikipedia entry , which in keeping with the conventions of the site was not written by him , had been altered in a way he believed would harm his chances of retaining his seat .
The Cheltenham MP was wary of altering the page himself , having been warned by Wikipedia administrators in the past that this was considered bad form .
In the end , he managed , with the help of a tech - literate friend , to find a form of words that passed muster with the administrators and neutralised his concerns about bias .
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales wants tighter editing restrictions
With his seat being one of the battleground marginals at the next election he feels cannot afford to have inaccurate information about him presented as impartial fact .
Mr Horwood 's experience is far from unusual and is likely to become even more common as the next general election approaches .
" An election does place a little bit of responsibility on Wikipedia and its volunteers to take extra care , " he says .
" I think it would be in Wikipedia 's own interest to maintain its impartiality and crack down hard on acts of political vandalism .
" It is a fantastic and impartial source , that is its great value , so it would be a shame if it allowed its pages to become ' point of view ' pages . "
' Correcting errors ' Britain 's political parties are all aware of Wikipedia 's power .
The site 's pages for David Cameron and Nick Clegg are ranked second on Google searches behind their own official sites .
In Gordon Brown 's case it is the top link .
In the 2008 US primaries , candidates ' Wikipedia entries ranked higher on Google than their own websites for 25 % of Democrats and 60 % of Republicans , according to research by the Tech President website .
In the UK , the main parties all monitor Wikipedia for errors and bias - but they are reluctant to criticise something which is generally seen as a force for good .
Labour and the Conservatives both declined to comment when contacted for this article .
Mark Pack , the Liberal Democrats ' internet guru , argues that the site had a much better track record than most newspapers , when it comes to corrections .
" Wikipedia is probably more prone to errors than other sources , but it is also much more prone to correcting errors , " he says .
But he adds : " There is a tendency to only see it as acceptable to remove information if it is factually incorrect or extremely trivial . "
Policy change
This means , he argues , that the site can sometimes be " unbalanced " in the way it presents information .
" The main weakness is that you do not get a good pen portrait of people , " he argues .
There is growing concern in the US about Wikipedia vandalism , after false reports of the death of two prominent US politicians , Senators Robert Byrd and Edward Kennedy , appeared on the site .
The errors were quickly corrected but they prompted Wikipedia 's co-founder Jimmy Wales to press the case for a tightening up of its editing policy .
In future , any changes may need to be approved by a group of editors , made up of regular contributors , before being made live .
Mr Wales believes such a move will improve accuracy - but it has not gone down well with some Wikipedia users who argue it goes against the egalitarian spirit of the site .
So for now , and to the dismay or delight of many in British politics , Wikipedia remains an untamed and unspun corner of the internet , with all the good and bad things that can mean .
The following comments reflect a balance of the views received .
Wikipedia is a good reference point as long as people treat what they read with the same caution they should apply to the red - top tabloids in the UK .
Unfortunately , they do n't in either case .
At least with Wikipedia you can get a falsehood corrected .
Stuart Smith , Wigan , Lancs ( UK ) Wikipedia is a great reference source but can't be relied upon for any contentious matter , whether political , historical or religious .
Hopefully most users know this !
Ahmed Berger , London , UK
This phenomenon does not only affect politicians .
The entry for the late actress Deborah Kerr was amended to state that after retiring from acting she moved to Britain where she opened a chain of abbatoirs .
Paul S , Dalston , London
The most revealing part about Wikipedia is people 's willingness to trust almost any written information as fact , as if it was written by some higher power ; a kind of " Bible mentality " .
Rationally , it should be sufficient for Wikipedia to make clear that anyone can edit the site and to trust content in proportion to that .
I wonder what a WikiBible would have been like ...
Mat , Bristol
At the end of the day , everyone knows that anyone can edit Wikipedia .
If people are concerned about what 's written ( and vandalism 's often rather obvious anyway ) , there 's always other places they can check for information .
Amy R , London For Pete 's sake would it not be easier if people could alter Wiki entries and then administrators were to approve first before they make publication ?
As a user myself I fear that information I gather could be vandalised material I am reading .
Kev Hedges , Stevenage , UK
If these entries are so sensitive , subject to vandalism and likely to lead to " Unbalance " why do n't all these bodies just agree to prevent any political portraits appearing on Wiki .
Personally , whilst you can't " trust " as truth what is on Wiki it should realistically be only used as one of the references anyone should use .
M Thompson , Winsford , Cheshire Would I vote , or not , for a political candidate based on what I had read about them on Wikipedia ?
Do you take me for a fool ?
MPs ought to get their knickers out of a twist and get on with sorting the problems of our nation rather than worrying about what people might think of them after reading a Wiki entry .
Even in the most marginal of seat where a candidate 's career is genuinely on a knife edge it at least gives them the unnerving sense of having their livelihood at the whim of a stranger they do n't trust - gives them a taste of what we have to put up with from them .
Paul H , Walsall England Wikipedia is a symptom of the fast and lazy " dumbing down " culture developing in the west .
Everybody has got an opinion and wants that heard without having to listen , evaluate , discuss and debate other peoples point of view .
and People should be taught how to research things for themselves .
Taught how to obtain original and source material for themselves and how to evaluate things .
Plus if they are going to postulate the information they wish to impart ; they should be taught how to do so with some authority .
P Gleeson , Stoke
In fairness to wikipedia , most " bad " edits are gone within a few minutes , most of the press act like wikipedia goes out in print form like a newspaper and that hundreds of thousands of people are unwittingly reading this false information , and this is simply not case .
James , Surrey Let 's not forget how many business and political figures in america have been caught falsifying information .
Sometimes those who complain the loudest are also the one 's behind amendments .

You can't believe everything you see on the internet .
Virtually all websites you surf to will have at least some kind of grammatical / spelling or continuity error in , and if they did n't the Internet would be a much more boring place .
It 's just a collection of opinions .
If you 're an athiest for example , wikipedia pages on religion might be considered incorrect and vice versa for religious folk .
Like any source its providence is important when assessing its accuracy .
You could start a wiki page answering how long a piece of string is , it would n't necessarily be wrong .
Anyway , we all know Cleggy would never get into Wu Tang , he 's best off sticking with his solo career .
Alex O'Donoghue , Norwich Relax , its only the internet !
Wikipedia is delusional if it believes that it is - or that people think it is - a source of absolute truth .
The majority of people know that wikipedia , due to being user generated , is subject to innacuracy , bias , and vandalism .
I once viewed the entry for Adolph Hitler , which simply read " Adolph Hitler was a very nasty man " .
While this entry was 100 % accurate , it failed to educate me as to why Hitler came to hate the Jewish people so much , and how his military machine was assembled ... but would an un-vandalised entry have been any more helpful , or as accurate ?
Paul , Birmingham Scandalous , they already spend millions of pounds on protecting the place and yet it is still full of mis-information , lies and the over hyping of already inflated egos ..... sorry , thought you were talking about the House of Commons .
Wikipedia .
leave it alone and rely on it in the spirit that you whist brwsing it , you can create an entry and call yourself President of the USA
Pat , Shoeburyness " I wonder what a WikiBible would have been like ... "
Edited by many people over a period of time to contain certain false and misleading portions of text ?
N Jones , Manchester , UK in response to Mat of Bristol , I do n't think a Wikibible would be much different to the current bible ..
jon , manchester
A WikiBible looks something like this : http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)
Thomas Dalton , Durham Wikipedia articles were recently found to be 99 % accurate when compared to the Encyclopedia Britannica .
Those who say you can't believe it are only undermining the effort Wikipedia goes to in order to give us accurate , concise and above all FREE information .
David Downey , Leeds
This " Wikipedia vandalism " is a growing trend but a small price to pay for such a wonderful resource .
The percentage of accurate information far outweighs that which is inaccurate and is a great start point for research .
History is written by the winners and it seemingly always will be to an extent .
Congratulations to Wikipedia for trying to redress the balance , the " graffiki " is n't to much of a price to pay .
Sam , London , UK
As an teacher I find it disconcerting the number of my pupils who will just wikipedia as fact before plagarising the site in their own work .... obviously as teacher we can take steps to detect and discourage this but it still a cause for concern in education but also their wider lives .
Sonya Manwaring , Tarleton , Lancashire I saw one vandalised article on Wikipedia which I reverted and reported as vandalised .
I also thought to check if the same person had also vandalized other pages .
By the time I 'd worked out how to view their edit history , all their vandalism had been removed , their account blacklisted and things were back to normal again .
The vandalism barely lasted 50 seconds before the administrators had wiped out all trace of it and banned the user .
Just be part of the solution and wikipedia is great .
Andy , Stockport Wikipedia is a superb source of information and links when it comes to pages edited by passionate , knowledgeable individuals .
This is the case for most pages about scientific or technological subjects , mathematics or widespread hobbies .
Pages that deal with contentious subjects or biographies of politicians typically provide interesting links to other sites , but simply can't be taken as reliable on their own .
This should be stated clearly at the top of pages , together with an encouragement to cross-check with other sources .
Wikipedia receives far too many daily edits for a smallish team of individuals to validate -- instead of " locking down " pages , which would discourage voluntary , enthusiastic and well - meaning contributions , we should insist our schools and higher education institutions train people to read with a critical eye and never to lap up any single source as gospel .
H Crockett , London , UK everyone knows that wikipedia is capable of being edited by anyone and is thus a rather inaccurate source of information in most cases .
I do n't understand why why politicans and the media seem to think that it 's actually important at all to crack down on " vandalism " , if one could actually call it vandalism .
This is all just hysteria and sensationalism and it's really got to stop .

nuff said
Graham Lamb , manchester , uk The sad fact is that you cannot have ANY unprotected space or facility on the Internet .
For sure , someone will come along and mess it up .
So Wiki is no exception to that rule and of course they should beef up their security so that the kiddy sandcastle tramplers on the Internet do n't undo all the good work .

Vital evidence which could have secured the release of one of Britain 's longest - serving victims of a miscarriage of justice 11 years ago was held in a forgotten forensic science archive on an industrial site in the Midlands , the Guardian can reveal .
Sean Hodgson walked free after 27 years in jail when his murder conviction was quashed yesterday .
But an inquiry is being launched into why the Forensic Science Service wrongly told defence lawyers acting for him in 1998 that exhibits in the inquiry had been destroyed .
The court of appeal heard yesterday that had his legal team acquired the exhibits they would have submitted them for DNA testing , which , in all likelihood , would have secured his release 11 years ago .
Instead the inquiry went cold ; Hodgson , who was in the prison hospital , became more seriously ill and his solicitor was unable to take further instructions .
It was not until last March when Hodgson , 57 , wrote to a new legal firm , Julian Young solicitors , that efforts were made to search for the exhibits once more .
Hodgson , who suffers from a personality disorder , was jailed for life in 1982 after being convicted of murdering Teresa de Simone , a 22 - year - old clerk who worked part - time behind the bar in the Tom Tackle pub in Southampton .
Her body was found in her Ford Escort car on December 5 1979 .
She had been raped and strangled .
As lord chief justice , Lord Judge , quashed Hodgson 's conviction for murder yesterday , he said the public would be concerned by the extraordinary case .
DNA tests on three samples from the victim 's body - which were not available at the time of the conviction - conclusively proved that Hodgson was not the killer .
A further 20 exhibits from De Simone 's car , clothes and body also contained none of Hodgson 's DNA , the court was told .
The court heard that Hodgson , from Bishop Auckland , County Durham , had made several confessions but was a compulsive liar who had also admitted to two murders which had never taken place .
A year after the killing , Hodgson had made a confession to a priest while he was serving time in prison for theft , he made further detailed admissions to a prison guard and police officers in which he described seven details of the case which had never been made public .
At his trial he pleaded not guilty but was convicted .
An appeal a year later failed but Hodgson continued to protest his innocence between bouts of mental illness .
Rag Chand , a barrister who worked on the case , told the Guardian he spent four months looking for the evidence .
There were no surviving papers in the case .
Instead Chand trawled through local newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened .
When it came to seeking the exhibits which the legal team wanted to submit for DNA testing , he was repeatedly told - like the legal team in 1998 - that they no longer existed .
" The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life , " he said .
" It was like finding a needle in a haystack .
But I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong . "
By autumn last year Chand 's tenacity had paid off when his information led the Forensic Science Service to an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands which they appeared to have forgotten about .
There they discovered exhibits from the investigation in 1979 , which included swabs taken from De Simone 's body , tapings of her clothes and the seats of her Ford Escort car .
It was only then that the DNA testing could take place .
Sarah Whitehouse , counsel for the Crown , told the court yesterday that the forensic regulator had been asked to investigate why the FSS had erroneously said in 1998 that the exhibits in the inquiry had been destroyed .
" It is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs and we need to know what steps have been taken to ensure this never happens again , " she said .
Hodgson 's barrister at the original trial , Robin Grey , QC , was there to shake his hand as he was released .
" As a human being I feel glad that we no longer have the capital punishment , " he said .
" As a defence barrister I did n't get him off , and I have bitter feelings of guilt about that . "
Horizontally Centered Menus with no CSS hacks
A lot of people want centred menus on their website but for the CSS novice this task seems impossible .
If you do a search online you will find a few centring methods but most of these rely on CSS hacks , JavaScript or non-standard CSS rules that are not supported by all browsers .
In this post I 'm going to show you my secret method of achieving centred tabs that do not use any CSS hacks and will work in all the common web browsers all the way back to IE 5.5 !
It 's also compatible with my perfect liquid layouts .
Let 's start with a basic example then I 'll explain how it works .
Centered Menu Basic Example
Below you should see four horizontally centred tabs in this column of text , the second tab is set as active .
Try resizing your browser window and change the size of the page text to see how the menus always remain centred and clickable .
See some more advanced centered CSS menu examples
Centered Menu HTML
The HTML used for centered menus is semantically structured and very basic .
The structure is simply a list of links in a single div .
< div id =" centeredmenu " > < ul > < li > < a href= " # " > Tab one </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " class= " active " >
Tab two </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Tab three </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Tab four </a></li> </ul > </div >
Centered Menu CSS
Below is the CSS used to center the tabs across the page .
See below for an explanation of how this works .
# centeredmenu { float : left ; width : 100 % ; background : # fff ; border - bottom : 4 px solid # 000 ; overflow : hidden ; position : relative ; } # centeredmenu ul { clear : left ; float : left ; list - style : none ; margin: 0 ; padding : 0 ; position : relative ; left :50 % ; text - align : center ; } #centeredmenu ul li { display : block ; float : left ; list - style : none ; margin: 0 ; padding : 0 ; position : relative ; right :50 % ; } #centeredmenu ul li a { display : block ; margin:0 0 0 1 px ; padding : 3 px 10 px ; background : #ddd ; color :#000 ; text - decoration : none ; line - height : 1.3em ; } #centeredmenu ul li a :hover { background : #369 ; color : # fff ; } #centeredmenu ul li a.active , # centeredmenu ul li a.active : hover { color : # fff ; background : #000 ; font - weight : bold ; }
How the centering method works
The trick to my centring method is how the floated elements are relatively positioned within one another .
To explain this properly let me first describe how an element can change its dimensions when floated .
Non-floated div
Here is a div ( a block level element ) that is not floated .
Notice how it stretches to 100 % of the width of its containing element , in this case , that 's the whole page .
Left floated div
If we now float the div to the left it will automatically shrink to match the width of the content inside itself .
It is now only as wide as the text " Div " .
This shrinking is the key to the centring process , it helps us move our menu the right amount into the centre .
Standard left aligned menu
Let 's use a traditional left aligned menu and move the tabs into the centre step by step .
I have coloured each element in a different colour so it is easy to see how they are all nested together .
Please note the following .
The ' centeredmenu ' div ( blue box ) is floated to the left but we give it a width of 100 % so it remains stretched across the whole page .
The ul element ( pink box ) is inside the ' centeredmenu ' div and is floated to the left .
This means that the ul will shrink to the width of its content , this just so happens to be the width of all the tabs .
All li elements ( green boxes ) are inside the ul and each is floated to the left .
This causes them to shrink around the link inside themselves and they all line up in a horizontal row .
Inside each link ( orange box ) is the text that appears on the tab ; Tab 1 , Tab 2 , etc .
Shifting the position of the unordered list
Next we shift the ul element to the right by 50 % by using position : relative ; .
When moving an element to the side by a percentage in this way it is important to note that it will move a percentage of its containing element 's width not it 's own width .
So in this instance , the ul element will move to the right by 50 % of the ' centeredmenu ' div width - this is half of the browser window .
The end result is our menus start from the middle of the screen and partly run off the page to the right , but do n't worry , in one more step we will have them in the centre .
Shifting the position of all line items
The last step is to shift all of the li elements back to the left by 50 % .
This is 50 % of the width of the ul element ( their containing element ) and it will put the tabs exactly in the centre of the window .
Some important notes
This method of centering menus is rock solid but there are a few things you must be aware of .
Because the ul element sits partly off the page your browser window will scroll sideways unless you include an overflow : hidden ; rule on the ' centeredmenu ' div .
This will chop off the overhanging div .
If you do n't want to use the overflow : hidden ; rule then see my centered drop - down menu article that explains how to remove it .
rule on the ' centeredmenu ' div .
This will chop off the overhanging div .
If you do n't want to use the rule then see my centered drop - down menu article that explains how to remove it .
Because the ul element is not aligned with the tabs you cannot add any visible styling to it .
Leave the ul element without a background colour and with no border so it will be completely invisible .
Do all of your tab styling on the li and a elements only .
If you need to style the first or last tab differently to the others , add a class to the first and last li element so they can be targeted individually .
So , here are the main features of the pure CSS centered menus .
No CSS hacks
The CSS used for these centered menus is 100 % valid and hack free .
To overcome Internet Explorer 's broken box model , no horizontal padding or margins are used .
Instead , this design uses clever relative positioning .
Valid XHTML strict markup
The HTML in these centered menus validates as XHTML 1.0 strict .
Resizable text compatible
These centred tabs are fully compatible with resizable text .
Resizable text is important for web accessibility .
People who are vision impaired can make the text larger so it 's easier for them to read .
It is becoming increasingly more important to make your website resizable text compatible because people are expecting higher levels of web accessibility .
No JavaScript required
JavaScript is not required .
Some website layouts rely on JavaScript hacks to resize divs and force elements into place but you wo n't see any of that nonsense here .
Full cross - browser compatible
The pure CSS centred menus have been tested on the following browsers .

The protesters are determined that the march should go ahead Police in Pakistan have arrested dozens of lawyers and opposition activists ahead of an anti-government protest march due to begin on Thursday .
Political gatherings have also been banned in Sindh and Punjab provinces .
Protesters led by lawyers and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif want judges sacked by former President Pervez Musharraf to be reinstated .
Tensions are high after the Supreme Court banned Mr Sharif and his brother from holding elected office .
Opposition groups and lawyers have been mobilising support for the four - day march on Islamabad since the court ruling on 25 February .
The Sharifs have blamed President Asif Ali Zardari for influencing the decision .
The government says the planned march is aimed at destabilising the country .
Correspondents say it appears determined to keep protesters outside the capital , Islamabad .
The deteriorating political and economic situation and high - profile attacks by militants have heightened fears over Pakistan 's future , just six months after President Zardari took office .
Into hiding
The marchers plan to stage an indefinite sit-in in Islamabad and there are fears there may be violent confrontations with security forces .
There can be no reconcialiation till the judges are restored - no ban can prevent the revolution that is looming ahead
Nawaz Sharif
Deja-vu of political violence Pakistanis defiant and fearful Q&A : Pakistan political instability " Provincial governments are fully empowered to take action to keep law and order ...
There are security threats , " Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik told reporters .
The government has issued orders to place senior leaders of Mr Sharif 's Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz ( PML - N ) under house arrest .
It is not clear whether there are also orders to place Mr Sharif and his brother Shahbaz under detention .
On Wednesday , Mr Sharif addressed a massive rally in the northern town of Abbotabad and urged Pakistanis to join the march to Islamabad .
" It is the duty of every Pakistani citizen to stand up for the restoration of the judiciary , " he said .
" I am not doing this for the sake of personal power , but for the future of Pakistan .
Mr Zardari has broken his word on the issue , and we have been left with no choice . "
Earlier , Mr Sharif 's brother , Shahbaz , said : " If this [ civilian ] government bans political gatherings , then I do n't see how it is different from the military regime of Gen Musharraf . "
The PML - N insists that it is a democratic right to hold rallies
He had to leave his post as chief minister of Punjab last month after the court decision declaring him ineligible to hold office .
Reports from several cities in Punjab province say that the police have arrested a large number of opposition workers to maintain public order .
A warrant has been issued for the arrest of another opposition leader , Imran Khan , the former Pakistan cricket captain .
Raids have also been conducted on the residences of prominent lawyers and opposition legislators , but most are reported to have gone into hiding to avoid arrest .
" We are avoiding arrest because we want to lead the march , " a prominent lawyer , Aitzaz Ahsan , told a local television station .
Ex-chief justice Chief among the lawyers ' demands is the restoration of a former chief justice of Pakistan , Iftikhar Chaudhry .

He was sacked along with some 60 other senior judges by Gen Musharraf in November 2007 , sparking countrywide protests .
Among other things , the judges had been due to rule on a controversial amnesty covering Mr Zardari and his wife Benazir Bhutto , who was later assassinated .
Mr Zardari has in the past accused Iftikhar Chaudhry of complicity in a campaign to victimise him while imprisoned on what he says were trumped up murder and corruption charges in the 1990s and the early part of this decade .
Under Mr Zardari's administration , Pakistan is descending deeper into crisis , BBC correspondents say .
In the past the military , Pakistan 's most powerful institution , has stepped in to seize power from failing governments .
The current army chief , Gen Ashfaq Pervez Kayani , has said he will respect civilian rule .

oh wait , you ’re serious ?
Is n't a graduate degree in science supposed to be in , you know , actual science ?
When I first read about the Institute for Creation Research trying to award a Master of Science degree in creationism , my jaw found itself very comfortable in my lap .
Texas ’
Higher Education Coordinating Board swiftly told the ICR to forget it and the ICR cried to the media about how its academic freedom is getting stomped on by evil politicos who wo n’t let them issue a degree in theology and pretend that it ’s science .
My jaw returned to its upright and locked position , but I was still curious how exactly the ICR could even claim that it taught anything about science or the scientific method .
You see , if you get a degree in science , you have to be well versed in the scientific method .
This means you should be able to form a hypothesis , observe and experiment to test it and find out whether your hypothesis is true or false .
Simple enough .
But the ICR teaches the very opposite ; that there already is an answer and that by virtue of something existing and the personal views of our ancestors , it must be a deity .
There is no hypothesis , no experimentation and , above all , there ’s no research .
Ironically , an organization with the word research in its name does n’t even do any actual research about anything other than how to proselytize .
And now they want to get the same certification as people who actually do real scientific work ?
What a sick joke !
If you really want to have a facepalm moment , try to read their evidence for why God exists .
It ’s nothing but short , talking point essays reflecting the authors ’ personal opinions on culture and their admiration for how beautiful our planet is along with the predictable creationist strawman of infinite reduction , i.e. something ca n’t come from nothing .
Where ’s the evidence ?
Where are notebooks with detailed charts of human DNA signed by God ?
Where are videos of miracles or demonstrations of prayers coming true before our very eyes ?
All we get are clichd essays and pretty pictures from Getty and Corbis libraries .
Even worse , the ICR essay which tries to assert that “ God caused love , ” says the emotion ca n’t be proven “ like gravity or aerodynamics . ”
If you have n’t randomly floated off into space , you ’ve proven gravity .
If you ’ve ever flown on an aircraft , you ’ve proven aerodynamics .
And after such a public demonstration of ignorance , the ICR expects to be given the right to award science degrees ?
Creationism neatly packaged all the questions and problems it can’t answer into a black box it labeled God and then pretends as if it has a solution .
But it really does n’t have anything besides its black box .
Scientists do n’t claim that everything came from nothing .
They think that there ’s a very long process where everything changed forms and the universe as we know it still needs to be studied to find out exactly what happened .
Creationism has created its own Quixotic quest in its desperation to find some sort of justification for its beliefs but in doing so , they ’ve turned to an idea which requires an eternal , all knowing , all powerful and incredibly intelligent being and if a scientist or a curious bystander ask how can this God come from nothing , creationists are at a loss .
They have no idea .
They just wanted to believe they ’re special and were designed by divine manifestations for a greater purpose than they can imagine .
And now , it seems that a group of them wants permission to present their security - blanket view of the universe as a science .

Let go and explore your very deepest emotions and thoughts about your relationship .
That ’s what psychologists James Pennebaker and Richard Slatcher told their study subjects to do , in a journal or diary , for twenty minutes a day .
The participants — University of Texas at Austin undergrads — were in long - term relationships , but temptation , hormones , and stress are known to take their toll on young love .
Slatcher and Pennebaker had a theory that writing about a lover could make love last longer .
The psychologists were n’t interested in what the subjects wrote about their girlfriends or boyfriends .
Those writings were kept private .
But another set of daily correspondence was fair game : instant messages ( IM ) .
Under the premise of a word quantification procedure , participants were asked to forward all instant message ( IM ) chats between themselves and their partners .
Because IMs are frequent , impromptu , and real - time , they ’re precious in the world of psychological studies .
The researchers wanted to know if expressive journal writing on a daily basis made a difference in a couple ’s everyday interactions .
The frequency and emotional content of IM conversations , they figured , reflect the state of the relationship .
It turns out that men and women required to write privately about their feelings do communicate more with their loved ones .
Comparing the instant messages of the 44 subjects assigned to express their feelings in writing on a daily basis versus the 42 who did not , the researchers found that the diary writers were more expressive with their partners .
Without realizing it , men and women who had previously reflected on their relationship in writing used more emotion words such as happy , love , nervous , and mad when they IM ’d their partners .
Three months into the study , 77 percent of the participants who had written about their relationship were still with their partners , compared to 52 percent of the participants in the control group .
Why does daily journaling about a relationship help so much ?
According to the researchers , it helps lovers to better articulate their feelings .
And in so doing , it also helps to reinforce those feelings .
Thoughts and feelings are so often vague and fleeting ; capturing them in words amplifies them and loops them back to you .
Our brains love patterns — mulling over emotions helps reify them , makes them concrete .
You may find yourself expressing yourself with your partner the same way you do in your private writing .
Focus on positive thoughts in your journal writing and you may find that those happy emotions spill over into everyday life .
In a virtuous cycle , the partners of the study participants also became more expressive as well .
( It ’s another amplifying feedback loop , not unlike how having a lot of sex may make you want even more of it . )
Take a moment and reflect :
How expressive are you with your partner ?
To what extent are you on autopilot , filling your conversations with practicalities instead of emotion ?
Can you commit your feelings to words ?
If you can , you may find yourself more committed to your relationship .
Thanks to FOX 13 in Tampa Bay for taking us behind the scenes as Anthony Sullivan produces a new commercial starring Billy Mays .
Here ’s a segment that ran on the Fox 13 6 pm news a few days back .
In this interview , Billy talks about assuming his pitchman persona as he prepares for the camera to roll :
“ Whatever product I ’m selling , it ’s like putting on Superman ’s cape , ” he says .
“ I become Billy Mays , the ultimate pitchman .
And that ’s who I am .
And I ’m proud to be that . ”
Billy also claims that the more he yells over the course of a day , the stronger his voice gets .
Must come from the years he spent pitching portable washing machines on Boardwalk in Atlantic City .

I spent several months in the UK in 2008 before I shipped back to North Carolina to work on Obama ’s campaign .
I was struck how at some point the British press stopped bothering to contextualise US election stories as being about another country .
The candidates were named and discussed in shorthand just as if they were running for Parliament – and usually given much more coverage than the latest row in Westminster .
Yet at the same time , I kept hearing the rueful opinion that none of this would be possible over here .
The British people , I was told , were far too apathetic , far too disengaged , far too convinced that their voice – no matter how loud – would fall on the deaf ears of politicians who could n’t be bothered .
Plus , as I was frequently reminded , “ there is no British Obama ” .
All of this casts a rather sad tinge to the cathartic obsession with the America election – it ’s as if many Brits gave up looking for vibrant democracy in their own lives and resolved to experience it vicariously in ours .
Well , in response to all of this self - depreciating civic gloom I have only one of my favourite British aphorisms : rubbish .
Why ?
Because the ‘ there is no British Obama ’ claim fundamentally misunderstands what just happened in America – and is in fact fatally counter - productive to replicating it here .
It ’s obviously true that Obama ’s sensational talent as a campaigner and the outstanding accomplishments of his campaign cannot be underestimated .
But they were able to succeed in a particular context , and that context was a long fought , hard won victory in and of itself .
Here ’s the first point to remember : only a few short years before last months ’ triumphant inauguration , George W Bush had stolen an election and was peddling grave falsehoods to the American people , yet was basking in the highest approval ratings of any sitting president in American history .
Instead of “ yes we can ” we had “ you ’re either with us or against us ” and “ bring it on . ”
Critiquing the administration ’s foreign policy was loudly called treason .
Civic duty was reduced to shopping .
Global warming was officially denied .
And those of us who felt differently about any of it were quite fearful that either we , or everyone else around us , had gone stark raving mad .
And you know who changed all of this ?
It was not an obscure state legislator from Illinois .
It was the people ourselves .
I was lucky enough to have a front row seat for this transformation through my work with MoveOn.org .
MoveOn began as a simple plea for sanity when a modest California couple put up an online petition to oppose the impeachment of President Clinton and sent it to 60 of their friends .
In a few months , half a million people had signed .
It grew bigger when a young nonprofit worker and his roommate put out a simple request that America and her allies treat 9/11 as a crime and punish the guilty – not seize it as a pretext for war .
He sent their petition to his friends , and within days several hundred thousand people from every state and dozens of nations had added their name .
Of course , President Clinton was impeached and Iraq was invaded .
But people who knew it was wrong were linked together – and so the seeds of change were sewn .
Over the next seven years , MoveOn grew to more than five million members and its volunteers organised over 130,000 local events in every corner of the country .
A teacher in Boise , Idaho gathered friends from church to protest the nomination of an extreme conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice , and minds were changed .
An accountant from Albany , New York went with his wife and brother to hand their Congressman letters from constituents defending the food stamp program – and a vote was switched .
A librarian from Atlanta , Georgia got on the local news for her efforts to defend social security from privatisation , and a generation was saved .
What are the characteristics of this type of politics ?
The groups that practice it have a different organisational model to more traditional institutions .
They are driven by the grassroots , and energised by the collective action of regular people .
They do have a leadership , but these people are ‘ stewards ’ .
As a result , those managing the organisation act on behalf of the membership , not the other way around .
Crucially , while such movements exist to articulate a deeply held political worldview , they remain independent of political parties , and are willing to express the views of their members to both friends and opponents .
The power of this model of organizing was illustrated by the electoral potency of our movement .
The Bush era did not end in 2008 .
It ended in 2006 , when voters delivered his party in Congress the greatest rout in a generation .
There was no single Barack Obama to anchor or inspire that campaign , but MoveOn members used online tools to make seven million phone calls to swing congressional districts driving key voters to the polls .
There have been several other major online movement organisations very like MoveOn , and countless other organisations of every shape and size operating at a local , state and national level whose members played a vital role in moving the country towards that moment we all witnessed on January 20th .
And to be clear , none of this background in any way diminishes the obvious skill and magnetic power of Obama as a candidate , or the stupendous organizing feat of the Obama campaign .
But Obama himself is quite aware of his context .
I was sitting in the stadium that starry night in Denver when Obama looked up and told 75,000 people , “ this campaign has never been about me .
It ’s about you . ”
That oft repeated line was n’t just rhetoric , and he was n’t only talking about his election supporters .
He was talking about everything a nation of stubborn believers did to pave the way .
So if you want to find the next Obama movement , do n’t wait for the next Obama – start the next movement .

HEMP FACTS
What is hemp and why is everybody talking about it ?
Here are a few facts to feed your head ...
For Starters : - Farmers around the world grow hemp .
Legally .
And they 've been doing so for thousands of years .
View a timeline of hemp throughout history here .
- Hemp is a plant grown from a seed .
It can get up to 15 to 20 or so feet tall .
It is an annual , herbaceous , long fibre plant similar to flax ( linen ) , jute and ramie . [ i ]
- It 's the sister plant to marijuana but it wo n't get you high .
However , it 's good at doing almost anything else except making you ' high ' .
You 'll learn more about its versatility in this document .
- Although hemp and marijuana are both from the cannabis species , hemp contains virtually no THC ( delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana . )
If you smoke hemp you will likely get a headache .
You will not get ' high ' .
Its THC level is less than 1 % , whereas marijuana may contain between 5 - 15 %.[ iii ]
- Its seeds are pressed for oil that can be used for food ( salad dressings , supplements , etc. ) , industrial lubrication , diesel fuel , paints , varnishes and more .
- Hemp is a distinct variety of the plant species cannabis sativa L. [ ii ]
- Hemp is among the oldest industries on the planet , going back more than 10,000 years to the beginnings of pottery . [ iv ]
- The Columbia History of the World states that the oldest relic of human industry is a piece of Mesopotamian hemp fabric dating back to approximately 8,000 BC . [ v ]
- For more than a century , hemp was legal tender to pay American taxes .
[ vi ]
- Over 600,000 acres of hemp grow worldwide today .[ vii ]
Over 8,500 acres were grown in Canada in 2008.[ viii ]
- The 2002 figures for global hemp sales were US $ 250 million .
US $ 150 million in the United States alone .[ ix ]
- The HIA ( Hemp Industries Association ) is confident that the total North American hemp food and body care market in 2008 accounted for at least $ 100 million in retail sales .
In 2005 - 2008 , hemp food sales have averaged 47 % annual growth , making hemp one of the fastest - growing natural food categories .
Source .
Legality : - For the first 162 years of America 's existence , marijuana was totally legal and hemp was a common crop .
But during the 1930s , the U.S. government and the media began spreading outrageous lies about marijuana , which led to its prohibition .
( " Marijuana : The devil 's weed with roots in hell " , " Marijuana makes fiends of boys in 30 days " , “ Reefer Madness ” , etc . )
It was banned in the USA under the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 .
In a blatant case of mistaken identity , industrial hemp was banned along with it . [ x ]
- It is said that the motivation for the hemp ban was that new processing technologies were developed that made it a potential competitor with the newly founded synthetic fibre and plastics industries .
Hemp 's potential for producing paper also posed a threat to the timber and oil industries .
Evidence suggests that commercial interests , having much to lose from hemp competition , helped propagate the reefer madness hysteria and used their influence to lobby for Marijuana Prohibition .
It is debatable at to whether special interests conspired to destroy the hemp industry via Marijuana Prohibition , but evidence exists to raise the possibility . [ xi ]
- In Canada , parliament passed Bill C - 8 in May of 1997 , freeing industrial hemp from the drug legislation imposed in 1938 when Canada ’s Opium and Narcotics Control Act followed the United States ’ lead and banned hemp production .
The responsibilities to regulate the “ new ” crop were given to Health Canada . [ xii ]
( The UK lifted its ban in 1993 .[ xiii ] )
- It is currently illegal to grow industrial hemp for food , oil , paper or fabric in the USA , but it is perfectly legal to export hemp to the U.S. and to process , consume and wear it there . [ xv ]
Versatiliy : - A Popular Mechanics article from 1938 stated that over 25,000 different products could be made from hemp in oil , seed or fibre form .[ xvi ]
- Used for thousands of years by a wide variety of cultures , hemp is currently being used worldwide in industries such as fabric , food , bio - diesel fuel , paper , plastics , rope , building material , molded panels , car components , wallpaper , acoustic baffling and barn bedding for farm animals .[ xvii ] - 125 years ago , 70 to 90 percent of all rope , twine , cordage , ship sails , canvas , fibre , cloth , etc. , was made out of hemp fibre .
It was replaced by Dupont ’s then newly discovered petrochemical fibre ( nylon ) beginning in 1937 . [ xviii ]
Farming : - The hemp plant is highly resistant to most insect and disease , largely eliminating the need for most ( or all ) pesticides and herbicides .[ xix ]
- No herbicides have been approved for industrial hemp .
Early planting , as soon as the soil is warm enough , is a recommended weed control strategy . [ xx ]
- A normal stand of 200 to 300 plants per square meter shades out weeds , leaving the fields weed - free at harvest and covered in leaves that improve the soil in a self - mulching eco-system .[ xxi ]
- Industrial hemp can be grown on a wide variety of soil types , but tends to grow best on land that produces high yields of corn .[ xxii ]
- Hemp prefers a mild climate , humid atmosphere , and a rainfall of at least 25 - 30 inches per year .
[ xxiii ]
- A hemp field produces a very large bulk of plant material in a short period of time .
( Stalks can reach 15 feet tall in 70 - 90 growing days ) [ xxiv ] [ xxv ] - Yields can reach between 3 to 7 tons of dry hemp fibre stalk per acre .[ xxvi ] -HEMP IS THE NUMBER ONE biomass producer on planet earth : 10 tons per acre in approximately four months .

Hemp 's EFA profile provides a healthy alternative to fish , often high in mercury and other toxins .
- Hemp 's overall protein content of 35 % is comparable to soybeans and is higher than that found in nuts , other seeds , meats , dairy products and fish or poultry .
Hemp protein contains all of the essential amino acids in more nutritionally significant amounts and at a ratio closer to " complete " sources of protein ( like meat , milk and eggs ) than all other seeds except soy . [ lxix ] - 65 % of the proteins in hemp are " edestin , " which are easily digestible and act as pre-cursors to such vital body components as hormones , hemoglobin , enzymes and antibodies .
Hemp 's edestin structure is the highest in the plant kingdom , making it more digestible than soy and many other plant foods . [ lx x ]
- Hemp also contains a healthy 35 % of dietary fibre , the highest of all commercial flour grains , and it is high in the natural antioxidants Vitamin E , Vitamin C and chlorophyll .[ lxxi ]
- The hardiness and nutritional benefits of hemp could help address many of the world ’s starvation problems .[ lxxii ]
- Hemp should not be cooked at temperatures over 350 F because at this emperature the fats are in danger of becoming " trans " and thus unhealthy .

GENEVA , March 13 ( Reuters ) -
Tens of thousands of Georgians who fled last year 's war with Russia in breakaway South Ossetia will probably not be able to go home unless a political solution to the conflict is found , a U.N. expert said on Friday .
Walter Kaelin , the U.N. Secretary - General 's representative on the human rights of internally displaced persons , said those who could not return to their homes for the foreseeable future were entitled to safety , housing and livelihoods .
" I am concerned that tens of thousands remain displaced and will probably not return to their homes in the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia and adjacent areas unless solutions to the underlying conflict can be found , " Kaelin told the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva .
He said that humanitarian access to the area had been " politicised by both sides , " a problem that prevented him from visiting South Ossetia during a trip to Georgia in October .
Goran Lennmarker , a European special envoy on Georgia , said last month that there had been " de facto ethnic cleansing " in South Ossetia .
Russia invaded Georgia last August to thwart an attempt by Tbilisi to re-establish control over the pro-Russian breakaway region of South Ossetia , which has since declared independence along with another breakaway enclave , Abkhazia .
Since the five - day war , both regions have been recognised by Russia as independent states , secured by Russian troops .
Giorgi Gorgiladze , Georgia 's ambassador in Geneva , told the Council it was unacceptable that Russia was " blocking " the access of international humanitarian aid .
Kaelin said the biggest challenge was integrating nearly a quarter of a million people uprooted by ethnic conflict in Georgia soon after the break - up of the Soviet Union .
" My biggest concern in Georgia is the fate of 220,000 people or more who had been displaced in the early 1990s because they remain largely forgotten and marginalised , " he told reporters .
Housing conditions for this group were " unacceptable " , but they deserved equal treatment , according to the Swiss expert .
He said he hoped the next session of talks between Georgian and Russian officials in Geneva -- co-chaired by the United Nations , European Union and Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe -- would resolve the sensitive question of humanitarian access .
Dates for those talks have not been set .

While acknowledging that the recession makes the political battle more difficult , President Obama plans to begin addressing the country ’s immigration system this year , including looking for a path for illegal immigrants to become legal , a senior administration official said on Wednesday .
Mr. Obama will frame the new effort  likely to rouse passions on all sides of the highly divisive issue  as “ policy reform that controls immigration and makes it an orderly system , ” said the official , Cecilia Muñoz , deputy assistant to the president and director of intergovernmental affairs in the White House .
Mr. Obama plans to speak publicly about the issue in May , administration officials said , and over the summer he will convene working groups , including lawmakers from both parties and a range of immigration groups , to begin discussing possible legislation for as early as this fall .
Some White House officials said that immigration would not take precedence over the health care and energy proposals that Mr. Obama has identified as priorities .
But the timetable is consistent with pledges Mr. Obama made to Hispanic groups in last year ’s campaign .
Now Textbooks Can Nourish the Mind and the Body .
Edible textbooks just seemed like a natural move for us as a company Students today are burdened with not only the high cost of textbooks but also the high cost of food .
As a company we have always tried to address multiple problems in the most natural ways possible .
At first I thought the idea was a little quirky , a bit out there … why would you want to make rental textbooks edible ?
After I sampled the Carmel Mocha Chemistry © flavor I realized that Chegg was on to something revolutionary , it was like a light turned on in my head … the schnozberries tasted like schnozberries kind of moment .
Today , Chegg.com , the number one online textbook rental company , announces the launch of edible rental textbooks called Text - a - Licious ®.
The edible textbooks are available in 21 new flavors including Marketing Mango Mint © and Biology Banana Crunch ©.
After extensive studies conducted by former Stanford researcher Dhruv Sampat , Chegg.com has developed a patent pending formula that breaks down the complex compounds found in rental textbooks into an edible form .
Now not only will Chegg.com help college students save money on textbooks but also on food expenditures .
Chegg.com text - a- licious flavors
Chegg.com is no stranger to innovation .
The Santa Clara , California company first gained national notoriety for its textbook rental service in 2007 .
The service helps students save 65 to 85 percent or up to $ 650 per semester on textbooks .
To date Chegg.com has saved students $ 34 million !
" Edible textbooks just seemed like a natural move for us as a company , " said Osman Rashid , CEO of Chegg.com .
" Students today are burdened with not only the high cost of textbooks but also the high cost of food .
As a company we have always tried to address multiple problems in the most natural ways possible . "
During the clinical trials students who were given samples of economic textbooks applied with the digestible formula immediately reacted with severe cases of diarrhea and stomach cramps .
After further research , Chegg.com determined that the side effects were corollary to economic recession and not a result of the formula itself .
" At first I thought the idea was a little quirky , a bit out there … why would you want to make rental textbooks edible ? " said Mark Sanders , a Freshman at New York University .
" After I sampled the Carmel Mocha Chemistry © flavor I realized that Chegg was on to something revolutionary , it was like a light turned on in my head … the schnozberries tasted like schnozberries kind of moment . "
GOP senator Orrin Hatch 's charity tied to massive pharmaceutical donations John Byrne
Published : Monday March 2 , 2009
Print This Email
This A charity founded by a senior Republican lawmaker who was a key ally to the pharmaceutical industry received more than $ 170,000 in 2007 from drugmakers , far in excess of campaign finance rules had the money been donated to him directly , leaked documents show .
The senator , Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) , founded Utah Families Foundation , the recipient of the gifts , though he does n't serve on the foundation 's board .
But his son is now the chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) , the industry 's lobbying group .
Hatch has received more money from the pharmaceutical industry than any other group , raking in $ 1.25 million since 1998 .
The latest sums , however , dwarf that of previous donations from individual corporations .
In 2007 , the foundation received $ 25,000 from Eli Lilly , $ 30,000 from Barr Pharmaceuticals , $ 25,000 from AstraZeneca and $ 40,000 from PhRMA .
The figures were part of the foundation 's tax returns and accidentally released by the Internal Revenue Service to a nonprofit group .
As a tax - exempt 501 ( c ) 3 organization , Utah Families Foundation is n't required to disclose a donor list .
The same year Utah Families Foundation received massive gifts , Sen .
Hatch voted on a bill relating to Medicare Part D. Hatch voted against a bill requiring that the government negotiate discounted prices from drugmakers , a measure the industry vehemently opposed .
In 2005 , Hatch also voted against a measure that would have allowed Medicare to negotiate bulk prices for prescription drugs .
" And if that were n't enough political intrigue , the tax - exempt charitable foundation , which the senator from Utah helped start in the 1990s and still vigorously supports , has been delinquent for nearly a decade in filing its required annual reports with Utah state officials , " a Washington Times review by Jim McElhatton and Jerry Seper found , the reporters who revealed the documents .
Contacted about the report , Sen .
Hatch defended his son's work as a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist .
" My son , Scott , does not lobby me or anyone in my office .
He is a very moral and ethical person , " Hatch said .
" As for the Utah Families Foundations , my limited involvement consists mainly of attending their events .
As with most service opportunities , I find even these small gestures are very gratifying ways to volunteer my time and give to those less fortunate in our community .
" Giving charitable contributions of time or money to good causes is something I believe every individual and organization should try to do , " Hatch continued .
" Organizations choosing to donate to the Utah Families Foundation are giving resources to help Utah 's families in need from all corners of our state and that is very admirable . "
Melanie Sloan , director of the Washington ethics group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics and Washington , pointed out that the activity was only discovered because the IRS made a mistake .
Due to the way nonprofit law works , and the fact that many members of Congress have personal " pet " charities , such giving can fly far below the radar and still potentially have meaningful impact as a lobbying tool .
Citizens for Ethics first spotted the IRS form .
" This could be more common than we know , " Sloan said .
" When companies need a member of Congress and they 've already donated to their campaigns , they can make very large contributions to members ' foundations , " Sloan added .
" It 's another way to curry favor with a member of Congress . "

As much as we take for granted that we can turn on the tap for an endless supply of water whenever we need it , the truth is that rapid industrialization , increasing agricultural use and pollution have contributed to worldwide water shortages .
Â
Everyday brings increasing concern about the scarcity of water and its impact on global survival .
While about 70 % of the earth ’s surface is covered in water , most of it is saltwater which cannot be used for drinking , crop irrigation or most industrial uses .
Only 3 % Â of the world ’s water resources are fit for human consumption .
Of that , only about 1 % is readily available .
( Source : Investopedia.com ) .
Now although most people drink only two liters of water a day , they consume close to 3,000 once you take into account the water that goes into their food .
Moreover , as the worldâ€™s population grows and incomes rise , farmers will need about 25 % more water to keep everyone fed by 2030 , according to the International Water Management Institute ( IWMI ) .
( Source : The Economist )
The question as to whether water should be traded as a commodity like many other natural resources has come under debate recently .
Â
After all , resources like gold , silver , and oil have been market reliant for years .
But unlike other natural resources , water is a quintessential need of human life ; without it , species die .
So for water activists commoditizing water means commoditizing life itself .
But with the advent of the bottled water industry , this vital resource has already become commoditized to a large extent .
The wealthy are willing to pay a premium for bottled water because they perceive it to be clean and safe .
In October last year , Economist.com held an online debate about the value of water .
The proposition held that water is a scarce resource and so it should be priced according to its market value .
An activist backed opposition however balked at the idea that the management and distribution of , and access to a vital resource like water be left to unreliable market conditions .
Today around the world , particularly in the Global South , many communities lack access to clean drinking water .
From war zones , to rural farms , unclean and unreliable water supplies have led to rising disease and malnutrition .
The awareness of water as a basic human right has become as issue not just with activists but also with the common people .
People are now looking to governments to actively protect this right .
The idea of clean , safe water as a right , rather than as a privilege , has inspired the movement behind Article 31 , a proposed addition of â€ œRight to Waterâ€ to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
The full text of the Article reads :
â€ œEveryone has the right to clean and accessible water , adequate for the health and well - being of the individual and family , and no one shall be deprived of such access or quality of water due to individual economic circumstance.â€ 
If you too believe that governments around the world need to protect your basic right to water , then please take a moment to read and sign the petition to adopt article 31 .
Michael Steele , the new chairman of the Republican party , is surely setting some sort of land speed record for public - relations disaster .
Elected on 30 January , he barely lasted a month before the first calls came for his resignation .
The month in question included various oddities on his part , most notably his disastrous attempt to show he was a bigger dog on the Republican porch than radio fat - mouth Rush Limbaugh , which ended with Steele in full retreat , tail between his legs .
The calamity proved that Limbaugh , in Republican and conservative circles , is not to be tampered with .
Everyone has observed that .
But few have taken the lesson one step further and asked what , in turn , is proved by Limbaugh 's preeminence within the party .
Within the answer to that question lies Steele 's biggest task as chairman , but it 's a task that , for implacable structural reasons , he 'll find impossible to take on .
If you 've been wondering why the Republican party is such a train wreck right now , this is why .
Limbaugh is a dominant figure because the Grand Old Party is no longer a political party in the usual American sense .
It is an ideological faction .
In America , as you know , we 've had basically a two - party system for most of our history .
In parliamentary systems , small ideologically driven groups tend to form political parties , win a few seats , and make coalitions with larger parties .
In America , it does n't work like that .
Our small ideologically driven groups have chiefly located themselves within the two big parties and fought for power internally .
For instance , the Democratic party has , since Franklin Roosevelt 's time , been an amalgam of clashing interests .
Notably , FDR's Democratic party included northern liberals and southern racists ( many of whom were liberal on economic and redistributionist questions as long as the redistributing was limited to white people ) .
By the early 1960s , though , the tension became too great and the Democrats made choices - good and courageous choices - that forced the racists to leave .
Meanwhile , from the mid-1950s , a conservative rump group decided to " burrow from within " and work inside the Republican party to take it over .
The GOP of the 1950s , led by Dwight Eisenhower , was quite middle of the road by today 's standards , and conservatives held Ike in contempt .
Well , to make a really long story really short , they succeeded .
A cohort of moderates remained within the GOP through the early 1990s .
Today ?
There are 41 Republicans in the Senate and 178 in the House of Representatives .
Perhaps four of the former and 10 or 12 of the latter can be called moderate .
The rest are committed conservatives .
This is insanely out of balance for an American political party .
You look at the Democrats , and they are n't uniformly liberal in the way the Republicans are uniformly conservative .
Of the 58 Democratic senators , nearly 20 are genuinely moderate .
This exasperates liberals and will get under President Obama 's skin .
But historically speaking , it is as it should be .
American political parties are supposed to be big and diverse .
But today 's GOP consists , with those few exceptions , only of its conservative faction .
Conservatives have been disciplined and strategic and have poured billions into political infrastructure - building over the years .
When things were going their way , they did n't have to worry about the lack of moderates .
But now , things are n't going their way .
Unless Obama really , really blows it , the GOP is going to be the minority party for quite some time .
It 's easy to see now why Limbaugh has such power , no ?
If the GOP had a moderate wing , he would n't .
Any sane person can grasp , then , that Steele should revive a moderate wing .
But the conservatives will not permit it .
Co-operation with the president is capitulation , and any vote or utterance that admits even the most modest role for government is socialism .
Steele himself seems to have no interest in changing direction .
Incredibly , he said he would not rule out primary challenges from the right to moderate GOP legislators who support Obama on key legislation .
One of the moderates , Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , is up for re-election in 2010 .
A rightwinger who nearly beat him in a primary the last time just vowed to run again , and he will have support from conservative money sources .
What will Steele do ?
The likely result of a primary win by the conservative challenger , of course , is that the Democrats will pick up the seat , because the challenger , Pat Toomey , may be too rightwing to win in Pennsylvania .
And if the Democrats get that 60th Senate seat in 2010 ( 60 is a filibuster - proof majority ) , the Republicans will really have no plan except to hope Obama fails .
Mind you , I 'm hardly upset about any of this .
I think it 's all pretty wonderful .
Certainly the selection of Steele , who is African American , played against type .
He was supposed to be a breath of fresh air .
So far the air is awfully hot and stale .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama on Friday lifted restrictions on U.S. government funding for groups that provide abortion services or counseling abroad , reversing a policy of his Republican predecessor George W. Bush , a spokesman said .
The Democratic president ’s decision was a victory for advocates of abortion rights on an issue that in recent years has become a tit - for - tat policy change each time the White House shifts from one party to the other .
When the ban was in place , no U.S. government funding for family planning services could be given to clinics or groups that offer abortion services or counseling in other countries even if the funds for those activities come from non-U.S. government sources .
Obama signed an executive order lifting the restrictions on Friday , a White House spokesman said .
It has been called the Mexico City Policy because it was unveiled at a United Nations conference there in 1984 and became one of the centerpiece social policies of the conservative administration of former President Ronald Reagan , a Republican .
Critics call it the “ gag rule ” because it also cuts funds to groups that advocate or lobby for the lifting of abortion restrictions , so they say it infringes on free speech .
They also say it has reduced healthcare for some of the world ’s poorest women .
Former President Bill Clinton , a Democrat , rescinded the rule when he took office in January 1993 and his successor , Republican George W. Bush , reinstated it in January 2001 .
Planned Parenthood , a health care provider and advocacy group for abortion rights , welcomed the move .
“ With the stroke of a pen , President Obama has lifted the stranglehold on women ’s health across the globe , ” Cecile Richards , the group ’s president , said in a statement .
“ No longer will health care providers be forced to choose between receiving family planning funding and restricting the health care services they provide to women . ”
CRITICS ON BOTH SIDES
When he reinstated the policy after the Clinton administration , Bush said taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for or advocate abortions .
Anti-abortion activists agreed with Bush and criticized the move to lift the ban on funding .
President Barack Obama signs an executive order concerning the U.S. military base in Guantanamo in the Oval Office , January 22 , 2009 .

“ When we wake up every morning to a deepening financial crisis , it is an insult to the American people to bail out the abortion industry , ” said Charmaine Yoest , president of Americans United for Life .
“ Planned Parenthood is a billion - dollar company and they do not need additional resources to burden the American taxpayer , ” she added .
U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed disapproval .
“ I have long supported the Mexico City Policy and believe this administration ’s decision to be counter to our nation ’s interests , ” he said in a statement .
The United States spends more than $ 400 million on overseas family planning assistance each year .
Critics of the funding ban say the anti-abortion restrictions have resulted in huge drops for funding worldwide to organizations that provide family - planning services and basic healthcare .
They say this means many women are deprived of contraception and other health services in poor countries , leading to back - alley abortions and deaths .
The Center for Reproductive Rights says , for example , that in Ethiopia and Lesotho , some nongovernmental organizations are no longer able to offer comprehensive and integrated healthcare services to patients suffering from HIV / AIDS .
Abortion rights opponents and groups who support the Mexico City Policy dispute the view that it has led to an increase of illegal abortions or deaths overseas .
Unlike Clinton and Bush , Obama did not act on the rule on the January 22 anniversary of Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that made abortions legal throughout the United States .

Designers are working on making pilotless aircraft semi-autonomous The Ministry of Defence has showcased current and next - generation unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) .
The event was held as part of National Science and Engineering Week - an annual event celebrating science , engineering and technology - and to give manufacturers the chance to show off some of their creations .
Military use of UAVs has been growing fast .
Twenty years ago , they were a bonus item for the armed forces , now they are seen as an essential part of the modern warrior 's arsenal .
Chart comparing UAVs UAVs are mainly used for reconnaissance , although some of the larger models can also drop weapons .
On show was equipment currently deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as prototypes and models of new technology that could be in service in the next few years .
The role of unmanned vehicles was to do " dull , dirty , and dangerous work and lessen the risk to the troops , " said General Andrew Figgures , the officer in charge of MoD procurement , at the event ..
T- HAWK MICRO AIR VEHICLE
The US Navy has 90 T - Hawks Built by Honeywell , this 8 kg hovering air vehicle carries a regular and night vision camera , enabling troops to get a stable eye - in - the - sky .
The device , with a price tag of $ 250,000 ( £ 180,000 ) is already in use with the US Navy and is currently on trial with British forces and the US 25th Infantry Division in Iraq .
Speaking to the BBC , Adrian Harding from Honeywell , said the device was almost unique in the market .
" Unlike most other UAVs , which have to make numerous passes over a target , we can hover overhead and have constant eyes on the ground , " he said .
WATCHKEEPER
The Watchkeeper UAV has seen service in Iraq and Afghanistan Thales ' UAV is already in active service in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
Unlike many UAVs , Watchkeeper does not need to be " flown " by an operator .
The device is autonomous , choosing the best flight path to get to a destination set by an operator .
Speaking to the BBC , Sergeant David Alexander - serving with the 32 Regiment , Royal Artillery - said that the Watchkeeper had already helped save lives .
" It 's easy to operate .
Really easy .
We have two - man teams , one who directs where the aircraft needs to go , and the other who monitors the images coming in .
" It 's main use is spotting possible IED [ improvised explosive devices ] by looking for disturbed soil , wires or possible enemy combatants .
" The work is really satisfying as you help save lives . "
MQ - 9 REAPER
The Reaper first saw active service with the RAF in 2007
The successor to the well known Predator UAV , the Reaper gives the armed forces a larger , faster aircraft with a greater payload .
Originally called Predator B , the aircraft has been designed to perform high - altitude surveillance , reconnaissance and so - called hunter - killer missions .
While the Predator could operate up to an altitude of 25,000 ft ( 7620 m ) and a speed of 120 mph ( 193 kph ) , Reaper can go up to 50,000 feet at speeds of over 240 mph .
It can also carry a weapon payload in excess of 1.3 tonnes .
The Reaper is already in service with the RAF and USAF and the developers are working on further modifications .
DESERT HAWK III The Desert Hawk III can be hand launched by a soldier Another UAV , but much smaller than Reaper , Desert Hawk III is a hand - launched drone that is used by troops to carry out surveillance .
The device fits inside a backpack carried by troops .
Developed by Lockheed Martin , the UAV has a range of up to 15 km and can be in the air for up to 90 minutes .
At present , an operator controls the Desert Hawk III from a laptop and transmitter , although the developers are working on a customised and more durable control system .
CASPER 250 UK police have also tested the Casper 250 British firms are also working on small UAVs that can be carried in a backpack .
Birmingham - based Sonic Communications has built the Casper 250 Man-pack , a battery - powered UAV that is ready for launched within 20 minutes of being unpacked .
The developer 's say the device becomes " silent and invisible " once it reaches 100 m , can stay airborne for more than 90 minutes and has a range of 12 miles .
Casper has two interchangeable cameras , for night or day use , and can transmit the images either directly to the ground control station or to a command and control centre .
TARANIS & MANTIS
It is thought the first test flight will take place in 2010 BAE Systems is working on two very different UAVs .
Mantis is a large pilotless aircraft , with a wingspan of 22 m , can stay airborne for more than 24 hours and operate at more than 40,000 feet .
Speaking to the BBC , BAE 's head of communications , Adam Morrison , said the Mantis could survey or patrol an area with great accuracy .
" Most UAVs are controlled on the ground , even if that control is a bunker somewhere in the US .
Because of the human element , you 're never going to get a precise and regular course over time .
" With Mantis , you can cover an area with almost regular monotony , which means not only constant coverage , but you can spot if anything in that area has changed .
" You could also use it for maritime patrol and with the autonomous nature of the plane , all you need to tell it is which airfield it takes off and lands at , the length of runway and off it goes . "
The other UAV it is working on - Taranis - is very different .
The £ 124 m , four year project to develop it hopes to create an unmanned , stealth , deep - strike aircraft as part of the Government 's strategic unmanned air vehicle experiment .
Initial ground trials are scheduled for late 2009 , with a maiden flight scheduled for 2010 .

Somebody asked me the other day what I thought of Recovery.gov using Drupal and it got me thinking about content management systems .
In my consulting days , I watched companies and political campaigns and non-profits sometimes spend hundreds of thousands of dollars annually trying to make their content management system do what they wanted it to do for their online campaigns .
As an honest developer and honest consultant , this made me apoplectic– I knew that at the end of the day , technically what they wanted was fairly easy to build .
But they had to pay hundreds of dollars an hour to get a “ Drupal Specialist ” at an outside consultancy to set up simple pages because they could not figure out how to get the stuff to work right .
Now , this experience is n’t solely limited to Drupal .
From working on the Dean Campaign to consulting for hundreds of clients at Blue State Digital , to working at a non-profit like the Sunlight Foundation , I do n’t think I ’ve ever been happy with a content management system .
I ’ve tried dozens , from the ever so simple blog engines like TextPattern and WordPress , to the more complex Drupal , MovableType , and ExpressionEngine , to the full - scale content management systems like Typo3 , Bricolage , I feel like I ’ve worked on and with as many content management systems as I possibly can in my career .
And I ca n’t help but feel as though I ’ve never been satisfied with any of them .
Amazingly , I can’t find anybody that ’s used their content management system that does n’t seem to either be resigned to using it , or have an amazing amount of contempt for it .
People really hate their content management systems and I think the reason why is because full - blown Content Management Systems just do n’t work for any kind of sophisticated online presence .
At the end of the day , you ’re probably going to want to do something that Content Management System ca n’t do or worse– you ’re going to run into something that your content management system can do and does poorly .
See– the problem with a full scale Content Management System is that it has too many opinions .
Those opinions were though of by somebody other than you and the needs of your organization .
The more developed a content management system ( or any piece of software , really ) the more “ opinions ” it has .
And the more “ opinions ” it has , the more likely one of them is going to really tick you off .
Especially in the world of Content Management .
Those opinions could be anything from “ What should the admin interface of the website look like ” to “ how should workflow work for the editorial process ” to “ What kind of user registration system should there be ” or a plethora of other opinions like “ how should data be stored ” and “ how does a designer interact with me . ”
More often than not , one of these pieces of functionality is bound to create frustration and anger– potentially rage for either you or your users .
Our alternative is to take a step back from Content Management Systems .
You have software frameworks — generally a programmer ’s toolkit used to build things like Content Management Systems or other web applications .
Instead of spending lots of money on a content management system and paying a specialist integrator to create and install and maintain it , you ’re better off finding a competent developer that is well versed in a framework like Django or Ruby on Rails .
One competent developer using either of these frameworks can weave together a content management solution and constantly be developing tools inside of this solution that make sense for your organization .
With Government in particular you end up with even more problems going the standard CMS route .
When Government picks a CMS over a framework , Government is basically saying that they ’re going to trust the CMS ’s standard way of delivering data or work to change those standards and replace them with new ones .
It seems to me that especially in Government it is far more effective to be using frameworks than CMSes .
Recovery.gov , for instance , is n’t a content management problem but a data delivery problem .
Government should be focused on delivering that data in the most thorough way possible and when you factor all the different data sources that recovery.
gov is going to have to talk to , I ’d much rather be using python than trying to hack within the confines Drupal to do the job .
There ’s some arguments against taking this route .
The most knee - jerk one is “ you ’re throwing away so much functionality ” when you do n’t use something like Drupal .
But the point of frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails is so that much of the common functionality ( user logins , registration , even things like social networks and shopping carts ) can easily be baked in to any application in the way a developer and a customer chooses .
They can be built custom or sewn together through components and plug-ins .
The second argument is : “ But Drupal / ExpressionEngine / Silverstripe is a framework , too ! ” and it is n’t .
It just simply is n’t .
Drupal and the like are content management systems that may have modular hooks in them to build other software , but the software crosses the line into content management systems when it starts providing default user - experiences out of the box .
This means you have to un - do the way default behavior works and apply what you want as desired behavior rather than writing behavior from scratch .
That ’s where the primary difference is between a Content Management System and a Framework are : a framework provides a minimal amount of user - facing functionality ( it may provide simple ways to create it ) but generally focuses on providing tools that make a developer ’s life easier .
The third is : “ Integration ” which for most organizations is a quixotic windmill chase if there ever was one .
In my years of working on voter databases , targeting tools , contribution systems and email systems people constantly asked for all these systems to be integrated , but when asked for practical reasons why they often came up short .
When you do have those practical reasons – those integrated queries you want to run on your user data — your developer can make that happen to you probably better than you can with squeezing your data needs into a CMS .
There ’s also some gray area here — a “ Third Way ” if you will .
Sometimes a framework gets extracted out of a content management system .
CodeIgniter , for instance , was extracted out of ExpressionEngine , and Sapphire was extracted out of Silverstripe .
You may be tempted to say “ Hey , this is the best of both worlds ! ” and it could be , but keep in mind that you ’re still choosing to adopt a bunch of opinions in your software from people who do n’t have your organization ’s priorities in mind .
The point is to start with a framework that allows you to build solutions rapidly rather than to buy off on somebody else ’s solutions .
Also , you have content management systems like Ellington and Mephisto that are built on these pre-existing frameworks .
Same deal applies – just because the content management system is built on a framework , even one that you like , does n’t mean that the design of the content management system works for your organization .
It is likely better and cheaper to build a solution that works for you out of the framework .
This is n’t to say that you need to build every application in your web presence from scratch .
At Sunlight , for instance , we use Blue State Digital ‘ s [ 1 ] mailer and advocacy tools and integrate them seamlessly into our campaigns when they fit the bill .
They ’re a great provider of services that fit around what we need .
We ’re happy to drop in other off the shelf solutions as well – the Sunlight Foundation blog , being a blog and all , is powered by WordPress .
But when it comes to content management and end user experience , we want to control the user experience as much as possible .
Now , this is n’t a decision for everyone to make .
But if you are sitting there thinking about your content management needs and trying to figure out how to “ power ” your website and a vendor has given you a bid somewhere close to or over $ 40,000 for the first year of purely technical work , consider shopping around for a full time Django or Ruby on Rails developer instead .
You ’ll find yourself with the ability to do more , faster .
One last caveat : never hire anybody who is religious about their software .
If somebody believes that “ Rails is the solution ! ” or engages you in a debate about why “ Drupal creates so much possibility for our movement ” and tries to inject some form of zealotry into your thought process , get away from them as quickly as you can .
Writing good software is , at the end of the day , not about the framework you use or the content management system you ’re an expert at , but about being a good developer .
A good developer is going to seem nearly agnostic about the tools that they use and instead be able to converse with you and develop the solution that is right for the problem .
A language like Python or Ruby or PHP does n’t matter nearly as much as the competency of a developer .
A great developer is going to be able to do amazing things in any language or framework .
Update 5:06 pm
It should be noted here that this is n’t a Drupal specific post , though it seems like there ’s a lot of anger from the Drupal community about this post .
To those that think that this is a direct attack on Drupal / Your Favorite CMS , I ask that you take another look through the article and keep a level head .
It is n’t .
Another misunderstanding is that this is specifically geared towards the Open Source community , which it is n’t .
Next , there ’s a new argument I did n’t account for that I should have : “ doing it all yourself means if your developer gets hit by a bus , you ’re going to be out of luck ! ”
That ’s not true exclusively of frameworks vs. content management systems .
That ’s where the competency comes in : if you hire a competent ruby developer to build a Ruby on Rails solution for you and help you maintain it , that code will be maintainable , just as if you hired a competent ExpressionEngine developer to make modifications to EE Core .
And if you hire an incompetent Ruby developer their code will not be maintainable , just like when you hire an incompetent EE developer .
The point is competency .

The idea that Cheney would seed the government with trusted contacts is not surprising .
As Hersh noted in his talk with Gross , Cheney has “ been around forever ” and “ understands bureaucracy much better ” than almost anyone in government .
In 2006 , Robert Dreyfuss reported for The American Prospect that when Cheney helped staff the Bush administration in 2001 , he put together a “ corps of hard - line acolytes ” that served “ as his eyes and ears ” in the federal bureaucracy .
Former officials called them “ Dick Cheney ’s spies . ”
Additionally , before leaving office , the Bush administration aggressively placed political appointees into permanent civil service positions as part of a process known as “ burrowing . ”
Some of the burrowed former political appointees have close ties to Cheney , such as Jeffrey T. Salmon , who was a speechwriter for Cheney when he served as defense secretary .
In July , he was named deputy director for resource management in the Energy Department ’s Office of Science
Transcript :
GROSS : You investigated the Bush administration throughout the Bush administration .
Always looking for ways that they may , might have been going beyond executive authority in taking on new powers .
And now that the Bush administration is over , you ’re still investigating what they did and where they might have violated the law .
Is investigating that any different for you as a journalist post - Bush administration than it was during the Bush administration ?
Are more people coming forward now , now that the president and vice president are no longer in power ?
HERSH : You know , that ’s a great question because I did think , I had a lot of people that had told me in the last year of Bush , “ call me next , next February . ”
And , so far , even people who are out are still cherry because , you know , not so much Bush , but Cheney really is …he ’s really smart .
In the article this week , in the New Yorker , that ’s coming out this week , I mention that at one point last fall , Mr. Miliband , the young foreign secretary of Britain , unilaterally , without telling the White House made a trip to Syria to see the president , Assad , and his intelligence chief , his MI6 chief went before him .
And Bush - Cheney did n’t know about it until actually was , they were actually there .
And Cheney at a meeting — and I do have , I can tell you I do have access and have had and I ’ve been careful of how I use it , to a lot of stuff from meetings in the White House — and at a meeting he railed on about perfidious Albion , you know , the old Shakespeare term for England and that was used during the Revolutionary war as a pejorative term for England .
Perfidious Albion he said .
He is , Cheney is really underestimated .
It ’s easy to make a caricature of him .
He ’s very very bright .
And he ’s also in person , a much more open - minded in the sense , I ’m talking about not politically .
You could go and the most despaired people in the world go and have social evenings with him and his wife and talking about current , as long as you do n’t get into politics , movies and stuff like that .
It ’s , he ’s easy to make a caricature , but he ’s much more formidable than people think .
Got a rap clap memory .
Understands bureaucracy much better , he ’s been around forever , has had every job .
GROSS : Are you saying that you think Vice President Cheney is still having a chilling effect on people who might otherwise be coming forward and revealing things to you about what happened in the Bush administration ?
HERSH : I ’ll make it worse .
I think he ’s put people left .
He ’s put people back .
They call it a stay behind .
It ’s sort of an intelligence term of art .
When you leave a country and , you know , you ’ve driven out the , you know , you ’ve lost the war .
You leave people behind .
It ’s a stay behind that you can continue to contacts with , to do sabotage , whatever you want to do .
Cheney ’s left a stay behind .
He ’s got people in a lot of agencies that still tell him what ’s going on .
Particularly in defense , obviously .
Also in the NSA , there ’s still people that talk to him .
He still knows what ’s going on .
Can he still control policy up to a point ?
Probably up to a point , a minor point .
But he ’s still there .
He ’s still a presence .
And again , because of the problems this administration ’s having filling jobs , a lot of people who served in the Bush Cheney government , particularly even in the White House people on most sophisticated staffs are still there .
You simply ca n’t get rid of everybody , you may not even want to .
Some are professional people .
But Cheney is , I would never call it admiration , but , you know , formidable , yeah , this guy .
This guy is the real McCoy .
ASSUMPTIONS ….
When I was a teenager , I had certain misconceptions about politics and government .
I assumed , for example , that members of Congress , whether I agreed with their policies or not , were necessarily very bright .
After all , these folks are educated and well read .
They attend policy briefings , hear expert testimony at committee hearings , and have staffers who help keep them informed on everything from the economy to foreign policy to constitutional law .
It ’s not like voters would just send some misguided schmuck to serve as their voice in one of the most prestigious legislative bodies on the planet .
Needless to say , I did n’t fully appreciate , at the time , how this process works .
I thought about this when I saw Matt Yglesias ’ item from yesterday , reflecting on Rep Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif . ) twittering about how much he ’s enjoying “ Atlas Shrugged . ”
Matt commented :
Something I think most liberals do n’t understand is exactly how stupid many conservative leaders are .
There is , yes , a condescending tendency to believe that no smart person could be on the right ideologically at all .
That ’s dead wrong .
There are plenty of bright people on the right .
But the way their movement works , intelligence or understanding of politics and policy has no meaningful role in advancement .
If anything , there ’s something of a negative correlation between knowing what you ’re talking about and being able to get ahead in right - wing politics .
So you get stuff like this .
He ’s not cocooning by reading Milton Friedman , he ’s cocooning by reading Ayn Rand .
It ’s nuts , but it ’s the way things work .
I ’d go a little further .
Most of the media and the public underestimate the scope of the foolishness , too .
If a member of Congress — not just some back - bencher , but a senator or a member of the House leadership — says something seemingly provocative , a lot of people are predisposed to take it seriously .
After all , he / she is in a position of authority .
He / she helps shape the policies of the federal government .
His / her opinion must have some value ; I ’m seeing it on television .
The underlying assumption is the same one I had in high school .
We talked earlier , for example , about House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) responding to an economic collapse by calling for a spending freeze .
News outlets reported this straight — as if it were a serious recommendation from a credible public figure .
Some Americans probably heard the news and thought there might be something to it .
After all , Boehner ’s the House Minority Leader .
GOP lawmakers got together and picked him as their # 1 guy .
If Republicans re-claimed the majority , Boehner would be the Speaker of the House , and two heartbeats from the presidency .
Respectable figures are reluctant to say , out loud , “ My God , what this man is saying is blisteringly stupid . ”
Indeed , leading Republican officials — Mitch McConnell , Jon Kyl , Mike Pence — say all kinds of things that should be dismissed as transparent nonsense , but are n’t .
There must be something coherent about their ideas , the conventional thinking goes , by virtue of their offices .
Their recommendations warrant responses — and even deserve consideration at the negotiating table — because they maintain positions of influence in government .
“ Something I think most liberals do n’t understand is exactly how stupid many conservative leaders are . ”
If only liberals were n’t the only ones .
But as the number of Western yoga teachers has grown , there has been a steady increase in patent applications claiming each pose in their class is not part of the ancient discipline of mind and body , but their own unique invention .
In the United States alone , there have been more than 130 yoga - related patents , 150 copyrights and 2,300 trademarks .
Now India 's Traditional Knowledge Digital Library is being made available to patents offices throughout the world so they can establish whether the claim is a genuine innovation or " prior art " from Indian systems of medicine .

Do you think that your boss does n’t know what he ’s talking about ?
Does it seem that the only reason that he ’s boss is because he talks a big game and people without any other ideas listen to him with little regard to the facts ?
And does your boss seem to think he ’s great despite his seemingly obvious short - fallings ?
Well , science says that you ’re probably right in your assessment much of the time .
As it turns out , being a boss often means that you just have to confidently talk like one and managers tend to hold an overinflated opinion of themselves and their performance .
The evidence ?
A study by social psychologists at the University of California not only confirms the axiom that talking like a leader makes you seem like one in people ’s eyes , but proves that the more dominating your personality , the easier it is to get away with incompetence .
By taking a group of people and presenting them with challenges , the researchers tried to evaluate what makes someone a leader .
The study ’s participants generally tended to assign leadership roles and favorable ratings to people who spoke the most and seemed the most confident with little regard for the quality of their answers and suggestions .
When solving math problems from an old GMAT test , the same highly thought of leaders were the ones who gave the most answers , not the ones who gave the right answers .
In fact , none of these emergent leaders were good at taking math tests according to their self - reported math scores from the SAT .
The disconcerting revelations did n’t stop there .
Participants gave any person who spoke up a higher rating than those who were quiet , even if these people said little or nothing of substance .
So next time you ’re in a meeting , consider speaking up even if you ’re just agreeing with what someone else said .
It makes you look good to the rest of the group and you do n’t even have to make a genuine contribution .
I know it ’s hardly shocking to those of us with years in the office under our belt , sitting with the bigwigs at meetings and wondering how they can talk for hours without really saying anything actionable .
But this is one of those studies which confirms our darkest suspicions .
When we ’re choosing our leaders , we focus too much on flash and pay little attention to the substance .
It ’s also interesting to note that you could be seen as leader material by giving your team a cheery , confident pep talk , putting up a to do list and waiting until it ’s all done to shake a few hands and say “ oh , I had no doubts we can do it . ”
To top it all off , most of your co-workers would describe you in very favorable ways after you did nothing but talk .
But being seen as a leader and described in gushingly positive terms based on your confident exterior creates a big problem .
A BusinessWeek Poll found that 9 out of 10 bosses think their performance puts them in the top 10 % of their peers .
Either there ’s a new definition of top 10 % or an overwhelming majority of managers have overinflated egos .
So not only do bosses rise to the top by acting like experts , they also seem to think they belong at the top by virtue of their positions .
If my experience is any guide , it ’s much more likely that bosses who did n’t think their performance is top 10 % material are doing exceptional work that usually gets overshadowed by big talk and confident smiles .
An American drone once again struck a suspected militant camp in Pakistan .
12 people are dead , and 13 more are wounded , residents of Khadizai village tell Reuters .
It 's the first known attack since President Obama announced his new war strategy for the region – one that places heavy emphasis on destroying jihadist networks in Pakistan .
The President pledged that no ground troops would be sent into Pakistan , to take out the terrorists .
So the unmanned strikes are likely to increase , Pentagon officials tell Danger Room .
According to the New York Times , the attack was " apparently aimed at one of the area ’s most important Taliban leaders , Hakimullah Mehsud " – but missed .
He 's a top lieutenant to Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud , who took credit earlier this week for the slaughter in a Lahore police training compound .
" It 's revenge for the drone attacks in Pakistan , " he told Reuters .
Separately , Mehsud told the Associated Press : " Soon , we will launch an attack in Washington that will amaze everyone in the world . "
Today 's unmanned strike " was the first drone attack " in Pakistan 's Orakzai agency , Reuters reports .
It had been considered " one of the most peaceful Pashtun regions in northwest Pakistan . "

Some days it seems the entire world is waiting with bated breath for the eventual fall from grace of the long - vaunted Macintosh security .
From industry publications to the mainstream press , even the slightest Mac security hiccup spurs an onslaught of articles , debates , and even the occasional cable news headline .
Some stories declare us invulnerable to attacks , while others give the impression that by the time you jump up from your armchair and rush to your Mac , it will already be infected and funneling your life ’s savings and family photos to Nigerian spammers .
For us Mac users it can be difficult to discern the lines between truth , hype , and outright fantasy .
As someone who spends most of his time reading , writing , and speaking about security , there are five things I tend to look for in Mac security news to cut to the heart of the story .
After all the hype in recent days over the “ Mac botnet , ” I thought it was time to share some of my tricks .
Is the Story Based on a Vendor Press Release ?
Many security vendors provide the computing community an invaluable service by releasing vulnerability and exploit information uncovered by their research and incident response teams .
While this information is incredibly helpful in learning about and evaluating new security threats , it also comes with a dark side : Vendor marketing departments often see these discoveries as a great way to scare people into buying their products .
They issue press releases to draw as much attention to problems as possible , hoping they will bring more users to their products ( since they can always , of course , protect against the new risk ) .
These releases would fade into the ether if it were n’t for a press hungry for readers .
Everyone loves a good scare story , and it becomes the digital media equivalent of “ if it bleeds , it leads . ”
When I read any story involving some new kind of security threat , the first thing I look for is the source of the story .
If I see nothing but quotes from a security vendor , or a straight reprint of a press release ( an all - too - common practice ) , my skepticism meter usually starts to peak .
( For the record , I do n’t consider the vendors malicious or deceptive , but when you truly believe in your product it comes with a certain bias . )
Is the Story Really New ?
Security stories often percolate for months , or even years , in the industry press before breaking out into more mainstream publications .
Even within the industry press , we sometimes see a small group of incidents constantly repurposed in new articles , typically with a healthy dose of additional hyperbole .
The Mac botnet story that flooded the press last week is a classic example of an old story experiencing an unjustified rebirth .
The malicious software initially appeared back in January 2009 , hidden inside pirated versions of iWork ’09 and Adobe Photoshop CS4 .
The story was revived as additional information came to light , but it was unfortunately misinterpreted by many as some new kind of attack .
The malicious software was demonstrating some interesting behavior , but nothing in the story indicated any additional risk to users .
A quick Google search will usually reveal the root of the story , and help determine if you face a new risk .
Is the Security Issue Really New ?
It ’s not uncommon to see a string of security stories that are all essentially about the same root problem .
This happens regularly even in the security industry ; once a new vulnerability or exploit becomes public there ’s a never - ending string of variants as different bad guys try to circumvent our security defenses .
But these variants are typically different colors on the same body , and do n’t indicate any increased risk over the original .
For example , some Mac malware hides itself as a fake video player on adult Web sites , and we saw a few new versions appear last year .
This social engineering trick – hiding malware inside an innocuous - looking application aimed at prurient interests – has been around nearly as long as people have been looking at digital pictures of other people who are n’t wearing clothes .
When I read stories that seem to spin old news , or describe a variant of a well - known problem , I start looking at them more skeptically .
I ’m generally unimpressed by any story that involves tricking a user into manually installing malicious software .
On occasion we see a particularly creative deception , and I might be concerned if the malicious software was hiding in a mainstream application , but getting someone to install something evil on their system is a fault with the human brain , not their operating system of choice .
What ’s the Mechanism of Action ?
With any security risk there has to be some sort of mechanism of action .
Sometimes it ’s a new vulnerability in an operating system or software , other times it ’s a new method of attack .
If the news story does n’t offer any details on the mechanism of action , I start hunting down sources to determine what ’s really going on .
Once I do identify the mechanism , I can usually determine the level of risk .
For example , as we discussed above , I tend to be less concerned about software that requires manual installation , unless it ’s hidden itself in an extremely common source that affects a large portion of the community .
( Yes , you could argue hiding malware in an adult video player hits a large portion of the community , but that ’s not something we talk about in polite publications ) .
If I see something that works only under a limited set of uncommon circumstances , the risk is usually low .
However , when I see something that allows an attacker to take over your system via an email message , by getting you to view a malicious Web page , or via a network attack on a common port or other common service , I become more concerned .
First ask yourself how it works ( what ’s the mechanism of attack ? ) , then how bad it is ( what does it damage , or allow the attacker to do ? ) , and then who it affects ( any Mac user , or just those running some obscure software ? ) .
Admittedly , you need a bit of knowledge to make these interpretations , but you do n’t generally have to be a security expert to figure out many of the basics .
Going back to our Mac botnet story , it was mentioned , if not clear , in every article that the malicious software hid itself only inside pirated versions of iWork ’09 and Photoshop CS4 .
Unless you downloaded those illegally , or grabbed a ( possibly illegal ) version from a friend , you were safe .
End of story .
Does the Story Defend Mac Security Based Solely on History ?
We Mac users have it pretty good .
We face only the smallest fraction of the security risk endured by our Windows brethren .
But just because we live in a nicer neighborhood does n’t mean we are immune to risks .
For many years Mac OS X did have an inherent security advantage over Windows , but to those who understand the technologies within the operating systems , those days are long past .
The latest version of Windows ( Vista , not that most people use it ) is provably more secure in the lab than the latest version of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard .
Leopard lacks proper implementation of the new anti-exploitation technologies included in Vista , and , based on the number of Apple security patches , experiences about as many vulnerabilities .
When I see articles that defend Mac OS X based on the lack of Mac - specific malicious software , and not on current technical capabilities , cybercrime dynamics , or attack methods , I tend to be dubious .
Mac OS X’s Unix core was a powerful security defense for many years , especially the requirement to enter a password before installing most kinds of software , but modern attack methods are able to circumvent that protection .
On the upside , Apple started adding some of these technologies to Mac OS X in Leopard ( albeit incompletely ) , and if they finish the implementation , and continue to add new security features , the odds are we will never face the same security risks as Windows users .
You Can Do It —
The need for computer security long ago passed from a minor annoyance to something that could affect our personal and financial safety .
Just as disasters , crime , and tales of tragedy tend to dominate the news , stories of information security failures never fail to grab the headlines .
When it ’s a story with the potential to smear a media darling like Apple , you can bet the article will be right up there next to the latest celebrity embarrassment .
But with a little consideration of these five tips , you can evaluate the reality level of any given security story .
MY cat Coco died recently .
Actually we euthanized him to alleviate his suffering from cancer .
And while this was a sad moment , it was made less sad because Coco ’s death also alleviated ever so slightly the suffering of the sea .
Coco , like most American cats , ate fish .
And a great deal of them  more in a year than the average African human , according to Jason Clay at the World Wildlife Fund .
And unlike the chicken or beef Coco also gobbled up , all those fish were wild animals , scooped out of the sea and flown thousands of carbon - belching miles to reach his little blue bowl .
The use of wild fish in animal feed is a serious problem for the world ’s food systems .
Around a third of all wild fish caught are “ reduced ” into fish meal and fish oil .
And yet most of the outrage about this is focused not on land - based animals like Coco but on other fish  namely farm - raised fish .
This is understandable .
Ever since the Stanford economist Rosamond Naylor concluded in a 2000 paper in the journal Nature that it took three pounds of wild fish to provide enough food to grow one pound of farmed salmon , environmentalists have been apoplectic .
They argue that the removal of wild “ forage ” fish threatens to starve whales , seals and other predators ; that anchovies , mackerel and other “ pelagic forage fish ” should be used to feed humans ; and that feed made from wild fish can give farm - raised fish higher levels of contaminants .
As a result of all these issues , ocean preservationists have focused their ire on salmon farming .
But in doing so they diverted attention from another problem of equal importance : the role played by those land - based creatures that also put their muzzles in the fish meal trough .
KENNEDY SPACE CENTER , Florida ( CNN ) --
A bat that apparently had trouble flying instead tried to hitch a ride on the space shuttle Discovery , NASA officials said .
The free tail bat was last seen clinging to the space shuttle Discovery 's external fuel tank just before launch .
The animal was last seen clinging on the foam of the external tank of the space shuttle moments before the Discovery launched , officials said .
NASA officials had hoped the bat would fly away on its own , but admitted the bat probably died quickly during Discovery 's climb into orbit .
Discovery 's seven - member crew , which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Sunday , is on a 14 - day mission to deliver supplies needed to expand the International Space Station .
NASA officials noticed the bat before shuttle 's liftoff and brought in a wildlife expert to look at video images of it .
The expert said it appeared to be a free - tailed bat that probably had a broken left wing and an injured right shoulder or wrist .
The launch pads at the space center are near the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge , so NASA has sirens to scare away animals that get near the shuttles .
Do n't Miss Discovery docks at international space station
The bat is n't the first to try hitching a ride into space .
NASA officials said they noticed one of the creatures on a tank of a shuttle in 1998 .
That bat flew away as the shuttle 's massive engines ignited .
The crew of the Discovery safely docked at the International Space Station on Tuesday .
It was unclear whether its stowaway was still clinging to the shuttle .

So , Spotify has been made available for free to anyone in the UK !
This is great news for anyone who is a fan of streaming free music online without feeling guilty about piracy etc etc .
According to a Forrester report :
By 2013 digital music spending will account for the majority ( 57 percent ) of the recorded music market , with digital licensing generating an additional € 1.2 billion
You could argue that with Spotify now in the room providing free streaming , this figure should be downgraded .
There was an issue last week where Spotify were re-cataloguing their music , which meant many users found some of their tracks went AWOL .
However , since then , they ’ve signed CD Baby to add songs from their catalogue , as well as introducing a further 1600 LPs .
This is a positive step that will hopefully start to show any doubters ( are there any ? ! ) that Spotify is going to expand the amount of music available by huge amounts .
Everybody loves Spotify .
There are lists of why it ’s great and glowing reviews everywhere .
Spotify could almost be falling prone Obamaism – that is by being so good , it almost sets itself up for a fall .
Spotify needs to make sure that by opening up the service it maintains its current high speed as this is arguably the main thing that would turn users away .
If the service becomes so over - used that it becomes prone to crashes and there are dribblings of a fail whale , this would be disastrous .
That is of course the reason that it ’s taken so long to come out of private beta , at least here in the UK .
The craving for free music is such that it would be of little surprise if the internet melted should Spotify all of a sudden be free to everyone .
So what is the next move for our favourite new music service ?
Money – Spotify needs to build a bigger revenue generation platform so that they can keep offering music for free ( with ads ) to users who do n’t want to sign up to the premium service .
Music –
They need to keep expanding the amount of artists who are involved – getting hold of an Oasis track is n’t possible yet for example .
Mobile –
If the service can be made available on mobiles , iPhone users would love it i’m sure , it would reach a whole new audience .
Simplicity –
The user interface is easy to use which means it is more accessible to the technologically uninclined – keep it basic , keep it clean !
Customisation –
The grey is a bit flat , it would be pleasant to implement a Tweetdeck style colour changing system to allow a bit of personalisation , but , bearing in mind the last point , not too much .
What would you like to see from Spotify as it becomes more widely available ?
If you do n't want some anger to go with your corn flakes this morning , look away now .
A new bill has been proposed by congressman Joe Baca which would require a health warning on videogames , telling consumers that gaming could lead to aggressive behavior , despite the fact that research on the subject is utterly non-conclusive .
The democratic Senator introduced the " Video Game Health Labeling Act of 2009 " last week , declaring that the games industry has failed to act enough like a surrogate parent to kids .
Apparently putting pseudo - truths and blatant scaremongering on the covers of games would make everything better and there 'd be no more violence EVER ... apart from State approved violence , of course .
Game packages would come with the following message if this bill passes : " WARNING : Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behavior . "
Baca puts the blame solely on the videogame industry , not on the parents who let their kids play violent games .
" The videogame industry has a responsibility to parents , families and to consumers – to inform them of the potentially damaging content that is often found in their products .
" They have repeatedly failed to live up to this responsibility .
Meanwhile research continues to show a proven link between playing violent games and increased aggression in young people .
American families deserve to know the truth about these potentially dangerous products . "
Apparently the very obvious ESRB labels are n't good enough .
The Senator believes that the industry " must be held accountable " for the rare instances of violent behavior that games have had tenuous - at - best links to in the past .
America is the most powerful nation in the world , and there are people in charge of it who are panicking over videogames .
This has gone beyond pathetic and into the realm of the farcical .
Somewhat scary , but here ’s the graph of kilobytes of text per day flowing through the #haskell IRC channel ( 90 day moving average ) , since the inception of the channel .
Yes , it is getting louder , and 1 / 2 a meg of text a day is pretty amazing .
That ’s a lot of Haskell chatter .
The challenge for the community now is to ensure it remains effective .

It ’s been long enough since Turbinado V0.4 that I figured I ’d skip V0.5 and go straight to announcing Turbinado V0.6 .
Lots of new excellent features :
By popular demand , support for CGI serving .
Apparently some web hosts do n’t support HTTP proxying , so some folks requested CGI support .
Statically compiled Layouts , Views , Controllers .
Support for “ . format ” in routes .
If a request path is “ / User / List.xml ” , then the following View will be called : / App / Views / User / List Xml .hs .
.hs. Lower case paths .
Support for cookies ( see here for examples ) .
Encrypted cookie sessions ( see here to see how to use them ) .
Much easier installs using cabal - install .
Support for GHC 6.10 .
GHC 6.8 is no longer supported .
Turbinado V0.7 will be all about :
Documentation . ( seriously . )
User authentication .
Tutorials .
Installation
Installation is pretty painless if you use cabal - install , so make sure that you have cabal - install installed first .
See here : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall.
To install Turbinado :
git clone git@github.com :alsonkemp/turbinado-website.git cd turbinado - website cabal install [ This might fail , saying that " trhsx " can't be found .
However , " trhsx " was built during the install and is probably at ~/.cabal / bin/ trhsx , so copy " trhsx " to your path and re-run " cabal install " . ]
CGI Configuration
[ Note : you do n’t want to use CGI without statically compiling in some Controllers , Layouts and Views .
See below . ]
Usually , Turbinado is called with “ - p ” to specify the port the process should listen on ( e.g. “ turbinado -p 8080 ” ) .
When called with the “ - c ” flag , Turbinado will handle CGI requests .
However , because of the process setup and tear down times , responding to CGI requests takes about 250 ms , which is considerably slower than responding to HTTP requests ( about 1ms ) .
Again following Rails , Turbinado includes a CGI script called “ dispatch.cgi ” in the /static directory .
Apache Configuration
In order to use Turbinado ’s CGI functionality with Apache , you ’ll need to something like the following in order to tell Apache to allow CGI scripts in your Turbinado / static directory and to send all requests ( e.g. “ ^ (.\* ) $ ” ) to the “ dispatch.cgi ” script .
DocumentRoot /home/ alson/turbinado - website / static < Directory " /home/alson/turbinado-website/static " >
Options + FollowSymLinks + ExecCGI + Includes AddHandler cgi-script .cgi AllowOverride None Order allow , deny Allow from all </ Directory > RewriteRule ^(.*) $ %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/dispatch.cgi [ QSA,L ]
Static Compilation Of Resources
Turbinado is designed to dynamically compile and link in the various resources ( Controllers , Layouts , Views ) needed to serve a request .
However , it can take up to 15 seconds to complete that process the first time a particular page is requested ( subsequent requests are very fast ) .
With CGI , the server only ever sees the first request , so Turbinado would never be able to serve a CGI request faster than 10 - 20 seconds .
To fix this , you can now compile into the server particular resources .
See Config / Routes.hs here .
Turbinado stores a function along with the file path and function name in a tuple , so you just give Turbinado that information in the Routes .hs file and it ’ll load those functions into the CodeStore at startup :
staticLayouts = [ ( " App/ Layouts / Default.hs " , " markup " , App.Layouts.Default.markup ) ]
Support for “ formats ”
Rails has great support for file formats .
Turbinado is trying to follow that lead .
The system will try to figure out the MIME type based on the extension .
According to the standard routes ( Config / Routes.hs ) , the following path= >
View mappings will occur :
/ abba/ding => /App/Views/Abba/Ding.hs /abba/ding.xml => /App/Views/Abba/DingXml.hs /bloof/snort/1.csv => /App/Views/Bloof/SnortCsv.hs
The same Controller handles all formats ; only the View will change .
Also , usage of a format causes a blank Layout to be used ( on the assumption that you do n’t want a Layout used with a CSV , XML , etc output ) .
Lower case paths
Turbinado now defaults to using lower case paths ( configured in Config / App.hs ) , so the following paths get mapped to Controllers and Views as follows :
/abba/ding_fling => /App/Controllers /Abba.hs : dingFling => /App/Views/Abba/DingFling.hs
Cookies
Cookies are now supported .
Examples here .
setCookie $ mkCookie " counter " ( show 0 ) v <- getCookieValue " counter " deleteCookie " counter "
Cookie Sessions
Session data is encrypted and stuffed into a cookie .
The encryption key is set in Config / App.hs .
Session usage examples are here .
setSessionValue " counter " " 0 " v <- setSessionValue " counter " deleteSessionKey " counter " abandonSession
Economic stimulus should have boosted demand , Mr Miles said
There are signs the economy may already have started a recovery , according to an economist who is set to join the Bank of England 's rate - setting body .
" The worst of the recession may well be behind us , " David Miles , Morgan Stanley 's chief UK economist , told the Western Mail newspaper .
" I 'm less pessimistic than many of where the economy may be going , "
Tax cuts and lower interest rates , along with other initiatives , should by now have helped boost demand , he said .
Mr Miles is due to join the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee in June .
" Economic history teaches us that a combination of tax cuts , running large fiscal deficits , substantial cuts in interests rates and more quantitative easing is likely , with a certain time lag , to have a substantial impact on demand in the economy , " Mr Miles told the paper .
" That 's not a confident prediction but a judgment about what may be the case . "
Feingold supports ' truth commission ' with reservations Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday March 4 , 2009
Print This Email This
As the Senate Judiciary Committee debated on Wednesday whether to establish an independent " truth commission " to investigate Bush - era war crimes and other abuses of power , committee member Sen.
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) issued a statement expressing strong support for the idea , but with certain reservations .
" I think a truth commission is the best way to get the comprehensive story out to the American people and the world , " Feingold stated .
" A crucial part of restoring the rule of law ... is a detailed accounting of exactly what happened in the last eight years and how the outgoing administration came to reject or ignore so many of the principles on which this nation was founded . "
However , Feingold also warned against taking any action that could interfere with prosecutions of high - level officials once a commission has determined the basic facts .
" On the question of immunity , I think we should tread carefully , " he cautioned .
" There are cases that may require prosecution , and I would n't want a commission of inquiry to preclude that .
Those who clearly violated the law and can be prosecuted should be prosecuted . "
" While a commission of inquiry is the best way to get the facts out , " Feingold concluded , " Congress , the Justice Department , and the public should decide what to do with those facts . "
In suggesting that a truth commission should be considered only the first step , Feingold appeared to be leaning towards critics who have complained that the effect of such a commission might be to bury Bush administration crimes rather than confronting them squarely .
The idea of a " truth and reconciliation commission , " modeled on those employed in South Africa following the apartheid era , was proposed last month by Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) as a " middle ground " between those who seek criminal prosecutions and those who want no investigations at all of Bush - era crimes .
" People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge and experiences , not for purposes of constructing criminal indictments , but to assemble the facts , " Leahy suggested at that time .
President Obama appeared cool to the idea but it has since gained momentum , despite being assailed by critics on the left , such as Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley .
" There 's no question that torture occurred here , " Turley told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann immediately following Leahy 's proposal .
" There 's no question that it was a war crime .
And so the only reason to have a commission of this kind is to avoid doing what we 're obligated to do under a treaty . "
It now remains to be seen whether Feingold 's hope of tying a truth commission to prosecutions down the road will prevail , or if Turley 's forebodings will be proved correct .

The Prime Minister in particular has been brazen in threatening Sir Fred with court action to retrieve a pension package that was signed off by the City minister , Lord Myners .
This is grandstanding of the cheapest kind .
Sir Fred 's deal is obscene , but that does not make it illegal .
Mr Brown understands this , but is desperate for the searchlight of public opprobrium to be shifted away from the unfolding debacle in Downing Street .
Ironic , is n't it , that having destroyed Britain 's private pension system with a tax raid which , grossed up over 12 years , has snatched about £ 100 billion from personal savings schemes , the Prime Minister is now keen to preach on pensions and justice .
Two army personnel were shot dead during a drive - by shooting at an army base in Co Antrim last night , raising fears that the grim spectre of terrorism has returned to haunt Northern Ireland .
Two more military personnel were wounded along with two civilians in what is believed to be the first major terrorist attack in the province for over a decade .
All four are said to be in a " serious " condition .
The shootings occurred at the Massereene Army base in Antrim , 16 miles north of Belfast , at 21.40 last night .
It is understood that a car or van pulled up outside the main gates .
Soldiers and security staff thought pizzas were being delivered and walked straight into an ambush .
Witnesses described hearing two long bursts of gunfire .
At least six ambulances and three paramedic vehicles were dispatched to the scene and a total of six people were taken to Antrim hospital .
The area around the barracks was sealed off and a major security operation was last night under way .
The attack is the first major incident believed to involve dissident republican terrorism since the Omagh bomb in August 1998 .
It would also be the first time members of the security forces have been killed by a Republican terrorist organisations since July 1997 when the Provisional IRA killed two members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Lurgan , Co Armagh .
If the killings are confirmed as the work of dissident terrorists , they represents a return to the campaign of assassination of soldiers and police officers that was meant to have ended when the IRA declared its final ceasefire in mid-July 1997 .
The killings come just 48 hours after Northern Ireland 's chief constable , Sir Hugh Orde , warned that the dissident terrorist threat was at its highest level since he took over seven years ago .
Observers fear it could signal an upsurge in the campaign by splinter IRA groups to destabilise the political settlement that has Sinn Féin sharing power with its Unionist enemies .
Orde also confirmed that undercover British army troops were on paramilitary surveillance duties in Northern Ireland .
Nobody has yet claimed responsibility for the attack but security sources said the incident was undoubtedly the work of dissident organisations opposed to the peace settlement .
Orde 's warning was prompted by intelligence reports that two republican splinter groups , the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA had recruited experienced , seasoned , ex-Provisional IRA veterans to its ranks recently .
Northern Ireland 's first minister and the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party , Peter Robinson , said he was postponing a trip to the United States as a result of the shootings .
He said they were a " terrible reminder of the events of the past " .
Secretary of state for Northern Ireland Shaun Woodward condemned the attack as an " act of criminal barbarism " .
He said : " My thoughts are with the families of those killed and injured in this murderous attack .
The prime minister is being kept closely informed .
The contrast between those who serve the community and those who would destroy it could not be clearer . "
Ian Paisley Jr , a DUP member for the Northern Ireland assembly , said the shooting could be a defining moment in the history of Northern Ireland .
" For the last 10 years people believed things like this happened in foreign countries , places like Basra .
Unfortunately , it has returned to our doorstep . "
Kylie McLaughlin , who lives near the scene , said the shots sounded like machine - gun fire .
" It was very scary .
We were not sure what was happening . "
Downing Street added in a statement : " This is a terrible incident that we utterly condemn and the prime minister 's thoughts , first and foremost , are with the families of those killed and with those seriously injured in this attack .
" In recent days action has been taken to increase security in Northern Ireland .
This is because of the increased threat from those who , even at this late stage , wish to ignore the wishes of the overwhelming majority … and attempt to derail the peace process . "
Dambisa Moyo , an African economist , has joined her voice to the other African economists [ e.g. James Shikwati ] calling for a full halt to Western aid .
Her book is called Dead Aid and it asserts a direct cause - and - effect relationship between $ 1 trillion of aid and the rise in African poverty rates from 11 % to 66 % .
Though it 's an easy enough signal to fake , I find it noteworthy that Moyo – in this interview at least – repeatedly pleads for some attention to " logic and evidence " :
" I think the whole aid model is couched in pity .
I do n’t want to cast aspersions as to where that pity comes from .
But I do think it ’s based on pity because based on logic and evidence , it is very clear that aid does not work .
And yet if you speak to some of the biggest supporters of aid , whether they are academics or policy makers or celebrities , their whole rationale for giving more aid to Africa is not couched in logic or evidence ; it ’s based largely on emotion and pity . "
I was just trying to think of when was the last time I heard a Western politician – or even a mainstream Western economist in any public venue – draw an outright battle line between logic and pity .
Oh , there are plenty of demagogues who claim the evidence is on their side , but they wo n't be so outright condemning of emotion – it's not a winning tactic .
Even I avoid drawing a battle line so stark .
Moyo says she 's gotten a better reception in Africa than in the West .
Maybe you need to see your whole continent wrecked by emotion and pity before " logic and evidence " start to sound appealing .

‘ The city has a lot of practice at cleaning up after these sorts of events , ” Mr. Tangherlini said .
He said it would take at least a month to disassemble the two reviewing stands at the White House where President Obama and members of the news media had watched the parade .
One stand is four stories tall , with a balcony .
Hosting the inauguration cost the city $ 47 million , according to city officials who have already received $ 15 million from Congress and promises for the rest later .
Early estimates of the crowd ranged as high as two million , while the National Park Service and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty put the figure at 1.8 million .
City officials said the number could be higher if the people standing on the Mall , along the parade route and farther into the surrounding neighborhoods were counted .
Satellite images of the swearing - in ceremony suggested , however , that the actual size of the throng might have been smaller , according to experts who reviewed the images .
Nonetheless , most agreed it was probably the largest crowd ever at an inauguration .
The National Park Service has not given official estimates of crowds in more than a decade , complying with a Congressional order to stop doing so after a controversy over how many people attended the Million Man March in 1995 .
Estimates then varied from 400,000 to more than a million .
But David Barna , a Park Service spokesman , said the agency was making an exception this year because of the historic nature of the inauguration and the public demand for a crowd estimate .
Subway officials said ridership set a record Tuesday , with 973,285 trips by 7 p.m .
The figure broke the record of 866,681 , which was set Monday on Martin Luther King ’s Birthday .
April 9 , 2009  --
Over the last 30 years , a Nashville , Tenn. , teacher invited teenagers over to his house , gave them drugs and alcohol and secretly recorded them having sex , according to local police and federal prosecutors .
Louis J. Levine , 52 , who taught in several Nashville - area schools and had worked at youth camps and a local science museum , was arrested Tuesday on child pornography charges and allegedly admitted to at least one incident of recording a teen performing a sex act .
Police and federal prosecutors say they continue to investigate Levine , who allegedly invited students over to drink and do drugs and then allowed them to use a small building behind his house known as the " Little House " to have sex , which he secretly recorded .
Levine also recorded sexual activity in a room inside the house called the " Isolation Chamber , " which contained a water bed covered with a wooden box , according to a statement released by Nashville police .
Levine was charged in federal court with producing child pornography .
He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
He is scheduled to have a preliminary hearing Friday morning .
Police say they also expect to file state charges against Levine .
Levine has not entered a formal plea and has been held in police custody since his arrest .
" He has n't been indicted , much less convicted , and our office looks forward to defending him against these charges , " said Levine 's defense lawyer , Hugh Mundy , who added he will ask a judge to release Levine on bail at Friday 's hearing .
" All we have are accusations right now . "
Nashville police refused to comment on the charges or the investigation outside of the press release .
Allegedly Admits Secretly Recording Teen Sex
On some occasions , Levine allegedly gave the teens drugs , including marijuana and ecstasy , according to a criminal complaint filed in the case .
The alleged incidents are believed to have occurred over a period of three decades , and several adults who were teenagers during the 1970s and ' 80s told police similar stories of drugs and sex at Levine 's home , according to the police .
When confronted by detectives , Levine allegedly admitted to secretly taping a boy masturbating and then climbing into bed with the boy .
" Society looks at this differently than I do , " Levine allegedly said , according to the complaint .
Police say that when they searched Levine 's house , they found more than 400 homemade tapes .
According to an affidavit from a Nashville police detective , a tape found in Levine 's camcorder had footage of people who appeared to be teenagers engaged in sex acts .
Teacher Allegedly Gave Teens Drugs , Recorded Them Having Sex
Nashville Police began investigating Levine March 25 after receiving a call from a parent of one of the alleged victims .
Levine was most recently working full time in the Murfreesboro School System , where he taught science .
The school system placed Levine on administrative leave April 1 , when administrators learned of the investigation , and have moved to fire him .
The director of schools did not return a call for comment .
Levine also worked as a substitute teacher for Metropolitan Nashville Schools since 2002 .
He worked two full days and a half day during the most recent school year and has been removed from the substitute teachers list , a school spokeswoman said .

Early last month , Kyrgyzstan 's president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , went cap in hand to Moscow to ask for financial aid .
To make his request more palatable , Bakiyev announced that he was demanding that the US close its airbase in Kyrgyzstan , which re-supplies Nato troops in neighbouring Afghanistan .
Similarly , late last year , Iceland 's government asked Russia to help bail out its banking system , while the Pakistani president , Asif Ali Zardari , visited China in the hope of securing an emergency infusion of cash .
Some observers cite these episodes as evidence of decline in America 's international clout .
But there 's a larger point : so far – except for relatively small sums offered to the Kyrgyz – Russia and China have n't offered much help .
Amid much talk of a " post - American world " , many observers see a shift from a US - dominated international order toward a multipolar system , in which countries like China , Russia , and several others compete for global leadership on a range of common challenges and risks .
More than five years ago , China 's president , Hu Jintao , proclaimed that " the trend toward a multipolar world is irreversible and dominant " .
When Vladimir Putin complained during a conference in Munich last year that US unilateralism stoked conflict around the world , an offended Senator John McCain responded that confrontation was unnecessary in " today 's multipolar world " .
When Putin welcomed the Venezuelan president , Hugo Chávez to Russia last September , he observed that " Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the chain of the multipolar world that is forming " .
Chávez agreed : " A multipolar world is becoming reality . "
All of them have it wrong .
US dominance is clearly on the wane , but a multipolar order implies that several emerging powers hold competing views about how the world should be run , and that they are prepared to act to advance their global agendas .
That is not the case .
Instead , we are witnessing the birth of a non-polar order , in which America 's chief competitors remain too busy with problems at home and in their immediate neighbourhoods to shoulder the heaviest international burdens .
Not one of the emerging powers has even begun to use its growing political and economic clout to advance truly global ambitions – or to take on responsibilities that Washington can no longer afford .
Start with Russia .
Despite its growing ties with Venezuela and efforts to co-ordinate energy policy with natural gas - rich countries in North Africa , the Kremlin has no aspirations to rebuild Soviet - scale influence in Latin America , Africa , or South - east Asia .
Nor does it have Soviet - style ideological appeal .
Instead , Russia 's leaders are busy protecting Russian markets , banks , and companies from the worst effects of the global financial crisis , consolidating state control over domestic economic sectors , and extending their foreign - policy leverage across former Soviet territory .
China 's need to satisfy its hunger for imported oil and other commodities has given it an international presence .
But its influence is more commercial than political .
China 's leaders must devote their attention to a staggering array of pressing problems at home : averting an economic slowdown that could push millions out of work and into the streets , the fallout from rural land reform , and efforts to manage enormous environmental and public health problems .
India must hold its own in China 's lengthening shadow .
Facing elections next year , the ruling Congress party is spending the government 's time and money on subsidies for consumers , wage hikes for state employees , and debt relief for farmers .
Brazil is similarly preoccupied , appearing to have no grander near - term aspirations than to promote stability in Latin America , manage the effects of the global financial crisis , and inspire others in the developing world .
In short , there is a vacuum of global leadership just at the moment when it is most badly needed .
Barack Obama 's attention is now concentrated on stimulating the anaemic US economy , crafting tax cuts , reforming energy and health - care policies , and restoring confidence in US financial institutions .
The European Union continues its internal debate over how best to bail out its failing banks and industries , handle the fallout from EU and euro - zone expansion , and manage increasingly rocky relations with Russia .
Who , then , can take the lead on efforts to create a new global financial architecture that reflects the complexities of 21st - century commerce ?
Who can drive consensus on a multilateral response to climate change ?
Who will replace an obsolete non-proliferation regime , provide collective security in emerging international hotspots , and build momentum behind Middle East peace talks ?
The international summit meeting in Washington in November 2008 underlined the problem .
The world 's richest countries ( the G7 ) turned to the emerging powers within the G20 to help coordinate a response to the global financial slowdown .
Difficult as it is for seven countries to agree on anything , imagine the challenge of building consensus among 20 .
Consider the competing views within this group on democracy , transparency , the proper economic role of government , new rules of the road for financial markets and trade , and how best to ensure that the United Nations , International Monetary Fund , and the World Bank fairly reflect today 's global balance of power .
For the next several years , when those in crisis turn to the US for help , they are increasingly likely to hear the word " no " .
And it is not at all clear that anyone else is willing and able to say yes .

Conficker Worm Strike Reports Start Rolling In
Editor 's Note :
The following was written in the spirit of April Fool 's Day .
Brian is following the story and if there are real reports of outbreak , he 'll report them in a separate post .
Reports are trickling in about the impact from the Conficker worm , as infected systems passed zero hour at midnight and began downloading additional malicious components .
Here 's a quick roundup of some of the more notable incidents caused by Conficker so far , according to published reports :
- A nuclear missile installation near Elmendorf Air force Base outside of Anchorage , Alaska briefly went on a full - scale military alert after technicians manning the bunker suspected that several of their control systems were infected with Conficker .
According to wire reports , the remote facility temporarily moved to Defense Condition ( Defcon ) 3 in the pre-dawn hours , but quickly backed down from that posture .
An airman at the installation who asked not to be identified blamed the mishap on " way too much caffeine " consumed by occupants inside the secluded underground control room .
The airman said the facility 's lead engineer became agitated and inconsolable after watching an Internet broadcast of Sunday night 's hard - hitting 60 Minutes expose ' on the Conficker worm entitled , " The Internet is Infected . "
- In Iceland , Conficker brought a brief thaw to the long economic winter that began last year with the government 's inexorable slide into bankruptcy .
According to local news reports , shortly after midnight local time , an ATM in the capital city of Reykjavik began spewing 100 - Krona notes .
Banking officials there reportedly said the Microsoft Windows - based based bank system began disbursing the bills after a local prankster crammed an infected USB stick into the maw of the teller machine .
- Londoners woke up to find the iconic clock tower Big Ben stopped at precisely one minute till midnight .
The British tabloids blared that the giant timepiece had been felled by the Conficker worm .
But security officials reasoned that the beloved landmark -- legendary for its reliability -- would have stopped exactly one minute later had the expected 12:00 a.m. updates to Conficker actually been the culprit .
Several members of Parliament are now calling for a full investigation into the incident .
- In Waukesha , Wis. , Leroy " Mac " MacElrie , 64 , turned himself in to local police , claiming he was the author of the original Conficker worm , and that all of the subsequent versions were mere copycats .
According to charging documents , MacElrie said he wrote the worm to get back at Microsoft founder Bill Gates for " not stopping spam by 2008 like he said he would . "
The man was released on his own recognizance , but several hours later a local television station captured footage of the man standing on a nearby street corner repeatedly shouting " I'm the confickter ! "
Read on after the jump for more Conficker madness .

The flow of Polish and other economic migrants from eastern Europe has fallen by more than 40 % as the recession in Britain bites , according to the latest immigration figures published today .
The Office for National Statistics said the number of work applications from the EU 's former communist countries dropped to 29,000 in the last three months of 2008 , down from 53,000 in the same period in 2007 .
The immigration minister , Phil Woolas , said this was the lowest level of registrations since Poland and nine other European countries , including Malta and Cyprus , joined the EU in 2004 .
Research suggested that many of those that came have now gone home .
ONS figures published today show that the majority of workers from eastern Europe are young – 78 % are aged 18 to 34 – and only 11 % said they had brought dependants with them to work in Britain .
The home secretary , Jacqui Smith , announced at the weekend new measures to block tens of thousands of foreign workers from outside the EU coming to work in Britain .
But the new immigration figures show the government is failing to meet its targets on removing failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders .
Removals of those who were turned down for asylum for the last quarter of 2008 are down by 16 % compared to the previous year , to 2,570 .
The number of other immigration offenders deported rose slightly over the same period , to 13,950 .
Woolas highlighted the fact that 5,395 foreign prisoners were sent home in 2008 , exceeding the UK Border Agency 's 5,000 target .
The resources devoted to this task were switched from pursuing failed asylum seekers .
Although ministers claimed success , the ONS said the 5,395 figure should be treated only as provisional as it had not yet passed their quality tests .
The asylum figures for the last three months of 2008 show the first fall for five years in the number of new claims for refugee status – with a 2 % drop to 6,735 .
The largest numbers came from Afghanistan , Zimbabwe and Eritrea .
Last year , 30 % of asylum applicants were granted refugee status or humanitarian protection .
A further 25 % of appeals also succeeded .
The UK Border Agency said it had passed a key milestone in concluding 60 % of all new asylum claims within six months by the end of 2008 .
The number of people from outside the EU granted the right to settle in Britain rose by 17 % last year to 145,965 .
Just over 60,000 were the result of people moving to the UK for work , while 52,000 were as a result of family reunion cases .
Only 3,860 refugees were granted the right to settle in Britain , down from 67,000 in 2005 .

Advertisement Forget flashmob - this was more Morphmob .
Outside London 's Tate Modern , about 200 devotees gathered to pay tribute to their doyen of DIY art - Tony Hart .
The children 's television presenter and art enthusiast passed away earlier this year aged 83 .
On Sunday some of his legions of fans decided to build a terracotta army of little orange men in his memory .
Scores of Morphs and his minions thronged a corner of the capital 's South Bank .
Their creators had fashioned them as a way of saying " thank you " .
Speak to any of them and they would tell you Hart inspired them to get out there and create .
Adelaide Lane helped organise the event over social networking sites and she was delighted by the response .
Asked about Hart 's legacy , she said : " You do n't have to have expensive felt tips or paper .
" Just find whatever you can and make a piece of art .
Just do n't be scared .
Just do it . "
Tony Hart appeared on the shows Vision On and Take Hart
It was a sentiment echoed in the many weird and wonderful versions of Morph on display .
Some wore top hats , others bikinis .
One shed a single blue tear as the little orange effigy waved goodbye to his on - screen friend and partner .
His owner told me that as a child she would not have missed Hart 's programme for the world .
Best in Show
Over the course of his 50 - year television career , Hart won two Baftas and a lifetime achievement award .
His infectious enthusiasm and avuncular style won him generation after generation of fans .
On Sunday , surrounded by a plethora of plasticine , his daughter , Carolyn Williams , joined in the fun .
She was invited to judge Best Morph in Show and was touched by the effort so many had gone to .
The army of Morphs came in a variety of guises " It 's absolutely fantastic , so many colours , so many styles , " she said .
" Morph as you 've never seen him before . "
And what of the use of the internet to create the flashmob ?
She thought her father would approve : " This is exactly what he was all about .
" Getting people together to join in and make a picture , to make something .
It 's so great . "
And with that she announced the winner - a six - inch high Morph clasping a bunch of pink carnations .
His creator Laura Kerry , an arts manager from Walthamstow , London , said : " I only spent four hours making him .
I heard about it and I was just really moved and felt we had to be part of it . "
Just one person among so many touched by Tony Hart 's love of art - let alone little orange people .

One of the first big splashes this blog made was when this post ( 2002 ! ) made it into the atheist blogosphere .
I got about a hundred notes from atheists saying “ Thanks . ”
I ’ve always agreed with what I wrote here , and I ’ve always felt it was important .
I also know that many culture - warring Christians will say this is a surrender document and I should join in the hatred of those who sometimes hate us .
Check with Jesus on that one .
Here ’s “ Why Do They Hate Us ? ” from this blog , 2002 version .
I do n’t really know why someone thought it was necessary to do a poll to see just who were the most disliked groups in society , but the results are in .
While serial killers and IRS agents still come in last , hot on their heels are evangelical Christians .
Not Christians in general .
Not Roman Catholics .
Not all Christians , but evangelical Christians .
If you ’re like me , you have three reactions to this news .
First , you tend to blame the media .
Almost every portrayal of an evangelical Christian on television or in movies makes us look like the worst version of every stereotype we fear .
Of course , one cannot expect the mainstream media to take up the cause of rescuing the evangelical public image , and these days virtually every group has a list of complaints with various kinds of media portrayals .
There is more to the public perception of Bible believers than a media vendetta .
The second reaction is what we tend to say to one another to reassure ourselves that we are really OK after all .
“ It ’s the Gospel , ” we say to one another .
Evangelicals are identified with a message that no one wants to hear , and so they are disliked .
If you do n’t believe it , watch what happens when an evangelical leader appears on a talk show .
It ’s like raw meat to hungry lions , no matter if the evangelical in question is rude or wonderful .
( I have seen some of the nicest evangelicals torn limb from limb in these settings including liberals who gave away the store . )
I would never argue with the basic premise of this observation .
I have seen its truth too many times .
They crucified Jesus .
Enough said .
But as true as this is , it is too simplistic to explain the increasing level of general despising of evangelicals in our society .
It explains one thing , but it does not explain many other things .
It actually may tend to blind us to our own behaviors .
Like the residents of Jerusalem who were convinced their city could not fall because the temple was there , evangelicals may explain this dislike as reaction to the Gospel and then be blind to those things - in addition to the Gospel - that create legitimate animosity .
The third reaction is the guilty knowledge that evangelicals really are , very often , easy to dislike for many obvious reasons .
Many evangelicals know exactly what the survey is registering , because they feel the same way themselves .
We ’ve all observed , in others and in ourselves , distinctively evangelical vices , hypocrisies and failures .
We hoped that our good points would make up for these problems , but that was another self - deception .
It is easy to say that people ’s dislike of Christians is the dislike of the Christian message , but that simply does n’t hold up in the real world .
It may be true of the Christian you do n’t know , but the Christians you do know have it in their power to either make it easy or difficult for you to dislike them .
For example , the Christian in your car pool may believe what others refuse to believe , but his life provides a powerful antidote to any prejudice against him .
Thousands of missionaries have been opposed for simply being Christians .
But hundreds of thousands have lived lives that adorned the Gospel with attractive , winsome and loving behavior .
A past president of our school was revered by Muslims during and after 6 years of Peace Corps service in Iran , years where he talked about the Gospel to Muslims every day and saw many trust Christ .
The fact that the Gospel has penetrated into many hostile environments is evidence of the power of the Holy Spirit , but it is also evidence that one way the Spirit works is by making Christians a display of the fruits of love , peace , patience , kindness , gentleness and self - control .
We are loathed , caricatured , avoided and disliked because we often deserve it .
There , I said it and I ’m glad I did .
Here ’s my list of why evangelicals are among the most disliked persons in America .
1. Christians endorse a high standard of conduct for others , and then largely excuse themselves from a serious pursuit of such a life .
Jesus is the most admired person in history , but evangelicals are far more likely to devise ways for Jesus to be like us than for us to be like Jesus .
If it has n’t struck you lately that you do the very thing you condemn others for doing , ( Romans 2:1 ) urge others to do what you do n’t do or excuse in yourself what you require in others , then you probably do n’t get this article at all .
Did it irritate you when your dad said “ Do as I say , not as I do . ” ?
Then you get the picture .
2. Evangelical Christian piety in America is mostly public .
Whether it ’s our entertainment - saturated “ worship ” services , our celebrity cults or our mad obsession with worldly success , we love for others to see what “ God is doing in our lives . ”
Of course , Jesus had plenty to say about this , and the essence of it is that when your piety is public , then there is almost certainly a lack of serious , life - transforming , private obedience and discipleship .
I have lately been strongly convicted by J.C. Ryle ’s little book , “ A Call To Prayer . ”
Ryle makes a devastating case for the obvious absence of the discipline of private prayer among Christians .
What would Ryle say today ?
Does our public manner grow out of a true inward experience of private prayer ?
You see what I am talking about .
If its public , we do it well .
If it ’s private discipleship , we probably do n’t do it at all .
3 . Many evangelicals relate to others with an obvious - or thinly disguised - hidden agenda .
In other words , those who work with us or go to school with is feel that we are always “ up to ” something .
You mean , they know we want to convert them ?
Apparently .
Ever been yelled at for saying “ I ’ll pray for you . ” ?
Maybe there was a reason .
You know that feeling you get when a telemarketer interrupts your dinner ?
I get that feeling sometime when my Pentecostal / Charismatic friends are trying to persuade me into their camp .
It ’s not that I do n’t know they are good , decent , law abiding people who like me .
I just want them to quit treating me as a target or a project and start treating me as a person who is free to be myself AND different from them .
This same feeling is prevalent among those who dislike evangelical Christians .
They are annoyed and sometimes angered that we are following some divine directive to get them to abandon their life choices and take up ours .
They want to be loved as they are , not for what they might become if our plan succeeds .
Evangelicals have done a lot of good work on how to present the Gospel , but much of that work has operated on initial premises that are irritating and offensive .
I have taken my share of evangelism courses , and there is a great blind spot on how to be an evangelist without being annoying and pushy .
We somehow think that the Holy Spirit takes care of that aspect of evangelism !
Thank God for men like Francis Schaefer and Jerome Barrs who have done much to model evangelism that majors of maintaining the utmost respect towards those we evangelize .
4 . We seem consumed with establishing that we are somehow “ better ” than other people , when the opposite is very often true .
Many evangelicals are bizarrely shallow and legalistic about minute matters .
We are frequently psychologically unsound , psychiatrically medicated , filled with bitterness and anger , tormented by conflicts and , frankly , unpleasant to have around .
I have an atheistic acquaintance who never misses an opportunity to post a news story about a morally compromised minister .
Is he just being mean ?
No ; he is pointing out the obvious mess that is the inner life and outward behavior of many evangelicals , truths we like to avoid or explain as “ attacks of the enemy . ”
Our families are broken , our marriages fail and our children are remarkably worldly and messed up .
Yet , we boldly tell the world that we have the answer for all their ills !
How many churches proclaim that a sojourn with them will fix that marriage and those kids ?
Do we really have the abundant life down at the church , ready to be dispensed in a five week class ?
We are not as healthy and happy as we portray ourselves .
The realities of broken marriages among the Christian celebrity set underlines the inability of evangelicals to face up to their own brokenness .
Was there some reason that Sandi Patti and Amy Grant were supposed to be immune from failed marriages ?
Why did their divorces make them pariahs in evangelicalism ?
The fact is that most evangelicals are in deep denial about what depravity and sinfulness really means .
The world may have similar denial problems , but I do n’t think they can approach us for the spiritual veneer .
The crowd at the local tavern may have issues , but they frequently beat Christians by miles in the realistic humanity department .
Maybe they should pity us , but the fact is that , as the situation becomes more obvious , they do n’t like us .
5 . We talk about God in ways that are too familiar and make people uncomfortable .
Evangelicals constantly talk about a “ personal relationship ” with God .
Many evangelicals talk as if God is talking to them and leading them by the hand through life in a way only the initiated can understand .
Christian testimonies may give a God-honoring window into the realities of Christian experience , or it may sound like a psychological ploy to promote self importance .
Evangelicals have yet to come to grips with their tendency to make God into a commodity .
The world is far more savvy about how God is “ used ” to achieve personal or group ends than most evangelicals admit .
Evangelicals may deny that they have made God into a political , financial or cultural commodity , but the world knows better .
How does an unbeliever hear the use of Jesus to endorse automobiles , political positions or products ?
In my ministry , I have observed how difficult it is to evangelize Buddhists .
One of the reasons is that the Buddhist assumes that if you are serious about your religious experience , you will become a monk !
When he sees American Christians talking about a relationship with God , yet does not see a corresponding impact upon the whole of life , he assumes that this religion is simply an expression of culture or group values .
Now we may critique such a response as not understanding certain basic facts about the Gospel , but we also have to acknowledge the truth observed !
Rather than being people who are deeply changed , we are people who tend to use God to change others or our world to suit ourselves .
6. Evangelicals are too slow to separate themselves from what is wrong .
Because ours is a moral religion , and we frequently advertise our certainty in moral matters , it seems bizarrely hypocritical when that moral sense is applied so inconsistently .
I note that my evangelical friends are particularly resistant to this matter , but the current Trent Lott affair makes the point plainly .
Lott says that he now repudiates any allegiance to segregation or the symbols of segregation .
Suddenly , he sees the good sense in a number of things he has opposed .
But bizarrely , Lott stands behind his evangelical Christianity as the explanation for his sudden conversion .
Watching this spectacle , there are many reactions , but what interests me is how Lott ’s Christianity only seems to apply now that he is being dangled over political hell .
Where was all this moral sense in the 1960’s ?
Where was it ten years ago ?
Why does it appear that Lott is using his religion at his convenience ?
It ’s not my place to judge what is going on between Lott and his God , but his apparent pragmatism in these matters is familiar to many people observing evangelicals on a daily basis .
Most evangelicals are not the moral cutting edge of contemporary social issues .
Despite the evangelical conscience on issues like abortion , it is clear to many that we no longer have the cutting edge moral sense of a Martin Luther King , Jr. or a William Wilberforce .
Evangelicals are largely annoyed at people who tell them to do the right thing if it does n’t enhance their resume , their wallet , their family or their emotions .
What is odd about this is that many of those who dislike evangelicals have the idea that we want to impose our morality upon an entire culture .
Fear - mongering liberals often talk about the Bush administration as populated by fundamentalist Christian Taliban poised to bring about a Christian theocracy .
I wonder if they have noticed that President Bush - an evangelical right down to his boots - is practicing religious tolerance over the loud objections of evangelical leaders like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell ?
7 . We take ourselves far too seriously , and come off as opposed to normal life .
Is it such a bid deal that Christians are offended at so many things others consider funny ?
I ’ll admit , it is a small thing , but it is one of the reasons ordinary people do n’t like us .
I read an incident written by a preacher to an internet list I monitor .
He told about taking his youth group on an outing , when the students began singing a popular country song about a guy who leaves his wife to pursue his fishing hobby .
It ’s a hilarious song .
But this fellow ’s reaction was predictable .
He asked them to not a song about a marriage that breaks up , and to instead sing something that honored God .
I routinely hear students ridiculing a fellow teacher who labels much of what students find funny as “ of the devil . ”
These incidents show something that evangelicals need to admit .
We are frequently unable to see humor , absurdity , and the honest reasons for humans to laugh at themselves .
What very normal , very healthy people find laughable , we find threatening and often label with the ridiculous label of “ the devil . ”
The message here is n’t just that we are humorless or Puritanical .
The message is that being human or being real is somehow evil .
This is one place I can feel exactly what the unbelievers are talking about .
When I see Christians trying to rob young people of the right to be normal , ordinary and human , it angers me .
I feel threatened .
It ’s hard to like people who seem to say that God , Jesus and Scripture are the enemies of laughter , sex , growing up and ordinary pleasures .
Some Christians sometimes seem to say that everything pleasurable is demonic or to be avoided to show what a good Christian you are .
Is n’t it odd that unbelievers are so much more aware of the plain teaching of scripture than we are ?
I am sure there is much more to say , but I have ridden this horse far enough .
Certainly , unregenerate persons are at enmity with God by nature .
And , without a doubt , Christians represent a message that is far from welcome .
Christians doing the right thing risk being labeled enemies of society .
Much persecution is cruel and evil .
But that ’s not the point .
Christians are disliked for many reasons that have nothing to do with the Gospel , and everything to do with the kind of people we are in the relationships
God has given us .
The message of salvation wo n’t earn a standing ovation , but people who believe that message are not given a pass to rejoice when all men hate you …for any reason , including reasons that are totally our own fault .
No doubt someone will write me and say that , to the extent people like us , we have denied the Gospel .
Therefore , being despised and hated is proof that you are on the right track .
And there is a certain amount of truth to that observation in some situations that Christians may find themselves in .
But that is an explanation for how we are treated , not directions on how to make sure we are rejected and hated by most people for reasons having nothing to do with the message of the cross .
I hate to say it , but I ’ve learned that when a preacher tells me he was fired from his church for “ taking a stand for God , ” it usually means he was just a jerk .
The scriptures tell us that the early Christians were both persecuted and thought well of for their good lives and good works .
What was possible then is still possible now .
I ’ve seen it and I hope I see more of it …in my life .

You can discuss the article .
We wo n’t be debating atheism vs Christianity , nor will I allow either team to generally accuse the other of atrocity .
Heavy moderation ahead . )
Civil servants considered including DNA or iris biometrics as well as digital photographs in the ID card scheme and the police wanted carrying the cards to be compulsory , just released documents reveal .
The Office of Government Commerce has finally bowed to legal pressure from trade mag Computer Weekly and released the two Gateway reviews into the national ID scheme .
It has taken four years and numerous court hearings to get the two reviews , from 2003 and 2004 , released .
The review noted : " The Police felt that the absence of any obligation to carry or produce identity cards would substantially remove the administrative savings and some of the other advantages that Identity Cards would offer . "
The 2003 review said : " Biometrics .
Opinion seems divided on how effective or dependable biometrics will be .
There is little past experience , in the UK or elsewhere , to go on . "
There is no evidence of any technical consultation or other attempt to answer these questions .
The second review in 2004 also supported a second biometric on the card and was still looking for answers .
Overall the level of dialogue at the OGC seems perfectly suited to its logo , which regular readers may remember .
The circlejerk of senior civil servants seem absurdly divorced from reality - they show awareness of neither the technical problems of what they are discussing nor any understanding of , or interest in , public reaction to the scheme .
Support from the rest of the civil service also appears muted .
The 2003 review said : " We noted with some concern that the main potential beneficiaries of an Identity Cards scheme , such as police , DVLA , Passport Agency , IND , DWP , Inland Revenue and the financial sector , though generally supportive , were not quite as enthusiastic about the programme as might have been hoped . "
Apparently major problems with the project are breezily dismissed .
So the review mentions one of the programme risks : " Inadequate support and commitment ( we noted with some concern that the main potential beneficiaries of an Identity Cards scheme , such as police , DVLA , Passport Agency , IND , DWP , Inland Revenue and the financial sector , though generally supportive , were not quite as enthusiastic about the programme as might have been hoped . " [ sic ]
The second review again confidently claims : " The Identity Cards programme ’s potential for success is not in doubt .
As the SRO and Programme Director recognise , however , there is much work to be done before a robust business case can be established for a solution that meets the business need " .
The 2003 review is here and 2004 is here , both as pdfs , or have a look at SpyBlog .
Gateway reviews look at many major government IT projects at various points in order to ensure progress is being made .
They give traffic light judgement on projects - in 2003 the ID scheme was given a red light , and by 2004 it was on amber . ®
Mr. Obama and many lawmakers have expressed anger that banks that received the first batch of aid money do not appear to have increased their lending significantly , even as some firms have spent billions on bonuses , corporate jets and other perks .
In two weeks the House will hold a hearing to ask chief executives of the eight largest banks about their spending controls .
As early as this week , the Treasury Department may impose new limits on the executive pay of companies receiving financial assistance .
The Oversight Panel created by Congress to monitor the program is also expected to publish a report this week looking at whether the government paid too much to the large banks that they have provided with assistance .
A frequent refrain in Washington and on Wall Street is that there are no current market prices for toxic securities .
But people who buy and sell these investments say that is a simplistic reading of the problem .
They say most kinds of securities can be valued and are being traded , but trading has slowed as sellers and buyers disagree about what that the price should be .
The value of these securities is based on the future cash flow they provide to investors .
To determine that , traders have to make assumptions about the housing market and the economy :
How high will the unemployment rate go in the coming years ?
How many borrowers will default ?
What will homes be worth ?
The Standard & Poor ’s group , Market , Credit and Risk Strategies , which operates independently from the company ’s credit ratings business , has been studying troubled securities for investors and banks .
The bond that is trading at 38 cents provides a vivid illustration of the dilemma in valuing these assets .
The bond is backed by 9,000 second mortgages used by borrowers who put down little or no money to buy homes .
Nearly a quarter of the loans are delinquent , and losses on defaulted mortgages are averaging 40 percent .
The security once had a top rating , triple - A .
Michael G. Thompson , a managing director at the S.& P. group , says his computer models can easily calculate what the bond is worth under different situations .
“ This is not rocket science , this is straight bond math , ” he said .
But determining what the future holds is much harder .
“ We are not masters of the universe who can predict the macroeconomic environment , ” he added
Portable WiFi-enabled electronics are everywhere .
An iPod touch gives you your email , the Internet , and even ( with the latest generation ) voice - over - IP .
But you can only connect when you 're close enough to a WiFi hot - spot .
Take your iPod away from that coffee shop or office and you lose the Internet .
You still have a fabulous music player and gaming device , but not a whole lot more .
That may be why cellular gadgets are really starting to break into the mainstream .
But , as they do , they face a provider market that 's badly fragmented .
Carriers get exclusive access to some devices , charge different fees based on the device class , and will happily bill consumers for multiple plans for various specialized devices .
Will the carriers sort this out in a way that actually gives consumers what they 're looking for ?
With an iPhone instead of an iPod , you can roam wherever AT&T offers cellular coverage , although that will cost you at least $ 70 / month with a two year contract .
That 's a pretty hefty price to pay to keep in touch with e-mail and the rest .
AT&T , Sprint , T - Mobile , and other providers all offer a variety of data plans in the US aimed at casual data users , but few are bargains and there 's little to distinguish them from heavy - duty tethering plans .
Take AT&T 's current netbook plan , which offers data at $ 60 / month with a two year commitment .
Sure they 'll knock a couple of hundred dollars off the price of a netbook for you .
Even so , the $ 60 / month outlay for a device that 's not usually used for serious connectivity and computing seems high .
Especially since it 's nearly the same cost as , if not more than , basic tethering plans .
Plus if you exceed the 5G cap , AT&T will charge you hundreds of extra dollars per GB .
Until last Autumn , AT&T offered MEdiaNet Unlimited , providing data for $ 20 / month ( provided there was an initial purchase of $ 100 , which kept the account active for the initial year . )
AT&T cancelled the plan , explaining that the service was a trial exercise , but I suspect that MEdiaNet Unlimited was killed by its own success .
Many users dropped more profitable data plans and switched to it , lowering revenues and raising demand on the data infrastructure .
Kindle and Peek
Even as the carriers continue to push full - service , full - price data plans , ubiquitous computing is finally starting to arrive on single - task gadgets .
Amazon's $ 360 Kindle ships with an already - paid - for data plan .
It uses Sprint 's national EVDO network to connect to the Web and provide on - the - go sales of e-books .
As with any special - purpose device , general Internet use is a compromise — Web browsing is stripped down to the basics .
For $ 20 / month , the Peek e-mail reader keeps you connected to your messages , providing Crackberry - style love at a highly discounted price .
You can take your e-mail on the road and keep in touch wherever you can get service .
Peek is powered by T - Mobile 's cellular network , which keeps the device in touch with the servers .
But you cannot use the Peek for anything but reading e-mail .
The company 's blog states , " We have limited access for our devices solely to our email server in the network .
While our customers pay a flat rate for unlimited data , we pay on a per-usage basis with the carrier so we are protective for now as we ’re a poor start - up . "
Becoming cellular
We are more than ever becoming a portable computing nation .
We have our laptops , our music players , our e-mail devices , and our e-book readers .
So when will the data component of this equation shake out ?
It 's absurd to think that we'd own a half - dozen devices and pay separately for each data plan .
Somewhere , somehow , an all - you - can - eat data plan has to be derived from this equation .
I should be able to pay a flat data access rate to the carrier of my choice and pull my data as needed .
Family plans for multiple users would extend to using that data on more than one device at a time .
But that price point has to be sane and affordable to consumers .
At the same time , why should my Dad , whose portable needs are well - satisfied with his little always - on e-mail device , be paying any more than $ 20 / month for his capability ?
So while all - you - can - eat is an important option for data consumption , it should n't come at the price of eliminating � la carte plans .
There will always be a population with limited needs that are willing to pay for convenience rather than covering the actual data transfer costs .
At some point , the carriers are going to need to figure out these details .
Ubiquitous data access lies on the brink of exploding into the mainstream .
It would be nice to think that carriers will solve the problem by balancing how much strain usage actually places on the system and how much is being charged to the customer .
Right now , the prices of cellular data place them into the luxury arena for anything more than a single device .
Are the carriers ready for the consumer data revolution ?

Stephen Mallon might be sitting on some of the most newsworthy pictures never seen .
Stephen , a New York City industrial photographer , was hired by Weeks Marine , the maritime crane company involved in the recovery of US Airways Flight 1549 from the Hudson River , to document the recovery process .
Those who have seen the pictures say he did a wonderful job .
He was given unlimited access on the water , to the plane 's interior , virtually anywhere he wanted to go .
He had the full cooperation and blessing of his immediate client , Weeks Marine ; of the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) ; and of USAirways .
He never signed a Work for Hire agreement , and his client had no problem with him publishing the work non-commerically — like , on his website , where he posted them .
The best shots from the more than 5,000 captures he made amounted to " an incredible , beautiful document of the recovery , " according to Pulitzer - Prizewinning photo editor Stella Kramer , who saw them .
( The two pictures posted here were published elsewhere while they were still available from Stephen . )
That 's when the funny business started .
Stephen put the pictures up on his website , where they were viewable for about a week .
Then he got a correction from the NTSB : no , he could not " go live " with the pictures .
So he took them down .
Two weeks later , the NTSB released them , so all but a couple went up again .
Then a couple more had to come down .
And so on .
Then he got a letter from J. Supor & Son , a land - based crane company , saying they were asserting their rights to be considered his client , based on their ownership of Weeks Marine , which , you recall , had hired Stephen in the first place .
Then he got a letter from a law firm , not sent directly but passed to him by insurance giant AIG — yup , that AIG — asserting that Stephen has no rights to his pictures , and that the pictures absolutely can't be released to anyone , ever — not even news outlets for news purposes .
AIG ( through its lawyers ) apparently seeks total suppression of the work , indefinitely .
Based on ... what rights , explicitly ?
Stephen is n't sure .
Like any photographer , Stephen owns the rights to his pictures , except those rights he signed away in his contract with Weeks .
AIG is US Airways ' insurer .
Ultimately , they 'll be paying for the salvage operation and for a new airplane .
But they were n't Stephen 's client .
The ASMP is urging him to proceed with caution , for which I emphatically do n't blame him — a sole proprietor photographer has a hard enough row to hoe as it is , without a giant multinational corporation trying with all their might to make his life miserable .
And based on ... what motivation , exactly ?
Why is AIG seeking to suppress the photos of the recovery ?
It 's not like they can cover up the fact that the plane ended up in the Hudson River .
No one 's disputing that .
It 's been reported all over the world .
And why would US Airways participate in a cover -up ?
If ever there was one , the Hudson River crash was an example of an airline doing everything right !
Not a single life was lost ; the pilot and crew performed bravely and brilliantly , and are national heroes as a result — they got a standing O from the U.S. Congress , for Pete 's sake .
It 's hard to imagine a better outcome for a dire emergency situation that results in a crash landing .
If you had to be in a plane crash , would n't you want it to be a US Airways flight with the intrepid Sully Sullenberger at the controls ?
So why the cover up ?
Stephen can't figure it out .
And he has the photos ... not just the ones that were posted on his site , but , of course , all his shooting from the scene .
And he can't see anything incriminating about the pictures .
You and I , of course , ca n't see for ourselves .
The national news media has yet to pick this story up .
I just called up Stephen at his New York studio .
He 's got the scoop .
NBC , CBS , ABC , PBS , NYT , etc. — your move .
So , can you help ?
Stephen thinks maybe you can .
He 's asking members of the public to write or call AIG and US Airways to help put public pressure on them to allow him to release his photos to public view .
While we 're at it , let 's ask them what they think they 're hiding !
I for one am curious to know that .
( Also , if you 're a lawyer , what 's your take on this ?
Obviously Stephen can't use his clients ' pictures for commercial purposes , but what about their newsworthiness ?
Does Free Speech trump AIG 's rights to suppress the work ?
I do n't know , I 'm just asking . )

Featured Comment by Carl Weese : " Are they covering something up , or acting on their Masters of the Universe reflex ?
The rule that says they can crush the little guy if they feel like it — for whatever reason , or no good reason at all — because he can't afford to protect his legal rights against them .
" I 'm not a lawyer but have done commercial / industrial photography since 1972 , and negotiated a lot of assignment agreements / contracts .
A client paying a photographer for an assignment acquires only such rights as the photographer assigns to them , in detail , in writing , in a formal document .
All other rights remain with the photographer ( ' creator ' in copyright language . )
It 's not unusual to restrict other distribution ( often for a limited period of time ) but there 's no such restriction automatically granted — it has to be spelled out in writing .
It 's not unusual to try to get total control of the pictures by demanding ' work for hire , ' but the photographer would have to agree to it in writing .
[ Note : Stephen did not sign a work - for - hire agreement .
— Ed. ]
A client can't legally assert ' work for hire ' rights after the fact .
So the documents that he did sign are terribly important here .
JC : " If you hire somebody to shoot something , would n't the photos belong to you , just as if you hired a carpenter to build a fence for you ? "
Carl Weese : " No , copyright automatically belongs to the creator , even if he / she is working for pay .
The reasoning ( supported by copyright law ) is because photos have no intrinsic commercial value : the value depends on use .
If I 'm assigned to do an environmental portrait for a small circulation magazine it might pay a few hundred dollars .
The same assignment for a corporate annual report would pay several times as much ( it 's a more valuable usage of the work ) and the same for a full page ad in a national magazine would be worth several times more .
If assigned to shoot for the annual report , my contract would restrict the client from using the work in ads without additional payment for the more valuable use .
So the client always wants to get the broadest possible rights for the least money , and the photographer wants to grant the opposite .
But the client can only acquire rights through written contract : 'we paid for it ' does n't mean anything without a contractually determined ' it . ' "
Featured Comment by Toe Tag : " Unless he assigned the rights to his pictures to the crane company ( which you say he did n't ) , AIG has no business telling him what he can or can't do .
If they paid for the hull loss , they bought the wreckage , not pictures of its recovery .
( In fact , if the Airbus was leased from ILFC — another AIG subsidiary — it looks like AIG paid for it twice . )
Practically speaking , though , if AIG is paying the crane company for the recovery , and he wants work in the future from that client , he might want to go slowly ( like ASMP recommends ) until everybody calms down .
" People do silly things when litigation is involved ; I recall that a couple of passengers have already filed suit against US Air and Airbus , though what effect pictures of the recovery of the wreckage would have on that case is beyond me , and I do a lot of that stuff . "
Featured Comment by Dave Wilson : " Interesting — contracts are sacrosanct when they involve AIG employees and large bonuses but can be trampled over with ease when they involve someone else and when AIG is not a party to the contract ?
I 'm not a lawyer but this sounds distinctly like a double standard to me .
" I 'm glad I got to see Stephen 's gallery when he posted them just after the event .
The photos are superb . "
The gang that allegedly plotted to kill Bolivian president Evo Morales was also behind a dynamite attack on the residence of Roman Catholic Cardinal Julio Terrazas last week , it has been claimed .
Bolivia has launched an investigation into the suspected militant group that police say was plotting to kill President Evo Morales , but the opposition slammed the probe as an " international show . "
Three suspected mercenaries were killed in a shootout on Thursday in the anti-Morales stronghold of Santa Cruz after police moved to arrest a gang that officials say traveled from Ireland or Croatia to kill leading public figures in the Andean nation .
One of the three was believed to be a man from Co Tipperary .
The Bolivian police have named him as Michael Martin Dwyer ( 24 ) .
" The investigative work is now in the hands of prosecutors .
I hope they do their work quickly so we can have clear and concrete information " about who was behind the conspiracy , police chief Victor Hugo Escobar told state television .
Interpol has offered to help Bolivia with the investigation .
But opposition Senate chief Oscar Ortiz said investigators " should aim to find the truth , instead of helping the president stage an international show " .
Mr Ortiz attacked Mr Morales for " playing the victim " and said the country 's first indigenous leader was trying to disparage the eastern city of Santa Cruz because he lacked support there .
Mr Morales has accused right - wing politicians and business leaders in Santa Cruz of organizing violent protests there last year to try to destabilize his government .
On Thursday , he said the rightist opposition wanted to " riddle us with bullets , " referring to himself and the vice president .
Government officials said the suspected conspirators had also targeted Santa Cruz Governor Ruben Costas , a fierce Morales ' critic .
They said the men were likely behind a dynamite attack on the residence of Roman Catholic Cardinal Julio Terrazas earlier this week .
The cardinal was not home at the time .
" The terrorist group had a strategy and part of the strategy was to attack the cardinal ... and ( take ) other actions , not only against the president or vice president , but other authorities as well , " deputy interior minister Marcos Farfan told the Erbol radio network .
Mr Farfan said the suspected plotters tried to blow up a navy boat on which Morales met with Cabinet ministers two weeks ago and aimed to trigger " a spiral of violence " in Bolivia .
The head of the Organization of American States , Jose Miguel Insulza , condemned the suspected assassination plot on Friday after meeting with Bolivia 's foreign minister in Trinidad and Tobago , where Morales was attending the Summit of the Americas .
Pictures of Mr Dwyer taken from his Bebo site have emerged but the site has been subsequently set to private .
Gardaí and Department of Foreign Affairs officials are due to confirm to the Bolivian authorities that the Irishman was one of those killed .
Bolivian authorities have said the deceased ’s Irish passport was found among his personal items after he and two of his associates were fatally wounded in what they said was a shoot - out with police in a hotel in the city of Santa Cruz on Thursday morning .
Two other suspects – accused of being part of a group of mercenaries hired to kill president Evo Morales – were arrested and taken in for questioning .
A member of the family of Michael Dwyer ( 25 ) , from Ballinderry , near Borrisokane , Co Tipperary , confirmed last night that he had died in unexplained circumstances while travelling in Bolivia .
The Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed that an Irishman had been involved in a “ violent incident ” in Bolivia .
An official from the Irish embassy in Buenos Aires , Argentina was travelling to Bolivia to investigate the matter .
In a press conference in Venezuela where he is attending a regional summit , Mr Morales said Bolivia ’s police had the group under surveillance since April 3rd and he gave the order to arrest them .
It is understood some of the group had been working in private security in the US .
The two other men killed in the shoot - out were a Hungarian man and a Bolivian man with Croatian citizenship who had fought in the Balkan wars .

The plane crashed close to the town airport A plane has crashed in the northern US state of Montana , killing at least 16 people on board , officials say .
The light aircraft went down in a cemetery as it approached the airport in the town of Butte .
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) said children were among the victims .
There were no survivors .
The pilot was flying from Oroville , California , when he diverted to Butte , the FAA said .
He tried to land but crashed 500 ft ( 150 m ) from the airport .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
At a news conference , FAA officials said the plane crashed in a cemetery close to the airport in cloudy weather conditions , John Emeigh , a reporter for The Montana Standard newspaper , told the BBC .
There were no survivors on board the plane , the FAA said .
No-one on the ground was injured .
The cause of the crash was not immediately known .
' Nosedive ' Reports suggest the pilot had filed a flight plan showing a destination of Bozeman , a ski destination about 85 miles ( 136 km ) southeast of Butte .
But the pilot cancelled his flight plan at some point and diverted for Butte , FAA spokesman Mike Fergus said .
" We think that it was probably a ski trip for the kids , " Mr Fergus told the Associated Press news agency .
A local reporter at the crash site told the BBC the area was sealed off , and officials were not letting anyone near it .
" I did speak to one eyewitness who said he saw the plane approaching from the west and nosedive into the Holy Cross cemetery just short of the airport here in Butte , " said Pat Ryan , also from The Montana Standard .
" I was on the scene speaking to eyewitnesses who basically described the plane coming in trying to make it to the runway and obviously not getting there . "
He said witnesses told him there had then been an explosion and the plane had caught fire .
Les Dorr , another FAA spokesman , told the BBC that the plane crashed at approximately 1527 local time ( 2127 GMT ) .
He said the plane was a Pilatus PC - 12 Swiss - made turboprop aircraft .

This is a story that is not going away .... the trail goes right to Dick Cheney 's office ....
This is just fucked up all around .....
When two Dublin art galleries discovered nude portraits of the Irish Prime Minister , Brian Cowen , hung on its walls , the story was immediately picked up by several media outlets .
The Sunday Tribune , a Dublin paper , covered the story , as did RTE , the national television broadcaster .
The story might have died there .
But a groveling apology from RTE over its report on the paintings , plus a police investigation into the offending mystery artist , whose identity was the subject of much speculation , has ensured that it has kept going .
A Facebook group in support of the artist had over 4,000 members as of Friday .
The episode began last week when two rather unusual portraits — one showing the nation 's leader on the toilet , and another showing him holding his Y - fronts — appeared in the National Gallery and the Royal Hibernian Gallery .
The artist 's guerilla tactics for exposing the paintings were successful , but did n't last too long .
When a museum visitor asked staff about the painting in the Royal Hibernian Academy , it was immediately taken down .
At the National Gallery , the nude was noticed 20 minutes after it was hung , and was promptly removed and handed over to police .
Then the Taoiseach 's ( Irish Prime Minister 's ) office made a complaint to RTE , which issued a formal apology .
RTE , which included shots of the portraits in its report on the story , said on air : " RTE News would like to apologize for any personal offence caused to Mr. Cowen or his family for any disrespect shown to the office of the Taoiseach . "
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cowen told IrishCentral that it was his press secretary , Eoghan O Neachtain who made the complaint of his own initiative , adding that it was n't at the Taoiseach 's request .
O Neachtain told an Irish newspaper that the report " went beyond the news values of RTE . "
Michael Kennedy , one of Cowen 's party members , and a Member of Parliament for North Dublin , said that the director general for RTE , Cathal Goan , should " consider his position . "
Then RTE , which is funded by the taxpayer , faced accusations that it was being " craven " to the Taoiseach .
And its kowtowing to Cowen drew the ire of the Irish blogosphere , which refers to the episode as " picturegate . "
" Respect the office ?
More like give the story more legs than it otherwise would have gotten .
Move on to bigger issues ?
Hah , a government more interested in covering Cowen 's modesty , " said Cain O'Flaherty of IrishElection .
Com .
Allan Cavanagh , a caricaturist and a blogger with a Web site called Caricatures Ireland , wrote one blog post entitled , " The Taoiseach has no clothes and RTE has no balls : the Brian Cowen Nude Caricature . "
Cavanagh wrote , " This needs to be screamed from the rooftops : the very freedom to express dissent and poke fun at those in power is being attacked . "
And Cavanagh is doing just that : selling T - shirts on his Web site that depict a naked Brian Cowen with the caption " Censor This . "
( All proceeds go to the Rape Crisis Network Ireland . )
The Taoiseach 's spokeswoman refused to comment when asked if he regretted the RTE complaint , which gave the story a new lease of life .
The story did n't end with the RTE apology .
Now it has emerged that the Irish police have been investigating the case – and that they may charge a man who admitted hanging the offending portraits .
He could be prosecuted for criminal damage after CCTV showed him putting glue on to the gallery walls to hang up the pictures .
The identity of the mystery artist has finally been revealed : he is Conor Casby , an art teacher from Dublin .
Casby has said that although he painted the pictures , he was n't responsible for hanging them up .
It has been reported that this was done by two other men .
The story was featured on Irish radio station called Today Fm , which had been contacted by Casby .
The station said that one of their producers had been question by the Irish police , but that no information about the artist was handed over .
The police then threatened to get a search warrant , Ray D'Arcy , the presenter of the Today FM show , said .
Facebook groups have come to Casby 's defense .
A group called " Leave Conor Casby Alone ! " has been set up , which had over 4,000 members by Friday .
One member , Suzanne Finglas , wrote on the group 's wall : " I think this is very typical of the current Irish government .
We have huge issues to be faced and the overstetched police resources are pursuing this ridiculous matter - what a joke ! "
Another Facebook group is called " Conor Casby for President . "
( This had 15 members by Friday . )
An opposition Member of Parliament , Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael , called the police investigation a " gross affront to freedom of expression and a waste of police time , " and said that Cowen 's reaction " to what amounted to satire is completely over the top . "
" Today FM has clearly come under pressure to hand over emails about this matter while RTÉ News was obviously been browbeaten into a groveling apology , " Flannagan continued .
" The way this matter has been handled is more reminiscent of Russia in the 1930s than Ireland in 2009 . "
The Taoiseach 's spokeswoman told IrishCentral it was the two Dublin galleries who had made a complaint to the police , and that the police investigation had nothing to do with him .
Meanwhile , Conor Casby , the artist who caused all the fuss in the first place has told Today FM that he wants to draw an end to the episode – after he sells the now famous " nudes " for charity .
The confident and unsentimental Mr. Obama , by contrast , has redefined the missions in Iraq and Afghanistan around endgames .
“ Until we have a clear strategy , we ’re not going to have a clear exit strategy , ” he told Jim Lehrer on Friday about Afghanistan , noting that he had ordered a “ head - to - toe , soup - to - nuts ” review of the mission there , so America could get out quickly without risking that the country once more becomes a staging area for terrorist attacks against us .
Mr. Obama called W. on Friday to give him a heads - up about the repudiation on Iraq .
Robert Gibbs said the call was not at all contentious .
But in the Lehrer interview , the president compared America to a big tanker that needed to “ start moving in a better trajectory so that five years , 10 years down the road you can say , you know what , because of good decisions now our kids are safer , more secure , more prosperous , more unified than they were before . ”
This analogy turns W. into the Exxon Valdez .
Mr. Ricks predicted that W.’s snake - bit war may yet swallow up Mr. Obama , that America will be in Iraq for many years to come , and that in the end , we will be the losers .
What emerges will be an Iraq that “ is not a democracy , not an American ally , and run by a strongman , probably tougher , smarter and more adept than Saddam Hussein ” and who is , ironically , “ an even worse guy , ” Ricks told Keith Olbermann .
The new commander in chief has the nerves of a riverboat gambler and , on the humongous budget and stimulus package , he and Rahmbo Emanuel are liberally applying the Rahm doctrine :
Take advantage of a crisis to grab an opportunity .
Even the Republican John
Thune seemed impressed at the administration ’s brazenness , telling The Times ’s Carl Hulse , “ They ’re really swinging for the fences . ”
It is a moment of so many giant , cascading perils , with so many mind - boggling numbers and cautionary codicils , that it makes your brain hurt .
No one , including the new president himself , can possibly know if his risky bets will pay off .
“ This is a human enterprise , ” he told Lehrer .
“ It ’s not going to be flawless . ”
Speaking of the Enterprise , Mr. Obama has a bit of Mr. Spock in him ( and not just the funny ears ) .
He has a Vulcan - like logic and detachment .
Any mere mortal who had to tell liberals that our obligations in Iraq and Afghanistan are far from over and tell Republicans that he has a $ 3.6 trillion budget would probably have tears running down his face .
A new petition by the Courage Campaign is calling upon Obama to allow the federal government to provide the same health benefits to same - sex spouses and partners of federal employees that other federal employee spouses receive .

First , critics said the government 's massive $ 800 billion economic jump - start was too much .
Now , with unemployment spiking , some say maybe it 's not enough .
And yet , as Christina Romer , head of the president 's Council of Economic Advisers , said Monday , the measure has barely taken effect .
NOVEMBER REPORT : Is today 's crisis another Great Depression ?
In a speech to the left - of - center Brookings Institution , Romer brushed aside talk that the ailing economy will require a second shot of fiscal adrenaline next year .
" We need to let the medicine work for a while , " she said .
But citing lessons from the Great Depression , she said the government must keep spending to sustain the economy until a recovery is well established .
After the 1929 crash , the economy plummeted for more than three years .
But as the New Deal 's deficit spending took hold , the U.S. posted the fastest peacetime growth in its history .
The economy expanded by 11 % in 1934 , 9 % in 1935 and 13 % in 1936 .
Then , though the unemployment rate remained stuck in double digits , President Franklin Roosevelt tightened spending and levied the first Social Security payroll taxes , which drained more purchasing power from private hands .
The Federal Reserve , at the same time , doubled reserve requirements for banks .
That one - two punch dealt the economy a blow that added two years to the Depression , Romer said .
Once seen as hyperbole , Depression references have increasingly become a staple of economic commentary .
And with reason :
The U.S. today has suffered the worst 12 - month job loss since the Great Depression , the highest home foreclosure total and the most crippling financial crisis .
Romer , an economic historian who specialized in the Depression while teaching at the University of California - Berkeley , said policymakers have learned the era 's lessons .
There are parallels between the Depression and the current crisis .
Both began with collapsing asset prices , saw leading financial institutions wrecked and were of global dimensions .
But even though today 's economy is badly wounded , it 's still nowhere near Depression depths .
From the 1929 peak to its trough in 1932 , the economy contracted by more than 25 % vs. the 2 % decline suffered from the most recent peak , Romer said .
Despite fierce public controversy over the trillion - dollar - plus bailouts of banks , insurance companies and automakers , Romer said those initiatives prevented the economy from deteriorating even more than it has the past year .
" We 've had a much better policy response already , " she said .
And Romer said the Depression does offer one positive lesson , even if an underwhelming one .
" A key feature of the Great Depression , " she said , " is that it did eventually end . "

In the course of the ongoing financial crisis , we ’ve been ceaselessly reminded of the dangers of moral hazard — the idea that if people are insulated from the negative effects of their gambles they are more likely to act rashly .
When Bear Stearns was bailed out , last spring , the move was attacked for exacerbating the threat of moral hazard .
When Lehman Brothers was allowed to go bankrupt , in mid-September , the decision was praised by some for reducing the risk of moral hazard .
These days , moral - hazard concerns are making policymakers cautious about stemming the rise in foreclosures , and about dealing with ailing banks : if we bail out banks or homeowners , we ’re told , it will only encourage more recklessness .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
The concept of moral hazard seems commonsensical .
A frequently cited example is fire insurance : people who know they ’ll be reimbursed if their house burns down supposedly wo n’t worry as much about preventing fires , and so will have more fires than people who do n’t have insurance .
By extension , the argument goes , if banks think that the government will bail them out in a pinch , they ’re more likely to make risky bets .
That ’s why moral - hazard fundamentalists advocated letting Lehman Brothers fail , and making it clear that bad decisions have consequences .
Of course , not acting also has costs , and sometimes — as in the case of Lehman ’s failure — those costs are immense .
So , if the threat of moral hazard is going to encourage inaction in a crisis , we should be sure that threat is real .
And there certainly are situations where moral hazard does seem to have an effect on people ’s choices .
Deposit insurance can make depositors less vigilant about the quality of banks , increasing the likelihood that bankers will make bad gambles with depositors ’ money , as they did during the savings - and - loan crisis of the eighties .
In other circumstances , though , moral hazard seems to have a much smaller impact .
And , in the case of public - sector intervention during financial crises , evidence for its dangers is surprisingly flimsy .
The International Monetary Fund , for example , has helped bail out developing countries across the globe .
If those bailouts heightened moral hazard , you ’d expect the recipient countries to be more reckless in their spending and borrowing , and outside investors to be more careless in their lending .
Yet a number of studies looking at the effects of I.M.F. bailouts on things like credit spreads and capital flows have found little evidence for that .
On the contrary , a 2002 study by Steven Kamin , of the Federal Reserve , found that , when it came to investing in developing countries , “ investors appear to be discriminating among credit risks more carefully than ever . ”
Similarly , the U.S. government ’s bailout of banks this fall has n’t led them to lend rashly ; indeed , they ’ve been attacked for not lending enough .
Even the example of fire insurance does n’t provide much proof of moral hazard : as it turns out , people who are insured often have fewer accidents , not more .
A recent study of businesses in Taiwan suggests that this may be because companies with fire insurance actually take more precautions against fires — the reverse of what the theory of moral hazard predicts .
Why might the effects of moral hazard be smaller than expected ?
To begin with , most bailouts are n’t like deposit insurance , which is certain and quick .
Financial bailouts are uncertain and messy , and they typically occur only after institutions have already suffered extensive damage .
Bear Stearns , for instance , was “ saved ” only after its shares had fallen almost ninety - five per cent from the previous year , and it seems unlikely that either its laid - off workers or its battered shareholders came out of the experience anxious to engage in more foolhardy behavior .
The moral - hazard argument also assumes that the most important factor shaping corporate decisions is the interest of the company as a whole .
But , more often , what ’s shaping those decisions is the interest of individuals , and on Wall Street those interests are often only loosely connected to the long - term health of companies .
The fact that people can reap enormous rewards for decisions that are beneficial in the short term but costly in the long term is likely to lead to reckless behavior , regardless of whether companies are bailed out or not .
Even if we allow Citigroup to fail , after all , Chuck Prince , the former C.E.O. , will still have walked away with a package reportedly worth more than seventy million dollars .
Finally , the biggest reason that moral hazard matters less than it might is that it can operate only if people actively countenance the possibility that their decisions could lead to complete disaster .
But it ’s well documented that people generally , and investors particularly , are overconfident and significantly underestimate the chances of being wiped out .
The moral - hazard fundamentalists argue that banks and other financial institutions will act recklessly if they think they ’ll be rescued in the event of failure .
But Wall Street was reckless because it never believed that failure was even a possibility .
The patchiness of the moral - hazard argument does n’t mean that we should simply rubber - stamp another bank bailout ; that may be both unjust and a poor strategy for whipping the financial sector into shape .
But it does mean that the failure of Lehman Brothers was an unnecessary and costly sacrifice to moral - hazard fundamentalism .
It also means that we should not sit quietly by because we fear that government action today will lead to reckless market behavior years from now .
Moral hazard has its costs .
But , so far , our fear of it has proved much more expensive . ♦
Chinook helicopter graphic
The lives of UK troops have been put at greater risk owing to an eight - year hold - up in getting eight Chinook helicopters into service , said MPs .
The transport helicopters have remained grounded since delivery in 2001 because of cockpit computer system problems .
The Commons public accounts committee also said the decision to add night vision equipment to RAF Chinooks Mk2s had been linked to two crashes .
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) said the MPs ' report contained " nothing new " .
" The department has repeatedly acknowledged the problems with the initial procurement and we have changed the way we do business since these helicopters were bought , " a spokesman said .
THE CHINOOK MARK 3 SAGA MoD orders 14 Chinooks from Boeing in 1995 , including eight Mark 3s for special operations
On delivery in 2001 , the Mark 3s - costing £ 259 m - do not meet MoD airworthiness standards Radar and software problems mean Mark 3s can only fly limited trials above 500ft in clear skies Efforts to rectify problems abandoned in 2007 , with standard Chinooks instead adapted for some special operations Significant safety concerns raised about reduced visibility from " bolt - on " night - vision equipment added to Mark 2s Mark 3s being " reverted " to standard models , expected for use in Afghanistan in 2010 Total procurement cost rises to more than £ 422 m
The ' sorry saga ' of UK's Chinooks The Mark 3 Chinooks were ordered from Boeing in 1995 , with a modified cockpit computer system in order to reduce costs .
But the aircraft have never been able to fly because the MoD failed to secure access to key software source code .
It announced last year that the helicopters would be downgraded to Mark 2 models , for use in Afghanistan in 2010 .
The cost of the programme has spiralled from £ 259 m to more than £ 422 m .
Committee chairman Edward Leigh said that the Chinook Mark 3 programme had been " hamstrung from the start " with " bad decision - making to the point of irresponsibility " .
He said : " The consequences have included a shortage of helicopter support in Afghanistan , thereby heightening the risk to the lives of British troops . "
Defence minister Quentin Davies said the fourth report on the Mark 3 programme offered " nothing new " .

He added : " We have fundamentally changed our methods of doing business , but this episode will remain a salutary example to us all .
" I am sure that given the problems that existed with this contract , the decision to convert these eight aircraft to a support helicopter role was the right one . "
He said the conversion of the Mark 3s could see the Chinook fleet in Afghanistan increase 25 % by 2010 , two years earlier than expected .
The MoD also highlighted a 60 % increase in helicopter numbers and flying hours in Afghanistan over the last two years .
' Short - term fixes '
The committee also reported that the addition of " bolt - on " night vision equipment to Mark 2 Chinooks had been linked to two crashes .
The package was fitted to the Mark 2s to compensate for the grounded Mark 3s .

An earlier National Audit Office report said the " bolt - on " night vision enhancement could reduce pilots ' normal visibility .
The committee said the MoD " should examine whether its acceptance of the risks associated with short - term fixes like the night enhancement package is consistent with the priority accorded to identifying funding for long - term solutions , the duty of care it has to personnel and the principles underpinning its approach to airworthiness . "
The MoD played down the significance of the crashes , likening them to " bending the fender on the car when you parked it " .
The MPs ' report also disclosed that Chinooks were now being used for basic pilot training because flight simulators had not been modified .

A biker war erupted in front of terrified travellers at Sydney airport yesterday as rival gang members fought a pitched battle inside the domestic terminal that ended in one man being bludgeoned to death .
Warring members of the Hell 's Angels and Comancheros gangs first came to blows near the arrivals gate shortly after a lunchtime flight from Melbourne had landed .
They brawled their way towards the check - in desks , where they grabbed metal bollards to wield as impromptu weapons , as innocent bystanders , including children , ducked for cover .
" They were swinging them , swinging them like swords at each other , " a witness , Naomi Constantine , told Australia 's ABC television .
" I saw one of the men lying on the ground and another man came up with a pole and just started smashing it into his head . "

A 29 - year - old man , thought to be a member of the Hell 's Angels , died later in hospital from severe head injuries .
" At this point in time we are investigating a murder involving up to 15 gang members , " said police chief Peter Williams .
" It would appear there was a degree of planning that went into this . "
Four of the Comancheros , aged between 21 and 25 , were arrested as they tried to flee by taxi but several other bikers escaped , despite the fact the violence exploded in a top - security public space .
" They came across the turnstiles like a tangled mob , " another witness , who did not want to be named , told The Sydney Morning Herald .
" Even if there was airport security , there was no way they could have intervened . "
Several check - in desks were still roped off behind crime scene tape last night , but Qantas , the airline which operates the domestic terminal , said the rampage caused minimal flight delays .
Local media said the violence was the culmination of a vendetta following last month 's bombing of a Hell 's Angels clubhouse .
The airport attack came just hours after drive - by shootings at six homes in a suburb of west Sydney in which two people were injured .
These are believed to be linked to two other feuding biker gangs – the Bandidos and Notorious – but some commentators were drawing links between the two incidents last night , with some suggesting the Melbourne flight was bringing in " new troops " .
The government of New South Wales is coming under pressure to enact tougher legislation and clamp down on biker violence .
There have been calls for the state to follow the lead of South Australia , which makes membership or association with outlawed clubs illegal , with a 10 - year prison term for bikers who take part in group violence .
Barry O'Farrell , the New South Wales opposition leader , said : " This horrific episode must finally force [ state Premier ] Nathan Rees to stop standing by and doing nothing as criminal bike gang members murder each other in broad daylight . "
Israel was last night confronting a major challenge over the conduct of its 22 - day military offensive in Gaza after testimonies by its own soldiers revealed that troops were allowed and , in some cases , even ordered to shoot unarmed Palestinian civilians .
The testimonies – the first of their kind to emerge from inside the military – are at marked variance with official claims that the military made strenuous efforts to avoid civilian casualties and tend to corroborate Palestinian accusations that troops used indiscriminate and disproportionate firepower in civilian areas during the operation .
In one of the testimonies shedding harsh new light on what the soldiers say were the permissive rules of engagement for Operation Cast Lead , one soldier describes how an officer ordered the shooting of an elderly woman 100 metres from a house commandeered by troops .
Another soldier , describing how a mother and her children were shot dead by a sniper after they turned the wrong way out of a house , says the " atmosphere " among troops was that the lives of Palestinians were " very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers " .

A squad leader said : " At the beginning the directive was to enter a house with an armoured vehicle , to break the door down , to start shooting inside and – I call it murder – to shoot at everyone we identify .
In the beginning I asked myself how could this make sense ?
Higher - ups said it is permissible because everyone left in the city [ Gaza City ] is culpable because they did n't run away . "
The accounts , which also describe apparently indiscriminate destruction of property , were given at a post- operation discussion by graduates of the Yitzhak Rabin pre-military course at the Oranim Academic College in northern Israel .
The transcript of the session in front of the head of the course – details from which were published by the newspaper Haaretz – prompted the Israel Defence Forces ( IDF ) military advocate general Avichai Mendelblit yesterday to announce a military police investigation into the claims .
Haaretz said the airing of the " dirty secrets " would make it more difficult for Israelis to dismiss the claims as Palestinian propaganda .
The course principal , Danny Zamir , told the newspaper that after being " shocked " by the testimonies on 13 February he told the IDF chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi he " feared a serious moral failure " in the IDF .
In one account , an infantry squad leader describes how troops released a family who had been held in a room of their house for several days .
He said : " The platoon commander let the family go and told them to go to the right .
One mother and her two children did n't understand and went to the left , but they forgot to tell the sharpshooter on the roof they had let them go and it was okay ...
The sharpshooter saw a woman and children approaching him .
He shot them straight away .
I do n't think he felt too bad about it , because , as far as he was concerned , he did his job according to the orders he was given .
And the atmosphere in general , from what I understood from most of my men who I talked to , the lives of Palestinians , let 's say , is something very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers . "
A second squad leader , who described the killing of the elderly woman , says he argued with his commander over loose rules of engagement that allowed the clearing out of houses by shooting without warning residents beforehand .
After the orders were changed , soldiers had complained that " we should kill everyone there [ in the centre of Gaza ] .
Everyone there is a terrorist . "
The squad leader said : " To write ' death to the Arabs ' on walls , to take family pictures and spit on them , just because you can .
I think this is the main thing :
To understand how much the IDF has fallen in the realm of ethics . "
Ehud Barak , Israel 's Defence Minister , said : " I say to you that from the chief of staff down to the last soldier , the most moral army in the world stands ready to take orders from the government of Israel .
I have no doubt that every incident will be individually examined . "
But Israeli human rights organisations , including B'Tselem and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , called for an independent investigation and complained that the military police inquiry had only been announced after Haaretz published the story , " three weeks after the relevant materials reached the Chief of the General Staff .
This tardiness follows a pattern of failures to investigate suspicions of serious crimes " .
Amos Harel , the paper 's respected military correspondent who broke the story , wrote that Mr Zamir was sentenced in 1990 for refusing to guard a settlers ' ceremony at Joseph 's tomb in the West Bank .
But he added that a reading of the transcript shows that Mr Zamir " acts out of a deep concern for the spirit of the IDF " .
In their own words : Soldiers ' stories
Squad leader Aviv
" At the beginning the directive was to enter a house with an armoured vehicle , to break the door down , to start shooting inside and to ascend floor by floor and – I call it murder – to go from floor to floor and to shoot at everyone we identify .
In the beginning I asked myself how could this make sense ?
Higher - ups said it is permissible because everyone left in the city [ Gaza City ] is culpable because they did n't run away .
This frightened me a bit .
I tried to influence it as much as possible , despite my low rank , to change it .
In the end the directive was to go into a house , switch on loudspeakers and tell them ' you have five minutes to run away and whoever does n't will be killed ' . "
Soldier Ram
" There was an order to free the [ confined ] families .
The platoon commander set free the family and told them to turn right .
A mother and two children did n't understand and turned left .
[ Officers ] had forgotten to tell the sniper on the roof that they were being set free and that everything was okay and he should hold fire .
You can say that he acted as he was supposed to , in accordance with the orders .
The sniper saw a woman and children approaching him , past lines that no one was to be allowed to cross .
He fired directly at them .
I do n't know if he fired at their legs but in the end he killed them . "
" Deficits do n't matter . "
-- Former Vice President Dick Cheney
The Republican Party 's most vile , and suddenly visible , toxic asset did more than commit war crimes , lie the nation into an unnecessary war , and mount wholesale attacks on the Constitution and Bill of Rights during his string - pulling stint in the White House .
Dick Cheney was also a champion and defender of George W. Bush 's fiscal madness .
Cheney supported Bush in forging public policies that drained the U.S. Treasury to provide tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and ran up record deficits while spending at rates that exceeded Lyndon Johnson 's pace .
Johnson , at least , raised taxes to pay for his disastrous war .
Cheney and Bush preferred to create billions of dollars of debt to finance their military and nation building experiments .
In late 2002 , Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill argued another round of massive tax cuts would result in staggering deficits and warned Bush the move would harm the economy .
Cheney , infamously , cut off O'Neill snarling , " You know , Paul , Reagan proved deficits do n't matter . "
O'Neill persisted in urging caution thus committing an unforgivable sin in the Bush administration - speaking the truth .
A month later , O'Neill was fired .
Dick Cheney , not the cowardly Bush , told O'Neill he was getting the heave - ho .
The last voice of fiscal restraint in the Bush administration and only cabinet member with the guts to say deficits do matter was unceremoniously sacked .
In Bush world , no one ever again , within earshot of Dick Cheney , would dare utter the heresy that debt financed tax cuts create problems .
With that backdrop , it is truly laughable these days to hear Republicans and a few Democrats sanctimoniously squealing about Obama 's budget and the deficits essential to prevent the recession from doing even more and lasting damage to the economy and creating indispensable stimulus .
Cheney recently tried to explain to CNN's John King why , during the Bush administration , an inherited $ 128 billion surplus transformed into a record $ 1.3 trillion deficit .
It was all unavoidable , Cheney argued .
Events just got out of hand .
There was 9/11 , then the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and out of nowhere Hurricane Katrina hit .
Cheney , whined , " All these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend , or were n't originally part of the budget .
Stuff happens . "
All those revenue draining tax cuts for the rich had nothing to do with the deficit , according to Cheney 's perverse and twisted reading of recent history .
Last week , House Republicans unveiled their alternative to Obama 's budget which absurdly contained virtually no numbers .
They promise details will follow .
But the silly prop book the Republicans gave reporters did contain one number that says it all .
The Republicans " blue print " calls for the top marginal tax rate to be slashed from 35 to 25 percent .
They offered not a scintilla of analysis of the budgetary implications of another tax cut for the rich .
Just say we 're against spending ( except for the military ) , we cut your taxes and deficits do n't matter .
Dick Cheney must be writing the Republican script when Rush Limbaugh is golfing or popping pills .
Cheney - who spent eight years in seclusion , hiding in a bunker plotting and executing horrific crimes - suddenly has become publicly visible - ready to appear on talk shows claiming Barack Obama is making the nation less secure by outlawing torture and planning to close the illegal gulag at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Cheney boldly claims waterboarding and other torture techniques were " absolutely essential " in keeping America safe .
We do not need some silly commission to review the horrors that came out of the White House , especially from Dick Cheney 's lair .
We need the Attorney General to simply enforce the law .
Dick Cheney 's public admissions are clear evidence of crimes committed .
The greatest failure of Barack Obama 's early months in office is his apparent unwillingness to confront the most monstrous deeds of the Bush administration , all of them covered with Cheney 's DNA .
We will soon learn more when Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. releases memos on torture and other illegal activities prepared by Justice Department attorneys at Cheney 's behest though his aides and political enforcers Scooter Libby and David Addington .
The documents are the target of a Freedom of Information request from the A.C.L.U .
The intelligence community is howling and former C.I. A. director Michael Hayden is reportedly " furious " that the memos will soon see the light of day .
Notions of truth and accountability in a free society offend Hayden and his ilk .
Better to keep dark secrets buried forever .
Cheney is flaunting his role in advocating torture and , so far , he 's doing it with smug impunity , almost daring Obama to try to do something about it .
Jonathan Turley , professor of constitutional law at George Washington University , argues we have a moral burden as a nation to confront torture .
He told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow , " We have third world countries that when they have found that their leaders committed torture war crimes , they prosecute them .
But the most successful democracy in history is just , I think , about to see war crimes , and do nothing about it . "
Turley has long argued that we have a civic mandate to act .
" It 's the indictment of all of us if we walk away from a clear war crime and say it 's time for another commission , " he said .
President Obama must appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the crimes .
Nothing else makes sense .
The U.S. Criminal Code is perfectly clear .
A person commits a war crime engaging in a " grave breach of Article 3 " of the Geneva Conventions .
Torture and conspiracy to commit torture are specifically defined as a breach .
The language of the law reads , " The act of a person who commits , or conspires to commit , an act specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering ... upon another person within his custody or physical control for the purpose of obtaining information or a confession , punishment , intimidation , coercion , or any reason based on discrimination of any kind . "
The statute also considers " cruel or inhuman treatment " a grave breach , the kind of acts Cheney has literally bragged about , admitting he discussed and supervised such treatment from the White House .
The brazen admissions stun Jonathan Turley .
" This is the most well - defined and publicly known crimes I 've seen in my life time , " Turley told Maddow , " There 's no doubt about it .
No ambiguity .
It 's well known .
You 've got people involved who have basically admitted the elements of a war crime that we are committed to prosecuting . "
Obama , so far , has shown great reluctance to unleash a criminal prosecution and even is shying away from some kind of truth commission .
Some would find it distasteful and label it a witch hunt .
Public support may be thin .
But it should be done .
" It is just as bad to prevent the investigation and prosecution of a war crime as its commission because you become part of it , " Turley said .
Cheney is running around trying to frame the issue as some kind of policy dispute and political distinction rather than a matter of law and criminal conduct .
Last week , former Attorney General John Ashcroft told a college audience in Texas , " I do n't have a mark on my conscience . "
That is , if he has a conscience .
Ashcroft went on to offer some ridiculous parsing of what waterboarding means .
" There are things that you could call waterboarding that I am firmly convinced are torture , " and " There are things that you could call waterboarding that might be torture . "
I suppose if you use Perrier Water or only pour less than one quart only a misdemeanor is committed .
Waterboarding has been considered torture since the Middle ages and we prosecuted Japanese soldiers for doing it during World War Two .
The legacy of torture Dick Cheney wears as a badge of honor cannot be tolerated .
To ignore it is to countenance the crimes .
President Obama has much on his plate , but he must appoint a special prosecutor now .
During his 60 Minutes interview , Obama said , " I think that vice president Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we can't reconcile our core values , our Constitution , our belief that we do n't torture , with our national security interests .
I think he 's drawing the wrong conclusion from history . "
We do n't need any reconciliation that we are a nation built on the rule of law not the rule of men who cloak themselves as our defenders beyond the law .

The organizers of Join the Impact missed a rare and possibly once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to make a real and lasting impact on the struggle for LTBTQI liberation .
As you may recall , Join the Impact was the group that impressively mobilized tens of thousands of queers to participate in simultaneous nationwide protests .
They put the whole thing together barely a week after a bizarre , pathologically dishonest , tax - evading cadre of magic underwear - clad cultists ( a.k.a. " Mormons " ) successfully purchased the passage of Prop 8 via a multimillion dollar campaign of fear - mongering and lies .
These protests took place in every state in the country , even in obscure small towns in states like Arkansas and Mississippi .
That was an unprecedented achievement in LGBT activism , or at least for LGBT activism during my lifetime .

The Prop 8 Mascot
In the immediate aftermath of Prop 8 's underwhelming margin of victory at the ballot box , LGBTQ people across the nation were glued to their tv's and computers , transfixed with hope by the countless images of boisterous and angry protests ( & near - riots ) that raged like wildfires across California .
Although radically - minded queers ( including , at times , me ) mostly dismissed these protests due to the various motives we imputed to the protesters , the fact remains that LGBTQ people were almost unanimously chomping at the bit to help fan the flames of what could very well have become another Stonewall riot , this time on a national scale .
The passage of Prop 8 was perceived by most queers as just another example of the countless indignities to which we are subjected daily .
Of course , Prop 8 was a highly publicized indignity , and it became a mascot of sorts for many queer people .
Mascots represent things .
Usually they are cute furry critters of some sort that represent sports teams or corporations .
The Prop 8 mascot , however , was a disfigured horror barely clinging on to life .
When queers looked at their Prop 8 mascot , what many of them saw was the legal incarnation of socially enforced shame , lies , family - inflicted wounds ( spiritual , psychological and physical ) , lies , Jerry Falwell , secrets , Matthew Shepard and the murder of thousands of other Matthews of all gender expressions who were n't pretty or white enough to warrant coverage on CNN , are you a boy or a girl , Pat Robertson , invisibility , lies , playground taunts , Rick Warren , I do n't want faggots in my house son so get the fuck out , Gwen Araujo murdered and no one giving a fuck , the pope , god hates fags , vulnerable gay preteens raped by priests or their fathers , Exodus International , the New Jersey 4 , and the condescending sneer of liberal heterosexist disdain .
Right Time - Right Place
Join
The Impact popped up at exactly the right place and at exactly the right time , and they tapped into the revulsion that queers of all stripes felt when forced to behold their new mascot .
The publicity surrounding the unveiling of the mascot allowed Join The Impact 's message to reach queers living in the rural South , the barrios , and every loft - infested gentrified gayborhood in urban America .
What followed was one of the most well - orchestrated and memorable events in recent LGBTQ history .
I 'm not entirely convinced that the rage that was on display in those protests was entirely due to Proposition 8 , the plethora of Google - sponsored " freedom to marry " placards notwithstanding .
After the success of that first national protest , the momentum of queer outrage and activism facilitated by the folks at Join the Impact could have been the catalyst for increasingly raucous protests , coordinated acts of massive civil ( and not - so - civil ) disobedience , sustained direct action , and a new subcultural norm of bashing back ( such as creating a Google map similar to the one that lists the addresses of Prop 8 donors , except this map would be dedicated to known gay bashers ) .
We could have very well witnessed the dawning of a new and more menacing ( and thus more effective ) LGBTQ rights movement .
An invigorated movement of this sort could have relegated the impotent and cowardly self - appointed leaders ( i.e. , affluent gay white male Uncle Toms ) of the dominant ( or " mainstream " , as they like to call themselves ) gay rights movement to the margins of obscurity along with their racist / transphobic / classist front groups like the HRC .
Could have .
So what happened ?
What did the folks at Join the Impact do with that angry momentum generated by those fabulously furious , gorgeously rage - filled , and strangely validating national protests ?
They squandered it completely .
Ignoring the voices of people who posted numerous pleas for more " militant " future actions ( e.g. , massive non-violent civil disobedience ) on their website , the leaders of JTI instead organized a silent candlelight vigil , a " day without a gay " , and a petition to Obama .
Let me say that one more time so it will sink in :
They organized a silent candlelight vigil , a Day Without a Gay , and a petition to Obama .
What Impact ?
What Happened ?
The Comintern leading Join
The Impact apparently believed that courageously defiant actions like sending petitions begging Obama to " please , pretty please keep your campaign promises to be nice to us and do things like repeal ' Do n't Ask Don't Tell ' " would actually have an impact .
This ridiculous petition drive demonstrated that Join The Impact 's organizers possessed a dumbfounding lack of awareness about Obama 's character and history .
It was as if a conscious decision was made by the group 's leadership to descend willfully into a state of pathological denial , clinical delusion and premature irrelevancy .
I applaud the initial work of Join the Impact , but I think they set a new record for selling out ( or maybe they never owned anything of substance worth selling in the first place ) .
After the paleoconservative religious wackos showed up in droves to help Prop 8 eke out its minuscule victory , many LGBTQ people were momentarily roused from their trauma - induced state of paralysis , and they were yearning for creative ways to express lifetimes of pent up fury that would be cathartic , militant , and ( heaven forbid ) effective .
A critical mass of queer people were finally sufficiently pissed off , fed up and seemingly prepared to engage in the risky work required to bring about real change and achieve true equality , even if that work involved cracking a few skulls and suffering a few skull fractures of one 's own .
With a single posting on their website , Join the Impact could have unleashed a queer rebellion that would have made the original Stonewall riots seem like a friendly game of paintball .
Had they done so , Obama almost certainly would have uninvited that putrid , purpose - driven mass of homophobic rhinoceros shit Rick Warren from his inauguration , and he ( and the rest of our rulers ) would have been forced to reckon with queer people on queer terms .
But Join the Impact held a nationwide candlelight vigil instead and Obama got a free pass for honoring a man with ties to Christian Jihadists in Africa who roam around looking for LGBTQ people to rape and slowly torture to death - just for shits and giggles .
The moment passed .
Sadly , the trauma - induced paralysis settled in again , while the change we could believe in turned out to be just another pedestrian fag joke we 'd already heard a million times before .
These days , Join the Impact 's website is little more than a collection of ads for online gay dating services and links to dancing penguins .
What an impact .
What a waste .

Many subscribers have asked my opinion of the possibility that , on 9/11 , the Twin Towers and Building 7 were brought down by controlled demolition .
My view is that all the evidence points in that direction , but I have been reluctant to dwell on the issue because it can get people sidetracked from other issues about which there can be no question – such as the fact that CFR controllers of the Bush Administration had ample foreknowledge of the attacks but decided to allow them .
One really does n't need to go any further than that to understand that the entire War on Terrorism is a ploy for hidden agendas , so why must we look for areas to discuss where the evidence is merely circumstantial ?
That is still my attitude , but it occurred to me several months ago that the evidence for a controlled demolition of the Twin Towers is far more than circumstantial .
It may not be " proof " for those who will accept nothing short of written confessions from the perpetrators , but is a significant factor to consider nevertheless .
There is no such thing as absolute proof .
There is only evidence .
Proof may be defined as sufficient evidence to convince the observer that a particular hypothesis is true .
The same evidence that is sufficient to convince one person may be insufficient for another .
The case may be proved to the first but not to the second who still needs more evidence .
It is in the spirit of this reality that I offer the following evidence .
A recent video documentary has sharply tipped the scales toward what most people would consider to be proof of an inside job .
It is called 911 Revisited , and it can be viewed in its entirety at : http://www.911revisited.com/video.html.
I find it difficult to believe that anyone can consider all the facts presented in this program and still cling to the view that these buildings were desgroyed as a rssult of fire .
SILVERSTEIN SAYS THE BUILDING WAS PULLED Larry Silverstein , the owner of The Twin Towers and Building 7 , said on a PBS TV documentary entitled America Rebuilds , broadcast in September 2002 , that he and others made a decision to " pull " Building 7 because of fires on two of its floors .
He did n't say who the others were , but it was assumed to be the New York Fire Department .
The term " pull " is commonly used in the building industry to mean a controlled demolition .
His exact words were : “ I remember getting a call from the , er , fire department commander , telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire , and I said , We ’ve had such terrible loss of life , maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it ; and they made that decision to pull , and we watched the building collapse . ”
This was the genesis of a thousand articles and blogs suggesting that Silverstein had deliberately destroyed his own buildings for the purpose of collecting insurance on them which , reportedly , was about two times their actual value .
2 YEARS LATER , HE CHANGED HIS STORY
Two years later , after his statement had come under scrutiny and the full implications began to emerge , Silverstein claimed that , when he said “ pull ” he was only talking about pulling the firefighters out of the building !
It is tempting to just laugh at this statement thinking that no one could take it seriously .
However , a review of the Internet shows that there are , indeed , many commentators who are content to accept his revised explanation .
So , let us briefly analyze .
The fires in Building 7 were relatively small and were limited to two locations .
All occupants of the building had been evacuated and , at no time was there any reason to think that the fires would cause additional loss of life – and at no time were the fires considered to be a threat to the structural integrity of Building 7 .
In view of all these facts , I believe it is far more logical to believe that Silverstein was talking about pulling the building rather than the fire fighters .
Watch the video and listen carefully to the inflection of his voice as he ties together the phrase : “ they made that decision to pull , and we watched the building collapse . ”
There can be no doubt that the two events are tied together just as the words are : the decision to pull and the collapse of the building .
Notice , also , that there is no indication of surprise when he mentions the collapse .
If he had not anticipated the collapse , one would expect him to say something like : " It 's a good thing we made the decision to get those fire fighters out of there , because , much to our surprise , the building collapsed just a short time afterward . "
But he did not say anything like that .
He simply said , as in one continuous thought : " They made the decision to pull , and we watched the building collapse . "
Watch the video here and judge for yourself : Silverstein on PBS THE FASTEST BUILDING DEMOLITION IN HISTORY
If you still think that Silverstein was referring to fire fighters , there is no point in reading any further .
You will not consider what follows to be of any significance .
However , if your judgment plus the manner in which Building 7 collapsed lead to you believe that it was brought down by controlled demolition , then what follows may be of interest .
It takes many weeks of planning and preparation by a team of highly trained experts to bring down a structure the size of Building 7 .
The first step is to locate a qualified organization .
Their number is small , and it is not likely that the New York Fire Department is one of them .
After negotiating a contract , the engineers have to obtain master blueprints and identify the main structural components .
They must analyze the building materials , the thickness of load - bearing beams , the weight that rests upon them , the space between them , where the access points are to place charges , how intense the charges must be , in what timing sequence they must be ignited .
A computerized firing system must be programmed to deliver the precisely timed firing impulses .
Then the charges must be obtained from a storage depot in a remote location away from urban areas .
Technicians must gain access to the beams and , in many cases , hack their way through walls to get to them .
Safety procedures are followed to insure that all technicians are clear of the area before implosion is triggered .
This is just a sampling of what must be done before a building like Number 7 can be pulled , and it normally takes many weeks or even months to do it .
Yet , the elapsed time between Mr. Silverstein 's decision to “ pull ” the building and the final collapse was 45 minutes !
What more do we need to know ?
For many of us , the evidence is comprised of so many components and , in its entirety , is so convincing that we consider it to be nothing less than proof .
The concept that the destruction of the World Trade Center was an inside job is absurd .
But the story advanced by the government and Larry Silverman is even more so .
To explain the manner in which the building collapsed - or that the building collapsed at all - plus the rapid execution of the demolition , all lead to the conclusion that explosives had to have been planted inside Building 7 before 9/11 .
And , if they were planted in Building 7 , for whatever reason , it would have been the same reason to plant them in the Twin Towers .
Those who believe that government officials are telling the whole truth about 9/11 will not be convinced by this reasoning - or perhaps any other .
For them , it is a matter of faith and , somehow , mixed up with " love of country . "
To question their leaders is , to them , unpatriotic .
For those who believe that government officials are covering up the truth about 9/11 , this will be only one more piece of evidence that strengthens their conviction .

Authorities said Catherine Thomas kept her son locked in the shower in her room at the Mall Motel on Lincoln Highway near the Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem while she entertained men .
I 'm not much of a Star Wars fan , but there was one aspect of George Lucas 's vision that left a lasting impression : the Ewok village .
Nestled high in the trees of the forest moon of Endor , the Ewoks formed their own private world , safe from the perils of life on land .
The Ewoks are n't the only fictional characters to have made a world for themselves high in the canopies .
What better home for Tarzan or Peter Pan ?
Nowhere encapsulates the spirit of youth – the pursuit of freedom in a world of constraint and responsibilities – like a private retreat among the stars .
According to the American architect and arboreal enthusiast Pete Nelson , " the treehouse possesses a transformative power .
It speaks an ancient language , and the message is universal : ' Climb up and be in harmony with nature .
Let go of earthbound encumbrances and be free . ' "
Spellbound by these homes in the sky , Nelson set upon a journey across six continents in search of modern treehouses that raise the stakes in creative design .
His findings are compiled in his new book , New Treehouses of the World .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At the start of his journey , in the small town of Crossville , Tennessee , Nelson found a man reaching a higher level in more ways than one .
Some 18 years ago , Horace Burgess received " a mission from God " .
" A vision of an enormous treehouse church presented itself to him , " explains Nelson , " with almost every imaginable detail intact . "
Since then , Burgess has spent 15 years creating a hand - built cathedral that now stands almost 100 feet high .
Burgess scavenged wood to create an intricate , eight - level structure enveloping the remnants of an old white oak tree in his grounds .
The pulpit stands before a large wooden cross , embedded in solid internal beams .
This area , at the summit , is accessed by a great spiral staircase , tunnelling up and around the oak .
Bells fashioned from old acetylene bottles hang from wire in a belfry that stands 97 feet high , while an enormous corrugated - plastic skylight illuminates the nave .
When not in service , the church doubles up as a basketball court : a hoop is fixed on the main wall above where the local congregation otherwise gathers .
Burgess 's exquisite creation has since become the heart of Crossville , and he is not the only one lifting the spirits of his community through the power of the treehouse .
Far across the Atlantic , in a deprived neighbourhood in Tangier , Newman discovered a charity established with the help of Roderick Romero , an American spiritualist , former musician and treehouse designer .
He and his partner , Anisa Romero , an artist , have raised the stakes with their innovative treehouse design .
Their opulent creations have graced the pages of Vogue and The New York Times , but the real reward for them is harnessing the " tranquillity and natural splendour " of the treehouse , to bring happiness and hope to deprived neighbourhoods across the world .
In Tangier , Romero helped initiate a captivating outlet for local children .
The Tangier Treehouse Project taught youngsters carpentry skills by helping them build a boat - shaped structure in the branches of a giant ficus tree .
The boat symbolised " the kids ' hope for the future , and a better life " , says Nelson .
And the treehouse was the perfect medium for this .
In his book , Nelson reflects on the restorative power of a place " surrounded by the raw energy of nature , where the soul is inevitably rejuvenated and the spirit lifted " .
But he talks about more tangible benefits , too .
In a world where natural resources are diminishing , and the impact of global warming places the need for sustainable development high on the international agenda , Newman argues that environmentally friendly treehouse tourist resorts , as seen in Thailand , India and Japan , are proof that the future of property development really is up in the air .
Whether or not this sort of high - rise building could ever replace the growing sprawl of concrete tower blocks that permeate Britain is debatable , but there are a number of people in the UK embracing their childhood fantasies .
Jenny and Richard Grindon have fulfilled a lifelong ambition in the grounds of their family home in Haslemere , Surrey .
" Our neighbours had one first , and friends of all ages arrive with tents and sleeping bags , " explains Jenny , who has three children between the ages of two and 10 .
" Some camp in the garden , while the lucky ones get to sleep in the treehouse . "
It was too glorious an idea not to emulate , and the Grindons had their own built in October last year .
" We live in a woodland and it called for a treehouse , " she continues .
They enlisted the skills of Tree House Life , which offers everything from basic children 's playhouses from around £ 3,500 to palatial affairs complete with hot tubs , which , unsurprisingly , do not come cheap .
The Grindons chose something in the middle .
" We wanted ours to blend in with the land , " says Jenny .
" It has a number of platforms and runlets , set around an old oak tree .
There is a zip rope , a rope bridge , a swing , a slide and a great wall of climbing net . "
It 's the ideal space for good , old - fashioned family fun .
" Because we live on a slope , there was little scope before for our children to play games outside before , " she continues .
" But now , every day when the kids come home , we go outside and play battles across the fortress .
You have to be a big kid to think of something like this , but who does n't have an inner child just waiting to be released ? "
' New Treehouses of the World ' by Pete Nelson ( £ 19.99 ) , is published by Abrams and is out in May
Today a brand new movie has premiered but this is not the usual Hollywood - style launch .
' Blank ' , described as an intense psycho- thriller by director Rick L. Winters , will debut on DVD but you can get it for free on BitTorrent too - with the blessing of the entire cast and crew .
Times are certainly changing and slowly but surely people are beginning to realize that rather than trying to fight piracy and destroy file - sharing networks , the best approach is to embrace your one - time rivals and try and create something positive .
Established in 2000 by director Rick L. Winters , Annodam Productions is an independent film company .
A forward looking outfit , Annodam will premiere its latest movie ‘ Blank ‘ , worldwide today .
‘ Blank ’ is the story of a Johnny , a young boy who witnesses the violent death of his parents and older sister .
Roll on some 20 years later and Johnny becomes involved in crime with his adoptive father – who is also a crime boss .
While watching a game of poker Johnny discovers who murdered his family and sets about planning his revenge .
Johnny unwittingly becomes involved with a pair of serial killers and the whole movie climaxes with a bizarre and shocking end .
While the plot may seems standard Hollywood fare , the way this movie has been financed and is set to be distributed is not – Director Rick L. Winters explains , “ The thing that makes this film unique is that it is a co-op based concept where the entire cast and crew worked on a deferred percentage of the film ’s gross .
In other words , the cast and crew own a percentage of the film ’s gross , so the profits are not going to Hollywood executives but instead into the pockets of the filmmakers themselves . ”
After receiving several distribution offers for ‘ Blank ’ , Rick turned them all down .
“ I have seen firsthand the greed that lurks in the Hollywood corporate circles , ” he said while explaining that after he released his first film , the cast and crew could n’t understand why a distribution company was making all the money .
So instead , Rick decided to let the audience distribute ‘ Blank ’ for him – via BitTorrent .
“ This time around the fate of the cast and crew getting paid is in the hands of the audience who watch the film .
No Hollywood bank accounts being filled to turn out more crappy remakes , ” he said , while adding that the future of film is “ in the home market , through peer to peer distribution . ”
Today , ‘ Blank ’ is released on DVD for $ 14.99 , via online streaming and of course , for free on BitTorrent .
“ No one should have to pay for a film they did not like , ” says Rick .
“ No one should be denied the right to enjoy the art of film . ”
The idea is that if people like the movie after they have seen it , they should go to the ‘ Blank ’ website and make a donation .
People are asked to donate what they feel the movie is worth , and in return will be invited to follow the production of the next movie , which they will have helped finance through their donation .
Rick told TorrentFreak , “ I am excited with the aspects of peer to peer distribution and the possibilities .
Giving everyone the opportunity to see my film for free in hope of receiving donations is a little nerve wrecking – wondering if I will receive enough donations to make my next film .
The concept is still scary for independent filmmakers who do n’t have the big budgets like the big studios and most of the time drain their personal accounts and run up credit just to get their film made , in hopes of recouping the cost of making the film . ”
Several large BitTorrent sites including Mininova will be offering ‘ Blank ’ , but undoubtedly it will spread to many others too .
Rick L. Winters is also writing a book which will document the whole process so that others can use the same methods to distribute their own movies .
“ I can only hope for the success of this endeavor to show the world that the revolution of peer to peer distribution can no longer be ignored and the time is now , ” Rick told Torrent Freak .
“ I decided to try the concept of a coop base film in hopes of encouraging other independent filmmakers to come together and create and share the art of film for EVERYONE to enjoy . ”
Congratulations to Rick and the crew for effectively ending the piracy of their movies and we wish them the best of luck with ‘ Blank ’ and all future success .

The CIA ’s secret prisons are being shuttered .
Harsh interrogation techniques are off - limits .
And Guantanamo
Bay will eventually go back to being a wind - swept naval base on the southeastern corner of Cuba .
But even while dismantling these programs , President Obama left intact an equally controversial counter - terrorism tool .
Under executive orders issued by Obama recently , the CIA still has authority to carry out what are known as renditions , secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate with the United States .
Current and former U.S. intelligence officials said that the rendition program might be poised to play an expanded role going forward because it was the main remaining mechanism -- aside from Predator missile strikes -- for taking suspected terrorists off the street .
Advertisement
The rendition program became a source of embarrassment for the CIA , and a target of international scorn , as details emerged in recent years of botched captures , mistaken identities and allegations that prisoners were turned over to countries where they were tortured .
The European Parliament condemned renditions as “ an illegal instrument used by the United States . ”
Prisoners swept up in the program have sued the CIA as well as a Boeing Co. subsidiary accused of working with the agency on dozens of rendition flights .
But the Obama administration appears to have determined that the rendition program was one component of the Bush administration ’s war on terrorism that it could not afford to discard .
The decision underscores the fact that the battle with Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is far from over and that even if the United States is shutting down the prisons , it is not done taking prisoners .

“ Obviously you need to preserve some tools -- you still have to go after the bad guys , ” said an Obama administration official , speaking on condition of anonymity when discussing the legal reasoning .
“ The legal advisors working on this looked at rendition .
It is controversial in some circles and kicked up a big storm in Europe .
But if done within certain parameters , it is an acceptable practice . ”
One provision in one of Obama ’s orders appears to preserve the CIA ’s ability to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects as long as they are not held long - term .
The little - noticed provision states that the instructions to close the CIA ’s secret prison sites “ do not refer to facilities used only to hold people on a short - term , transitory basis . ”
Despite concern about rendition , Obama ’s prohibition of many other counter - terrorism tools could prompt intelligence officers to resort more frequently to the “ transitory ” technique .
The decision to preserve the program did not draw major protests , even among human rights groups .
Leaders of such organizations attribute that to a sense that nations need certain tools to combat terrorism .

“ Under limited circumstances , there is a legitimate place ” for renditions , said Tom Malinowski , the Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch .
“ What I heard loud and clear from the president ’s order was that they want to design a system that does n’t result in people being sent to foreign dungeons to be tortured -- but that designing that system is going to take some time . ”
Malinowski said he had urged the Obama administration to stipulate that prisoners could be transferred only to countries where they would be guaranteed a public hearing in an official court .
“ Producing a prisoner before a real court is a key safeguard against torture , abuse and disappearance , ” Malinowski said .
CIA veterans involved in renditions characterized the program as important but of limited intelligence - gathering use .
It is used mainly for terrorism suspects not considered valuable enough for the CIA to keep , they said .
“ The reason we did interrogations [ ourselves ] is because renditions for the most part were n’t very productive , ” said a former senior CIA official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the subject .

The most valuable intelligence on Al Qaeda came from prisoners who were in CIA custody and questioned by agency experts , the official said .
Once prisoners were turned over to Egypt , Jordan or elsewhere , the agency had limited influence over how much intelligence was shared , how prisoners were treated and whether they were later released .
“ In some ways , [ rendition ] is the worst option , ” the former official said .
“ If they are in U.S. hands , you have a lot of checks and balances , medics and lawyers .
Once you turn them over to another service , you lose control . ”
In his executive order on lawful interrogations , Obama created a task force to reexamine renditions to make sure that they “ do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face torture , ” or otherwise circumvent human rights laws and treaties .
The CIA has long maintained that it does not turn prisoners over to other countries without first obtaining assurances that the detainees will not be mistreated .

In a 2007 speech , https:// www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2007/general-haydens- remarks-at-the-council-on-foreign-relations.html " > www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2007/general-haydens- remarks-at-the-council-on-foreign-relations.html
the agency had to make a determination in every case “ that it is less , rather than more , likely that the individual will be tortured . ”
He added that the CIA sought “ true assurances ” and that “ we ’re not looking to shave this 49 - 51 . ”
Even so , the rendition program became a target of fierce criticism during the Bush administration as a series of cases surfaced .
In one of the most notorious instances , a German citizen named Khaled Masri was arrested in Macedonia in 2003 and whisked away by the CIA to a secret prison in Afghanistan .
He was quietly released in Albania five months later after the agency determined it had mistaken Masri for an associate of the Sept. 11 hijackers .
Masri later described being abducted by “ seven or eight men dressed in black and wearing black ski masks . ”
He said he was stripped of his clothes , placed in a diaper and blindfolded before being taken aboard a plane in shackles -- an account that matches other descriptions of prisoners captured in the rendition program .

In another prominent case , an Egyptian cleric known as Abu Omar was abducted in Italy in 2003 and secretly flown to an Egyptian jail , where he said he was tortured .
The incident became a major source of embarrassment to the CIA when Italian authorities , using cellphone records , identified agency operatives involved in the abduction and sought to prosecute them .
Defenders of the rendition program point out that it has been an effective tool since the early 1990s and was often used to bring terrorism suspects to courts in the United States .
Among them was Ramzi Ahmed Yousef , who was captured in Pakistan and was convicted of helping orchestrate the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
Because details on the rendition program are classified , the scale of the program has been a subject of wide - ranging speculation .
An exhaustive investigation by the European Union concluded that the CIA had operated more than 1,200 flights in European airspace after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Advertisement
The implication was that most were rendition - related , with some taking suspects to states where they faced torture .
But U.S. intelligence officials contend that the EU report greatly exaggerated the scale of the program and that most of the flights documented by the Europeans involved moving supplies and CIA personnel , not prisoners .
Instead , recent comments by Hayden suggest that the program has been used to move no more than a handful of prisoners in recent years and that the total is in the “ midrange two figures ” since the Sept. 11 attacks .

The insanity of closing schools as the state spends hundreds of millions to build more prisons should not be lost on anyone , says Jesse Hagopian , a teacher and co-founder of Seattle 's ESP Vision .
ONE IN 31 .
As a public school teacher , I am quite familiar with this figure - - it 's a typical teacher - to - student ratio in the classroom .
But now that proportion has taken on new significance : A report released on March 2 by the Pew Center on the States found that one in every 31 adults reside in the U.S. corrections system -- now totaling some 7.3 million people .
That means roughly one student per classroom in America will end up in prison , on parole or on probation .
As New School Foundation board member Lisa Fitzhugh notes in her January 19 Seattle Times op - ed , states like Washington even determine how many prison cells to build based on fourth grade reading scores and graduation rates .
So rest assured , if your 9 - year - old stumbles over syntax or has trouble sounding out the word " priorities , " the state has readied the necessary cellblock accommodations .
Why flush money down the sinkhole of reading improvement teachers when there are solitary confinement cells to be built ?
As the Pew study reports :
A Black male born today has a one in three chance of spending time behind bars during his lifetime
In the past two decades , state general fund spending on corrections increased by more than 300 percent , outpacing other essential government services from education , to transportation and public assistance .
Only Medicaid spending has grown faster .
Today , corrections imposes a national taxpayer burden of $ 68 billion a year .
In Seattle , where I teach , our politicians have magnified this absurdity by simultaneously proposing two pieces of public policy : 1 ) Mayor Greg Nickels has proposed the construction of a new municipal jail , projected to cost taxpayers over $ 200 million ; 2 ) Seattle 's School Board voted recently to close five schools and disrupt or discontinue eight other programs .
If you like these policies of planning prison construction based on elementary reading levels , and of closing schools while opening jails , you might consider a couple of other equally rewarding ventures : smashing holes in your boat and investing in buckets to bail out the water , or , equally clever , slashing holes in the tires of your car and subsequently investing in tire patches .
HOW DO we end this illogical , anti-hope scenario and reverse increases in prison spending ?
After years of deregulation and outlandish speculation that caused an implosion of the economy , many politicians and corporate heads are venturing out of their boardrooms to examine the rubble at " Main Street Middle School . "
Realizing something must be done , they tout their education schemes as " school reform " -- including paying teachers according to culturally biased / curriculum narrowing tests their students take , the breaking of teachers ' unions , and the privatization of education through charter schools .
But in an era when CEOs and bankers sabotage the economy and then get to float to the ground on golden parachutes worth tens of millions of dollars , it 's unclear how merit pay for teachers would be structured -- in this new age , would it mean that the more students who flunk the test , the bigger bonuses teachers get ?
Given the current free - market meltdown , they can't really believe that our public schools are better off following the laissez - faire predisposition for privatized charter schools run by CEOs .
A genuine first step on the path to improving education should center on what teachers , students , and parents have known for a long time : class size matters .
Unfortunately , this common sense approach missed Mayor Bloomberg who was quoted in the New York Times on February 22 giving his explanation of how to improve education : " It 's the teacher looking a child in the eye , and teachers can look lots of children in the eye , " he added .
" If you have to have smaller class size or better teachers , go with the better teachers every time . "
I 'll go for option C : The skilled teacher with the smaller class .
Tennessee 's Project STAR ( Student Teacher Achievement Ratio ) -- the most comprehensive class size study ever conducted -- showed students who had been randomly assigned to smaller classes of 13 - 17 students in grades K - 3 outperformed their peers in regular classes of 22 - 25 students ( and in regular classes with an educational aide ) .
Additionally , by eighth grade , those students who had been placed in small classes through Project STAR were still outperforming students who had been placed in regular classes or regular - plus - aide classes in K - 3 .
While proven to help , lower class sizes are not popular with the guardians of the bottom line because training and hiring more teachers costs money .
I should admit I am not a trained economist like the financial intellectuals who managed asset - backed securities at AIG .
However , I feel qualified to assert that unlike the purchase of collateralized debt obligations , spending on our children is a sound investment -- morally and financially .
THE AMERICAN Economic Review , one of the longest running journals in the field , recently released a study revealing that only " A one percent increase in the high school completion rate of all men ages 20 - 60 would save the United States as much as $ 1.4 billion per year in reduced costs from crime incurred by victims and society at large . "
Having missed this statistic , states across the country are reacting to the financial crisis with school closures and teacher layoffs .
While some of the largest districts have postponed massive layoffs for now , recently the Los Angeles Unified Schools threatened 2,300 teachers with pink slips and New York City Schools said they could lay off 15,000 .
The Seattle School District is planning to terminate or disrupt 13 schools , and Chicago is shuttering 16 of its own .
Federal stimulus dollars for education will help ease some of the cuts , but politicians -- from governors to local school officials -- have promised closures and layoffs nonetheless .
Activists in Seattle , however , are working on an alternative lesson plan for our city that may prove to be a model for saving schools and halting jails .
Representatives from all the schools slated for closure and other community members have formed ESP Vision : Educators , Students and Parents for a Better Vision of the Seattle Schools -- rallying hundreds against the school closures , teaming up with the local NAACP to help parents file over 200 grievances with Department of Education , and assisting parents in a formal appeals process to block the closures .
Moreover , ESP Vision has teamed up with the Initiative - 100 campaign that is attempting to block the building of a new city jail by collecting the 23,000 signatures needed to put its construction to a vote .
Mark
Twain once said , " Every time you stop a school , you will have to build a jail .
What you gain at one end you lose at the other .
It 's like feeding a dog on his own tail .
It wo n't fatten the dog . "
While Twain leaves us with a distasteful image , far more repugnant is a social order that invests in metal bars rather than in cultivating our children 's talents .
Australians gratefully accept $ 10.4 billion from Kevin Rudd 's first economic stimulus package , then hand half of it straight to their banks .
That 's one way of looking at the effect of the nation 's gargantuan level of bank fees .
Australians will fork out more than $ 5 billion in fees this year , according to Fujitsu Consulting .
That 's half of Mr Rudd 's initial package gone in a blink .
Prime ministers only have to pump such massive amounts into the economy in times of deep trouble .

Notes : Program descriptions are available at the " http " address , but the " Web Ferret Pro " program is ONLY available at the " ftp " site .
Also available at the " ftp " site is a program named " NFupgrade111.exe " , which is just an upgrade utility to convert " older " versions of these programs to the " current " version , which is Version 1.11 for all of the programs listed except the Web Ferrets .
WFPEV .exe is time crippled at install AND at run-time .
It is also " missing " some code to turn off the advertising , but I 'll show you how to get around these problems later .
Despite these " problems " , you 'll want to download " WFPEV.exe " instead of " WebFerret110.exe " because " WFPEV.exe " is the " PRO " version , which does boolean searches , allows deletes , and has several other " nessesary " features .
Get it as soon as you can , because it has already expired and will probably be removed from the server as soon as someone notices it 's still taking up space .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT DO THESE PROGRAMS DO ?
--------------------------
These are very compact " search engines " which live on your hard drive .
You enter query strings , just like you would at any search engine , and these programs will search ALL of the search engines you select .
The results can be saved for future use , or used imediately if you choose .
For instance , using Web Ferret and Win95 as an example , you would go to " find " on your " start " menu , click " web pages " to start the program , type in " Fravia " and " cracking " as the items to search for , then click " find " , and you 'll get a listing containing every web page listed on the search engines that contain the text " Fravia " and " cracking " .
Point your mouse at any listing , and you 'll see the begining text from that web page , click on a listing to open your browser and load the web page .
The boolean feature in the Pro version is especialy helpful .
You can search for " cars AND trucks [ but ] NOT convertibles " , as stated by the company .
Features like these can be real handy when searching for a certain file , web - site , E- mail address , or IRC channel .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?
-------------------
Cash flow , or boredom , depending on WHY you reverse .
These programs are VERY reasonably priced , and worth the investment !
It was the sales tactics which drew my attention to these programs , and the encryption technique which drew my interest .
When you install these programs , you enter your name and company , then click the " next " button , and enter your serial number and registration " key " , or just leave these two feilds blank to take the program for a test drive .
After installation , you 'll want to run the program , of course .
It is then that you will discover the sales tactics .
A banner will continualy display adds , on YOUR monitor !
This can NOT be tolerated !
The " view " menu has an " option " to turn OFF advertising , but this option has been disabled , until you register the program .
They could have lost a sale because the time I WOULD have spent earning money to pay for these programs HAD to be spent removing thier advertising instead .
How do they expect me to test drive thier product with those awful banners constantly distracting me ?
Even though we 've got the program installed on our hard drives , the original install program is nessesary to register the program , so do n't delete it yet .
Let 's fix these programs so we can test them without all of those distractions !
The Web Ferret Pro is totaly different from all of the other programs listed above , so I 'll cover it a bit later in this essay , but here is what you 'll need to fix ALL of the other programs .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though we will NOT be going into the encryption scheme used in this program in this essay , I urge you to study it .
It wont be nessesary for cracking these programs , but the author has done a very fine job of encrypting things , and deserves honors for his style and technique .
Unfortunately , he forgot that , no matter how well he encrypts his passwords , it MUST always boil down to a simple " go here , or go there " instruction in the end .
For those of you who are too lazy to study , I 'll give you a short description of how this encryption scheme is implimented .
For those of you who DO study this , be VERY careful , one slight miscalculation will crash your computer !
You should become very familiar with the " hboot " command inside Soft - Ice .
Even minimizing the loader screen to the taskbar will lock up your computer .
The serial number must contain five digits for reasons I 'll explain later , and the " key " number must contain nine digits to activate the " next " button , which is deactivated as soon as you enter the first digit of the serial number .
After you 've typed in your serial number and registration key number , locate them , and set BPR's on them inside Soft - Ice .
Then click on the " next " button .
You 'll break into the protection scheme at CS:004026 D4 .
The " key " that you typed in , as you 'll learn , is the " key " to unlocking the program .
The serial number is only used to set a counter .
The " key " value does it 's usual trip through memory addresses until it finaly ends up on the stack .
The center digit has been removed , so now your " key " is a " handy " eight characters long , so it fits nicely into the registers .
After the string was shortened to eight characters , it was counted in the usual mannor by placing FFFFFFFF in ECX .
The result was inverted , as usual , to obtain the " decimal " byte count of " 8 " , but it was also saved , uninverted as FFFFFFF8 , to crash your computer !
At this point , we find another key already waiting for us at DS:0041C540 .
This second key is 12h bytes long , and is comprised in three parts , using the starting values : " 12345678 " " 23456789 " and " 34567890 "
To make a long story short , these three groups of eight numbers are sent to war against the " key " value you typed in , AND against the other " eight number " groups .
It 's like a war between four countrys , with EACH country fighting the other three countrys .
They are beat against each other in just about every way imaginable until nothing is left but a mangled , un-recognizable , eight character string of garbage .
From time to time , the 12h byte string is " refreshed " with the original numbers I 've listed above .
But the war continues .
And when the smoke has cleared , we can finaly do a few comparisons .
If you 've followed this through , you should find yourself at CS:0040EC3D .
Again , the author was very clever .
Every time you THINK EAX should be set to " 01 " , it should be a " 00 " , and vise versa .
Keep this in mind , because , as I mentioned earlier , we 're set up to crash !
Any time you choose the " wrong " path to take after a CMP or TEST instruction , the program will find its way back to that FFFFFFF8 monster , and use it to crash your system .
So choose wisely .
Remember that you 've entered bad data , so if the program " wants " to go one way , it probably " should " go the other way instead .
Also remember , thats NOT always true !
But , alas , we 've made it to the check point .
Lamers can just set your breakpoints to the following addresses .
Lamers are lamers because they miss all of the fun stuff , YOU decide who you are !
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st check : ; [ ESP+0C ] holds the ; encrypted value of ; your input " key " :0040EC3D 8B44242C mov eax , dword ptr [ esp+2C ] ; the GOOD number :0040EC41 83C40C add esp , 0000000C :0040EC44 3944240C cmp dword ptr [ esp+0C ] , eax ; the first " test " :0040 EC48 7525 jne 0040EC6 F ; a bad place to go !
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here , the GOOD value is stored at [ ESP+ 2C ] .
Then it 's MOVed to EAX to be CoMPared to the encrypted value of the " key " you typed in , which is stored at [ ESP+0C ] .
Assuming EAX is " 59 42 55 f8 " and [ ESP+0C ] is " 22 47 39 23 " , you might encounter a slight " problem " when you arrive at the JNE instruction .
To repair this " problem " when the two numbers do NOT match , simply edit memory in Soft - Ice , as follows : d esp+0 c yet !
We still have a couple of checks left , and FFFFFFF8 is sitting on the stack just WAITING for us to make a mistake so it can crash our computers !
If you decided to " repair " the JMP instruction above , instead of entering the proper data , you 'll learn just how effective that FFFFFFF8 monster can be , when you have to re-start your computer .
Wander through the code just a while longer , and eventualy you 'll come across the next check .
Again , the lamers can just set thier breakpoints here , but they 'll miss the full beauty of the authors protection scheme .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2nd check : :0040E92 F 8B8D70 FFFFFF mov ecx , dword ptr [ ebp+ FFFFFF70 ] ; the GOOD number :0040E935 3B01 cmp eax , dword ptr [ ecx ] ; the 2nd " test " :0040E937 0F850E000000 jne 0040E94B ; a BAD place
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we find another instance of the encrypted version of the " key " you entered being CoMPared to a " good " number .
You might notice that both of these numbers are quite different from the numbers you used to fix that last " problem " we had .
The repair technique is the same though .
Simply copy the value you find at ECX into EAX .
Please note that ECX holds the ADDRESS of the proper number , NOT the proper number itself !
So DO NOT copy the ADDRESS into eax , and DO NOT try to " repair " the JMP instruction , or the FFFFFFF8 monster will get you !
There is one more check that must be made , but if you typed in a five digit serial number like I told you to , feel free to hit " F5 " or at any time now .
Your program will be fully registered .
When the program is registered , it will write a 398 byte ( 18 Eh ) " lic " key into your registry , and any disabled functions and menu items will be enabled .
For those of you who typed in more than five digits , follow the code a bit further .
The program will simply count the number of digits you entered , then use the result of the count to check some strings in memory .
So if you entered seven digits , it will look for seven strings .
The problem here is that there are only FIVE strings in memory to be checked .
And the FFFFFFF8 monster is STILL waiting !
You can fix this problem by fixing the count when the result is placed in EAX .
Simply change the value to " 5 " , then quit Soft - Ice and your program will be fully registered .
These techniques will fully register ALL of the FerretSoft programs except for the Web Ferrets .
Web Ferret is a " crippled " version of the Web Ferret Pro program , which is offered just to get you interested in the product , so you 'll break down and " pay " for the " real " program .
Web Ferret Pro is NOT offered in any form as a demo .
Fortunately for us , FerretSoft left an evaluation copy on thier ftp server for us to play with .
Since it 's an evaluation copy , we 'll need to treat it just a bit differently .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT ABOUT THAT MONSTER ?
------------------------
If ANY of the " checks " fail , ( and there are MANY more than I 've mentioned here ) , the program begins encrypting data against the 12h byte string .
Each pass through the encryption process will decrement the FFFFFFF8 monster by " 1 " , so you " could " go through the encryption process 4,294,967,288 times , theoreticaly !
Of course , this would never happen because each pass is directed towards a different byte in memory , so eventualy you encounter a " Memory Out Of Range " error message .
With Soft - Ice running , you 'll never get back into the program to see that message though .
And , as I mentioned earlier , even minimizing the Loader window used to load the program will cause a crash .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEB FERRET PRO
--------------
Now let 's install the Web Ferret Pro program .
This program has a time lock when we try to install it .
All we get is an error message informing us that the trial period is over .
Later , when we get to run this program , we 'll see that it expired December 31st , 1997 .
We can " fix " that though .
So lets get to work !
STEP 1 ------
In Soft - Ice , set a BPX on GetLocalTime .
Then start the " WFPEV.EXE " program .
When Soft - Ice breaks , you 'll be at the first line of the GetLocalTime function .
Press " F12 " to return to the WFPEV code , ( read the title on the line that runs across your screen inside Soft - Ice . )
Trace through the code about fifteen steps until you find the following line of code : :00413716 0594F8 FFFF
ADD EAX , FFFFF894
As soon as this instruction has executed , change EAX to " 0 " with the instruction : r eax=0 Then let the installation run its course .
The program will install , but as soon as you try to run it , you 'll get the same " expired " error message .
If you cancelled your breakpoint , re-set it .
If you did not cancel it , you should already be where you need to be .
We 're just going to do that last " fix " all over again , except this time we 'll need to make it a permanent repair using a hex editor .
When Soft - Ice breaks at GetLocalTime , just press " F12 " again , to return to the WFPEV code , then trace about fifteen instructions again , and you should see : :004BD162 0594F8 FFFF
ADD EAX , FFFFF894
Which we need to change to : :004BD162 B800000000 mov eax , 00000000
This will ALWAYS tell the program that this is the first time you have ever used it .
Be sure to write down the hex bytes of the instructions around this instruction .
You will need them to locate this spot in your hex editor when we make these changes permanent .
STEP 2 ------
This step is strictly cosmetic .
You can skip it if you 're in a hurry and do n't care what your menu looks like .
Because this is an " evaluation " copy , they did n't bother to put in all that code it takes to enable or disable a menu item .
They also left out the code needed to make the function work , in case " WE " got a copy of the program .
What function ?
The one to turn off the advertising , of course !
They just tossed in a few lines of code to make sure the adds would ALWAYS run .
So skip these steps if you like to see advertisments , too !
To enable the menu item " advertisment " on the " view " menu , set a breakpoint on " EnableMenuItem " .
When Soft - Ice breaks , use " F12 " again until you return to the WFPEV code .
Then , back - trace through the code until you reach this line of code : :0048DD7A 6A00 push 00000000
A World Without Chocolate ?
Some scientists say chocolate could become as rare and expensive as caviar .
Feb. 14 , 2008  --
It 's hard to imagine Valentine 's Day without chocolate , but some scientists say that it 's possible that chocolate could one day be in short supply .
What would the world be like without this decadent , delectable and divine dessert ?
Watch the story today on Planet Green 's " Focus Earth " with Bob Woodruff .
Historians say the Aztecs discovered chocolate more than 3,100 years ago and it was revered to the point of worship .
Cocoa beans were linked to the feathered serpent god of agriculture and creation called Quetzalcoatl .
If you believe the myth , Quetzalcoatl descended from the heavens on the beam of a morning star , carrying a cocoa tree stolen from paradise .
In its early form , chocolate was consumed as a celebratory beer - like beverage described as foamy and reddish and flavored with chilli water , aromatic flowers , vanilla and wild bee honey .
It was also food fit for an army .
Legend has it that French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte carried chocolate morsels on his military campaigns in the 19th century , eating it to conserve energy .
Scientists say that now it is chocolate 's sustainability that needs to be monitored .
The Ghana - based Nature Conservation Research Center warns that chocolate may become as rare and expensive as caviar within 20 years .
A number of factors , including climate change , are affecting the farming and production of cacao , or the cocoa plant .
Howard Shapiro , global director for plant science and external research for confectionery manufacturing Mars Inc. of McLean , Va. , said measures must be taken soon to prevent shortages of chocolate .
" If nothing was done , and the temperature was to rise , and the rainfalls were to change and drought became more prevalent ... without looking into new farming practices , then there should be a problem , and there might likely be a problem , " he said .
Cacao grows in rainforest conditions with high biodiversity .
David Croft , the British chocolate company Cadbury 's conformance and sustainability director , said , " cocoa is n't a traditional farmed crop .
If you go to West Africa , it 's cocoa trees underneath forest canopy or underneath a canopy of shade trees .
So it 's important we help to maintain that natural eco-system if we want cocoa to thrive and to flourish . "
Preserving ' the World's Favorite Treat '
Because there is a huge global demand for chocolate , farmers are now being forced to clear the forest and use hybrid seeds to produce higher output in a shorter amount of time .
There are consequences to this kind of farming .
One of them is soil erosion and a shorter lifespan for the cacao trees .
When the trees die and the land is infertile , farmers move onto another patch , clearing forests and adding to the already existing problem of deforestation .
There 's also the issue of disease .
As with any other crop , pests are a problem .
They can spoil and devastate entire cacao growing regions .
Eventually , if all the aforementioned challenges are not met , they will lead to an overall shortage of cacao and , thus , chocolate , experts say .
But for all you chocoholics , before you go and hoard all those candy bars , top chocolate companies like Mars and Cadbury are doing something about it .
The companies are training farmers in sustainable cacao cultivation and working with scientists to map the genome of the cocoa bean , which could help battle crop disease and perhaps even improve flavor .
" I am quite optimistic with the ongoing activities , the genome , farmer training , understanding the problems , that we believe the plants will survive and thrive in the future using the techniques that we know and we can bear on the production of this wonderful crop , " Shapiro said .
Similar efforts are being employed at Cadbury .
" In the last two years , Cadburys has really upped the game , to create more sustainable chocolate , cocoa supply chains particularly , " Croft said .
" We 're managing all the factors reasonably well at the moment and there 's a lot of anticipatory work going on , looking at cocoa trees that are more temperature tolerant , looking at cocoa trees that are more saline tolerant so that as climate change begins to impact them , we have crops that will work through that change . "
In 20 years , he said , chocolate " will still be the world 's favorite treat . "
Unable to nurse for itself , this little Ring - tailed Lemur is being hand raised by zoo keepers at the Franklin Park Zoo .
Just like a human baby , the little guy requires around the clock care , but the staff at the zoo have experience with sleepless nights and the lemur has been growing steadily since its birth on February 18th ( the sex is still unknown ) .
Franklin Park
Zoo celebrates the birth of a ring - tailed lemur
The baby is being hand - reared behind the scenes by Zoo staff
Boston , Mass . ; April 3 , 2009 – Since the birth of ring - tailed lemur on February 18 , the staff at Franklin Park Zoo ’s Tropical Forest has been busy with an around - the - clock feeding schedule to care for the baby .
The lemur is being hand - raised behind the scenes because it was unable to nurse from its mother Lulu .
Zoo New England ’s animal care and veterinary staff prefer to have baby animals raised by their mothers , as they would be in the wild , but because the baby was unable to nurse hand - rearing was the best option for its survival .
“ Our staff is skillfully hand - raising the baby lemur for at least the first four months of its life .
The baby requires an extraordinary amount of time , care and attention , ” said John Linehan , Zoo New England President and CEO .
“ We are hopeful that this baby will continue to thrive and that guests will soon be able to delight in this new addition when they visit the Tropical Forest . ”
Franklin Park
Zoo has six lemurs in its animal collection , including the new baby .
The adults – Emily , Lulu , Nebuchadrezzer and Tango ( the baby ’s father ) – are all exhibited in the Tropical Forest , along with Maki , who was born on April 25 , 2008 .
Like the new baby , Maki , the first offspring of Lulu and Tango , was also hand - reared by zoo staff because he was unable to nurse from his mother .
Maki is a true success story at the Zoo as he was successfully reintroduced to the lemur group .
ZNE participates in the Ring - tailed Lemur Species Survival Plan ( SSP ) , which is a cooperative , inter - zoo program coordinated nationally through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums .
SSPs are designed to maintain a genetically diverse and demographically stable captive population .
Ring - tailed lemurs are listed as a vulnerable species with numbers ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 in their native Madagascar .
These small primates are one of 22 species of lemurs , all of which share a common ancestry with Africa ’s apes and monkeys .
ZNE has exhibited lemurs since the 1970s .
Lemurs are noted for their wide - round eyes and their white and black , long banded tails .
These animals , which are active during the day , inhabit dry brush , scrublands and closed canopy forests .
If the Segway 's current movement mechanism and cast of characters astride them was n't keeping you up at night , the Cajun Crawler should seal the deal .
Based on the work of kinetic sculptor Theo Jansen , the Cajun Crawler holds up a Segway - style platform with a scary collection of steampunk - like mechanical legs , which can scurry across a floor with surprising agility .
The project was built by a team of folks at the University of Louisiana , who do not know the meaning of fear .

After losing her job as a dispatcher for buying her cancer - ridden aunt marijuana , Laura Llanes says she would do it again .
She was stunned , nevertheless , when she was fired from CenCom E - 9 - 11 last week after admitting she bought the pot to help relieve her aunt 's suffering through breast cancer and chemotherapy .
Marijuana for medicinal purposes is legal with a prescription in 13 states ; Illinois is not one of them .
Llanes , 28 , of Lake Villa , remains adamant that she did the right thing , saying her biggest mistake was telling a few co-workers what she had done .
" They ratted me out , " she said .
Her aunt , who lives in Aurora , was " sick constantly , not eating , not having an appetite .
She is diabetic .
She has to eat .
She was whittling away to nothing , " said Llanes .
" I thought , ' I will get her some marijuana so it would get her to eat , ' " she said .
" It worked .
She did get the munchies . "
Llanes has not been charged with a crime , but when confronted by her supervisor , she admitted she had bought pot and was promptly fired Wednesday .
" All that mattered was that I admitted to committing an illegal act , " she said .
A bill introduced in the Illinois legislature calls for allowing the medicinal use of marijuana in a three - year test program .
Critics oppose the legislation because of concerns about potential abuse and enforcement .

Advertisement Hit British film Slumdog Millionaire has won the top prize at the Academy Awards , winning eight Oscars including best director and best picture .
In a great night for Britain , Kate Winslet won the best actress Oscar for The Reader , finally clinching the award on her sixth nomination .
The big surprise of the night was Sean Penn , winning best actor for his role as gay rights activist Harvey Milk .
Heath Ledger won a posthumous Oscar for supporting actor for The Dark Knight .
The actor 's family received the award on behalf of Ledger , who died in January 2008 .
" We have been truly overwhelmed by the honour and respect being bestowed upon him with this award , " his mother said .
Ledger becomes only the second performer to win a posthumous Oscar , following Peter Finch 's win for Network in 1977 .
But the night belonged to Slumdog Millionaire , the rags - to - riches tale that has enchanted audiences around the world .
Director Danny Boyle , 52 , bounced up and down in delight as he received his award , telling the audience : " I swore [ to my children ] if this miracle ever happened I would receive it in the spirit of Tigger . "
Optimism Winslet was presented her Oscar by five previous best actress winners
The film , set in the slums of Mumbai ( Bombay ) , won eight awards in total , including gongs for best adapted screenplay , cinematography , sound mixing , film editing , best original score and best song .
" There are certain places in the universe you never imagine standing .
For me , it 's the moon , the South Pole , the Miss World podium and here , " joked British screenwriter Simon Beaufoy , previously best known for writing The Full Monty .
Indian composer AR Rahman , who received two Oscars - for best song and best score - praised the city which inspired the book , and subsequently the film .
He hailed " all the people from Mumbai and the essence of the film , which is about optimism and the power of hope and our lives " .
" We had passion and we had belief and if you have those two things , truly , anything is possible , " said Christian Colson .
As anticipated - after years of waiting in the wings - Winslet , 33 , won her Academy Award for playing a Nazi prison officer in The Reader .
" I 'd be lying if I had n't made a version of this speech .
I think I was probably eight years old and staring into the bathroom mirror , " she said .
" I feel very fortunate to have made it all the way from there to here . "
In a night of predictable outcomes , Sean Penn 's best actor triumph for his portrayal of gay rights activist Harvey Milk seemed to win the A - list audience 's approval .
AWARDS TALLY Slumdog Millionaire - 8 The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - 3 Milk - 2 The Dark Knight - 2
" You Commie , homo - loving , sons of a gun , " said Penn , addressing his fellow performers .
" I did not expect this , and I want to be very clear that I know how hard I make it to appreciate me , " said the 48 - year - old , who often attracts criticism for his outspoken views .
In an impassioned plea - and to rapturous applause - Penn called on " equal rights for everyone " .
" I think it is a good time for those who voted for the ban against gay marriage to sit and reflect and anticipate their great shame , " he said .

People do pay attention to their dreams .
More so in countries like South Korea and India , but here in the U.S. , too .
They are perceived as being far more meaningful than consciously imagining an event , or even expert advice .
Details of a study on how seriously people take their dreams were reported in this month ’s issue of the APA Monitor on Psychology .
The article was based on a study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , another publication of the American Psychological Association .
Researchers found that in the U.S. , 56 percent believe dreams reveal hidden truths .
That climbs to 65 percent in South Korea and 74 percent in India .
But more interesting was the conclusion that dreams influence decision making .
They asked 182 commuters in Boston which would be more likely to change their air travel plans : a government warning about a possible terrorist attack ; finding out that a plane crash occurred on their regular route ; consciously imagining a crash ; or dreaming about a plane crash .
Most respondents said the dream would just as unsettling as hearing about a real crash , and have a bigger impact than a government warning .
Perhaps even more interesting is that 68 percent of people participating in another study believe that dreams predict the future .
But one of the researchers , Carey Morewedge , PhD , at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , thinks that ’s a result of self - fulfilling prophecy .
I do n’t find it terribly surprising that people view their own dreams through selective lenses .
For example , a group was asked about God speaking to them in a dream .
They were more likely to take it to heart if God suggested that they travel the earth ; far less likely if they were told to go work in a leper colony .

I had a silly idea tonight that for a game like Super Mario Bros .
where the scrolling follows the player , and the player is usually in the center of the screen , collecting a single column of the screen per frame and combining them horizontally would produce a sort of timelapse image where the player would be seen as a blurred stripe moving through the scenery , which would be stretched or squashed according to the player 's speed .
I think I 've seen something like this before , but in this era of information overload and the futility of trying to find anything in Google , I figured I 'd just go ahead and hack it into my emulator rather than searching for prior art .
Here 's an example from Super Mario 3 : It 's a bit rough ( and that 's one of the better portions ) , but you can see the path of Mario hopping from point to point .
I tried this with several games : Super Mario Bros. 1 Duck Tales , and Life Force .
In the latter case the game scrolls at a fixed rate , so you get a sort of shabby automap .

Do you drink raw milk ?
Unless you milk your own cow , the answer is probably no since the sale of raw milk is illegal in about half of the United States .
Consumption of raw milk is legal in all 50 states , but current federal regulation prohibits interstate commerce of raw milk and raw milk products for human consumption .
Ron Paul would like to change that law .
U.S. Congressman Ron Paul has introduced H.R. 778 which would “ authorize the interstate traffic of unpasteurized milk and milk products that are packaged for direct human consumption . ”
According to the Organic Consumers Association :
The bill would not force a state to legalize the sale of raw milk from local producers , nor would it force a state to allow the sale of raw milk from out - of - state producers in its retail stores .
The bill would , however , enable consumers to enter into transactions to obtain raw milk and raw milk products from other states without the transactions being in violation of federal law .
The current regulation banning raw milk sales 21 CFR 1240.61 states :
… no person shall cause to be delivered into interstate commerce or shall sell , otherwise distribute , or hold for sale or other distribution after shipment in interstate commerce any milk or milk product in final package form for direct human consumption unless the product has been pasteurized ….
The only legal milk to be sold across state lines is pasteurized .
Pasteurization kills disease causing germs and prevents souring by keeping milk at a temperature of 145 degrees F for at least half an hour , then reducing the temperature to no more than 55 degrees F. According to “ Raw Milk Vs. Pasteurized Milk ” published in a British Medical Journal in 1938 :
It is undoubtedly beneficial to destroy dangerous germs , but pasteurization does more than this - it kills off harmless and useful germs alike , and by subjecting the milk to high temperatures , destroys some nutritious constituents …
But , after pasteurization , the lactic acid bacilli are killed .
The milk , in consequence , cannot become sour and quickly decomposes , while undesirable germs multiply very quickly …
Besides destroying part of the vitamin C contained in raw milk and encouraging growth of harmful bacteria , pasteurization turns the sugar of milk , known as lactose , into beta - lactose — which is far more soluble and therefore more rapidly absorbed in the system , with the result that the child soon becomes hungry again .
Probably pasteurization ’s worst offence is that it makes insoluable the major part of the calcium contained in raw milk .
This frequently leads to rickets , bad teeth , and nervous troubles , for sufficient calcium content is vital to children ; and with the loss of phosphorus also associated with calcium , bone and breain formation suffer serious setbacks .
Pasteurization also destroys 20 percent of the iodine present in raw milk , causes constipation and generally takes from the milk its most vital qualities .
Of course , there are critics that suggest raw milk is not beneficial and milk borne illnesses are on the rise .
Ron Paul ’s response :
My office has heard from numerous people who would like to obtain unpasteurized milk .
Many of these people have done their own research and come to the conclusion that unpasteurized milk is healthier than pasteurized milk .
Americans have the right to consume these products without having the Federal Government second - guess their judgment about what products best promote health .
If there are legitimate concerns about the safety of unpasteurized milk , those concerns should be addressed at the state and local level .
H.R. 778 has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce .
You can read the full text of the legislation that would allow the interstate commerce of raw milk .
Personally , I would not want to buy raw dairy products from an out of state farmer because of transportation costs and concerns about freshness .
Whether you believe raw milk is healthier or not , at the heart of the issue is US constitutional law that allows Congress to regulate interstate traffic ( Art. I , section 8 , Clause 1 ) , but such commerce should not be impeded .
Do we really need to regulate the sale of raw milk across state borders when consumers can seek it out locally ?

I ’m sure everyone has his own favorite go - to lasagna recipe , but I ’d just like to offer that this really is The Best Lasagna Ever .
Growing up , my mom and her friends used to make it for potlucks and gatherings , and part of its appeal is that the ingredients used are totally basic ; you do n’t have to hunt down fresh basil or buffalo mozzarella or Parmigiano - Reggiano or handmade sausage from an Italian mama in old Napoli .
Anyone can make this , anywhere , anytime .
And it ’s the easiest thing in the world .
Aside from the simplicity and availability of ingredients , however , this lasagna is just dadgum good .
I ’ve made this lasagna for various categories of humans since my mom first scribbled it down for me : men , women , democrats , republicans , scholars , and foreign dignitaries .
I even donated two pans to a charity auction once .
The overwhelming consensus has always been that it ’s " The Best Lasagna Ever , " which is precisely what I ’ve been trying to tell you turkeys .
So let ’s get started !
The Cast of Characters .
See how , um , basic everything is ?
The recipe even calls for KRAFT Parmesan Cheese , of all things .
Are you ready ?
Here we go …
In a skillet , combine 1 1 / 2 pounds ground beef , 1 pound hot breakfast sausage , and 2 cloves minced garlic .
Cook until brown .
Then …
You might consider draining off about half the fat .
I like to leave some in there , though , because it tastes better and because I ’m a naughty girl .
Just please do n’t be a health nut and drain it all , for pete ’s sake .
After that , add two 14.5 - oz cans of whole tomatoes , two 6 - oz cans of tomato paste …
2 tablespoons of dried parsley flakes , 2 tablespoons dried basil …
And 1 teaspoon salt .
Mix together thoroughly and simmer , uncovered , about 45 minutes …
Stirring occasionally .
In the meantime , boil a 10 - oz package of lasagna noodles .
Add 1/2 teaspoon salt to the water , as well as 1 tablespoon olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking .
Cook the noodles " al dente " so they ’ll still have quite a bite to them .
When they ’re finished cooking , drain , rinse with cool water , and lay the noodles flat on a sheet of aluminum foil .
That way , they ’ll be easier to handle later .
While the meat mixture and noodles are cooking , mix 3 cups lowfat cottage cheese in a bowl with 2 beaten eggs .
IMPORTANT : If the thought of cottage cheese makes you want to run out of the house , take heart : you wo n’t even know it ’s there .
Ladd would n’t touch cottage cheese with a ten foot pole , yet he loved this lasagna so much …he married me .
To the cottage cheese , add 1/2 cup Kraft Parmesan Cheese …
2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes , and 1 teaspoon salt .
Mix together well .
Now , go ahead and build your assembly line : meat mixture , 1 pound sliced mozzarella cheese , cottage cheese mixture , and cooked lasagna noodles .
Let the assembly begin !
Lay four cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of the pan , overlapping as you go .
Spread half of the cottage cheese mixture evenly over the noodles …
Then lay 1/2 pound of mozzarella cheese slices on top of the cottage cheese mixture .
This particular brand of cheese was cut very thin , so I had to double up the slices to make 1/2 pound .
Do n’t let this throw you off — some brands are cut thicker , and would only require a single layer of slices .
NOTE : I prefer sliced mozzarella , but you can certainly use grated mozzarella if necessary .
With the spoon , make a line through the middle of the meat mixture so you ’ll distribute it evenly .
Spread a little less than half of the meat mixture over the mozzarella cheese slices …
Until it ’s evenly distributed .
Now it ’s time to repeat the process !
Add another layer of four lasagna noodles …
And top with the remaining half of the cottage cheese mixture .
Then top the cottage cheese mixture with another 1/2 pound of mozzarella .
And finish with the rest of the meat mixture .
Spread evenly .
Now grab that trusty - rusty container of good ol ’ Kraft Parmesan Cheese and start sprinklin’ !
Top with a pretty generous layer .
Now pop it in a 350 - degree oven for 20 - 30 minutes , until hot and bubbly .
( Alternately , you could cover and freeze it , unbaked , at this point .
OR cover and refrigerate , unbaked , for up to two days before baking . )

The recording industry has been stridently preparing for victory in their battle to double the term of sound copyright in the EU .
But their campaign has hit an unexpected hitch -- individual governments among the EU member states think their demands overstep the mark .
The Committee of Permanent Representatives , or COREPER , is a closed meeting of senior officials from European Union member countries .
Part of its job is to negotiate a consensus before votes are taken by senior politicians from each state at the Council of Ministers ( the Council of Ministers is the voice of the national state at the EU ; it shares power with the EU's own executive , the Commission , and the European Parliament ) .
The last COREPER meeting showed that for copyright term extension , there is no such consensus .
According to reports , at least eleven countries ' representatives voted against the proposal to extend sound copyright in the EU .
That 's enough to block the Copyright Term Extension Directive in the Council of Ministers .
The music industry is outraged .
In the face of widespread economic and political opposition , they 've successfully bulldozed copyright extension past the Commission and European Parliament to get this far .
Lack of a clear majority at this stage demands they indulge in an unseemly scramble across Europe for the support of individual governments .
Oddly , their fury at the vote was primarily reserved for the UK government .
The UK has been broadly supportive ( against its own expert advice ) for a 70 year extension , but finally balked at the 95 year period proposed by the European Commission .
It was also uncomfortable with the ongoing attempts by industry lobbyists to kill a connected retirement fund for future musicians .
UK music groups are now pressuring on the UK " to match its supportive rhetoric with concrete action , by moving heaven and earth to reach an agreement . "
But the recording industry will need to move more than just heaven , earth , and the British .
Sweden , Denmark , Italy , Belgium , Malta , Netherlands , Finland , Austria , Slovakia , Slovenia and Romania all voted the proposal down -- and at least one of those countries will have to change its mind for the directive to continue .
If you 're a European citizen , now is the time to call on your national government 's department responsible for IP policy ( you can find a contact list here ) to encourage it to join the opposition against term extension or steady its current no vote in the Council of Ministers .
You can also follow the Sound Copyright guide to lobbying your MEP .
If the directive overcomes this latest hurdle , only a vote in the European Parliament will stop it from becoming EU law .
Australia will examine its free trade deal with the United States to see if Washington is flouting its obligations under the pact if it adopts a " Buy American " clause for new stimulus projects .
America 's key trading partners , including Australia , are alarmed at the clause , which seeks to ban the use of foreign steel and iron in major US infrastructure projects .
Australia stands to lose $ 500 million in steel exports to the United States if the Congress adopts the measure , part of the $ US819 billion ( $ A1.26 trillion ) financial stimulus package .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is warning a reversion to protectionism is a " spear at the heart " of the Australian economy because so many jobs are generated by export markets .
US President Barack Obama has been talking down the " Buy American " push , warning it would be inappropriate to send a protectionist message in the current economic climate .
KenKen , which starts in The New York Times today next to the crossword puzzle , is a new numerical logic puzzle from Japan .
The name means loosely “ cleverness squared . ”
KenKen shares some properties with sudoku .
Each is a pure logic challenge in which numbers are filled in the squares of a grid .
Unlike sudoku , though , in which the numbers act solely as symbols ( letters or pictures would work as well ) , KenKen requires arithmetic .
The rules are simple :
Fill the grid with digits so as not to repeat a digit within any row or column , and so the digits within each heavily outlined box ( called a cage ) go together using the arithmetic operation shown to make the target number indicated .
Two new KenKen puzzles will be presented in The Times each day from Monday through Saturday .
The first is a four - by - four - square puzzle that increases in difficulty from easy to medium as the week progresses .
The second is a six - by - six - square puzzle that goes from medium to hard .
BANGALORE : The second - biggest bank of the US , JP Morgan Chase , which acquired Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns recently , will increase its outsourcing to India by 25 % this year to nearly $ 400 million .
It will also manage the integration of the acquired companies from India to bring down the cost of integrating different information technology ( IT ) systems .
Right now , JP Morgan outsources $ 250-300 million worth of IT and back - office projects every year to Cognizant , TCS and Accenture , apart from to its own captive centre in Mumbai .
�� �JP Morgan CIO Guy Chiarello said last week that he will increase outsourcing to India , and will drive several integration projects from there , ��� a New York - based expert , familiar with JP Morgan���s outsourcing plans , told ET last week , on conditions of anonymity .
A spokeswoman for JP Morgan India could not reply to an email query sent by ET on Friday , and the bank���s spokesperson in the US too did not reply .
�� �JP Morgan is one of the first banks in the US to have fleshed out its outsourcing strategy ever since the banking meltdown happened .
Many others are still undecided about their IT spend , ��� said a senior official at one of the technology firms , who did not wish to be quoted .
The bank , which cancelled its $ 5 - billion outsourcing contract with IBM in 2004 ��� following the merger with Bank One ��� had brought back around 4,000 IT staff in - house after the new CIO Austin Adams had proposed a ���do - it - yourself��� strategy for the merged entity .��
�
In this economic environment , Mr Chiarello , the current CIO , wants to ensure that he helps JP Morgan meet cost - reduction goals , ��� the expert added .
With large global banks like Lloyds TSB and HBOS , and Bank of America & Merrill Lynch merging , India���s top tech firms , including Infosys , TCS and Cognizant , are bidding for at least three $ 100 million - plus contracts .
As these banks merge , they face a huge task of integrating their software applications , consolidating their data centres and other trading platforms into a single entity , so that their customers are able to transact without having to face any merger - related issues .
And since offshoring will help them save costs by 30 - 40 % , these merged banking entities are seeking to partner with a vendor having significant offshore presence .
�� �Apart from looking at cost - saving opportunities , such as offshore outsourcing , these banks also want to partner with their existing vendors because they would know the systems better , ��� said a consultant on condition of anonymity .
As reported by ET recently , Lloyds TSB ��� which merged with HBOS ��� is seeking partners to help the merged entity integrate its retail and wholesale banking systems through an IT platform .
The company has already outsourced its HR functions to Xansa two years ago , in a five - year deal .
In recent years , the pharmaceutical industry has been repeatedly ( and rightly ) excoriated for its shameless efforts to promote its products : Freebies handed out to doctors as inducements to prescribe particular drugs .
Studies underwritten by drug companies with financial interests in the outcome published in prestigious journals .
Lucrative consulting contracts given to National Institutes of Health scientists .
To name just a few .
You would think that in the face of all the unpleasant scrutiny -- books on the industry ’s “ deceit ” and “ greed , ” congressional investigations , lawsuits and even some criminal convictions -- drug makers would wake up , do some serious self - analysis , retool their outrageous marketing practices and try , as Pfizer Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler said last month , to “ earn the trust of patients and the public . ”
But this week , two New York Times stories suggested that , despite rhetoric to the contrary and a few tentative efforts at self - policing , the industry is still up to its old tricks .
On Wednesday , the Times reported that federal prosecutors and health officials are planning to crack down on illegal drug - company kickbacks to physicians .
As they should .
These payments line doctors ’ pockets while driving up the cost of care and doing nothing -- or worse -- for patients .
The second story chronicled the anger of Harvard Medical School students over professors who receive drug industry consulting and speaking fees .
About 1,600 of the school ’s professors and lecturers -- charged with molding the minds of aspiring doctors -- acknowledged that they or a relative had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching , research or clinical care ; 149 had ties to Pfizer , and 130 to Merck .
The industry must be brought under control .
But how ?
Its lobbyists are among the most powerful in Washington .
Its revenues , though battered , remain enormous .
Its voluntary measures have been largely symbolic or merely attempts to forestall tougher requirements imposed from outside .
Yes , Pfizer and Eli Lilly recently unveiled new disclosure rules , and yes , the industry has tightened its ban on trinkets , fancy meals and other gifts -- but these are only a start .
Outsiders must keep the pressure on .
An investigation by Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) has identified doctors who have failed to disclose large payments from drug firms .
The crackdown by prosecutors is also welcome .
In addition , the medical profession and academia need to wean themselves off inappropriate drug company money and ensure that their conflict - of - interest policies are loophole - free .
Inevitably , some drug money will still flow in , and Congress must make full disclosure mandatory .
The too - cozy ties between doctors and drug makers must end .
WASHINGTON , Feb .
21 - A unanimous Supreme Court decision on Tuesday gave a small religious sect the right to keep importing a hallucinogenic tea , central to its ritual observance , that the government wants to ban as a controlled substance under federal narcotics law .
With an opinion by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , the decision was one of the most significant applications of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , a 13 - year - old federal statute that requires the government to meet a demanding test before it can enforce a law in a way that creates a substantial obstacle to religious observance .
The government failed to carry its burden under the statute , Chief Justice Roberts said in an opinion that not only rejected the administration 's specific arguments but also dismantled its theory of the case .
The chief justice said the government 's " bold argument " that the Controlled Substances
Act , the basic federal narcotics law , " simply admits of no exceptions " could not be reconciled either with the religious freedom law or with administrative practice under the act itself .
For the past 35 years , he noted , the government has permitted American Indians to use peyote in their religious rituals despite the fact that peyote and its active ingredient , mescaline , are banned for general use under the Controlled Substances
Act and have been found by Congress to be dangerous substances with a high potential for abuse .
KAGUYA ( SELENE )
Successfully Captures Moving Images of the Earth
at the Time of a Penumbral Lunar Eclipse using HDTV
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation ( NHK ) successfully took moving images of the precise Earth rise moment when the Earth looked like a diamond ring using the onboard high definition camera ( HDTV ) of the lunar explorer " KAGUYA " ( SELENE ) on February 10 , 2009 ( Japan Standard Time , all the following dates and times are Japan Standard Time . )
The moment came when a penumbral lunar eclipse occurred and sunlight was covered by the Earth .
During that time , since the view of the Sun from the KAGUYA was mostly covered by the Earth , the KAGUYA observed that the Earth looked like a diamond ring .
This is the first time that this phenomenon was shot from the Moon .
The images were shot by the HDTV onboard the KAGUYA for space - use developing by NHK .
The moving images were received at JAXA and processed at NHK .
* A penumbral lunar eclipse is a phenomenon in which the Sun , Earth and Moon line up in tandem , hence the Moon is in the Earth 's penumbra , or , when you look from the Moon , the Sun is partially covered by the Earth ( partial eclipse . )
During this phenomenon , the volume of sunlight to the Moon decreases , and the Moon 's surface looks darker when you look at the Moon from the Earth .
The KAGUYA , which circles around the Moon on its polar orbit , can witness this phenomenon only twice a year at most , thus it was very valuable to capture the moving images of the phenomenon from the KAGUYA .

This still image was a cutout from the moving images taken by the onboard HDTV ( tele - camera ) of the KAGUYA ( SELENE ) on February 10 , 2009 .
The bright part on the lower right side is the Sun and the black area surrounded by the thin light ring is the Earth .
The red dotted line shows the Moon 's surface .
Most of the Sun is covered by the Earth and the Moon 's surface .
The KAGUYA captured the moving image of the Earth and the Sun gradually rising from the Moon 's surface .
The above sequence of images is a cutout from the moving image to show the rising process .
The image on the far left is just after the Earth rise from the Moon 's surface .
It took about 47 seconds to film from the left to the right when the Sun came out from the Moon 's surface and the diamond ring appeared .
In the past , motel families here were mainly drawn from the chronically struggling .
In 1998 , an exposé of neglected motel children by The Orange County Register prompted creation of city task forces and promises of help .
But in recent months , schools , churches and charities report a different sort of family showing up .
“ People asking for help are from a wider demographic range than we ’ve seen in the past , middle - income families , ” said Terry Lowe , director of community services in Anaheim , Calif .
The motels range from those with tattered rugs and residents who abuse alcohol and drugs to newer places with playgrounds and kitchenettes .
With names like the Covered Wagon Motel and the El Dorado Inn , they look like any other modestly priced stopover inland from the ritzy beach towns .
But walk inside and the perception immediately changes .
In the evening , the smell of pasta sauce cooked on hot plates drifts through half - open doors ; in the morning , children leave to catch school buses .
Families of three , six or more are squeezed into a room , one child doing homework on a bed , jostled by another watching television .
Children rotate at bedtime , taking their turns on the floor .
Some families , like the Malpicas , in a motel in Anaheim , commandeer a closet for baby cribs .

The Garza family moved to the Costa Mesa Inn in August , after the husband , Johnny , lost his job at Target , his wife , Tamara , lost her job at Petco , and they were evicted from their two - bedroom rental .
Their 9 - year - old daughter now shares a bed with two younger brothers , their toys and schoolbooks piled on the floor .
The couple ’s baby boy , born in April , sleeps in a small crib .
Rental aid from federal and county programs reaches only a small fraction of needy families , said Bob Cerince , coordinator for homeless and motel residents services in Anaheim , who estimated the families at more than 1,000 .
President Obama ’s stimulus package may give hope to more people and blunt the projected rise of families who could end up in motels and shelters , said Nan Roman , president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness in Washington .
The package allows $ 1.5 billion for homeless prevention , including help with rent and security deposits .
Schools have made special efforts to help children in displaced families stay in class , and some send social workers to connect families with counseling services and food aid .
Wendy Dallin , the liaison for the homeless in one of Anaheim ’s seven school districts , said that in the last three months she had learned of 38 newly homeless families , bringing the total she knew of in her district to 376 .
About 48 of those families are living in motels , Ms. Dallin said , with the rest in shelters , renting a room or garage , staying with relatives or living in cars .
At the same time , in California ’s budget crisis , some school social workers are being laid off .
Is Chicago leading the way for solar - powered EV charging stations ?
( PhysOrg.com ) --
One of the biggest arguments that some have made against plug - in electric vehicles is that they still promote the use of fossil fuels .
When you have to plug in a car for a charge , the electricity used to charge the battery often comes from a power plant that gets its energy from oil .
Chicago is hoping to change that as it becomes the first city to install an electric vehicle ( EV ) charging station powered with solar energy .
When you think of advances in making electric vehicles easier to use , you do not normally think of Chicago .
San Francisco or Portland often come to mine .
Both cities are working to install EV charging stations throughout the city in order to make " filling up " with electricity almost as convenient as filling up with gasoline .
But Chicago has gone one better .
Not only will Chicago provide EV charging stations , but the city will do so using renewable energy .
Solar power will be used to provide electricity , negating the need for fossil fuels altogether if you drive an electric vehicle in the Windy City .
There is a tree - like canopy that holds the solar panels .
These panels collect the sun 's light and facilitates the transformation into electric energy .
Storage of the electricity is underground .
The station was built by Carbon Day Automotive .
The company hopes that other cities will follow suit , allowing them to build solar - powered EV charging stations for other American cities .
For now , the City of Chicago is likely to be the biggest user of the EV station .
The city has a fleet of electric cars , and the charging station will be used daily to make sure that the cars have the electricity that they need .
It 's a great idea , and proof that innovation and technology can move us into a more sustainable future -- one that does n't require fossil fuels to keep us going .

epoll_wait ( ) の呼び出しは排他制御し、同時に一つのスレッドだけが実行できるようにします。そして読み込み可能なファイルディスクリプタを取り出したら、すぐにロックを解除します。そのスレッドはそのまま取り出したファイルディスクリプタからread(2)します。このとき既にロックは解除されているので、このスレッドがread(2)している間にも他のスレッドがepoll_wait() →read(2)を実行することができます。
ここではepollにファイルディスクリプタを登録するときに、EPOLLONESHOTフラグを設定しているところがポイントです。読み込み可能なファイルディスクリプタが取り出されると、そのファイルディスクリプタは再度有効化されるまでepoll_wait()で報告されません。このためread(2 ) がEAGAINになるまで完了していなくても、他のスレッドがすぐにepoll_wait( )
を実行することができます。
また、取り出されたファイルディスクリプタを再度有効化する操作（epoll_ctl()
でEPOLL_CTL_MODを指定）は、スレッドセーフであるようです。つまりread(2) がEAGAINになったら、ロックを取得せずに再有効化する操作を行うことができます（図中の「reactivate」）。
以上の手順によって複数のコネクションを高い並列性で扱うことができます。
さらに、ここにタスクキュー+スレッドプールの機能を統合することができます。
epoll_wait ( ) するときにタスクキューをチェックし、タスクが入っているようならそれを取り出して実行します。このときの方針として以下の方法が考えられます：
epoll_wait ( ) が実行されていなかったら、タスクキューをチェックせずにepoll_wait( ) →read( 2)を実行する
必ずタスクキューにタスクをチェックし、タスク処理を優先して処理する
タスクキューに溜まっているタスクがN個以下であればepoll_wait()
→read(2)を優先するが、そうでなければタスク処理を優先する（N個以上のタスクが溜まらないようにする）
mp::wavyでは３つ目の方針を採用しています。この部分の処理に関しては、タスクキューの実装を優先順位付きキューにするなどの発展が考えられます。
これでイベント駆動型のアーキテクチャは簡単に実装できるようになりました。read(2)して取り出されたメッセージが、処理に時間のかかりそうなものであればタスクキューにpushし、そうでなければそのまま実行します。（時間のかからないメッセージだと処理にかかる時間全体に対して、スレッドの切り替えに発生する遅延の割合が大きくなってしまうため）
ここで、read(2)をしている間やLogicを実行している間も他のスレッドが並列して処理し続けられることから、read(2)をブロッキングIOで行うこともできます。
イベント駆動型のアーキテクチャでは、イベントを処理し終わるたびに状態を変数に保存しておく必要があります。そのため一連の処理が終了するまでに複数のイベントが絡む場合は、状態を保持する変数が増えてプログラムがややこしくなる傾向にあります。あるいはメッセージ指向ではなくストリーム指向のプロトコルの場合は、ストリームをイベント単位に区切って扱わなければならいため大変です。*1
そのような場合は無理にイベント駆動にせず、上の図のようにスレッドを１本占有して処理した方がうまくいくと思われます。
しかしスレッドを占有してしまうと、スレッドの数より多い数のリクエストが同時に到着したときに、スレッドの数が足りないため並列して処理できない可能性があります。スレッドを占有して行っている処理がCPUを使うものであればしょうがないですが、read(2)を待っているのであれば、この待ち時間の間に別のイベントを処理したいところです。スレッドの数を十分増やせば済むことですが、あまり多くしたくない、かもしれません。
そこで、スレッドを占有する代わりにFiber（coroutine , 協調スレッド）を占有する方法が考えられます。※Win32以外の環境ではfiberはスレッド固有だという情報。この方法はダメそうです（コメント欄参照）
メッセージ指向のプロトコルであれば、上の図のようにread(2)して取り出されたメッセージがどのFiberに関するものなのかを探します。もし見つかればそのFiberの処理を再開し、見つからなければ新たなFiberを作ります。Fiberを処理している間もread(2)は並列して行われるため、パイプライン化されたメッセージは並列して処理することができます。
ストリーム指向のプロトコルであれば、下の図のようにファイルディスクリプタをキーとしてFiberを探します。
以上のアーキテクチャではwrite(2)（送信側）に関しては触れてきませんでした。ソケットへのwrite(2)は別のモジュールに分けて扱います。
LogicやFiberの中でソケットへデータを送信したいとき、ブロックしてしまうとスレッドを占有してしまうため並列性が低下する可能性があります。これを避けるため送信用の別のスレッドにデータを受け渡します。
このとき、writev(2)システムコール１回で書き込みきれなかった場合や、既に書き込みきれなかったデータが溜まっている場合のみ、別のスレッドにデータを受け渡します。データが小さくwritev(2)システムコール１回で書き込み切れた場合は受け渡しません（スレッドの切り替えによる遅延を避けるため。また多少時間がかかっても他のスレッドには影響しないこともポイント）。
送信用のスレッドはそれぞれepoll_wait( ) を行い、ソケットが書き込み可能になるまで待っています。そのスレッドにデータを受け渡したいときは、そのスレッドが持っているキューをロックしてにデータを受け渡し、ロックを解除してepollにソケットを登録します（epollはスレッドセーフ）。
データを受け渡すとき、データはコピーせずに参照を受け渡します。ソケットに書き込むときはwritev(2)を使い、連続していないアドレスを効率よく送信できるようにしています。
この送信用モジュールの実装ではwritev(2)が非同期に行われるために、writev(2)のエラーを受け取れないという問題があります。この問題に関して私の実装では、writev(2)が失敗したら積極的にソケットを壊す（shutdown(2)）ようにしています。これによって確実にread(2)側でもエラーを検出できるため、そのコネクションに結びつけられていたホストがダウンしたことにするなど、異常系の処理を行うことができます。
以上のアーキテクチャはkqueueを使っても実装することができます。Linuxでepoll、Mac OS Xでkqueueを使った実装が動作することを確認しています。同様にSolaris（Solaris 10 3/05以降）ではEvent Portsを使って実装できると思います。

Picture the scene : a fleet of black limousines crunches up the driveway of a Buddhist temple nestled in lush pine - carpeted mountains an hour west of Tokyo .
The precious cargo of limousine one – a violent but ageing mob boss – steps out into the sun , surrounded by four sumo - sized bodyguards and is welcomed by a priest .
As cherry blossom petals blow gently in the wind , the gangster enters the shrine and proceeds to be solemnly ordained into the Buddhist priesthood .
It sounds like the opening of a terrible yakuza movie , but this is what took place in this picture - perfect setting when Tadamasa Goto , one of Japan 's most feared mob bosses , stepped out of the shadows this week and into the path of God .
Unsurprisingly , he was watched – at a safe distance – by a 40 - strong media scrum .
It was as if the infamous mafia don John Gotti , a man with whom Goto is sometimes compared , had ditched his dapper suits for priests ' robes at the local Catholic church .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Today , Goto reportedly spends his time praying and contemplating on long meditative trips into these mountains .
Eventually , he could find himself comforting the sick and the bereaved , an odd occupation for a man who dealt in murder and mayhem for Japan 's largest yakuza syndicate , the Yamaguchi - gumi .
" I believe he has really turned away from his past life and wants to change , " says Jishu Tsukagoshi , one of the young priests at this temple , the Joganji .
" But only time will really tell if that is true . "
Probably nobody except Goto himself knows why he decided to swop a pistol for an incense burner , though there is no shortage of theories .
Most observers scoff , however , at the idea that the 66 - year - old , known as one of the country 's most dangerous gangsters , had a genuine change of heart .
The most popular theory is that he is on the run , hoping to escape assassination by former yakuza colleagues infuriated that he brought them one of the few things they genuinely fear : publicity .
Goto was splashed across the world 's newspapers last year after details emerged of a deal he had struck with the US authorities .
In exchange for a queue - jumping transplant at the UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles , Goto reportedly agreed to become an FBI informer .
For the bureau , he was a rare prize : a high - ranking boss apparently willing to break the yakuza 's silence about its operations in America , and its drug and weapons connections with North Korea .
But Goto walked away from the deal with a new liver having reportedly given the FBI nothing that they could not read in a 400 - yen ( £ 2.70 ) Tokyo magazine .
" He came to the States and got a liver and was laughing back to where he came from , " the former FBI chief Jim Stern told the LA Times .
" It defies logic . "
That sleight of hand may have saved Goto from being saddled with the deadly tag of snitch , but not from mob concerns that he could n't keep his name out of the press .

Those fears were compounded last year when he invited five well - known popular enka singers to his birthday party outside Tokyo on 17 September , igniting a media scandal when it was aired in a popular weekly magazine .
The leadership of the 40,000 - strong Yamaguchi - gumi reacted furiously , officially banishing him from the group during a meeting at its headquarters in Kobe and declaring him persona non grata .
According to mob watchers , Goto took with him a faction of 1,200 men , a reputation for violence and a drastically reduced life expectancy .
" There are a lot of people that want to kill him these days , " says Jake Adelstein , the Japan - based journalist who broke the story of Goto 's liver transplant .
" There 's even kind of a bidding war between groups , and not just the Yamaguchi - gumi , because the bounty on his head is quite substantial . "
Observers believe that Goto took trips abroad and played a lot of golf before hew decided that his new life was , in the words of the weekly magazine Friday , " empty and lacking stimulation . "
The prospect of a gang war between his breakaway group and the Yamaguchi - gumi also caused him sleepless nights .
His ordination gives him the chance to appear remorseful , and hopefully stave off the chances of being whacked .
For the 400 - year - old temple , however , the attractions of the arrangement are less clear .
Its head priest , who has a two - decade relationship with the don , has taken a pounding in the media , which finds Goto 's sudden conversion to Tendai Buddhism a little hard to swallow .
How is a man who has wallowed in the demi-monde for most of his life supposed to achieve Buddha - hood this late in the piece ?
Perhaps cash has helped smooth the way .
Goto donated $ 100,000 ( £ 68,000 ) to the LA hospital that performed his transplant , earning himself a commemorative plaque that reads : " In grateful recognition of the Goto Research Fund established through the generosity of Mr. Tadamasa Goto . "
The UCLA Medical Centre came under intense fire when it was revealed that Goto and three other yakuza had jumped over several hundred waiting patients to get their new livers .
Those patients all died .
Joganji's head priest is keeping mum about rumours of financial compensation .
But he admitted in a magazine interview this week that the don's epiphany was slow in coming .
" At first , he appeared to have little interest in Buddhism but as he got older , it deepened . "
Goto 's life of crime presumably left little time for the pursuit of enlightenment .
Apart from drugs , fraud and prostitution , he has been linked most infamously to a vicious knife attack on Juzo Itami , a top director who angered the mob by portraying them as lowlife thugs in a hugely popular movie .
Itami subsequently committed suicide in a death that has long been rumoured to have been a mob - hit in disguise .
In 2006 , Goto and his oldest son Masato were arrested for real - estate fraud following the killing of a man who was trying to clear out Goto - gumi gangsters .
He was acquitted but faces other charges .
Those court battles , his declining health and the prospect of war with probably the world 's largest organised crime outfit may all have played a part in his conversion , believes the temple priest Koji Tsukagoshi .
Whatever the reason , he says Goto is a shadow of his former self .
" He looks just like any man of that age , not scary at all , until you see the men he keeps around him . "
Goto offered few clues at his ordination , reportedly brushing off questions about his decision with a curt statement : " Buddha will make me his disciple and enable me to start a new life . "
Adelstein , who went into hiding in fear for his life after his story was published , recommends that his tormentor fill out an organ donor card and give his liver to a " more deserving " person .
" It would be a good and final chance for him to achieve some absolution .
Because I think that the odds are he 's going to be experiencing reincarnation first hand , a lot sooner than he expects . "
In the gang : The Yakuza
* The Yakuza , a loose alliance of Japanese criminal gangs , trace their origins back to a thoroughly romantic source : the machi - yokko , mercenaries who protected townsfolk from bandits in the 17th century .
Others connect them to the kabuki-mono , masterless samurai who terrorised villages across the country .
* The violent gangs to whom the modern term refers emerged after the Second World War , when they asserted control of the black market .
They conduct themselves with a veneer of honour and politesse , but the racket is a familiar one : smuggling , selling drugs , extortion , illegal gambling and prostitution rings .
* The Yakuza 's organisation follows a highly sentimentalised father - son structure , where relationships are cemented by the mutual drinking of sake in a ritual known as Sakazuki .
* In the gangs ' mythology , the archetypal Yakuza is an abandoned son taken in by a father figure ; gang members cut all family ties to affirm their allegiance to their superiors .
* Dedicated Yakuza confirm their loyalties with ornate tattoos ( left ) ; if they err , they expect to lose their pinkies .
With about $ 13 bn ( £ 9 bn ) flowing through their coffers each year , it is little wonder that 40 to 80,000 people are prepared to take the risk .
A reader writes :
A police officer friend of mine once pointed out something essential about the role marijuana plays in the War on Drugs : from a law enforcement perspective , it 's easy .
Marijuana use is incredibly widespread , particularly among certain predictable populations , like college kids .
Because it 's not a hard drug , marijuana users , most of whom are a lot like Phelps ( smart , hard working , young - not " addicts " ) are far less likely than other drug users to carry a weapon or get violent with an officer .
While marijuana growers tend to be less " average " than your average pot smoker ( more likely to have a weapon around , for instance , to protect their crop ) , they are still less organized and violent than traffickers of heroin , crack , etc .
Cops are under constant pressure to keep their numbers up .
That 's how they prove their efficacy to their bosses , and its how their bosses get money from their bosses ( again , this is my friend 's theory , but obviously I could have picked that tidbit up from The Wire ) .
Busting college kids for holding weed and taking down grow houses is a terrific way to keep these numbers up .
Drug arrests always look better than traffic stops on your report .
And drug seizures are viewed particularly favorably .
But going after junkies and heroin dealers is a lot more dangerous than trying to take down the marijuana trade .
So from the perspective of law enforcement , illegal marijuana provides a perfectly balanced way for them to prosecute the War on Drugs .
Weed is harmless enough to be widely used ( since , unlike say heroin , it wo n't kill you ) , which provides cops with plenty of potential arrests .
But again , because its so widely used , especially among the young , no amount of crack downs is going to get rid of weed in our society .
So it 's a well that never goes dry .
And it 's a win-win on the PR end : every marijuana bust can be used as both evidence of a problem , and evidence that law enforcement is confronting that problem .
Perfect .
Of course , having said that , I have to confess my own bias against the ganga : a [ former ] boyfriend once ditched me on my birthday to smoke up on a friend 's couch .
So the commercials are right ; weed really does destroy your personal relationships .
Or maybe that guy was just an asshole .
Hard to say .

Gordon Brown has promised to help 500,000 people into work or training , as the government attempts to stop unemployment increasing further .
The prime minister said employers would be given up to £ 2,500 for every person they trained who had been unemployed for more than six months .
Hosting a jobs summit , he promised that communities would not be " written off " .
With 1.8 million people out of work , the Conservatives say the government 's job package " does not go far enough " .
' Not on my watch '
Mr Brown 's announcement came as administrators for the ceramics firm Wedgwood confirmed 367 staff are to be made redundant and digger manufacturer JCB announced a further 684 job losses on top of 1,000 redundancies made last year .
More than 400 jobs are also under threat at Findus frozen food firm Newcastle Productions , which has also gone into administration , and another 875 at distribution company Wincanton , after it confirmed two of its depots may close in the spring .
Kent - based retailer Land of Leather also announced it was going into administration but would continue to trade while a buyer was sought .
But , on a brighter note , supermarket chain Morrisons unveiled plans to take on 5,000 extra staff for its store expansion programme .
In a speech at the Science Museum in London , Mr Brown set out plans to prepare Britain for growth in sectors such as environmental technology , advanced manufacturing , healthcare and education .
He said : " Failure to act now and to do so in coordination with our international partners would mean a deeper and longer global recession .
There are fears that three million people could be unemployed by 2010 " It would mean temporary rises in unemployment becoming permanent .
It would mean as in the past whole communities written off , and that would mean lasting damage to our economy and a bigger bill to pay in the future .
And this will not happen on my watch . "
Mr Brown said : " We can not always prevent people losing their jobs but we can help people finding their next jobs . "
He told the audience that people unemployed for three months or more would also get help , including " extensive " job interview training , and would have to sign on weekly for benefit payments .
Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell said of the £ 500 m scheme to help people who have been out of work for more than six months : " What we have learned from previous recessions is we need to make sure people do n't feel out of touch with the labour market ...
" We do n't want to waste a generation of people , as has happened in the past . "
Since being made redundant it 's become obvious that the jobs are n't out there .
And what jobs there are , an awful lot of people are applying for them
Mike Kirkham - Jones
Read Mike 's story Nick Robinson 's blog The Federation of Small Business has launched a five - point plan which it says could create up to 400,000 new jobs .
Measures it is calling for include the promotion of part - time working , simplified regulation and lower taxes .
It also wants to see more investment in apprenticeships and greater opportunity for small firms to bid for government contracts .
Union leaders at the summit will propose more training and job creation programmes , while environmental campaigners want greater investment in energy efficiency .
Derek Simpson , joint general secretary of Unite , said he welcomed any attempt to create new jobs but there needed to be more emphasis on protecting existing jobs , particularly in car manufacturing .
Not far enough
He said : " The businesses are basically sound .
It 's a question that they have a cash - flow problem .
" Commercial loans are difficult or more difficult through banks who do n't appear to be passing on the advantage the government has given them .
" And the government needs to step in to ensure that these particularly skilled jobs are not lost because once lost they 'll never return . "
In November , the Conservatives called for people made redundant to be able to retrain straight away , while also claiming benefits .
HAVE YOUR SAY Jobs are created by companies when the outlook looks good for them .
When the economy improves jobs will be created Harry , Reading Shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling said : " We have been arguing for the government to pay subsidies to employers who take on people who are out of work .
" We therefore welcome today 's announcement but what the government now needs to do is adopt our plans for a national loan guarantee scheme to help existing businesses and to protect jobs . "
Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Webb said : " Six months is too long for many unemployed people to wait before they get help .
" Someone who needs and wants to retrain should not be told to come back in six months ' time .
They need help immediately .
" Gordon Brown is extending existing programmes which have so far failed .
The economy needs new initiatives , not a rehash of old ideas . "

TOYOTA CITY , Japan ( CNN ) --
On what was to be a historic day halting all of Toyota 's Japanese assembly lines , the automaker announced late Thursday that it kept one line running .
The late news sent copy editors and reporters to their laptops erasing headlines like " historic shutdown , " but it did little to quell the pain for the tens of the thousands of workers idled across Japan as nearly every Toyota line stopped producing autos and auto - related equipment .
Nowhere was the silence more deafening than in Toyota City , home and birthplace to Toyota Motor Corp . ( TM ) .
Factories were shuttered and workers idled in an attempt to bring production in line with falling global demand .
The day was particularly ominous for assembly line worker Takayuki Yoshikawa , who has already been told he 's out of a job and back home in May .
Yoshikawa lives in a Toyota - owned dormitory .
" I do n't know what to do , " said Yoshikawa .
" I could go back to my hometown , but there are no jobs there , either . "
Toyota , now the world 's largest automaker , plans 10 more days like this , spread out over the next two months .
Toyota 's incoming president , Akio Toyoda , called the current economy " unprecedented , the likes of which have n't been seen in 100 years . "
Toyota also said the scheduled assembly line shutdowns are an attempt to save what jobs the automaker can .
" The production suspensions scheduled for Japan in February and March are part of our effort to keep production in line with market demand , " the company said .
" We are carrying out these suspensions fully aware of the necessity to even out production volumes and maintain employment levels . "
Analysts say while painful , these shutdowns may be unavoidable .
" Everywhere , almost everywhere , things are getting worse and worse and worse , " said Koji Endo , a Credit Suisse ( CS ) auto analyst .
" Under that kind of circumstance , you have to control your cost .
Maybe try to shrink temporarily . "
The cost control is having a damaging effect on Toyota City public coffers .
The city of 400,000 , located about 150 miles southwest of Tokyo , estimates 90 % of its tax dollars will evaporate as Toyota loses money and pays less corporate taxes .
It comes at a time when Toyota City is seeing historic levels of unemployment .
This region , according to city hall , carries the dubious distinction of having the highest rate of unemployment in Japan .
Alberto Dilone , already fired from a Toyota parts subsidiary , showed up at the Toyota City job center to search for a new job Thursday .
" Kubi , " Dilone said , slicing a finger across his throat .
The Japanese expression means cut or fired .
Dilone said half the people in his plant have been fired and jobs in Toyota City are scarce .
Like the hundreds of unemployed filtering through the employment center everyday , he left with no leads .
In Kreisen der SPD - Bundestagsfraktion gilt es als ausgeschlossen , dass die große Koalition noch in dieser Legislaturperiode den Einsatz des Bundestrojaners im Rahmen der Strafprozessordnung ( StPO ) zulässt .
Dieser Ansatz zur Freigabe heimlicher Online - Durchsuchungen für die Strafverfolgung oder etwa auch für den Verfassungsschutz sei zwar letztlich konsequent , erklärte ein Sprecher gegenüber heise online , die Materie sei aber " rechtlich sehr komplex " .
Bisher darf allein das Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) zur Abwehr terroristischer Gefahren verdeckt auf IT - Systeme Verdächtiger zugreifen .
Gegen die entsprechende Gesetzesnovellierung laufen aber Verfassungsbeschwerden .
Diese wollen die Sozialdemokraten auf jeden Fall zunächst abwarten .
Weitere Grundrechtseingriffe in diesem Bereich würden " ohne höchstrichterlichen Segen " der bestehenden Regeln nicht verfolgt .
Der stellvertretende Vorsitzende der CDU / CSU - Fraktion , Wolfgang Bosbach , hatte zuvor verkündet , dass noch vor den Bundestagswahlen eine entsprechende StPO - Änderung erfolgen solle .
Für dieses vom BKA und der Generalbundesanwaltschaft verfolgte Vorhaben kann die Union nun aber nicht auf die Unterstützung des Koalitionspartners zählen .
Bundesjustizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) hatte zuvor erwogen , eine Verwertbarkeit der Funde bei heimlichen Online - Durchsuchungen zur Terrorabwehr für die Strafverfolgung zuzulassen .
Wie ein Sprecher ihres Ressorts am heutigen Sonntag aber gegenüber heise online erklärte , wolle man auch in dieser Frage die Entscheidung aus Karlsruhe zur Novellierung des BKA - Gesetzes abwarten .
Die Verfassungsrichter hatten vergangenes Jahr dem Ausspähen von Festplatten bereits vorab sehr enge Grenzen gesetzt .
Weiter verfolgt wird in der Koalition laut Justizministerium eine Initiative , die Quellen - Telekommunikationsüberwachung ( Quellen - TKÜ ) verstärkt im Rahmen der Strafprozessordnung zuzulassen .
Dabei geht es um das Abhören von Internet - Telefonaten vor beziehungsweise nach einer Verschlüsselung direkt auf dem Rechner des Betroffenen .
Die dazu eingesetzte Technik ist vergleichbar mit der zur Online - Durchsuchung , es darf offiziell aber nur auf die laufende Kommunikation zugegriffen werden und keineswegs auf gesamte Festplatteninhalte .
Einen Vorstoß der Bundesregierung wird es nach Angaben des Justizressorts aus Zeitgründen aber nicht mehr geben .
Die Fraktionen von Union und SPD müssten hier einen eigenen Entwurf vorlegen .
Nach der FDP kritisierten unterdessen auch die Linken die Gedankenspiele der großen Koalition scharf .
Petra Pau , Mitglied im Fraktionsvorstand , bezeichnete die " Maßlosigkeit der CDU / CSU " als " verlässlich " .
Am Anfang heiße es , dass niemand die Absicht habe , heimlich Computer auszuspähen .
Am Ende stehe dann die Devise : " Bürgerrechte , wie Datenschutz und Postgeheimnis , waren gestern . "
Der Respekt der Union gegenüber dem Grundgesetz befinde sich im freien Fall .
Das Nachrichtenmagazin " Focus " berichtet zudem über neue Einzelheiten zu den zuvor bereits bekannt gewordenen Geheimdienstoperationen mit dem Bundestrojaner .
Demnach griff der Bundesnachrichtendienst ( BND ) in den vergangenen Jahren in ausländischen Staaten wie Afghanistan oder Kongo in angeblich 90 Fällen verdeckt auf Computer zu und spähte dabei Festplatteninhalte aus .
Dies habe der stellvertretende BND - Chef Arndt Freiherr Freytag von Loringhoven am Mittwoch gegenüber Mitgliedern des Parlamentarischen Kontrollgremiums ( PKG ) des Bundestags eingeräumt .
Die heimlichen Online - Durchsuchungen richteten sich demnach vorwiegend gegen politische Institutionen , Behörden und Firmen .
In etwa zehn Prozent der Fälle seien Rechner von Einzelpersonen inspiziert worden .
Davon zu unterscheiden seien die mindestens 2500 Fälle , in denen der Nachrichtendienst versucht habe , E - Mail - Konten mithilfe von Spionagesoftware zu lesen .

Republicans have been predicting the decline of American power ever since President Obama was photographed at last week ’s hemispheric summit shaking the hand of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and  gasp !
 smiling .
Former Vice President Dick
Cheney warned that that act of civility would be viewed as a sign of “ weakness . ”
Newt Gingrich , who may be honing his attack skills for a presidential run , said Mr. Obama ’s behavior was bolstering “ enemies of America . ”
We have no patience for Mr. Chávez .
He was elected as a champion of the poor and has turned himself into a standard - issue autocrat  playing the anti-America card to divert attention from his failed economic policies and ever more outrageous power grabs .
But Venezuela is no strategic threat .
And this country has paid far too high a price in both power and influence for former President George W. Bush ’s bullying .
Mr. Obama got elected on a pledge to do things differently .
At the summit , years of antagonism gave way to eagerness for new relations with Washington .
Mr. Obama undercut Mr. Chávez ’s bluster with that handshake and his promise of a “ new beginning ” with Cuba .
The Obama administration is resisting an independent inquiry into the Bush torture program because top Democrats like Pelosi were complicit in approving illegal methods
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , April 24 , 2009
We now know why top Democrats are protecting Bush administration officials from facing an inquiry into the illegal torture program – because several of them were actually complicit in giving their approval for such methods to be used .
The White House stressed again yesterday that it would not be pursuing an investigation of key Bush administration officials , despite the manifestly provable fact that the order to torture came from the very top , which was re-affirmed with the recent release of the Senate Armed Services Committee report .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs stated yesterday , “ I think the last few days might well be evidence of why something like this would likely just become a political back and forth . ”
“ By ( definition ) , an independent commission would probably not be something that I would weigh in on if Congress were to create one of those , ” he told reporters , according to AFP .
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also said he opposed an independent torture probe , stating , “ I think it would be very unwise , from my perspective , to start having commissions , boards , tribunals , until we find out what the facts are . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In addition , upon the recent release of the torture memos , Obama ’s right - hand man , chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , told ABC News that top Bush administration officials “ should not be prosecuted either and that ’s not the place that we go . ”
Obama ’s statement that accompanied the release of the torture memos stated , “ In releasing these memos , it is our intention to assure those who carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice that they will not be subject to prosecution . ”

Why are top Democrats so vehemently opposed to an independent inquiry into the blatantly illegal Bush torture program ?
This goes further than the crony self - interests of the two party monopoly – it turns out that top Democrats had foreknowledge of the torture and actually provided their unmitigated approval for the methods when presented with them by the CIA .
Despite Nancy Pelosi ’s denial that Congress was informed that the CIA was illegally waterboarding detainees , the Senate committee report discovered that in 2002 Pelosi and three other members of Congress ( one other Democrat and two Republicans ) were given a virtual tour by the CIA of overseas detention sites and the torture tactics employed to try and make detainees talk .
This was reported by the Washington Post in December 2007 .
Democrats Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) and Sens. Bob Graham ( D - Fla . ) and John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , all held oversight roles during this period .
The Post reports that the lawmakers raised “ no objections ” to the interrogation methods demonstrated by the CIA and that in fact , “ at least two lawmakers in the room asked the CIA to push harder . ”
So in summary , at least four top Democrats were aware as far back as 2002 that the CIA was using torture tactics which were illegal under the Geneva Conventions on detainees .
They gave their approval for such measures and , along with Republicans , advised that even harsher torture methods be employed .
Any independent investigation into the torture scandal will most probably uncover the fact that top Democrats like Pelosi , Harman , Graham and Rockefeller were complicit in approving the torture methods used by the CIA , which would also likely make them culpable to charges on the basis of knowingly covering up the fact that illegal actions which violate both the Geneva Conventions and the U.S. Constitution were taking place .
This is why Obama , Pelosi and the rest of the Democratic elite are so resistant to prosecuting Bush officials for devising the torture program – and have made every effort to protect them – because they were in on the fun and any truly independent inquiry would expose the fact that this whole debacle was a bipartisan cover - up from the very beginning .

Comment on this article
The government is expected to scrap s92A this afternoon , according to the Dominion - Post .
Good .
The law would have introduced a guilt by accusation regime into New Zealand , in violation of the rights to due proces and natural justice .
Overseas , such laws are primarily used to squash competitors and silence dissent .
This is not a law we need in New Zealand .
It is not a law we want in New Zealand .
And I will be very glad to see it dumped ( though constitutionally , having decided not to bring it into effect , the government should move urgency to repeal it - that would be a justified case for urgency , as compared to their usual reason of " avoiding public scrutiny " ) .
Update :
And while I was writing that , the government has issued its press release , announcing that s92A will not come into force , but will instead be reviewed and amended .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's blog has an interesting graph of What 3.6 Million Jobs Lost Over 13 Months Looks Like .
This chart compares the job loss so far in this recession to job losses in the 1990 - 1991 recession and the 2001 recession – showing how dramatic and unprecedented the job loss over the last 13 months has been .
Over the last 13 months , our economy has lost a total of 3.6 million jobs – and continuing job losses in the next few months are predicted .
By comparison , we lost a total of 1.6 million jobs in the 1990 - 1991 recession , before the economy began turning around and jobs began increasing ; and we lost a total of 2.7 million jobs in the 2001 recession , before the economy began turning around and jobs began increasing .

Employment Cycles During Recessions
When comparing the current employment ( black dashed line ) climate with that of prior recessions shows that we had anemic growth in employment heading into the current recession similar to the March 2001 recession ( red line ) , though we are following the worst cycle on the downside post the recession onset , following the July 1981 recession ( orange ) .
Employment did n’t stop falling in the 1981 and 1973 recession until roughly 16 months after the onset , and if we follow a similar pattern than job losses should stop by summer , and if they do n’t then this will be the worst job cycle since the Great Depression .
Pelosi : We Cannot Afford Delay on Recovery Package
“ This morning ’s startling job loss numbers show why it is imperative that the Congress act immediately to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stem the rising tide of unemployment and get Americans back to work .
The economic recovery package will create and save more than 3 million jobs and put America back on more solid economic footing .
“ With a record 3.6 million American jobs lost in just the last 13 months , we cannot afford to delay legislation that will create new jobs and invest in a stronger economy for years to come .
We must complete the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act next week so that the President can sign this critical legislation into law . ”
Misguided Efforts
Six - month cycles are great .
Now let ’s talk about meta-cycles : broader release cycles for major work .
I ’m very interested in a cross-community conversation about this , so will sketch out some ideas and then encourage people from as many different free software communities as possible to comment here .
I ’ll summarise those comments in a follow - up post , which will no doubt be a lot wiser and more insightful than this one 🙂
Background : building on the best practice of cadence
The practice of regular releases , and now time - based releases , is becoming widespread within the free software community .
From the kernel , to GNOME and KDE , to X , and distributions like Ubuntu , Fedora , the idea of a regular , predictable cycle is now better understood and widely embraced .
Many smarter folks than me have articulated the benefits of such a cadence : energising the whole community , REALLY releasing early and often , shaking out good and bad code , rapid course correction .
There has been some experimentation with different cycles .
I ’m involved in projects that have 1 month , 3 month and 6 month cycles , for different reasons .
They all work well .
.. but addressing the needs of the longer term
But there are also weaknesses to the six - month cycle :
It ’s hard to communicate to your users that you have made some definitive , significant change ,
It ’s hard to know what to support for how long , you obviously can’t support every release indefinitely .
I think there is growing insight into this , on both sides of the original “ cadence ” debate .
A tale of two philosophies , perhaps with a unifying theory
A few years back , at AKademy in Glasgow , I was in the middle of a great discussion about six month cycles .
I was a passionate advocate of the six month cycle , and interested in the arguments against it .
The strongest one was the challenge of making “ big bold moves ” .
“ You just ca n’t do some things in six months ” was the common refrain .
“ You need to be able to take a longer view , and you need a plan for the big change . ”
There was a lot of criticism of GNOME for having “ stagnated ” due to the inability to make tough choices inside a six month cycle ( and with perpetual backward compatibility guarantees ) .
Such discussions often become ideological , with folks on one side saying “ you can evolve anything incrementally ” and others saying “ you need to make a clean break ” .
At the time of course , KDE was gearing up for KDE 4.0 , a significant and bold move indeed .
And GNOME was quite happily making its regular releases .
When the KDE release arrived , it was beautiful , but it had real issues .
Somewhat predictably , the regular - release crowd said “ see , we told you , BIG releases do n’t work ” .
But since then KDE has knuckled down with regular , well managed , incremental improvements , and KDE is looking fantastic .
Suddenly , the big bold move comes into focus , and the benefits become clear .
Well done KDE 🙂
On the other side of the fence , GNOME is now more aware of the limitations of indefinite regular releases .
I ’m very excited by the zest and spirit with which the “ user experience MATTERS ” campaign is being taken up in Gnome , there ’s a real desire to deliver breakthrough changes .
This kicked off at the excellent Gnome usability summit last year , which I enjoyed and which quite a few of the Canonical usability and design folks participated in , and the fruits of that are shaping up in things like the new Activities shell .
But it ’s become clear that a change like this represents a definitive break with the past , and might take more than a single six month release to achieve .
And most important of all , that this is an opportunity to make other , significant , distinctive changes .
A break with the past .
A big bold move .
And so there ’s been a series of conversations about how to “ do a 3.0 ” , in effect , how to break with the tradition of incremental change , in order to make this vision possible .
It strikes me that both projects are converging on a common set of ideas :
Rapid , predictable releases are super for keeping energy high and code evolving cleanly and efficiently , they keep people out of a deathmarch scenario , they tighten things up and they allow for a shakeout of good and bad ideas in a coordinated , managed fashion .
Big releases are energising too .
They are motivational , they make people feel like it ’s possible to change anything , they release a lot of creative energy and generate a lot of healthy discussion .
But they can be a bit messy , things can break on the way , and that ’s a healthy thing .
Anecdotally , there are other interesting stories that feed into this .
Recently , the Python community decided that Python 3.0 will be a shorter cycle than the usual Python release .
The 3.0 release is serving to shake out the ideas and code for 3.x , but it wo n’t be heavily adopted itself so it does n’t really make sense to put a lot of effort into maintaining it – get it out there , have a short cycle , and then invest in quality for the next cycle because 3.x will be much more heavily used than 3.0 .
This reminds me a lot of KDE 4.0 .
So , I ’m interesting in gathering opinions , challenges , ideas , commitments , hypotheses etc about the idea of meta-cycles and how we could organise ourselves to make the most of this .
I suspect that we can define a best practice , which includes regular releases for continuous improvement on a predictable schedule , and ALSO defines a good practice for how MAJOR releases fit into that cadence , in a well structured and manageable fashion .
I think we can draw on the experiences in both GNOME and KDE , and other projects , to shape that thinking .
This is important for distributions , too
The major distributions tend to have big releases , as well as more frequent releases .
RHEL has Fedora , Ubuntu makes LTS releases , Debian takes cadence to its logical continuous integration extreme with Sid and Testing :-) .
When we did Ubuntu 6.06 LTS we said we ’d do another LTS in “ 2 to 3 years ” .
When we did 8.04 LTS we said that the benefits of predictability for LTS ’s are such that it would be good to say in advance when the next LTS would be .
I said I would like that to be 10.04 LTS , a major cycle of 2 years , unless the opportunity came up to coordinate major releases with one or two other major distributions – Debian , Suse or Red Hat .
I ’ve spoken with folks at Novell , and it does n’t look like there ’s an opportunity to coordinate for the moment .
In conversations with Steve McIntyre , the current Debian Project Leader , we ’ve identified an interesting opportunity to collaborate .
Debian is aiming for an 18 month cycle , which would put their next release around October 2010 , which would be the same time as the Ubuntu 10.10 release .
Potentially , then , we could defer the Ubuntu LTS till 10.10 , coordinating and collaborating with the Debian project for a release with very similar choices of core infrastructure .
That would make sharing patches a lot easier , a benefit both ways .
Since there will be a lot of folks from Ubuntu at Debconf , and hopefully a number of Debian developers at UDS in Barcelona in May , we will have good opportunities to examine this opportunity in detail .
If there is goodwill , excitement and broad commitment to such an idea from Debian , I would be willing to promote the idea of deferring the LTS from 10.04 to 10.10 LTS .
Questions and options
So , what would the “ best practices ” of a meta - cycle be ?
What sorts of things should be considered in planning for these meta-cycles ?
What problems do they cause , and how are those best addressed ?
How do short term ( 3 month , 6 month ) cycles fit into a broader meta-cycle ?
Asking these questions across multiple communities will help test the ideas and generate better ones .
What ’s a good name for such a meta- cycle ?
Meta - cycle seems …. very meta .
Is it true that the “ first release of the major cycle ” ( KDE 4.0 , Python 3.0 ) is best done as a short cycle that does not get long term attention ?
Are there counter - examples , or better examples , of this ?
Which release in the major cycle is best for long term support ?
Is it the last of the releases before major new changes begin ( Python 2.6 ? GNOME 2.28 ? ) or is it the result of a couple of quick iterations on the X.0 release ( KDE 4.2 ?
GNOME 3.2 ? )
Does it matter ?
I do believe that it ’s worthwhile for upstreams to support an occasional release for a longer time than usual , because that ’s what large organisations want .
Is a whole - year cycle beneficial ?
For example , is 2.5 years a good idea ?
Personally , I think not .
I think conferences and holidays tend to happen at the same time of the year every year and it ’s much , much easier to think in terms of whole number of year cycles .
But in informal conversations about this , some people have said 18 months , others have said 30 months ( 2.5 years ) might suit them .
I think they ’re craaaazy , what do you think ?
If it ’s 2 years or 3 years , which is better for you ?
Hardware guys tend to say “ 2 years ! ” to get the benefit of new hardware , sooner .
Software guys say “ 3 years ! ” so that they have less change to deal with .
Personally , I am in the 2 years camp , but I think it ’s more important to be aligned with the pulse of the community , and if GNOME / KDE / Kernel wanted 3 years , I ’d be happy to go with it .
How do the meta-cycles of different projects come together ?
Does it make sense to have low - level , hardware - related things on a different cycle to high - level , user visible things ?
Or does it make more sense to have a rhythm of life that ’s shared from the top to the bottom of the stack ?
Would it make more sense to stagger long term releases based on how they depend on one another , like GCC then X then OpenOffice ?
Or would it make more sense to have them all follow the same meta-cycle , so that we get big breakage across the stack at times , and big stability across the stack at others ?
Are any projects out there already doing this ?
Is there any established theory or practice for this ?
A cross-community conversation
If you ’ve read this far , thank you !
Please do comment , and if you are interested then please do take up these questions in the communities that you care about , and bring the results of those discussions back here as comments .
I ’m pretty sure that we can take the art of software to a whole new level if we take advantage of the fact that we are NOT proprietary , and this is one of the key ways we can do it .

BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
A huge mural greets visitors to the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston .
It 's a memorial to the building 's namesake , who died unexpectedly in 1993 .
Hundreds of tiles are used to create the " magic " mural at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Boston .
A young Reggie Lewis , wearing his No. 35 Boston Celtics jersey , dominates the middle of the 11 - foot - by - 14 - foot artwork .
At the bottom left is a picture of him and his wife .
To his right , the face of legendary Celtic Larry Bird .
But as young men in sweats and sneakers make their way into the gym , something strange happens .
The mural comes alive .
The photo of a beaming Lewis in formal attire transforms into Lewis the basketball player , streaking down the court .
Larry Bird 's picture morphs into that of another famous player , Robert Parrish .
With each step , the mural transforms , representing the many scenes in one man 's life .
Artist Rufus B. Seder calls these " movies for a wall " Lifetiles .
The Massachusetts artist invented the Lifetiles medium and is the only artist in the world using it .
He has more than 30 Lifetiles installations around the globe .
Watch a magic mural in action »
At the Taiwan Aquarium , dolphins swim on the wall alongside awestruck children .
Bucking broncos line the halls of the the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth , Texas .
Dancers spin and twirl along with passengers on luxury cruise ships in the south of France .
And Seder calls the the South San Francisco , California , BART station his " own personal gallery , " with more than 16 installations .
Lifetiles do n't use electricity , moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder 's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston .
" What I 'm after is trying to create an experience which totally takes you by surprise , " he said .
Scanimation on the shelf
If the technology you see in Lifetiles looks familiar , you might have caught something similar at a local bookstore .
The popular children 's books " Gallop ! " and " Swing ! " were also written and illustrated by Seder .
With a technique he calls scanimation , pictures in the books come alive as you flip the page .
It 's a kids ' favorite that quite a few parents enjoy , too , based on sales numbers .
" Swing ! " and " Gallop ! " are currently on The New York Times bestseller list .
Seder originally used scanimation in greeting cards he sold at trade shows around the country .
Then Workman Publishing came calling , asking Seder to develop a book based on the eye - catching technique .
That 's when Seder caught lightning in a bottle .
After several decades as a somewhat unknown artist , he found himself flying to China to teach the scanimation technique to book makers .
Just a few years later , there are over 2 million copies of " Gallop ! " in print in more than 13 languages .
Still awed by their popularity , Seder said , " I would 've been satisfied if a limited edition sold well .
It totally blew my mind what happened . "
Although his books ' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity , the Lifetiles are truly his life 's work .
The relatively unknown and seemingly modern form of art is n't new at all .
Seder 's been working on Lifetiles for more than 20 years , inspired by toys from the 1850s called zoetropes and an active imagination as a youngster .
" I started making movies when I was 12 years old , " he said , " so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye . "
How does it work ?
As a viewer , you do n't have to learn how to see a Lifetile .
It 's intuitive , and one immediately understands the concept .
As you walk past the mural , it begins to move along with you .
But the question that immediately comes to mind -- and the one Seder gets the most -- is , " How does it work ? "
" The short answer is , it 's magic , " Seder said .
" The longer answer is , it 's like a flipbook .
I 've taken all the pages from a flipbook and scrambled them all together , and I 've put them up on the wall and made them animate . "
The lengthy process also requires attention to detail .
Much like an animator , he creates a series of drawings on his computer .
He then strips down each image into what becomes an indistinguishable picture made up of a series of vertical lines .
This squiggly - lined image becomes the equivalent of a photo negative .
The negative gets sandblasted onto a hand - cast glass tile made in Seder 's studio .
The heavy , 8 - inch - square glass tiles get painted , scraped , fired in a kiln and finally added piece by piece to a Lifetiles mural .
Hundreds of these tiles work in harmony to create a huge moving image when displayed on a wall .
Seder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists would n't have his patience , even if they had his know - how .
" It 's not that I 've been playing my cards close to my vest , " he said .
" It 's just very difficult to do . "
A Lifetiles installation , from conception to completion , can take up to a year to complete .
It 's a labor of love he shares with others who walk by his " magic " walls .
" I love to watch people react to the work .
They do n't expect a wall to move , " he said .
" They 'll be walking down the hallway in a museum and walking outdoors through a zoo ... and suddenly they realize , ' Those dolphins are starting to move next to me !
How is that possible ? ' "

Mexico ’s flu season is usually over by now , but health officials have noticed a significant spike in flu cases since mid-March .
The W.H.O. said there had been 800 cases in Mexico in recent weeks , 60 of them fatal , of a flulike illness that appeared to be more serious than the regular seasonal flu .
Mr. Córdova said Friday that there were 1,004 possible cases .
Still , only a small number have been confirmed as cases of the new H1N1 swine flu , according to Gregory Hartl , a W.H.O. spokesman .
Mexican authorities confirmed 16 deaths from swine flu and said 45 others were under investigation , most of them in the Mexico City area .
The C.D.C. said that eight nonfatal cases had been confirmed in the United States , and that it had sent teams to California and Texas to investigate .

“ We are worried , ” said Dr. Richard Besser , the acting head of the C.D.C .
“ We do n’t know if this will lead to the next pandemic , but we will be monitoring it and taking it seriously . ”
There is no point in trying to use containment measures in the United States , he said , because the swine flu virus has already appeared from San Antonio to San Diego , without any obvious connections among cases .
Containment measures usually work only when a disease is confined to a small area , he said .
The C.D.C. refrained from warning people not to visit Mexico .
Even so , the outbreak comes at an awful time for tourism officials , who have been struggling to counter the perception that violence has made Mexico unsafe for travelers .
The outbreak was also causing alarm among Mexicans , many of whom rushed to buy masks or get checkups .

On the same day that Sarah Palin blasted Barack Obama for his Special Olympics joke on The Tonight Show , the Alaska Governor announced that she would not be accepting $ 170 million for economically disadvantaged and special needs students .
Thus she decided to put her 2012 ambitions ahead of special needs students .
While Palin ’s office is claiming that they are only taking half of the federal stimulus money , the reality is that they are taking 69 % .
Palin used the national debt as the reason why she is turning down additional education funding , “ Simply expanding state government under this federal stimulus package creates an unrealistic expectation that the state will continue these programs when the federal funds are no longer available .
Our nation is already over $ 11 trillion in debt ; we ca n’t keep digging this hole . ”
She also used building codes as a reason why she turned down federal stimulus money , “ We wo n’t be bound by federal strings in exchange for dollars , nor will we dig ourselves a deeper hole in two years when these federal funds are gone .
For instance , in order to accept what look like attractive energy funds , our local communities would be required to adopt uniform building codes .
Government would then be required to police those codes .
These types of funds are not sensible for Alaska . ”
Oh my God , not uniform building codes !!!!

Why should Sarah Palin let the educational needs of a few special needs kids ruin her run for the White House in 2012 ?
Do n’t these people realize that she has national ambitions ?
If I lived in Alaska , I think that I might be getting a tad bit nervous about my governor making decisions that seem to be based on positioning herself on the national stage as the anti-Obama .
The good news for the parents of those students in lower income families and those who have special needs is that the Alaska legislature has an opportunity to take the funds despite Palin ’s objections .
Her actions today show that Sarah Palin may care about her special needs child , but contrary to what she said on the campaign trail last year , she wo n’t put her own political ambitions behind the needs of other special needs children in her state , she should be ashamed of herself , but team Palin 2012 probably views this as a wise political strategy .
The problem is that if Palin is willing to sell out special needs kids in order to get the Republican nomination in 2012 , then she will dump any principle that she claims to hold if it will advance her political career .

Update : The Husband of the Bill ’s Sponsor Does Work for Monsanto
Reader CW tipped me off to this .
It checks out .
Rosa DeLauro is married to Stanley B. Greenberg .
Here ’s a bio on Greenberg :
Stanley B. Greenberg is Chairman and CEO of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research .
He has served as polling advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore , Prime Minister Tony Blair , Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki , Prime Minister Ehud Barak , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada of Bolivia and their national campaigns .
Greenberg provides strategic advice and research for companies , organizations and campaigns trying to advance their issues amid shifting social currents .
Greenberg is author of the new book , The Two Americas : Our Current Political Deadlock and How to Break it , published by St. Martin ’s Press , described by James Carville as “ the most important book on American politics in my memory … maybe since 1960 , the Making of the President . ”
Greenberg is also the author of Middle Class Dreams .
Together with Bill McInturff , Greenberg conducts bi-partisan surveys for National Public Radio on the main issues of the day .
His private sector clients include BP , Boeing , Monsanto , Comverse , Sun Microsystems , United HealthCare , the Business Roundtable , and the organizing committee for the 2004 Olympics in Athens .
— END UPDATE —
What this will do is force anyone who produces food of any kind , and then transports it to a different location for sale , to register with a new federal agency called the “ Food Safety Administration . ”
Even growers who sell just fruit and / or vegetables at farmers markets would not only have to register , but they would be subject inspections by federal agents of their property and all records related to food production .
The frequency of these inspections will be determined by the whim of the Food Safety Administration .
Mandatory “ safety ” records would have to be kept .
Anyone who fails to register and comply with all of this nonsense could be facing a fine of up to $ 1,000,000 per violation .
I ’ve bought food at several farmers markets for years and I have yet to meet any vendors who are fond of the government .
I think it ’s pretty safe to say that most vendors at farmers markets wo n’t go along with this .
The problem will be that the people who run the farmers markets will be forced to make sure that vendors are “ registered ” with the government .
Is this Change we can believe in ?
Maybe it is for Obama ’s Secretary of Agriculture , Tom “ I Fly with Monsanto ” Vilsack .
For the rest of us , this is a nightmare .
Let ’s take it piece by piece :
What is the legislation called ?
H.R. 875 : Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009 :

R. 875 To establish the Food Safety Administration within the Department of Health and Human Services to protect the public health by preventing food - borne illness , ensuring the safety of food , improving research on contaminants leading to food - borne illness , and improving security of food from intentional contamination , and for other purposes .
How does this affect farmers who just sell fruit and vegetables at farmers markets ?

A law requiring US citizens to present federally mandated ID cards for " official purposes " such as boarding a plane is likely to be shaken down at the door under the US Department of Homeland Security 's new secretary , Janet Napolitano .
The ex-governor of Arizona , tapped as chief homeland spook by Obama in January , has been an outspoken adversary of the law since its introduction as a rider act for the " Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense , the Global War on Terror , and Tsunami Relief , 2005 . "
Revisions to the law being proposed by Napolitano and other officials , however , appear to be motivated by the cost of implementing the law , rather than out of concern for the privacy of American citizenry or states ' rights .
Dubbed the Real ID
Act of 2005 , the law imposes uniform requirements for driver 's licenses and state ID cards in order for them to be accepted by the federal government as identification for official purposes .
It also establishes new standards for the personal data to be tracked by the cards ( similar to that of a passport ) , and requires each state to share its ID databases with each other .
In the US , driver 's licenses are issued by the states , not by the federal government .
While the law allows each state to continue issuing non-complying IDs , the old cards must carry a unique design and be clearly marked to show they cannot be accepted for any federal purpose .
But the usefulness of non-complying cards is rather put into question by the federal government 's running the show at US borders and security check-ins at the country 's airports .
Furthermore , the Act specifies needing a Real ID to enter a federal building or nuclear power plant - but leaves the true scope of what is considered an " official purpose " as an ambiguity .
For some officials , it 's a tempting opportunity to use the system to track more mundane activities such as purchasing over - the - counter medicines as a means to bust meth labs .
Napolitano said earlier this month that her office is working with the National Governors Association ( NGA ) to propose revisions to the law .
The NGA claims Real ID places unnecessary and costly burdens on states and will do little to achieve the law 's intended security goals .
" Governors are committed to improving the security and integrity of state DL / ID systems , but the timelines and requirements mandated by Real ID are unrealistic , " the group states in its online policy manifesto .
NGA says implementing the program could cost upwards of $ 11bn over five years - money the federal government currently does n't intend to fund and that many states can't afford .
Presently , all 50 states have received extensions to the original May 11 , 2008 deadline .
A few holdout states such as California , Montana , Maine , and South Carolina have either refused to commit to the plan or even passed resolutions not to participate .
The current deadline for when all US citizens aged 50 years or younger must have a Real ID license is May 2011 .
Privacy advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) claim the Real ID law fails to provide critical privacy - security safeguards for personal data .
From the EFF 's policy page :
Once the IDs and database are in place , their uses will inevitably expand to facilitate a wide range of surveillance activities .
Remember , the Social Security number started innocuously enough , but it has become a prerequisite for a host of government services and been co-opted by private companies to create massive databases of personal information .
A national ID poses similar dangers ; for example , because " common machine - readable technology " will be required on every ID , the government and businesses will be able to easily read your private information off the cards in myriad contexts .
While financial complaints are prominent in the NGA 's policy , it does recommend establishing further minimum guidelines to protect the " security , confidentiality , and integrity of personally identifiable information . "
But that 's not to say Napolitano and company are against tracking the personal data in the first place .
Napolitano is an advocate for states individually implementing so - called " enhanced driver 's licenses , " which include an embedded RFID chip that allows for remote tracking .
" Enhanced driver 's licenses give confidence that the person holding the card is the person who is supposed to be holding the card , and it 's less elaborate than Real ID , " she told The Washington Times .
Napolitano said she expects the NGA to introduce their package of changes to congress this spring . ®
Missouri retracts police memo which labeled activists as ' militia ' Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday March 26 , 2009
Print This Email This The Missouri Department of Public Safety has retracted a controversial profiling memo which linked libertarian activists , Christians , constitutionalists , supporters of Congressman Ron Paul and other traditionally conservative groups to underground militias .
It also specifically cautioned police to be on the lookout for bumper stickers advertising third party candidates , or people with copies of the United States Constitution .
" [ Lt. Gov. Peter ]
Kinder called on Nixon to place Department of Public Safety Director John Britt on administrative leave pending an investigation of how the report came about , " reported the Springfield News - Leader . " [ Gov. Jay ]
Nixon 's office did not comment on Kinder 's demand , but said it backed Keathley 's plans to reform the process of releasing [ Missouri Information Analysis Center ] intelligence reports .
" In a lengthy statement , Keathley expressed remorse for the lack of oversight in the creation and distribution of the report , but he did not apologize for its contents .
Keathley said his office ' would undertake a review of the origin of the report by MIAC . ' "
The News - Leader published a copy of the memo ( PDF link ) .
" Due to the current economical [ sic ] and political situation , a lush environment for militia activity has been created , " the memo reads .
It goes on to cite possible militia members as people who talk about the New World Order conspiracy , express anger with the Federal Reserve banking system , resist paying taxes , warn other citizens about the percieved dangers of radio frequency identification ( RFID ) or lobby for a return to strict constitutionalism as possible threats to law enforcement .
While the memo does offer something of a lopsided summary of many of the various groups which swelled enormously following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , it also links individuals who are otherwise peaceful with the Ku Klux Klan and other violent organizations .
It also specifically highlighted former presidential candidates Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin and Bob Barr as icons of the militia movement .
The apology and retraction only came after all three men signed a letter to Gov. Nixon ( PDF link ) demanding an about - face .
" It would be difficult , Governor , to recount in any letter of reasonable length the nonsense and inaccurate information contained in this so - called ' Strategic Report ' ... " wrote the three candidates .
" The ' Report ' draws links between white supremacists , anti-immigration persons , people opposed to gun control , those who do not favor the Federal Reserve Banks and more .
Were the ' Report ' nothing more than a nonsensical diatribe penned by some uninformed person , we certainly would n't take our time writing this letter ( although we respectfully suggest you may want to question why such nonsense is of interest to and being disseminated by an agency connected to the state of Missouri ) . "
" In a letter of apology to the former candidates , Britt wrote that ' portions of that report may be easily misconstrued by readers as offensive to supporters of certain political candidates or to those candidates themselves .
I regret that those components were ultimately included in the final report , ' " reported CNN .
" Training law enforcement officers to watch for political speech like signs and bumper stickers when trying to determine if someone is part of a violent hate group will , obviously , ' chill open discourse ' and people 's willingness to express their beliefs , " said Missouri Libertarian party spokesman Mike Ferguson in a prepared statement .
" It literally describes half the state of Missouri as potentially linked to these hate groups , " he said in a published report .
" It really would be laughable , if it were n't such a serious situation . "
" The outcry prompted James Keathley , the superintendent of the Highway Patrol , to stop distributing the document to law enforcement officers , " reported the Associated Press .
" In a letter released Wednesday afternoon , Keathley also said he will create a process that ensures he and Department of Public Safety Director John Britt will read all future reports before they are released . "
" In the future , high - level review of these reports prior to issuance will ensure not only that law enforcement officers get better quality intelligence , but also that certain subsets of Missourians will not be singled out inappropriately in these reports for particular associations , " he wrote ( PDF link ) .
" Because the memo was released by a state task force in cooperation with the [ Department of Homeland Security ] , it is not outrageous to assume that Missouri is not the only state involved , " opined Jessica Bernier in Vermont 's Times Argus .
" This is chilling news to those of us who look beyond the headlines , and damning evidence of a creeping disease rotting America . "

How do I Qualify for Mensa ?
Tests often claim to determine an intelligence quotient , or IQ score , without really defining the term .
In fact , there are many different types of IQ tests and IQ scoring scales , plus intelligence tests that do n’t even show results as an IQ score .
For admission to Mensa , applicants must take a standard intelligence test and score at or above the 98th percentile .
What Do IQ Tests Test ?
It is more valuable to look at what IQ tests correlate with than what they measure .
IQ tests did n’t arise as measurement tools for theories that immediately proved to correlate with notable outcomes .
IQ tests have been tweaked and refined over time to show these correlations - a process similar to natural selection .
Why IQ Matters More Than Grit .
Lifespan , physical wellness , and economic success have legitimate correlations with IQ .
Unfortunately , we have little control over our IQ scores and measurements ; the level of intelligence we ’re born with is essentially what we ’ll have throughout life .

Vampires ( Homo sapiens homovorus ) are an extinct anthropophagous subspecies of Homo sapiens .
Since their extinction , they have been embedded in the mythology and folklore of various cultures .
In folklore , they acquired numerous supernatural characteristics , the most common is that they were re-animated corpses of human beings .
In modern times , vampires are the frequent subject of cinema and fiction .
Their taxonomic name , Homo sapiens homovorus , is Latin for " human eating wise - man . "

Physiology Edit
Overview Edit
The difference in external diagnostic features between humans and vampires were actually pretty subtle , both because vampires never lasted long enough to diverge greatly from the human baseline , and also because natural selection is going to promote superficial similarity .
However , while virtually identical to modern humans in terms of gross physical morphology , vampires were radically divergent from humans on the biochemical , neurological , and soft - tissue levels .
This limited significant physical changes to soft tissue and microstructures that do not fossilise .
This is one of the reasons why it 's so difficult to identify these creatures in the fossil record - the other reason being that they sat at the very apex of the food pyramid , which means that they were quite rare even at peak numbers .
Appearance Edit
More gracile than Homo sapiens sapiens , gross physical divergence from baseline humans included a slight but distinct extension of the mandible , and of course of the slight elongation of canines , the classic " fangs " of the predatory grip - and - tear feeding mode ( although this was n't quite as pronounced as the popular mythology would have you believe ) .
Vampires also tended to be taller and longer - limbed than humans .
All of this was in service of an increasingly predatory lifestyle .
Vampire skin possessed a ghastly white pallor .
This discoloration however , was not the result of anemia ; in fact their blood volume was actually seven percent higher than humans .
Instead their blood volume was redistributed away from the peripheral tissues and sequestered deep in the core .
They had capillary beds formed in the body core .
All humans have these , the digestive system is highly vascularised to facilitate nutrient transport from the intestine into the bloodstream , but the capillary meshes in a vampire 's core were far more extensive than anything seen in humans .
Tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate were elevated ; ATP is the chemical battery that powers the cell , and this explains the abnormal strength and stamina that vampires displayed .
The gastrointestinal tract was foreshortened and secreted a distinct range of enzymes more suited to a carnivorous diet .
Since cannibalism carries with it a high risk of prionic infection , the vampire immune system displayed great resistance to prion diseases , as well as to a variety of helminth and anasakid parasites .
Nervous system Edit
The central nervous system is where the difference between vampires and humans really showed up .
The corpus callosum was twenty percent larger in vampires than in humans .
This enabled high - speed broadband communication between hemispheres .
Interneuron / glial density , cortical folding and lamination were far above those in a human , particularly in the visual cortex .
Their motor neuron nerve axons were almost twice as thick as conventional humans .
This gave vampires faster signal transmission and faster reflexes than humans .
A vampire could literally snatch a speck out of your eye before you had time to blink .
A vampires 's amygdala and visual cortex -- essentially , the pattern - matching wetware at the back of the head - were seven and thirteen percent larger than what is found in humans , respectively .
Synaptic interconnections between the anterior cingulate gyrus and the rest of the brain were much lower than normal , almost as if the core of the brain were being isolated from the neocortex .
They also possessed some very unusual wiring in the retina .
Human eyes contain whole arrays of specialized receptor cells ; some fire only when they see light and shadow in conjunction , some fire only when they see horizontal lines - horizons and so on .
In a vampire 's case , the receptors that responded to horizontal lines were crosswired with those that responded to vertical ones .
When both sets of receptors fired simultaneously in a very specific way - that is , when intersecting right angles occupied more than thirty degrees of visual arc - positive feedback generated a neuroelectrical overload in the visual cortex .
This what caused the famous adverse reaction to crosses , which consisted of violent convulsions which strongly resembled grand mal seizures .
The reaction is commonly called the " crucifix glitch " by scientists .
Within the vampire eye there was an increased reflectivity of the retina , reminiscent of the tapetum lucidum found in the eyes of cats and other nocturnal predators .
Vampires also had quadrochromatic vision ; while we humans have only three types of cones in our eye vampires had four , the fourth being tuned to near - infrared .
Blood diet Edit
The reason vampires did not resorted to non-human prey and evolved such radical adaptations to accommodate human meat into their diet is because they received something from humans that they could n't from other species .
What they received that is so essential to their diet is PCDH-Y , a protein responsible for certain aspects of central nervous system development .
Vampires possessed a genetic defect that resulted in the inability to synthesize the protein .
Since this protein occurs only in other hominids , human prey was an essential component of the vampire diet .
Technically vampires were closer to what might be called obligate cannibals , eating human flesh rather than simply drinking the blood .
However , given that the only thing they really needed from humans was a certain type of protein , it 's theoreticaly possible that a blood diet could meet that need , although they had to drink a large amount of blood .
Perhaps this was a deliberate conservation strategy ; drinking the blood leaves you with an anemic victim that can recover over time and serve as a future food source , while eating the flesh basically relegates your victim to single - serving status ; and vampires could feed on other species to meet most of their dietary needs .
They were much more intelligent than humans , intelligent enough to figure out the virtues of resource conservation .
Because of modifications to the digestive system , PCDH-Y was obviously not broken down in the stomach as with other proteins , but instead was absorbed with its full effects into the central nervous system .
Those modifications probably also included anticoagulants that stopped blood from curdling in the stomach , thereby preventing any emetic effects of ingesting blood .
The vampire mind Edit
Since vampire grey matter was " underconnected " compared to human norms due to a relative lack of interstitial white matter ; this forced isolated cortical modules to become self - contained and hypereffective , leading to pattern - matching and analytical skills far in excess of the human norm .
Vampires were omnisavants ; their groove extended to pretty much every logical and pattern - matching dimension known to man , and more besides .
They were insanely smart by human standards .
Vampires could even do something that 's neurologically impossible for us , they could hold simultaneous multiple worldviews .
This allowed them to instantly grasp things that to us seem plagued by contradictions , to see things we have to work out step - by - step .
Vampires had to be smarter than people , because they hunted people for a living .
Lions are smarter than gazelles for pretty much the same reason .
By the same token , something else vampires had to be is clinically sociopathic .
Among our own kind , a lack of conscience , of empathy for one 's fellow human beings , is considered a pathology .
Among vampires , though , sociopathy is an essential survival trait .
If you felt empathy for your prey , you 'd starve to death .
Natural selection would have weeded " moral " vampires out of the gene pool relatively fast .
On the biological level , the sociopathy was caused by the poor connection of the anterior cingulate gyrus , as its ventral area is related to emotional cognition .
The undead state Edit
A major prey - related problem that vampires faced was the predator - prey ratio .
In most every case where one species eats another , the prey species is at least an order of magnitude more numerous than the predator , and breeds faster .
The reasons for this are obvious : the transfer of food energy between trophic levels is very inefficient .
Cows have to eat ten kilograms of grass to make one kilogram of cow ; it takes ten kilograms of cow to make one kilogram of human ; and of course , it takes ten kilograms of human to make one kilogram of vampire .
So at any given level , the level below you must out - produces you by at least ten to one , or you 'll exterminate your own food supply .
Since the metabolic and reproductive rates of vampires were pretty much the same as humans , what they did was cut back on their activity levels .
The bodies of vampires contained high concentrations of Leuenkephalin , an opioid peptide found in animals like bears and squirrels , and is involved in hibernation .
Vampires conserved energy - and their food supply - by extended periods of hibernation .
Suspended animation is not uncommon even among higher animals like birds and mammals .
Vampires were able to shut themselves down for decades , dessicating down to this biologically dormant condition and entering what 's commonly known as an " undead state . "
This worked in three ways : firstly , it drastically reduced their energetic needs , redressing the original imbalance between prey production and predator consumption .
Secondly , it gave the prey population time to recover in the event that it had been severely hammered by predation , and let the vampires wait out food shortages .
And thirdly , it 's possible that these extended leaves - of - absence might have given humans time forget that they were prey .
By the Pleistocene era , humans were intelligent enough to pass information from generation to generation , but were also intelligent enough for skepticism .
Stories of " nightstalking demons " were likely taken as mere tales of fantasy by senile elders .
Primitive cultures were likely to get careless after a few decades with no vampires on the horizon .
At any rate , scientists believe that this is where the blood - pooling strategy started ; part of being " undead " involved sequestering blood around the vital organs and letting the peripheral tissues starve , much the way seals and whales triage their oxygen supply when cut off from the air .
This likely proved so effective that over time , it became a normal state of affairs even among active vampires ; the ghastly white pallor of vampires was actually a strategy for increasing their gas mileage .
When lactate levels in the surface tissues got too high -- or when vampires were feeding - blood was redirected to the skin and the complexion flushed .
Reproduction Edit
As the classic mythology would have it , vampires reproduced by turning their victims into other vampires .
Revisionists and horror writers have played around with the idea of vampirism as a kind of viral infection , an STD transmitted from saliva to blood .
Biologically , of course , there are some problems with this idea : if you create another vampire every time you feed , it wo n't be long before all your prey have been turned into vampires , all of which will get very hungry very fast .
However , the idea is n't as absurd as it may seem on the surface .
Lateral gene transmission is not unheard of in nature ; certain microbes are known to act as carriers for the DNA of other species , transmitting them from one host to another ; and in any event , it appears that predator and prey share many of the same genes anyway ; perhaps the only thing that needs to be transmitted is some kind of catalyst to activate them .
More conventionally , vampires and humans never achieved complete reproductive isolation in any event ; there 's no reason why interbreeding could n't produce vampire offspring , especially if the critical vampire genes were heterozygously dominant .
Many scientists have theorized that the genes responsible for vampirism are widely spread amongst the human population , simply dormant in most people .
They lie within junk DNA , which are ancient genes that have n't expressed themselves in thousands of years .
These scientists believe that in certain cases , some of these genes do express spontaneously ; that psychopathy , autism and certain types of schizophrenia arise partly from the partial expression of these genes in a broken and rudimentary form .
That sociopaths and savants show us one or two bits of the vampire subspecies .
Origin Edit
Judging by nuclear introns and mitochondrial satellites , scientists believe that vampires split off the human lineage something less than 90 thousand years ago , and persisted ( albeit in small numbers ) into the beginning of historical times .
Their genesis has been traced to a paracentric inversion mutation on the Xq21.3 block on the X - chromosome , resulting in functional changes to genes that code for protocadherins .
PCDH-Y is a protocadherin , and as mentioned they play a critical role in brain and central nervous system development .
They occur in the headwaters of CNS development , as it were , and a relatively small change far upstream can lead to a whole variety of interrelated cascade effects .
A headwater mutation had such a huge impact on so many aspects of CNS development that suddenly there was far more variation for natural selection to work on , and so vampires arose relatively quickly .
Despite common misconception , natural selection does not optimize anything .
It 's actually something along the lines of " survival of the least inadequate . "
It does n't matter if a given adaptation is the best possible solution .
All that matters is rather it works better than the competition .
Overall vampires did work better than the competition .
But that does n't mean they did n't have a few design flaws .
The biggest were the broken pathway which forced them to eat other hominids and the defect referred to as the so - called crucifix glitch .
It is this glitch that doomed them from the moment humans developed Euclidean architecture .
Vampires would have been barred from approaching any human dwellings that featured quartered windows , supporting crossbeams , and so on .
And this weakness was likely discovered by the people of early civilization rather soon .
The cross is not an exclusively Christian icon : it has been used as a religious symbol back into prehistoric times , and vampires were apparently the reason .
The crucifix glitch , such a lethal trait remained in the vampire population and was not weeded out by natural selection very soon because the trait was n't lethal at first .
An aversion to crosses is not a disadvantage in a world where crosses do n't exist and there are n't many right angles in nature .
Neutrally selective traits can become fixed in small populations through a simple process called " genetic drift " .
In this case the trait was n't even neutral : the same crosswiring responsible for the crucifix glitch was also involved in vampiric pattern - matching skills , and that was a trait that natural selection would have actively promoted - right up until the point that their human prey discovered geometry and Euclidean architecture .
The crucifix glitch spelled the end of the vampire lineage .
Suddenly denied access to its prey - the entire subspecies went extinct shortly after the dawn of recorded history .
Although they obviously persisted long enough to embed themselves in our cultural mythology .
Myths Edit
The crucifix glitch is likely the source of the myth that vampires can't enter someone 's house uninvited .
It would be more accurate to say that vampires could n't come into a house unless they kept their eyes closed ; and since that would have made them extremely vulnerable to attack , they usually could only enter a house when the house 's inhabitants did n't wish them ill .
Vampires had very sensitive night vision and their pupils did n't react as quickly as humans to changes in light intensity ; they could be easily snowblinded .
Although it could n't cause them to burst into flame when struck by the sun 's rays , but it might explain a general aversion to bright light .
A crowd of peasants with torches likely presented a real problem to the subspecies .
It 's possible that vampires themselves spread the myth of garlic repelling them , to engender a false sense of security among their prey .
It 's also possible that the whole story is pure fiction .
Or possibly , maybe the majority of the population had a severe allergy towards garlic and garlic products .
A lot of other myths - that vampires can fly , or shapeshift , or that they do n't reflect in mirrors - are likely to be mostly fiction as well .
But it 's worth remembering that these creatures were both faster and more intelligent than humans , and their superlative pattern - matching skills would have given them a real advantage in " blending in " via crypsis ; it 's quite likely that one might seem to disappear simply by fading into shadow , or adopting a posture that broke up its outline against the background .
Combine such a vanishing act with , for example , the flushing of some startled animal caught in its path , and a primitive human might think that some kind of shape - shift had occurred .

Thomas Jarrett helps teach troops how to handle the stresses of the battlefield during a course at Camp Liberty in Iraq .
BAGHDAD  In Maj .
Thomas Jarrett 's stress management class surrounded by concrete blast walls , American troops are urged not to accept post - traumatic stress disorder as an inevitable consequence of war .
Instead , Jarrett tells them to strive for " post - traumatic growth . "
During a 90 - minute presentation entitled " Warrior Resilience and Thriving , " Jarrett , a former corporate coach , offers this and other unconventional tips on how troops can stay mentally healthy once they return home .
He quotes Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius , Paradise Lost author John Milton and German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , among others .
Walking through the crowd of young GIs in the makeshift classroom , Jarrett urges them to fight their " internal insurgents . "
The overriding theme of the course : Troops have the power to determine how they react to the horrors they may experience in Iraq .
They can either accept them as traumatizing events , or transform them into learning — even empowering — experiences .
" Pain is inevitable .
Suffering is optional , " says Staff Sgt. Michael Venutto , a member of Jarrett 's team of instructors .
The class is part of an urgent initiative aimed at halting an epidemic of suicides , which has killed almost as many American troops this year as combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan combined .
The trend has left top military psychologists puzzled and resulted in a new emphasis on programs that alleviate stress and prevent possible suicides while troops are still on the battlefield , where doctors say many mental health problems begin .
To that end , every soldier arriving in Iraq is now handed a card detailing the warning signs for depression and suicide .
Two - star generals appear on the Armed Forces Network talking about their experiences with mental health specialists and how it helped .
And mental health experts are spending more time on the front lines to make the counseling process informal and accessible to troops who may be reluctant about seeking out a psychiatrist .
The challenge is to get soldiers to open up about their troubles and to break what Lt. Col.
Peyton Hurt , the senior psychiatrist in Iraq , calls the old Army way : " You suck it up and drive on . "
" We 're rolling out program after program and making a very concerted effort at lots of levels , " Hurt said .
" The government is just pouring money into this stuff right now . "
In January , suspected suicides in the Army reached an all - time monthly high of 24 , doubling the number of combat deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan combined , according to military data .
( Military investigators often take months to confirm suicide as the cause of death . )
The number of suspected suicides was 18 in February .
The majority of the suicides have occurred once troops return home to the USA , but Hurt and other doctors say the problems tend to take root while troops are still at war , meaning it 's crucial to address their mental health as early as possible .
The strains that the armed forces have endured as they fight two long wars are well - documented : extended deployments , a rash of brain injuries and sometimes insufficient military health care , among others .
But military psychologists and troops in Iraq interviewed by USA TODAY also mentioned less conventional explanations .
They ranged from boredom as combat operations cease in Iraq to , paradoxically , the improvement in communications that allows troops to keep in better touch with their loved ones — but also immerses them in family problems while they 're still at war .
Ultimately ,
Hurt says the military is n't really sure what 's causing the suicides .
He has hope in programs like Jarrett's , but he also worries that the military 's outreach effort relies on " marketing " techniques to make troops aware of the problem without adequately addressing the core causes .
" I do n't want to be cynical about it , but I 'm not convinced that necessarily it 'll make much difference , " Hurt said .
" It might .
We do n't know . "
Enormous time pressures
Hurt says the military has worked hard to overcome the traditional stigma associated with mental health issues — one that , despite the hard - learned lessons of previous wars , prevailed again early in the Iraq war .
Lt. Col. Benjamin Matthews says he laughed at the idea of mental health counseling back in 1993 , when he was a young lieutenant in Somalia during the Black Hawk Down incident , where 18 Americans were killed and more than 80 others were wounded .
" I got two 800 - milligram Motrins and was told ' Go back out and fight , ' " Matthews said .
He said there was also little opportunity for counseling during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the months following because it was such a " mobile battlefield . "
He said soldiers were so focused on securing cities and establishing bases throughout the country that there was no time to get stressed .
" The only stress you had was a lack of sleep , " he said .
In 2006 , Joshua Moreland , an Army staff sergeant who is serving his second tour in Iraq , said he rarely spoke about the roadside bomb that hit his convoy of Humvees in Samarra that year .
He did n't speak to a chaplain , a counselor or even his wife .
His wife did n't find out about the blast until he returned home and she asked about a new badge on his uniform .
It was the combat action badge he received for the bombing .
Even then , he barely spoke of it .
" She wanted me to , " Moreland said .
" But I did n't want her to worry .
I knew I was coming back again . "
During a deployment near Baghdad 's explosive Sadr City from 2006 to 2007 — the peak years of the sectarian violence — Sgt. Christopher Dunne said his unit was hit by roadside bombs five times .
Six soldiers in his unit died .
He lost count of the number of firefights they got into .
Yet Dunne , 25 , a father of two from Kansas City , Kan. , said the option of mental health counseling was never there .
" There were people who were messed up , " Dunne said .
" A program can be there six , eight years , whatever , but it does n't matter if nobody knows about it .
I know guys in my unit that could 've used the programs . "
More assessments being done
Now the Army is hoping to get soldiers to open up about those experiences .
That 's why counselors are spending more time closer to the fighting front .
Just as most units have a doctor that they become familiar with , Hurt said they are trying to use the same principle with counselors .
" It 's different if you know the guy , " Hurt said .
" If I sit next to you in the chow line and we chat and you seem like a regular guy , I may be happy to talk to you about all my stuff because you 're going to get it . "
All troops leaving combat undergo a Post Deployment Health Assessment to screen for signs of depression , PTSD and other mental health problems .
Four years ago , the Army added another round of screening after the troops return home .
The Post Deployment Health Reassessment is now done three to six months after soldiers return to ensure that they are adjusting to life .
" You 've got to figure out what 's effective .
It 's a long , complicated road to figure it out , " Hurt said .
The efforts are to eliminate as much stress as possible to minimize suicidal tendencies , he said .
On his second tour , Dunne said things are completely different .
He said they are receiving briefings from mental health experts that are catered to their phase of deployment : the first 100 days , the middle of the tour , the last 100 days and adjusting to life back home .
" The briefs have been more often .
More targeted , " he said .
Matthews now sees the mental health of his soldiers as a critical aspect of his job and as a way to prevent suicides .
" I call it ' getting personal with your personnel , ' " Matthews said .
" I know who the high - risk soldiers are , and I know who the lower - risk soldiers are .
I know which soldiers have a privately owned weapon .
I know the soldiers who have motorcycles .
I know the soldiers who party hard at night .
" It 's not about invasion of privacy .
It 's about the people . "
Roles are winding down Just as military leaders settle on a systemwide approach to mental health , the security situation on the ground in Iraq has changed the kind of treatment they must give .
When violence peaked in Iraq during 2006 and 2007 , it was clear what psychiatrists had to watch for .
" Usually , it was something really horrific , like ' The guy next to me was cut in half by a ( bomb ) ' or ' My truck commander 's head was blown off and his severed head hit my head and knocked me out , ' " said Navy Capt .
Gregory Firman , a Vietnam War veteran who runs a PTSD clinic in Massachusetts and has counseled troops in Iraq .
As the pace of the war has slowed and troops transition into more of a peacekeeping and advisory role to the Iraqis , troops are struggling to downshift .
" I 've had guys say ' This is my fourth tour here and I have n't done anything .
I have n't shot my weapon once , ' " said Maj .
Kevin Gormley , commander of the 98th Combat Stress Control unit stationed in Baghdad .
" And I say ' That 's a good thing , right ? ' and he goes ' I guess , sir . ' " Pfc. Joe Funderburk said he 's tried to settle into life at Camp Liberty .
He and his roommate separated their room with their two wall lockers to give a sense of privacy .
Funderburk put up pictures of his mother and father .
He put up a flag of his alma mater , Alabama .
He bought a rug at the military store to make the small room feel homier .
He works out , watches DVDs , anything to pass the time .
" But you do get kind of stir crazy , " he said .
Navy Lt. Edmund Clark , a psychiatrist at Camp Liberty , said the lack of constant fighting does n't mean a tranquil state of relaxation , either .
Battles are still raging around the northern city of Mosul and other parts of the country and car bombs and mortar attacks still target Americans , if not as frequently .
Clark said the constant threat of the infrequent , random attack is still a heavy burden for any American in Iraq .
He said the slower tempo of the war has led to another surprising complication : too much contact with relatives .
Soldiers have more down time and more access to satellite phones and computers — where soldiers can e-mail , instant message or video chat with their families .
Clark said in previous wars , when communication amounted to maybe a letter a month , family problems would usually be resolved without any input , or stress , from the deployed soldier .
Now , soldiers are in the middle of any problem back home .
" I 've had to encourage commands to keep their soldiers engaged , have them do something , have them stay busy with something , " Clark said .
" Because having them just sit and instant message with the girlfriend that 's cheating on him — that kind of thing is not always helpful . "
Tragedy not always traumatic
The Army provides marriage counselors , financial assistance and several other " family readiness " programs to help soldiers straighten out their lives back home .
But it 's now up to people like Jarrett and his instructors to get their soldiers straight on the battlefield and hope they will help turn more soldiers away from committing suicide .
Venutto , the instructor , explains how a soldier will become traumatized and depressed if that is what they expect to happen following a tragedy .
If you expect to suffer , you will .
He urges them instead to listen to the words of Epictetus , a former Greek slave turned stoic philosopher .
" It is not the thing itself , but the view we take of it which disturbs us , " the quote reads .
During a break in a recent class , Jarrett said the military had no such training when he was in the 82nd Airborne Division in the early 1980s , or during his first tour in Baghdad in 2005 .
As he saw the war in Iraq escalating and kept hearing reports of soldiers struggling to cope with the stresses , the 47 - year - old corporate coach who was working toward a doctorate returned to the military and started the training course .
To explain its purpose , he points back to his home in Maplewood , N.J. , and a weed that was growing outside .
He tried to cut it away .
He tried weed killers .
He doused it in gasoline .
But still , it grew .
" Everything I did to it caused it to be stronger , " Jarrett said .
Completing the analogy , he explained that " soldiers are made stronger by what they go through . "

Obama will now implement various measures to fight what he believes is the threat of " climate change " .
Among those are his " Cap and trade scheme " that he for example explicitly mentioned in is remarks to the joint session of Congress An alternative approach to " cap and trade " is a straightforward carbon tax .
As I 've already pointed out , " cap and trade " is simply a euphemism for an alternative form of carbon tax .
What is then the real difference between " cap and trade " and a straightforward carbon tax ?
The difference lies in what element is fixed and what is variable ( what will fluctuate ) .
It is a basic truth within macroeconomics that monetary policy makers can only fix one target at the time .
If they try to fix exchange rates , then they 'll have to let consumer price inflation and money supply growth fluctuate .
If they try to target consumer price inflation , they 'll have to let money supply growth and the exchange rate fluctuate .
If they target money supply growth , they 'll have to let the exchange rate and consumer price inflation fluctuate .
This conflict also exists for politicians that try to reduce carbon dioxide emissions through economic incentives ( taxation ) .
Either they 'll have to fix the amount that emissions will be reduced and let the incentive fluctuate .
Or they 'll have to fix the incentive abnd let the emission reduction fluctuate .
In a " cap and trade " scheme the emission reduction is fixed , so fluctuations in demand for emissions will result in fluctuations in the tax on emissions .
In a straightforward carbon tax , the tax rate will be fixed so fluctuations in demand for emissions will result in fluctuations in actual emissions .
Which scheme is preferable , or which scheme is the lesser evil ?
" Cap and trade " is the worst of the two because they create an unnecessary ( artificial ) economic cost .
Leaving aside the issue of whether really emission reductions are a worthwhile goal , we have to ask which scheme produces the greatest economic cost .
While uncertainty about prices is necessary in many cases in order to avoid excess surpluses or shortages of goods and services , it is nevertheless always a bad thing in itself , which is why artificial uncertainty ( that do not fill any function ) is a bad thing , period .
" Cap and trade " creates such an artificial uncertainty for market participants .
Remember , the difference between " cap and trade " and straightforward carbon taxes lies in what is uncertain , the price ( tax ) or the amount of emission reductions .
While short - term fluctuations in emissions should n't be a problem for the politicians , short - term fluctuations in price is an example of the kind of artificial uncertainty that produces an economic cost as companies can't be sure of how much the tax will cost them , and they will therefore refrain from investments which will likely but not certainly be profitable .
So , while " cap and trade " and a straightforward carbon tax will not ( need not ) create any difference in the level of emissions , " cap and trade " will for any given level of average emissions impose a greater economic cost .
But if " cap and trade " produces a greater economic cost , why do Obama and many other politicians push for it ?
The most likely explanation is that " cap and trade " sounds better from a political point of view .
Obama frequently claims that he will not raise taxes for anyone with a family income of less than $ 250,000 a year , an assertion that is false for several reasons , including his planned " cap and trade " scheme " .
But since " cap and trade " does n't sound like a tax , Obama thinks he can get away with that lie , while he knows that anyone would recognize a straightforward carbon tax as a tax .
But make no mistake - " cap and trade " is a tax that you will all have to pay , and it is a tax that will damage the economy even more than most other taxes .
WASHINGTON – The United States plans to withdraw most of its troops from Iraq by August 2010 , according to Obama administration officials .
The withdrawal plan would fulfill one of President Obama ’s central campaign pledges , albeit a little more slowly than he promised .
He said he would withdraw troops within 16 months , roughly one brigade a month from the time of his inauguration .
August 2010 would be 19 months .
The officials said they expect Obama to make the announcement this week .
The US military will leave behind a residual force , between 30,000 and 50,000 troops , to continue advising and training Iraqi security forces , the two officials said .
Also staying beyond the 19 months will be intelligence and surveillance specialists and their equipment , including unmanned aircraft , they said .
A further withdrawal will take place before December 2011 , the period by which the United States agreed with Iraq to remove all American troops .
A senior White House official said yesterday that Obama is at least a day away from making a final decision .
He further said an announcement today was unlikely , but he said that Obama could discuss Iraq during a trip to North Carolina on Friday .
About 142,000 US troops are in Iraq , roughly 14 brigades , about 11,000 above the total in Iraq when then - President George W. Bush announced in January 2007 that he would start a “ surge ” in forces to put down the insurgency .
He sent an additional 21,000 combat troops to Baghdad and Anbar province .
Although the number of combat brigades has dropped from 20 to 14 , the United States has increased the number of logistical and other support troops .
Obama ’s campaign promise to withdraw troops in 16 months was based on a military estimate on what would be an orderly pace of removing troops , given the logistical difficulties of removing so many people and tons of equipment , a US military official said .
The 19 - month strategy is a compromise between commanders and advisers worried that security gains could backslide in Iraq , and those who think the bulk of US combat work is long done .
Because they lived and worked here in the past - for five years in the 1960s in Ms Tokley 's case - Australia pays a pro-rata portion of their pension under reciprocal welfare agreements .
Ms Tokley believes Australia contributes about $ 30 a week to her pension .
But in December she got the full $ 1400 stimulus payment .
And so did every other non-resident , non-citizen who - because they are from one of the countries in our reciprocal pension deal - are entitled to a full or part- pension from Australia .
If they are couples , they got the full $ 2100 stimulus bonus .
With a favourable exchange rate , Ms Tokley 's $ 1400 became $ NZ1658 .
" It does sound ridiculous , " she admits .
" But I 'm not going to say , ` No , I do n't want it . '
Who would say I do n't want $ 1600 ?
No way . "
Asked how she spent the money , she at first said : " I can't remember .
I think I got my teeth fixed , or new glasses .
Something like that . "
Later she corrected the record : " No , I know what I did .
I took a holiday to the South Island .
I 'm a tramper .
That 's a trekker , but we call it tramping here .
Yes , I had 16 days tramping in the South Island . "
Lovely ?
" Yes , thank you . "
Why not Tasmania ?
The Australian Government might have preferred you went tramping over here .
" I could n't afford that . "
The office of the Minister for Families and Community Services , Jenny Macklin , confirmed that the stimulus bonus went to 69,000 overseas pensioners in December .
But most of these were Australian citizens living overseas and her spokeswoman could not break it down to reveal the number of non-citizens getting the money .
The Opposition had already decried giving it to even Australians living abroad so they could stimulate the economies of Ireland , Cyprus , Italy and so on .
A Centrelink manager told a parliamentary committee that - based on a figure of about 60,000 pensioners overseas - it could amount to $ 75 million .
Under its international obligations , the Government had explained , it could not exclude one - off payments - even those meant to stimulate the local economy - from payments to Australians overseas .
But nor , it now emerges , can it exclude non-Australians living overseas .
Ms Tokley is far from alone .
A Bondi reader told the Herald of her surprise at receiving " a phone call from Germany , where my ex-husband resides for the last 46 years , after working several years in Australia " .
He , too , got the $ 1400 .
It was galling for the woman who , at 67 , still works and is entitled to none of the stimulus money .
Her ex-husband has not lived here since about 1963 .
" I can not begin to imagine how huge a sum of money has left our country and is stimulating other economies ! " she said .
The Government can't quite imagine , either , it seems .
Ms Macklin 's office could not put a figure on the stimulus money going to non-citizens .
In Auckland , Ms Tokley received a letter that began : " This payment is being made to Australians who . . . "
The intention seemed clear .
It was meant for Australians .
Ms Macklin 's spokeswoman said the reciprocal pension deal also worked in Australia 's favour .
" These agreements help to make sure Australians get social security protection when they move to particular countries , or when people from other countries move to Australia the government of the country in which they have spent most of their working years contributes to their support accordingly . "
But she had no answer for the following questions :
Why can't the stimulus payments be disentangled from pensions ?
Why , at least , ca n't they be paid pro rata , like the pension , to reflect the years of work and paying tax in Australia ?
How much of the new stimulus package , if any , will go overseas ?
Ms Tokley told the Herald : " If it 's any consolation , I am planning a trip to Australia . "
Loading
While tramping she met some Australians who recommended Nitmiluk National Park in the Northern Territory .
She will tramp there in August or September , and she will stay at least a month or two .
" So you 'll be getting your own back , after all . "
But what of all the others ?
Kevin Rudd might consider sending them a postcard .
Centrelink has their addresses .
" Wish you were here , " he might write .
Or : " Where the bloody hell are you ? "
Minnesota court ruling supports Franken ; Coleman appeal likely Jeremy Gantz
Published : Tuesday March 31 , 2009
Print This Email This
It could very well be the beginning of the end for Norm Coleman .
Or the harbinger of a whole new legal battle for his tireless lawyers .
As much as Al Franken 's lawyers celebrated it Tuesday , the long - awaited Minnesota state court ruling on Norm Coleman 's appeal of the Senate race recount has  you guessed it  not quite put an end to the post- election showdown , now more than four months long .
A three judge panel has ordered that up 400 absentee ballots that were rejected by election workers be opened and reviewed  far fewer than the 1,300 Coleman argued should be counted .
The ballots will be reviewed and many of them may be counted by Tuesday , April 7th  or not .
 To be clear , not every absentee ballot identified in this order will be ultimately be opened and counted , " the ruling said .
Franken was left with a 225 - vote lead after a hand recount of the election 's result in November , so an overwhelming portion of the 400 ballots would have to go to Coleman for him to lose his lead .
The decision is being celebrated by the Franken campaign as a win .
" The math is the math , " Marc Elias , Franken 's lawyer , said after the decision was announced Tuesday afternoon .
" We 'll find out on Tuesday [ April 7th ] what 's in these envelopes ( but ) the math is going to be very difficult for former senator Coleman and his legal team at this point ...
The vast majority of those ( absentee ballots ) were properly rejected . "
But even if the former comedian retains his lead after the court reviews the new lot of 400 ballots , a federal appeal case may be looming on the horizon .
On Monday , Texas Sen. John Coryn threatened " World War III " if Democrats tried to seat Franken before Coleman 's team pushed a potential appeal through federal courts .
If Franken is seated , he would be the 59th Democrat in the Senate , leaving his party just one vote shy of a filibuster - proof majority .
A few minutes after Franken 's lawyer embraced the court 's decision this afternoon , a Coleman attorney did exactly the opposite , calling the ruling " wrong " and vowing to appeal if necessary .
" If these points stand in any final order of the court , it will give us no choice but to appeal that order to the Minnesota Supreme Court , " Ben Ginsberg said .
" It is unfortunate that the court has taken this tact because it continues to disenfranchise thousands of Minnesotans . "
The seemingly endless struggle could end up costing Coleman if ultimately loses :
In legal documents filed early this month that summarized his side of the case , Franken asked the Minnesota state judges hearing the U.S. Senate trial to require his Republican opponent to pay court costs and some opposing attorneys ' fees if Coleman is unsuccessful in his lawsuit , Raw Story reported .
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
This past week , I caught an article in Wirschaftswoche ( WiWo ) , the German Business Week , which suggested that the South Koreans were very confident about their economy and had learned from the Asian Crisis .
Just today , the South Koreans released GDP numbers that many would find amazing , showing that the economy grew 0.1 % in the first quarter compared to Q1 2008 Q4 2008 .
Q4 2008 was a 5.1 % fall , so that ’s a pretty prodigious uptick which comes largely from household and private consumption .
It certainly begs the question as to whether the Asians are ‘ de - coupling , ’ a term I never though I would use in a positive sense .
What is clear from the reports at a minimum is that intra-Asian trade is increasing and keeping countries like Korea from feeling the full impact of the slow down in the West .
( A 30 % currency devaluation helps too . )
Below is a Bloomberg video on the Korean economy :
Also , here is what WiWo had to say ( my translation ) :
South Korea wants to present itself at the just opened Hanover Fair as a country with a promising future – and as an unbroken dynamic export nation .
The worst is behind the country .
But , the Koreans find one development unpleasant .
Like a ballerina , the young lady dances around in front of the black sedan of Mr. Yoo .
She leads the heavy but graceful Hyundai into the car park at the Seoul Lotte warehouse and bows so deeply that her little pink hat almost touches the ground .
She chirps , that she is sorry for the precious time that had to be wasted by the important Client in the queue .
Yoo Jae -Wook , head of consultancy Nemo Partners , sees the ‘ parking show , ’ as a good sign : “ Every day the same large crowd .
Officially , we have crisis , but they are all go shopping ! ”
South Korea , this year the official partner country at the Hanover Fair , wants to present itself to the world as a haven of stability amid the present global crisis .
This is not only outdoor advertising , but is quite the mood in the country itself .
The fourth largest economy in Asia has come through the global shock calm .
Quite unlike the Asian crisis of 1997 / 98 , when some Koreans even donated their gold to support the economy .
“ In Seoul , they are not making cuts to their quality of life , ” says Kim Nan-Do from the National University in Seoul .
The Koreans , according to the local Siemens boss Josef Meilinger , understand the global crisis as an opportunity : “ You look at which share of the world pie you can grab now . ”
Crisis ?
What Crisis ?
What crisis überhaupt ?
The Koreans come to Hanover full of self - confidence : “ Our economy is overcoming the global crisis faster than other countries , ” said Cho Hwan - Eik , president of the trade promotion company Kotra , .
“ We have high - performance products , sophisticated marketing strategies , and government and businesses have relatively low debt - burdens .
Indeed , South Korea with government debt of 38.5 percent of annual gross domestic product is much better than Japan , for example , with almost 185 percent .
The country has dealt with the recession from just over a decade ago and it is partially immunized against new problems – at least in many Koreans opinion .
“ The Asian crisis has made us seem well trained .
We have learned to survive , ” says business consultant Yoo .
In the areas of information technology , electronics , shipbuilding and auto industries , South Korean firms are forcing their way into the world class tier , but also lately in green technologies .
In addition : The banking system is reasonably stable .
“ In comparison to the great Asian crisis a decade ago , our banking and financial system today is less vulnerable , ” says Jong - Goo Yi of the state financial oversight of FSC .
At that time , many indebted Korean conglomerates like the car manufacturer Daewoo and KIA , the Hanbo steel producer as well as several banks were forced into bankruptcy or had to give up their independence .
Today , however , the liquidity of the 44 major Korean corporations is “ so high that these companies have even more months to survive crisis , ” says Yi .
Cautious optimism in the boardrooms
It is also reassuring , according to Yi , that the Korean banks , on average , have less than one percent of their loan portfolio in “ toxic ” assets – they have little invested in complicated derivatives .
Accordingly , the financial structure is much healthier than in Europe or the USA .
In the boardrooms of the export - dependent companies , the typical sound is somewhat subdued optimism .
In 2008 , the export share of the economy was about 55 percent .
Now , in the face of the crisis of world trade , sensitive setbacks are threatening .
“ Until now we have had the rapid depreciation of the won to hold us above water , ” said Ko-Yung Sang of Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul .
Against the dollar , the exchange rate of the Korean currency fell by almost 30 percent in the past twelve months .
So Korea ’s largest car manufacturer Hyundai / KIA lost in the U.S. less than one tenth of its turnover , although the total there saw a 40 per cent fall .
The worst for Korea could already be behind them .
The most difficult month was January , when the Korean exports crashed 34.2 percent .
Afterward , the figures have improved .
In March , the trade surplus was even at a record high of 4.6 billion U.S. dollars .
For 2009 , the economy ministry expects an increase of approximately 20 billion U.S. dollars , significantly more than previous estimates .
Even in crisis , South Koreans can rely on their main trading partner China , which at last count bought 23 percent of all Korean exports – 14 percent went to the European Union , and nearly ten to the U.S. .
Above all , the shipbuilders were successful : Korean shipbuilders recorded a sales increase of 61 percent in March .
Such export power could ensure that South Korea ’s recession in 2009 is relatively mild with a fall of minus two percent , the government previously estimated .
Some prognosticators still hold a crash of up to six percent possible .
The FKI Industries notes , however , that the mood among business people has improved significantly .
“ The downturn will lose significant momentum , ” said JP Morgan economist Lim Ji-Won Lim .
He holds a recovery already this summer for possible .
Need for social consensus is growing
Koreans feel uncomfortable , however , with the development of its labor market – despite the fact that other industrialized countries might be jealous at the figures .
The unemployment rate has gone since February 2008 from 3.5 to 3.9 percent .
Especially small and medium - sized enterprises should cut some 200,000 further jobs , which would bring the rate upward a further percentage point .
Therefore , the need for social consensus is rising .
Entrepreneurs , workers and government have agreed on a program “ to share the social pain . ”
In many companies the employees take up to 30 percent wage cuts .
Managers voluntarily reduce their salaries , officials waive ten percent of their salaries and donate the money for the needy .
Several unions , in fact notorious for militant strikes , want to work , fighting to forgo wage increases – in exchange for guaranteed jobs and recruitment .
In addition , the government is on a major stimulus program : 25 billion euros – about 2.5 percent of gross domestic product – to keep the economy on track :
“ The main objective is the preservation of jobs , ” President Lee Myung - Bak announced .
The same applies for the job of dancing white car park in the Lotte department store .
Strikingly , many customers pay with cash coupons , which the State distributed as part of the economic program to 2.6 million poorer citizens .
By By Chris Hogg Feb 25 , 2009 in Business According to a letter released by TMZ , Nadya Suleman has been offered up to $ 1 million to star in a porn film produced by Vivid Entertainment .
Suleman recently gave birth to eight babies , earning her the nickname " Octo - Mom . "
The only thing that can make you more famous than giving birth to eight kids , is if you already have six at home .
The only thing that can top that , is if you star in a porn after .
Just ask Octo -Mom Nadya Suleman who has seen a firestorm of media coverage since giving birth to her eight children .
Suleman has been in the press recently after reports surfaced she was having financial difficulty and could With added financial burden , Suleman has no doubt been looking for ways to make ends meet .
Perhaps surprising , however , is when a job offer comes along from a porn company .
A letter released by TMZ ( see it Vivid Entertainment made the offer to Suleman , and is famous for other adult productions such as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee 's sex tape .
" We hope you will give this project serious consideration , " Vivid co-chairman says in the letter , " and that you will contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter . "
Suleman has not commented publicly on whether she 'll take the offer .
Also , there has been no word from Vivid on a working title for the film .
Any guesses ?

Businesses , educational institutions , governmental agencies and other organizations around the world are converting 1 their computer operating systems from Microsoft Windows to Linux at an increasing pace .
They are likewise converting their application programs from commercial software to free software ( also referred to as open source software ) .
There are at least 25 reasons for this situation , including : ( 1 ) Because it is licensed under a free software license 2 , Linux ( as well as other free software ) is available at no cost .
It can be downloaded from the Internet for free , and it can be purchased in disk or box form at trivial cost .
One copy can be used on as many computers as desired with no restrictions .
This is in sharp contrast to Microsoft Windows , which can easily cost US $ 100 or more per computer .
( 2 ) Because it is free software , Linux is also free in the sense that anybody is permitted to modify it , including its source code , in any way desired .
If modified versions are not redistributed ( i.e. , given away or sold outside of an organization ) , they can be kept secret .
This is also in sharp contrast to Microsoft Windows , for which modification of the software is generally not permitted .
Source code is the original version of a program as it is written by a programmer using a programming language and before being converted by a compiler into a form such that its instructions can be understood directly by a computer 's CPU ( central processing unit ) ; it is generally necessary to have the source code in order to be able to make changes to a program .
This ability to freely experiment with and modify the source code , and to do so without disclosing the modifications to outsiders , has been a very important consideration for a number of large organizations 3 .
( 3 ) High quality support for Linux is available for free on the Internet , including in newsgroups and other forums .
Some people claim that this support is at least as good as that provided for proprietary ( i.e. , commercial ) operating systems for a fee .
Linux support can also be purchased on a commercial basis if desired .
Among the types of support that can be required for operating systems are help with customization , assistance in installing new programs , patches to cope with new security threats and patches to fix newly discovered bugs ( i.e. , defects ) .
Fortunately , the need for the last two types is relatively infrequent for Linux . ( 4 ) There is little possibility that support for Linux will be discontinued at some future date due to planned obsolescence or for any other reason .
This is because the source code will always be available to anyone who wants it , including individuals who provide support for free over the Internet and businesses which provide it for a fee .
In contrast , with Microsoft Windows and other proprietary software for which the source code is usually kept secret , obtaining support becomes difficult ( from both a technical and a legal point of view ) if the developer decides to withdraw it ( for example in order to try to force users to pay for upgrades to newer versions ) .
( 5 ) There is little or no fear of major obsolescence , planned or otherwise , with Linux .
This is because the UNIX architecture on which it is based has been exhaustively tested and refined for more than 35 years and has proven to be extremely efficient , robust and secure .
Improvements continue at a rapid pace , but new versions remain basically compatible with the underlying UNIX architecture .
( 6 ) There are no forced upgrades 4 for Linux users .
This because older versions continue to be supported ( e.g. , with the development of new security patches and device drivers ) and because newer versions , if desired , are available for free ( as is all free software ) and are typically highly compatible with older versions .
The developers of proprietary software , however , have strong financial incentives to engage in planned obsolescence , namely , in order to induce users of earlier versions to spend money to buy or lease new versions .
( 7 ) Should a user decide to upgrade to a newer version of Linux , there are no licensing fees or other software costs if the user selects a free distribution ( i.e. , version ) .
Moreover , the training , program modification / conversion , hardware acquisition and other costs associated with upgrading to a new version are also relatively low due to the compatibility with earlier versions .
( 8 ) Linux has no onerous requirements for keeping track of licenses .
In a company with hundreds or thousands of computers , a number of full time personnel can be required just to make sure that all of the computers in use are in compliance with the complex licensing terms of the EULAs ( end user license agreements ) for Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Office and other proprietary software .
And for Linux users there is no fear of surprise audits by the BSA ( Business Software Alliance ) 5 , with possible severe penalties for minor license violations .
( 9 ) Linux features superior security , including a very low rate of infection by viruses , trojans , worms , spyware and other malware .
This is because UNIX and all of its descendants ( including Linux ) been designed from the ground up with security in mind , rather than having attempts at security tacked on as an afterthought .
For example , users do not routinely use the system as the root ( i.e. , administrative ) user , thereby protecting key system files even in the event of a break - in by a malicious intruder .
Also , a robust firewall is included in major distributions and it is enabled by default .
Another important factor is the free availability of the source code , which allows thousands of people around the globe to search for security vulnerabilities in it 6 .
( 10 ) Linux is highly resistant to system crashes and rarely needs rebooting ( i.e. , restarting ) .
This can be very important for large organizations for which even a few minutes of down time can result in a substantial cost .
The reason is that Linux has been designed from the ground up to be an extremely stable and robust operating system , incorporating all that has been learned about attaining these goals from the more than 35 years of history of Unix - like operating systems .
( 11 ) Although the number and variety of application programs for Linux are not yet as large as those available for the Microsoft Windows operating systems , an extensive selection already exists and it is continuing to increase rapidly as more and more developers start creating programs for Linux .
Most Linux applications are also free software ( including nearly all of the most popular ones ) , and many have features and performance equal or superior to those of comparable applications for use with Microsoft Windows .
In fact , users often find that all the applications that they want are freely available on the Internet and that it is no longer necessary to purchase any commercial software .
( 12 ) There is a choice of numerous distributions ( several hundred ) of Linux , each with its own unique set of characteristics but all basically compatible with each other .
This allows users to select the versions which best meet their specific requirements .
It also means that if one provider of Linux were to go out of business , there would still be many others from which to choose .
Moreover , it fosters a healthy competition among them , thereby contributing to the continuous improvements in Linux 's quality and performance .
If the choice seems overwhelming , it is usually difficult to make a mistake by selecting one of the most popular distributions , such as Red Hat or SuSE .
( 13 ) Linux features a high degree of flexibility of configuration , and a great deal of customization can be accomplished very easily and without having to modify the source code .
For example , it is a simple matter to configure Linux during installation so that it will be optimized for use as a workstation , desktop computer , notebook computer , web server , database server or a router .
Likewise , the appearance and behavior of the desktop , including icons and menus , can be configured in an almost infinite number of ways , according to user tastes or requirements .
They can even be made to resemble Microsoft Windows .
Should this not be enough , the ability to freely access , revise and recompile the source code allows virtually unlimited flexibility of configuration .
( 14 ) Linux and other free software uses open format file formats .
These are formats for word processing , spreadsheet and other file types that conform to industry - wide standards and which can be used by any developer of software to create compatible programs , in contrast to the closed formats commonly used by some proprietary software .
This eliminates the problem of lock - in to proprietary standards , with the consequent difficulty and expense of switching to other software in the future .
It allows the user to have complete control of its data , particularly in the event that at some future date the developer who originally created the software goes out of business or stops supporting its earlier software .
( 15 ) Linux is generally faster for a given set of hardware specifications .
This is due to greater optimization of the source code , including far less code bloat .
( 16 ) Linux features a high degree of compatibility with other operating systems .
For example , it can read , write , copy , erase and otherwise manipulate data that resides on Microsoft Windows partitions on the same hard disk drive ( HDD ) , act as a Windows server for a network containing Windows clients , format disks for use with Windows , and even run Windows programs directly if necessary .
In contrast , the Microsoft Windows operating systems cannot access HDD partitions that contain other operating systems , cannot format disks for other operating systems , etc. ( 17 ) Very high ethical standards are maintained for Linux and other free software , in large part due to the very openness of their development process and the free availability of the source code .
Linux has never been convicted in a Federal court of violation of U.S. antitrust laws or other crimes , nor has it had to pay penalties for the unauthorized copying of technology developed by other companies .
Antitrust refers to government policy to regulate or break up monopolies in order to promote free competition and attain the benefits that such competition can provide to the economy and to society as a whole .
( 18 ) Linux reduces the need to upgrade or replace hardware when upgrading to newer versions .
This is because its code is very efficient and compact , thus allowing it to work effectively on older computers that are not suitable for the newest versions of Microsoft Windows .
( 19 ) Linux is capable of operating on a wide variety of platforms ( i.e. , processor and system types ) , rather than just being limited to Intel - compatible processors and computers .
It scales well and is well suited for use on a diverse array of equipment ranging from supercomputers to industrial robots to electronic medical equipment to cell phones ( and can even run on a wristwatch ) .
( 20 ) Linux is a superior choice for use in academic institutions for a number of reasons .
Among them is the fact that there are no secrets ( in sharp contrast to proprietary software ) , thereby providing students the opportunity to study how computers really work rather than to just learn how to use them .
Many educators are convinced that it is far more important for students to study computer science fundamentals than to practice specific applications ( such as Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint ) .
One reason is that computer science fundamentals will still be valid many years from now , whereas the specific application programs , especially the proprietary ones that do not conform to industry - wide standards , are constantly changing and those currently in use will likely become obsolete in a few years 7 . ( 21 )
For governmental agencies , Linux and other free software allows for transparency of data because it stores the data in formats consistent with industry - wide standards .
This is in contrast to the proprietary , closed formats characteristic of commercial software .
Such transparency is important for maintaining an effective democracy .
Keeping non-secret data in standards - compliant formats allows anyone to access it without having to purchase expensive proprietary software .
Also , storing secret data in standards - compliant formats is widely regarding as being more secure than keeping it in proprietary formats .
( 22 ) With Linux and other free software there is little reason to fear the existence of backdoors , in large part because all of the source code is available for inspection .
A backdoor is a secret method for obtaining remote access to a computer .
There is a ( not unjustified ) concern by many foreign governments and corporations that back doors have been covertly inserted into proprietary software that could allow the software developer and agencies of other governments to snoop into their most confidential data .
( 23 ) Using and advocating Linux helps foster a healthy diversity and increased competition throughout the software industry .
Such competition can promote technological advance , improve performance and lower costs for open source software and proprietary software alike .
Both economic theory and hundreds of years of real - world experience clearly show that monopolies have little incentive to innovate , tend to produce shoddy products , charge inflated prices and tend to corrupt the political system .
( 24 ) Linux and other free software have not only caught up with , or some cases surpassed , their proprietary counterparts , but they are also developing at a faster pace 8 .
This trend will accelerate as demand for such software continues to grow and more and more individuals and organizations become actively involved it its development .
( 25 ) Linux and other free software provide the opportunity for users to contribute to the advance of software technology because the source code is freely available to study , improve , extend and redistribute .
This has been fairly common , and the most notable corporate example has been IBM .
In addition to giving back to the software community and being a virtue in itself , such contributions can have great public relations value .
( 26 ) There are actually more than 25 reasons that organizations around the world are converting to Linux and other free software .
A twenty - sixth reason is that with Linux , in contrast to the Microsoft Windows operating systems , there is no need to defragment HDDs .
Fragmentation , which is the spreading of data into non-contiguous locations on a hard disk drive , can reduce the efficiency of data storage and slow down computer operation .
Defragmentation is not difficult , but it can be an annoyance to have to do it periodically , and it is unnecessary with a well designed operating system .
There are also several situations in which businesses and other organizations might benefit from converting their operating systems from Linux to Microsoft Windows : ( 1 ) An organization that is downsizing its operation and already has valid but unused licenses for Microsoft Windows might be able to reduce personnel costs by replacing its Linux experts with Windows administrators , as the latter can generally be hired for significantly less than Linux administrators .
( 2 ) Were Microsoft to offer an organization an extremely low cost incentive package , including providing long - term licenses ( and upgrades ) at nominal cost , paying for new hardware and providing free training and support , this could be a very attractive proposition .
In fact , it could be a win - win situation because of the great publicity value that could accrue to Microsoft from a company or other organization converting from Linux to Windows .

1 For links to articles about some recent conversions to Linux , see Linux Success Stories , The Linux Information Project , December 2005 .
2 Linux and most other free software is licensed under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) .
This highly successful license has been specifically designed to provide as much freedom as possible for users , both in a monetary sense and with regard to use .
The GPL allows anyone to freely access the source code for software licensed under it in order to study , use , modify , extend and redistribute it as desired with only the very minimal requirements of always making the source code for redistributions of modified versions freely available and including a copy of the GPL text with the software .
It should be pointed out in this context that there are also compiled versions of Linux that are not free in a monetary sense , which is also permitted by the GPL .
However , they are not necessarily any better than the free versions .
Businesses and other organizations have the option of selecting whether they want a free or non-free version , and if they select the former , they have many distributions from which to choose .
3
This is a major reason that Google selected Linux , according to industry sources .
4 Forced upgrades occur when the developer stops supporting an earlier version of its software , and thus security patches for the newest viruses and other malware become unavailable and drivers are no longer developed for new hardware .
Thus , many users have little choice but to purchase or lease the newest version .
This can be very costly because of the licensing fees or other payments that must be made to the software developer or vendor .
Further adding to the cost is the frequent need to purchase new hardware to accommodate the bloated code in the new versions of the software .
In addition , installing the new software and troubleshooting it can be very time - consuming for system administrators and disruptive for business operations .
5
The highly controversial BSA is an international organization that was set up by major developers of proprietary software .
It is empowered by the mandatory EULAs accompanying such software to make surprise audits on users and to levy heavy fines in the event of violation .
6
The is the same principle that is employed by public key cryptography ( PKC ) , which is the most secure form of data encryption .
And it is the opposite of the approach used with proprietary software , for which an attempt is made to keep the source code secret as a means of hiding security vulnerabilities .
7
For a more detailed look at the reasons that Linux is the best choice for use in educational institutions , see Linux and Education , The Linux Information Project , March 2004 .
8 Numerous examples could be cited .
For example , Apache is the dominant web server , hosting far more web sites than any of its proprietary counterparts .
Likewise , it is widely agreed that the free Firefox web browser is far more advanced ( in terms of security , usability , etc. ) than Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
Internet Explorer is free in a monetary sense , but it is not free software because the source code is not made available and users are prohibited from modifying it .

This talk was given at the 2009 Austrian Scholars Conference at the Mises Institute .
It is available as an MP3 audio download .
Our current income tax system , inaugurated in 1913 with the adoption of the 16th Amendment , began with a 1 percent tax on taxable income above $ 3,000 ( $ 4,000 for married couples ) .
A series of surcharges of up to 6 percent were applied to higher incomes , with the maximum rate being 7 percent on taxable income over $ 500,000 .
Less than 0.5 percent of the population ended up paying income tax .
From these humble beginnings , the income tax soon blossomed , thanks to World War I , into a tax with a minimum rate that doubled and a maximum rate that reached 77 percent on income of over $ 1 million .
The rates did not fall significantly until 1925 .
In the middle of the Great Depression , the top rate rose to 79 percent .
During World War II , the tax rate for those in the highest income bracket reached an astounding 94 percent .
The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 resulted in 24 brackets with rates ranging from 20 to 91 percent .
The top rate remained at 91 percent until 1964 .
Under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , the top marginal tax rates were lowered to 50 and 28 percent respectively .
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2001 established the current tax brackets of 10 , 15 , 25 , 28 , 33 , and 35 percent .
There is no question that the federal tax code is too long , too complex , too intrusive , too confusing , and too inequitable .
The members of Congress responsible for the tax code would not even disagree .
As a consequence , cries for tax reform can always be heard from every quarter — and especially around election time .
There are even organizations dedicated solely to tax reform , such as Americans for Tax Reform , Reform AMT , Citizens for Tax Justice , and Americans for Fair Taxation .
Since the federal government is always looking to increase its revenue while at the same time making Americans feel better about paying their taxes , it has also climbed aboard the tax - reform bus , most recently in 2005 when President Bush formed the President ’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform .
I am sorry to say that principled libertarians who welcome gradualism toward the goal of substantially reducing or abolishing the income tax while at the same time shunning any compromise of the principle that taxation is theft — like those friends and supporters of the Mises Institute — are in the minority .
Left - liberals , who want to use the tax code for their social engineering and income redistribution schemes , are not opposed to taxes on principle .
Barack Obama ran campaign commercials openly boasting that no taxes would be raised on any American making under $ 250,000 .
This , of course , means that he intends to fleece any American making over this amount .
Conservatives are not generally opposed to taxes on principle either .
They have no problem taxing the American people to fund bloated defense budgets , US military adventures around the world , the CIA , FBI , and anything related to law enforcement or homeland security , faith - based welfare programs , educational vouchers , abstinence - education programs , the war on drugs , and various conservative pork projects .
But what ’s up with libertarians ?
Brink Lindsey , of the Cato Institute , supposedly a libertarian think tank , wrote in an online article for the New Republic that also appeared on the Cato website :
Tax reform also offers the possibility of win-win bargains .
The basic idea is simple :
Shift taxes away from things we want more of and onto things we want less of .
Specifically , cut taxes on savings and investment , cut payroll taxes on labor , and make up the shortfall with increased taxation of consumption .
Go ahead , tax the rich , but do n’t do it when they ’re being productive .
Tax them instead when they ’re splurging — by capping the deductibility of home - mortgage interest and tax incentives for purchasing health insurance .
And tax everybody ’s energy consumption .
All taxes impose costs on the economy , but at least energy taxes carry the silver lining of encouraging conservation — plus , because such taxes exert downward pressure on world oil prices , foreign oil monopolies would wind up getting stuck with part of the bill .
Shift taxes ?
Increase taxes ?
Tax the rich ?
Impose new taxes ?
Use the tax code to influence public policy ?
What kind of libertarian tax reform plan is this ?
How about reduce , cut , eliminate , and abolish taxes ?
Not deductions , not exemptions , not credits , not shelters , not loopholes — taxes .
Two specific tax reform plans that some libertarians have fallen for are the Flat Tax and the FairTax .
Both plans promise to invigorate the economy , increase employment , and raise everyone ’s standard of living .
Neither one is true to its name ; neither one is an incremental step toward overall lower taxes .
Both are fraught with problems and contradictions ; both are revenue - neutral plans that would fund the federal government at the same obscene level that it is now .
The Flat Tax is an income tax .
It is the tax - reform idea that has been around the longest .
First proposed by economist Milton Friedman in 1962 , the flat tax entered the mainstream through a 1981 Wall Street Journal article by Hoover Institution economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka called “ A Proposal to Simplify Our Tax System . ”
This article grew into a 1985 book published by the Hoover Institution Press called The Flat Tax .
A second edition was published in 1995 , and an “ updated revised edition ” in 2007 that can hardly be called either .
Aside from this book , the Flat Tax gained national prominence when House Majority Leader Dick Armey ( R - TX ) pushed the idea of a Flat Tax after the Republicans gained control of Congress during the Clinton administration .
A few bills based on the Hall - Rabushka plan were then introduced in Congress , but came to nothing .
Other incarnations of the Flat Tax were pushed by both Democrats and Republicans .
Another incarnation of the Flat Tax is that of former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes .
His 2005 book is called Flat Tax Revolution .
Under a Flat Tax , everyone ’s income is taxed at the same rate ( Forbes says 17 percent ; Hall and Rabushka say 19 percent ) .
And not only are there no tax brackets , there are generally no tax deductions other than personal and dependent allowances .
Social Security and Medicare taxes would remain as they are now .
The appeal of the Flat Tax is simplicity .
You can do your taxes on a postcard - sized form says Forbes .
Goodbye compliance costs .
The problem with the Flat Tax is a simple one : the Flat Tax is not flat .
And furthermore , no one actually pays 17 or 19 percent .
In fact , taxpayers do n’t even pay the same percentage .
The Flat Tax is actually a highly progressive tax .
It is more progressive than our current system , and effectively has more tax brackets .
Who said progressivity requires graduated tax rates ?
Under the Forbes plan , a family of four would pay no federal income tax on its first $ 46,165 of income ; a family of six would owe nothing until its income exceeded $ 65,930 .
And those figures are sure to have increased since they were first proposed back in 2005 .
But not only would many families pay no income tax , they still might get a refund anyway because the Forbes plan includes a refundable child credit and earned - income credit .
If you want an example of a real flat tax , look no further than the 2.9 percent Medicare tax .
Everyone pays 2.9 percent ( split between employer and employee ) , on every dollar earned , no matter one ’s marital status , number of dependents , or income level .
I am in favor of neither the tax nor Medicare , but if you are looking for a genuine flat tax , then the Medicare tax is your tax .
The FairTax is a consumption tax .
It is the most radical tax reform plan , bar none .
It also has the most vocal and intolerant proponents .
The FairTax is the brainchild of three businessmen concerned about the crippling effects on the economy of the current federal tax code .
After adopting the name “ FairTax ” for their tax - reform plan , they formed Americans for Fair Taxation in 1997 and enlisted Representative John Linder ( R - GA ) to introduce FairTax legislation in Congress .
Linder first sponsored the “ Fair Tax Act ” in the House in July of 1999 , and has reintroduced a FairTax bill at the beginning of every term of Congress since then , including the current one .
Although Linder ’s FairTax bill languishes in the House Committee on Ways and Means each time it is introduced , it has always had a number of cosponsors , including Tom Tancredo and Duncan Hunter — but not Ron Paul , the acknowledged taxpayers ’ best friend .
It also has its share of supporters outside of Congress , including Mike Huckabee and Neal Boortz .
The latter is the author , with Congressman Linder , of The FairTax Book , published in 2005 .
A paperback version of The FairTax Book was issued in 2006 with some notable changes to correct false statements made in the original hardcover release of the book .
Boortz and Linder also published a sequel , FairTax : The Truth , Answering the Critics , just last year .
I am getting weary of writing about the FairTax .
Every time I think I ’ve written my last article on the subject , some new opportunity presents itself and I take the bait , as I am doing right now .
I do n’t consider myself to be an expert on the FairTax .
Although the idea of the FairTax has been around since 1997 , I had never even heard of the FairTax until I wrote an article for the Mises Institute in 2005 on the evils of the withholding tax .
It was only after my inbox was bombarded with mail from FairTaxers trying to sell me on the FairTax that I looked into it .
If you have read any of my articles on the subject you know that I did n’t like what I saw .
The FairTax is a national retail sales tax of 30 percent on the final sale of all new goods and services .
All new goods — from cars and houses to prescription drugs and food ; and all services — from operations and funerals to rent and haircuts .
Because it would replace the personal income tax , there would also no longer be withholding tax , capital - gains tax , the alternative - minimum tax , or taxes on interest and dividends .
Even your gambling winnings would no longer be taxed .
Of course , there would be no tax deductions either .
The FairTax would likewise eliminate corporate income tax , estate tax , gift tax , unemployment tax , Social Security tax , and Medicare tax .
The appeal is obvious : no more complex tax code , no more taxes withheld from paychecks , no more 1040 forms , no more record keeping , no more compliance costs , no more IRS audits .
And if that were n’t enough , the FairTax also includes a monthly rebate to offset the taxes paid on basic necessities .
But for a plan that promises such a utopia , the problems with the FairTax are legion .
The stated rate of the FairTax is too low to achieve the promised revenue neutrality .
The amount by which it is claimed that prices would fall under a FairTax system has been grossly exaggerated .
There is nothing to prevent an income tax from being reinstituted , giving us a two - headed hydra of an income tax and a consumption tax .
And not only would state and local governments have to pay a national sales tax to the federal government , the federal government would have to pay sales taxes to itself on all its new purchases .
Since I have already written extensively about the problems with the FairTax , I will stop with its problems here and focus on why the FairTax , like the Flat Tax , is not true to its name .
So why is the FairTax not fair ?
Well , first of all , what ’s fair about a consumption tax ?
Why is it that people who rightly criticize the income tax are so quick to accept a national sales tax on consumption ?
The FairTax perpetuates the fallacy that the government has a right to confiscate a percentage of the value of each new good sold and every service rendered .
This is no different than claiming that the government has a right to the portion of each American ’s income .
As Murray Rothbard explained ,
The consumption tax , on the other hand , can only be regarded as a payment for permission - to - live .
It implies that a man will not be allowed to advance or even sustain his own life , unless he pays , off the top , a fee to the State for permission to do so .
The consumption tax does not strike me , in its philosophical implications , as one whit more noble , or less presumptuous , than the income tax .
The FairTax is also not fair because of the rate .
What is fair about the government taking a 30 percent cut on every transaction ?
I know the FairTaxers claim that the rate is only 23 percent , but when I buy an item for $ 1.00 and end up paying $ 1.30 , the basic math I learned in elementary school tells me that I paid a tax rate of 30 percent .
But regardless of whether the rate is 23 or 30 percent , why should the bloated , pork - laden leviathan we call the US government get anywhere near this much of our income ?
And finally , maintaining that the FairTax is a “ fair ” tax system , or one that is “ fairer ” than our current system , is highly subjective .
Boortz himself even acknowledges this in his newest book on the FairTax : “ Whether a tax system is ‘ fair ’ is a complicated economic and philosophical question , one that inevitably involves oversimplification and subjective judgment . ”
If you want an example of a real fair tax , then consider the equal tax .
I first saw this proposed by Joe Sobran .
Let every American pay the same amount — no deductions , no exemptions , and no exceptions .
Sobran reasons ,
The billionaire does n’t use the police or the streets any more than the pauper .
Maybe less , since he presumably hires private guards to protect him and has less need of the police , and he is less likely to drive long distances than to fly .
Now , I would n’t like paying this tax any more than I like paying income tax , but it is certainly a fair tax .
But not only is the Flat Tax not flat and the FairTax not fair , the Flat Tax is not fair and the FairTax is not flat .
Let me repeat that : not only is the Flat Tax not flat and the FairTax not fair , the Flat Tax is not fair and the FairTax is not flat .
According to Hall and Rabushka , the flat - tax system they propose is both “ fair and progressive — the poor pay no tax , and the amount that a family pays rises with income . ”
They say their Flat Tax is fair because it is based on the principle that “ income should be taxed exactly once , as close as possible to its source . ”
But how can a system that punishes success and fosters class envy be considered “ fair ” ?
And why should it be considered “ fair ” that income is taxed “ exactly once , as close as possible to its source ” ?
Just because every American would pay the same rate under the Flat Tax does n’t necessarily make it a fair tax .
Making the tax code less progressive is not enough .
As Rothbard again explains ,
The flat - tax movement is part of a process by which the government and its allies have been able to split and deflect the tax protest movement from trying to lower the taxes of everyone , into trying to force everyone into paying some arbitrarily defined “ fair share . ”
It is no consolation to a wealthy person who is stripped of his money by the federal government that a poorer person is likewise relieved of his money by the same percentage .
One of the reasons FairTax supporters claim that their tax is fair is that it has a flat rate that everyone would pay .
But the FairTax is about as flat as it is fair .
I already mentioned that the FairTax includes a monthly rebate to offset the taxes paid on basic necessities .
This “ prebate ” is based on the government poverty level and family size .
Thus , although everyone would pay the same rate under the FairTax , the end result would be that some Americans would pay no taxes at all , some would have most of their taxes offset , and some would get more money back than they paid in taxes .
This makes the FairTax an income redistribution scheme under the guise of tax reform .
Neither the Flat Tax nor the FairTax is a step toward the libertarian goal of substantially reducing or abolishing the income tax ; neither tax - reform plan is an incremental step toward lower overall taxes .
They could be , however , if their promoters recognized that the problem is taxation itself , not the tax code .
All they have done is shift the debate from how much of the wealth of the American people the federal government confiscates to the manner in which the wealth is confiscated .
We do n’t need compassionate tax reform that makes people feel better about paying their taxes ; we need radical tax reform that reduces , cuts , eliminates , and abolishes taxes without replacing them with other taxes .
As I have quoted Congressman Ron Paul on many occasions , “ The real issue is total spending by government , not tax reform . ”
With the federal budget fast approaching $ 4 trillion , I ca n’t think of anything that is more of a waste of time than quibbling about how the government can make the tax rates flatter or fairer while it robs us of trillions of dollars .
The only fair tax is a tax low enough to flatten skyrocketing congressional spending .
Like educational vouchers and the privatization of Social Security , the Flat Tax and the FairTax are gimmicks that libertarians should avoid .

The Corrugator , this is a great Instructible !
I used a different method to boost the output power , which will work not only for the Belkin Tunecast , but for ANY transmitter which uses a BH1415 F , or even any other Rohm FM transmitter chip .
Instead of trying to figure out what components were involved in the filter / attenuation network , I used a soldering iron and a toothpick to lift and disconnect BH1415 F pin # 11 ( RF output ) from the board .
Then I soldered a quarter - wave wire antenna directly to the pin , which gives direct access to the maximum possible output power .
Make sure the wire is secured so an accidental tug wo n't rip the pin off the IC ; I used a generous application of super glue to attach the wire to the board near the connection .
If a transmitter uses a different Rohm FM transmitter chip than the BH1415 F , look up the datasheet to find out which pin is RF output .
The real gold in this Instructable is the auto power - off disable .
I 've been using this transmitter to listen to music from my computer anywhere in the house , and have been looking for a good way to disable the auto power - off .
Up until now , I 've been doing it by running a separate copy of Winamp that plays a subsonic or ultrasonic burst for two seconds , every 30 seconds in a loop .
It worked , but on some radios you could hear a slight distortion when the burst played .
This may still be a useful option for people who are n't comfortable soldering , or who have a different transmitter .
I just performed your auto power - off disable mod , and it works great !
Though I did make one change .
The pad you 're getting power from appears to be active only once the transmitter is powered up , which still requires an initial audio input .
So instead , I connected the transistor pin through a 1 M resistor directly to the positive pin of the DC power jack .
If you 're looking at the board from the LCD side , with the power connector on the bottom , it 's the second pin from the left between the large SMD capacitor and the LCD ( verify it with a voltmeter if you 're unsure you have the right one ) .
The transmitter now turns on immediately when power is applied , and stays on indefinitely ; regardless of audio input .
Finally , one more tip .
Loop the power and audio input cables a few times through a ferrite toroid filters out hum and hiss .
You can use one toroid , but it 's easier to use two , one for each wire .
The more loops , the tighter the windings , and the closer to the transmitter , the better it works .
A clamp - on style ferrite should work almost as well , though I have n't tried .
Obviously , do n't loop your antenna through a ferrite , as this will attenuate the signal .
If you have n't added your own separate wire antenna , skip the toroid for the audio cable , as it contains the antenna .
With these changes , I 'm very happy with the performance of this transmitter ; and its range and quality rival any consumer or kit transmitter I 've tried for less than $ 100 .
Fertility Doctor Will Let Parents Build Their Own Baby Fertility doctor will let parents custom - pick their baby 's hair and eye color .
March 3 , 2009  --
Imagine if you could choose your baby the same way you pick out a new outfit from a catalogue .
Perhaps some blue eyes , a bit of curly hair , and why not make her tall , lean and smart ?
One fertility doctor now says that he may be able to deliver .
Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg has already helped thousands of couples choose their child 's gender at his fertility institutes in Manhattan and Los Angeles .
Within six months , he says , the clinic will offer a new service : allowing couples to select the physical traits of their babies .
Steinberg says he cannot promise that people will get their selections , but claims he can dramatically increase the probability .
" I can't say with 100 percent certainty that parents will be able to choose something like eye color -- more like 80 percent certainty , " Steinberg said .
The procedure is called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis , or PGD .
It 's been used by fertility doctors for years to screen embryos in the lab -- mostly for parents who want to reduce the chances of carrying a baby with life - threatening diseases .
According to Steinberg , the technology behind genetic screening has progressed to the point where parents can almost custom - design their babies .
It is n't clear that Steinberg can safely deliver on his claims .
ABC
News spoke to a variety of geneticists and fertility experts who disagreed about whether this science is actually possible .
Many said it seemed conceivable .
Others were not so sure .
" Theoretically , I suppose , as our ability to probe the human genome , and to apply various tests to a specific gene that has been discovered , " said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks of New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
" That possibly anything can be looked for and potentially identified and applied . "
But Rosenwaks said he strongly opposes the possibility , adding that is not the role of a physician .
Designer Babies Set Off ' Slippery Slope '
Science 's understanding of genes is way ahead of the ethical debate surrounding designer babies .
While there is no legal prohibition against customizing your baby 's traits , the reality of a brave new reproductive world generates enormous emotion .
" There is no more important question that is going to face us than deciding how to control and use genetic engineering and genetic selection to design our kids .
Nothing , " said Art Caplan , ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania .
" Designing your descendents and seeking out perfection is the biggest slippery slope we could go on , " he said .
" Are the rich going to be able to do it and the poor not ?
Are we going to create a sort of subpopulation of the genetically perfect as against everybody else ? "
Are parents playing God ?
Couples routinely choose the sex of their new baby and are able to carefully screen egg and sperm donors , but many say this advancement takes it too far .
Steinberg says that designing your baby is on the verge of becoming reality .
The question for parents , doctors , and society is whether this is progress and if they are on board .

After years of frustration , allergists meeting in Washington proclaimed a small but significant victory against life - threatening peanut allergies .
Five children , long urged to avoid peanuts like the plague , today tote peanut - butter - and - jelly sandwiches in their lunch boxes , blithely share candy with friends and accept snacks at other people ’s homes without quizzing their hosts on the treats ’ ingredients .
The children appear to have lost their allergies , said Dr. Wesley Burks , a Duke University pediatric allergist who presented the results of two clinical trials Sunday at a meeting of the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology .
The unpublished trials tested whether peanut - allergic patients could be helped to tolerate peanuts by consuming tiny but increasing doses of the food , which induces hives , itching or swelling and is responsible for about half of the 150 annual deaths associated with food allergies in the United States .
The studies are the first in a series of promising efforts to push back this dangerous , and growing , allergy .

As many as 3 million Americans have an allergy to peanuts , and usually also to tree nuts such as almonds and walnuts .
The percentage of U.S. children with a food allergy jumped 18 % in the decade leading to 2007 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and there has been a fourfold increase in children ’s hospitalizations for food allergies in recent years .
Researchers have puzzled over the cause of this rapid rise ; some have suggested that childrens ’ dwindling exposure to dirt , soil and animals has driven the increase .
Though the studies are small and preliminary , Burks said the group planned to enroll more children in the research , and he hoped that within two to three years , the first of several treatments for peanut allergies will be available to physicians .
“ We ’re encouraged , ” said Robert Pacenza , executive director of the Food Allergy Initiative , a patient group active in promoting research and educating the public about the dangers of food allergies .
Though only five children have so far had a seemingly complete reversal of their allergy , that ’s five that have never been seen before , he said .
In the studies , conducted by a joint team of researchers from Duke University Medical Center and the Arkansas Children ’s Hospital Research Institute , children started on the equivalent of 1/1,000th of a peanut and progressively worked their way up .
Advertisement
In the first study , 33 highly allergic children underwent the so - called oral immunotherapy treatment .
Burks reported on nine who had been followed for 2 1/2 years .
Five had weathered several food challenges -- eating a substantial helping of peanuts -- without incident , under the eyes of a researcher armed with a syringe full of epinephrine to counter any sudden reaction that might occur .
All five started the trial with slightly lower allergic sensitivity than the average subject .
They have been allowed to discontinue daily therapy , though their peanut intake is still monitored , as are immune reactions that might signal a return of their peanut sensitivity .
Burks said that he was unsure how long the effect would last but that the five children were the first ever to exhibit “ long - term tolerance ” of peanuts after having been diagnosed as allergic .
“ They ’re eating peanut candy , peanut - butter - and - jelly sandwiches , whatever they want , ” Burks said .

The second study , though very small , is of a design that is considered to be the gold standard of research .
In it , 18 subjects were divided into two groups , one of which got oral immunotherapy and the second , a placebo .
The children were fed small but growing portions of peanut protein and were periodically tested to see whether the dose could be increased without reaction .
In Burks ’ report on the 10 children who had been in treatment longest ( from six to eight months ) , five given the placebo treatment could tolerate the equivalent of about one peanut before experiencing allergic symptoms .
All five on oral immunotherapy could eat the equivalent of 13 to 15 peanuts without distress .
The studies , which were the buzz of the allergists ’ conference this year , are among the first products of a new Food Allergy Research Consortium , established by the National Institutes of Health in 2005 with a $ 22 - million grant .
Some of the consortium ’s other early findings received their first public airing at the allergy meeting .
A study using mice found that a traditional Chinese herbal medicine showed promise in reducing allergic reactions to peanuts ; another trial showed that applying small amounts of peanut extract on the skin appeared to build tolerance in peanut - allergic mice .

Other approaches promise more advanced therapies down the road .
One -- expected to begin human trials this year -- is a peanut allergy vaccine , designed to trick the human immune system into giving up its defense against peanuts .
The injectable vaccine , under investigation at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , would be made of recombinant peanut protein -- essentially a chemical replica of peanut protein but scrubbed of the components that trigger an immune attack .
Researchers hope that a child ’s immune system would learn to let the real protein pass without mounting an attack if exposed to this harmless protein via a vaccine .
Peanut allergies are among the most severe of food allergy reactions , experts said .
And though most children allergic to milk or eggs grow out of those conditions , only about 20 % of those with peanut allergies do .
According to reports at the allergy meeting , the stress of managing a child ’s peanut allergy weighs most heavily upon mothers , imposes a heavy financial burden on families and limits family vacations .
Advertisement
Among the findings : 68 % of families with a food - allergic child limit where they will go on vacation , with most refusing to travel outside the U.S .
At their vacation destinations , 51 % of those with food allergies say they eat most meals in their rooms .
Compared with the general population , those who care for children with food allergies were more likely to stop working , reduce work hours and incur financial problems .
Jenny Kales of La Grange Park , Ill. , who publishes the Nut - Free Mom Blog , said she would be the first to welcome a cure for the food allergy that nearly killed her daughter , Alexandra , five years ago .
But without a lot more evidence , she ’s skeptical .
“ This flies in the face of science up to now , ” Kales said .
Kales questioned whether her 9 - year - old daughter would be willing to undergo a treatment that would expose her to a food that repulses and scares her .
( Alexandra has told her she “ would consider it . ” )
Many questions remain , said Dr. Scott H. Sicherer of Mount Sinai School of Medicine ’s Jaffe Food Allergy Institute and a medical advisor to the Food Allergy Initiative .

“ How does it translate into what people can practically do in their lives ? ” Sicherer said .
“ How much are they protected ?
Does it really make the allergy go away or is it just a temporary thing that ’ll come back when therapy stops ? ”
The concept of “ immunotherapy ” for a food allergy has a long history and a string of partial successes , Sicherer said .
The approach has worked to cure an allergy to penicillin .
But as soon as the exposure therapy is discontinued , the allergy roars back .
More recently , researchers at Mount Sinai , Duke and Johns Hopkins University successfully used oral immunotherapy to build the tolerance of children severely allergic to milk .
But though 13 of 15 subjects increased their tolerance for milk and 1 in 4 was able to drink all the milk they wanted , researchers reported that allergic reactions , some of them serious , were common .

Denotational design with type class morphisms Conal Elliott
Type classes provide a mechanism for varied implementations of standard interfaces .
Many of these interfaces are founded in mathematical tradition and so have regularity not only of types but also of properties ( laws ) that must hold .
Types and properties give strong guidance to the library implementor , while leaving freedom as well .
Some of this remaining freedom is in how the implementation works , and some is in what it accomplishes .
To give additional guidance to the what , without impinging on the how , this paper proposes a principle of type class morphisms ( TCMs ) , which further refines the compositional style of denotational semantics .
The TCM idea is simply that the instance ’s meaning is the meaning ’s instance .
This principle determines the meaning of each type class instance , and hence defines correctness of implementation .
It also serves to transfer laws about a type ’s semantic model , such as the class laws , to hold for the type itself .
In some cases , it also provides a systematic guide to implementation , and in some cases , valuable design feedback .
The paper is illustrated with several examples of types , meanings , and morphisms .
Mike Capps , president of Epic Games , has come under fire recently for remarks about quality of life issues in the videogame industry made during the “ Studio Heads on the Hotseat ” panel at the IGDA Leadership Forum ’08 ( video here ) .
The remarks which brought about the controversy were made at about 21 minutes into the panel .
Taken in the context of everything he says , his remarks are n’t as inflammatory as they ’ve been made out to be , but I still have experiences which would contradict some aspects of what he maintains is a good way to make video games .
I ’ll get back to him after a little background on crunching to make a video game .
For anyone who has n’t studied the game development industry , the dreaded “ crunch ” refers to the period during which game developers work well beyond eight hours a day and sometimes through weekends in order to meet an important deadline , typically the shipping date of the finished game .
It is , as you could imagine , generally dreaded .
The video game industry is rampant with stories of employees forced to work marathon weeks of twelve hour days plus weekends for months at a time so that a project can ship when planned .
Things came to a head with the infamous ea_spouse posting , revealing what were practically sweatshop conditions within a major American company .
Any employee understands the difference between their passion being self motivated and being exploited , and it was obvious to everyone involved that what was happening was not healthy for the employees .
I have worked on projects which required extensive periods of heavy crunch .
It is actually possible for you to , in a way , quit having a life outside your office during these crunch times .
My first job with a major publisher required moderate to heavy hours for the better part of a year to finish Turok 2 .
So heavy was our crunch for the final months that , to this day , I can distinctly remember how new and novel a trip to a local shopping mall with my family felt on an evening after I had been freed from the bonds of crunch .
It literally felt as if I had never been out shopping with my family before .
I believe I can say I know how people freed from jail must feel .
How did this happen ?
What could have made so many employees let the needs of a company or a schedule dictate so much of the shape of their lives ?
In the early days of our industry , there was no industry to speak of ; videogames were made by young people pouring their ideas for new creative experiences into personal computers on desks in their bedrooms .
There were no working hours to speak of ; the employees were either students who had taught themselves to program and wanted to make something like the games they played in arcades , or someone in an established industry who worked on a videogame idea in their off hours .
The passion for creating a videogame , as for any creative endeavor , can consume a person .
It can become all that the developer thinks about , and all that he or she wants to do .
Being young and passionate and working on something that was so entertaining , these early developers were willing to pour every spare waking hour they had into their creations .
These people , propelled by a shared vision and a passion for what they did , eventually came together and formed companies .
Naturally , the culture of these companies reflected the interests of its owners , and there was not so much an expectation of crunch as a desire for it .
It was less a job and more a hobby , one you could devote endless hours to while getting paid .
Friction naturally arose when the industry became large enough to need the talents people who did not want to devote the lion ’s share of their life to it , and this has been the state of affairs for some time .
Is this “ proper ” ?
Because some people in an industry are willing to devote sixty hours of their life a week to their passion , does that mean everyone around them should as well ?
Is it better to turn away someone who does forty hours of high quality work in a week and replace him with someone who does more , but lower quality work ?
Even within the industry , the more dedicated people usually do n’t expect everyone to share their passion to the same depth and extent that they do .
As the industry ages , even the most passionate gamers within it want to experience a more well rounded life .
There are far more pictures of children hanging on the walls in any given game company today than there were when I was getting started .
I believe recent high profile abuses of crunch have come from two factors .
The aforementioned built in mentality that since someone is doing their “ dream job ” they should be willing to devote most of their waking hours to it , coupled with managers naive exploitation of the fact that few in the industry have ever made an hourly wage .
The result is studios ( infamously some EA studios ) where managers simply expected employees to work nights and weekends as a matter of course , whether the needs of the schedule dictated it was necessary or not .
Crunch in these instances becomes known as a grind ( also referred to as a death march ) , which has no end in sight .
There ’s no discernible schedule , and no date or milestone to meet save for finishing the game .
“ Grind ” is a pretty accurate description , too .
The employees on these teams are eventually ground into a fine dust .
There ’s the camaraderie of a shared ordeal , fond memories of the times later and a product on the shelf to remind them of the effort , but little else that is ultimately fun about living through the experience .
Note that I said these managers are being naive .
The first and most obvious argument against the fact that endless extended hours is productive is the mountain of evidence which led to the creation of the five day work week in the first place .
Numerous studies , many of them cited by the IGDA itself , have discovered that after working a certain number of hours within a week an employee ’s productivity drops off sharply .
Sustained extended hours eventually wear out an employees to the point that they are spending as much time fixing mistakes due to fatigue as they are moving forward .
You can multiply this effect when you consider that game creation is an inherently creative endeavor .
It thrives on the people doing the creating being sharp , alert , focused , and passionate about what they are doing .
These naive managers do not seem to grasp the fact that video games are not stamped out by a machine on an assembly line ( despite the frequent reappearance of some franchises on the shelf ) .
There is no lever which , when pulled more often or more rapidly , will magically cause a game to appear in a shorter amount of time .
They foolishly believe that if they have employees working on weekends , they are getting more value out of what they pay that employee .
But things in a creative endeavor are never as simple as they seem .
I have spent many an hour fixing simple mistakes put in by someone working extra hours , too bleary eyed to clearly see what he was doing .
I ’ve spent a few mornings shaking my head at the code I wrote late the night before .
I have done it so often now that I recognize the point at which I am making the mistakes and I now force myself to stop , go home and think about something else for a while .
When you have to pay an employee to fix a mistake made due to fatigue , you are not getting any extra value out of their salary .
You are wasting money .
In effect , you are now paying that employee more money to produce the same amount of work , getting the product of their laborlater thanks to their diminished productivity .
And you are reducing the quality of the finished game , which will be reflected in lower review scores and quite possibly lower sales .
Also consider that tired unhappy employees are much more likely to look for work conditions more conducive to happiness somewhere else .
Employee turnover is not your friend in a place where intimate knowledge of the innards of a proprietary engine and production pipeline are required to add new features or content , or to fix existing ones .
Every time an employee with that kind of knowledge walks out of a studio , the money and time spent so that she could acquire all that knowledge of your engine and processes will then have to be spent on her replacement .
Not all crunch happens because a malicious manager thinks he can get something for nothing .
Often , it ’s merely a case of a schedule being far too ambitious for the amount of time allocated to it .
This has generally been the reason I have found myself working extended hours .
In the early days , there were no production departments keeping a close eye on the progress of a project , constantly comparing what was left to do to the time left to do it and raising flags when it looked as if slipping dates were inevitable .
Better planning and scheduling techniques can help mitigate the effects of ambitious schedules .
Smart companies and teams are acutely aware that everything that ’s desired for a game simply can’t be done given a certain amount of manpower , and are careful to scope the size of a project accordingly .
Managing the dreaded “ feature creep ” , the last minute addition of features to a game , is a much larger concern today than in the past .
Which all brings me back to Mike Capps .
He made it clear in his remarks that his company is very upfront that Epic ’s “ company culture ” considers a sixty hour work week de rigeur .
When someone knows what they are getting into , it ’s hard to sympathize when he finds himself in it .
Another earlier remark indicated that Epic employs profit sharing and thus the employees are motivated to produce a product with a smaller headcount to increase the portion of the profits for any one person .
Everyone , not just the managers , shares the motivation for the extended hours , and there is a payoff for everyone involved for participation in the company ’s culture .
He eventually makes the remark that he does n’t think the forty hour week makes sense for our industry , and this is the part that gives me serious pause .
Is it possible that a person who expects to live a normal life , with friends and leisure and experiences they can only have miles away from their desk , can contribute nothing to the videogame industry ?
Is the knowledge in my head useless to a company because I have a wife and children I like to see in the evenings ?
I really have to wonder , what is the motivation for his statement ?
Is he implying that people who are not so driven , so devoted to their desire to make games that they will do nothing else are of no use to the industry ?
So I wonder , is this true in all forms of creative endeavor ?
Do n’t the best painters and writers and musicians devote their lives to their art ?
Why would anyone want to listen to a rock band that considered playing music a “ normal job ” ?
Would we have Mozart ’s Requiem if his love of music had not consumed him ?
But I also think I would hate to live in a world where artists had no life outside of their art , because they would have no life to inspire their art .
What would Van Gogh have given us if he had remained happily holed up in his studio avoiding courting so that he could devote himself to the technical details of painting ?
Life has to drive a devotion to art for without a life , you have nothing to make art about .
Thus I find it interesting that Epic ’s latest great work centers around a muscled space marine fighting monsters from below .
This is not to imply that great human stories cannot be told in such a setting , it ’s just revealing to me that with all of the prowess on display they have managed to apply a great degree of technical sheen to a game I played over a decade ago .
It ’s obviously not necessary to make games that aspire to art , we are free to strive to merely entertain .
But if we are calling for people to work a week and a half within a normal week , why do we also ask them to make the same game again ?
And then again ?
Can crunch be removed entirely ?
Probably not .
As I ’ve said , game creation is a creative endeavor and thus will always inspire those making them to improve them , to make them more fun and engaging .
Artists will want what they create to look as good as it can before potentially millions of eyeballs come to rest upon it .
It ’s almost inevitable that newly imagined features will creep in as a project progresses that everyone would like to see in the final product .
In recent years , scheduling and production techniques which take this into account and respond and adjust the schedule as the game is in progress are becoming more popular .
Smart companies are now taking more and more input from employees during the scheduling phase .
This not only produces a more realistic schedule ( provided the employees are familiar with their abilities ) , but it also means that the employees are more motivated to deliver what they promised when they promised , even if it means working extra hours .
At least in such a situation the employee has learned something about what they are capable of , and thus will be less likely to agree to an overly ambitious schedule in the future .
I ’m not arguing that crunch should never occur , or that it can be excised completely .
Personally , if I ’m treated well at a company I do n’t mind working extra hours to ensure the final product is as good as it can be made to be in a reasonable amount of time .
If I ’m convinced that my extra effort is making a game better , more fun and interesting , it will be done without any grumbling .
But I have to question the culture that maintains it ’s better to work more hours instead of just doing better work to begin with .
I ’d rather view this as a sometimes necessary compromise instead of the norm .
And managers have to understand there is no linear relationship between man hours and creativity , in fact there may even be an inverse relationship .
I ’m not so sure I could ever tell someone that their job “ does n’t make sense ” within the context of a normal work week , that they should work a week and a half when their friends and family work one .
Nor would I ever assume that because someone does that sixtieth hour of work that it will be anywhere near the quality of work done in the forty - first hour .
I ’d rather be treated like it ’s my creativity and skills that actually matter , rather than my willingness to sit at a desk long after the sun has set .
Analysis : Germany fears social unrest
by Stefan Nicola
Berlin , April 23 , 2009
Observers fear that Germany , Europe 's largest economy , could be gripped by social unrest this year because of mass layoffs sparked by the worst recession since the end of World War II .
In France , frustrated workers are blocking factories and holding top managers hostage .
The economy of neighboring Germany , experts say , is much more vulnerable to the negative effects of the global economic crisis because it is largely export - driven .
Germany 's main customers , such as the United States , the large European nations and Russia , will definitely pull back on imports .
This will only increase the woes of German companies , which are already suffering because of a credit crunch on the international banking market , Germany 's leading economic experts said Thursday in Berlin .
A joint statement drawn up by several leading economic institutes predicted the German gross domestic product would plunge by 6 percent in 2009 , the biggest recession since the end of World War II .
" And there wo n't be a stabilization until mid-2010 , " Kai Carstensen , of the Munich - based Ifo Institute for Economic Research , said Thursday in Berlin .
Germany will lose 1 million jobs this year , with just under 5 million people unemployed by the end of 2009 , Carstensen said .
The gloomy outlook for the German job market has observers worried that social tensions may grip the country .
" It could be that social peace , which is important for the stability in Europe , is in danger , " the head economic expert of Deutsche Bank , Norbert Walter , said in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF .
Michael Sommer , Germany 's top union official , told German television station ARD he fears " social unrest " because the economic crisis is about to affect the core of Germany 's society -- " workers , employees and the middle class . "
He added that the most recent predictions could be compared to the economic situation in the early 1930s , which helped bring Adolf Hitler 's Nazi Party to power .
" You know how people react when they are losing their livelihood , " Sommer said .
Politicians are equally worried .
" I can imagine that in two or three months , people 's anger could grow significantly , " Gesine Schwan , a candidate for the largely ceremonial German presidency , told the Munich - based newspaper Merkur .
German Labor Minister Olaf Scholz meanwhile urged companies not to lay off people but instead expand the so - called Kurzarbeit , a program relying on government - subsidized short working hours .
Placing workers on short hours , however , makes sense only for a certain amount of time ; if the economy does n't recover soon , Kurzarbeit would be too expensive , some experts say .
German car maker Daimler , which has some 70,000 workers on short hours , said recently that it could no longer rule out job cuts .
Bosch , the world 's largest car - parts maker , on Thursday said its net gains plummeted by 87 percent to $ 485 million , adding that it was mulling layoffs .
To soften the impact of the crisis , the German government already launched two economic aid packages .
Despite international and domestic pressure , Chancellor Angela Merkel has resisted calls for a third one .
The economic experts Thursday in Berlin backed Merkel 's position , arguing that a third package would be too costly at the moment .
" We should wait for the first two packages to take effect before we start proposing new measures , " Carstensen said .
Because of the aid packages that include infrastructure investments and tax breaks , Germany 's federal deficit is expected to jump to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and 5.5 percent in 2010 .
This is still fiscally conservative compared with the 13 percent deficit forecast for the United States this year , but the Germans are notorious for their uneasiness over amassing large amounts of debt .
Meanwhile , the experts said Berlin should concentrate its efforts on repairing the root of the crisis -- bad banks .
They said the German government should provide embattled financial institutions with cash to avoid a second , potentially catastrophic credit crunch when more and more midsize companies file for bankruptcy .
Berlin may then have to " force banks to accept state aid " or even nationalize some banks in order to contain the worst damages , Carstensen said .
Robert A. Heinlein , author of such seminal works as The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Starship Troopers ( nothing like the movie of the same name , which was created by people who hated the very things Heinlein held dear ) , once said :
An armed society is a polite society .
It has its ( sometimes humorous ) implications that rudeness becomes rare when one may have to back up one ’s acts with one ’s own life , but this is not where the really important implications arise .
The gun of the citizen is akin to the sword of the honorable knight : it is a symbol of responsibility , of duty .
It is the tool of the trade of protection — protecting the innocent from the guilty , protecting oneself from the predations of the wicked , protecting individuals from the mob and the civilized from those who would unethically press any advantage .
God made man , but Samuel Colt made them equal .
To a nontrivial degree , gun control laws in the United States ( and the colonies that preceded the founding of the US ) have their basis in racism .
For examples , look back to the French Black Code of 1751 .
They have evolved well beyond this point , of course .
These days , the line drawn between the oppressed class and the privileged class is not one of color , except insofar as it is still sometimes difficult for men and women of color to achieve entry to those rarefied ranks .
President Obama is a pretty clear indicator that any hard and fast rules that support the racist application of gun control laws are null and void these days .
Now , instead , Obama is surrounded by men with submachine guns much of the time as a matter of daily expectation , while a white man named Dick Heller who lives in the same city had to go all the way to the Supreme Court to beg to be allowed to own and carry a single self - defense weapon .
It clearly is n’t a matter of the color of one ’s skin that makes the difference these days — though it just as clearly still is n’t the content of one ’s character , either .
It ’s amazing to me that people just accept arguments that poor little old women are being “ protected ” by gun control laws from lascivious brutes who would do terrible things to them .
The number of women in this country who think guns are bad , terrible threats to their safety appears to be far greater than the number of men .
The simple facts of how relative strength plays into things should be an obvious disputation of that view .
When a 120 pound woman encounters a 170 pound man bent on doing ill , she is at a staggering disadvantage if she must defend herself — unless she carries the modern descendant of Mr. Colt ’s equalizer .
Ideas that with unrestricted , free ownership of firearms the streets would run red with blood , that law and order would fall apart under a prevailing “ Wild West ” environment ( which was never really as wild as people seem to think , anyway ) are disproven over and over again .
When the assault weapon ban ended , the streets did n’t run red with blood .
When Florida became the first state to enter a new era of shall - issue policy for issuing concealed carry permits , the streets did n’t run red with blood .
When Kennesaw , Georgia actually passed a law that “ required ” ( there are ways around it if you really do n’t want to ) all heads of household to maintain a working firearm , the streets did n’t run red with blood .
On the contrary — crime rates dropped precipitously .
While Kennsaw ’s population climbed quickly , its burglary and violent crime rates remained fairly constant , hovering around zero percent .
While nationwide violent crime rates continued to climb , Florida saw an immediate and significant drop in violent crimes after the passage of its shall - issue law .
I do n’t really know whether there was a measurable change in crime rates after the end of the assault weapon ban , but I would n’t be surprised if it did n’t change a thing , because the only way it would logically have altered crime at all was by changing what perfectly reasonable , safe activities are considered crimes and which are not : a top - mounted carrying handle and a bayonet lug make a weapon no more , nor any less , suitable for violent crime ( nor for preventing such crime ) in the general case .
Personally , I think concealed carry permits are a bad idea .
I prefer Vermont ’s approach : no permit needed .
That does n’t stop me from recommending getting a permit , though — even in Vermont , if only for purposes of legal reciprocity with states that require a permit to carry when you travel .
While you ’re at it , learn the tradition of the American rifleman , and make the life of a responsible gun owner one of the key requirements of your take on the American Dream .
I want to be a better programmer , a better bass player , a better writer , and a better citizen .
Toward these ends , I ’m trying to make sure I find the time to study the appropriate knowledge and practice the requisite skills , including improving on my skills and responsibilities as recognized and protected by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution .
An armed society is a polite society .
A disarmed society is merely docile , as sheep to the slaughter .
Unfortunately , practicing bass has kinda fallen by the wayside .
I ’ll have to find more time for that , too .
Maybe I can forgo a little more sleep .
If principles of life are universal , could life emerge on the internet ?
I posed the question to evolutionary dynamicist Martin Nowak of Harvard University , developer of a mathematical model of evolution 's origins , the period during which unique chemical structures experienced mutation and selection that guided them toward replication – and thus to life .
Though Nowak 's focus is biological life , the principles seem broadly applicable , perhaps even to configurations of electrons coursing through the Internet 's silicon and fiber - optic substrate .
" Computer viruses are some form of evolution , " said Nowak .
" Viruses fulfill replication , mutation and selection – but people do n't consider them to be alive , because they think life has to be made of chemicals , " said Irene Chen , a Harvard systems biologist who specializes in early biomolecules .
" We can definitely make things in a computer that fulfill the criteria for life that NASA uses , except it 's not chemical , " she added , and cited the AVIDA program at Michigan State .
Indeed , computer viruses and e-mail spam have arguably displayed evolutionary characteristics .
But Nowak was more interested in the forms of social life produced by the internet .
" It 's already an interesting phenomenon that allows people to function in a different way , " he said .
" It leads to very different properties than what were out there before . "
His words echoed those of microbiologist and complexity researcher Carl
Woese .
" Man is the one who 's undergoing this incredible evolution now , "
he said earlier this year in my article on complexity and evolution .
" We see some in the insects , but the social processes by which man is evolving are creating a whole new level of organization . "

If you 're between 18 and 34 and have a job , particularly if you live alone or with a working flatmate , Chris Moore , the boss of Domino 's Pizza delivery chain , probably knows more about your weekend social life , or lack of it , than all but your closest friends .
You are his target customer .
And the home truths from bedsit Britain do not make for pretty reading .
Billions of pounds , he explains , have been spent on flat - screen TVs , home cinemas and games consoles in recent years .
Evening meals are frequently selected from three delivery numbers on fliers kept in a drawer - an Indian , Chinese or pizza - then consumed on the sofa in front of the box .
Supplies of cut - price lager and cigarettes , unavailable or outlawed in the local pub , have been bought in advance , and the television schedules have been scanned for favourite phone - in reality shows ( Domino 's sponsors Britain 's Got Talent
In short , staying in is the new going out .
It is an opportunity for what Moore calls the " time - poor cash - rich " to shut the door on a gloomy world and indulge in some seriously comforting indulgences after a tough working week .
So closely does Moore track these domestic trends that he even claims to be monitoring an emerging habit among people living alone of buying a large pizza on a Friday night , eating some of it , and saving the rest in the fridge for the next day .
" People are eating more and more cold pizza , which would never be the case 20 years ago , " he explains .
" It 's a sign of a mature market . "
As the economic storm clouds gather , numbers staying in have continued to climb , if anything accelerating .
" Instead of spending £ 60 to £ 70 at a restaurant they 're spending £ 20 to £ 30 on a Domino 's pizza and staying at home , without anyone saying : [ Moore puts on a nasal voice ] ' Do n't drink , do n't smoke , do n't do this or that . '
It 's their place . "
But Moore insists Domino's is not feeding a nation of couch potatoes - a suggestion he has struggled to refute before .
He claims it is catering more to people with busy lives rather than those slobbing out on the sofa .
" There 's actually an argument that says maybe the pizza draws the family together .
For example , if you have an Indian dinner and you shout up to the kids ' Guys , the food 's arrived ' , it 's 15 minutes before they 're downstairs .
But if you have a Domino 's delivery and say : ' Guys , the pizza 's arrived ' , they 'll be down there [ he snaps his fingers ] like that .
To say it 's the social glue is a horrible expression but it does get the clan gathering . "
This is how it works when the Pepperoni Passion arrives on Friday night at the Moores 's , he insists .
Almost a third of Domino 's Pizza business is taken over two frenetic four - hour spells on Friday and Saturday evenings , and Moore , who has been at the company for 17 years , admits the company has made meeting this surge of demand an obsession .
Most of the group 's 550 stores have telephone lines and pizza topping stations solely for that purpose , remaining idle for the rest of the week .
The trend for ordering in food is nothing new .
But its resilience against the backdrop of a wider economic decline has made Domino 's the talk of the City .
The company , which controls a UK and Ireland master franchise for the Detroit - originated chain , recently posted comparable sales for January - traditionally the slowest month of the year for the restaurant trade - up 15 % .
The business graduated from the junior Aim market to a listing on the main stock exchange only last year but has already stormed up the rankings to become a mid-table FTSE 250 company by market capitalisation .
It continues to add 50 stores a year and will next year move its main Milton Keynes food factory to a nearby site more than four times the size .
Part of the secret behind Domino 's success is Moore 's acute understanding of what his customers want at the end of a hectic week and how quickly they want it .
His catchphrase , harking back to the early 1990s when then Detroit - owned Domino 's offered a delivery time guarantee , is " after 30 minutes hunger turns to anger " .
While customers are no longer offered compensation for deliveries that take longer than the half - hour target , the business is focused around driving down what is internally known as the " at the door time " .
Across the group the average is currently 23 minutes .
Store managers can see these times updated minute by minute on in - store screens and are able to compare their team 's performance with rival stores .
Typically they are paid a bonus for out - performing their peers .
After taking a tour of several stores one impressed visitor once described it all as " Thatcherism on acid " , Moore recalls .
Next month the Domino 's boss will host the company 's annual awards to celebrate along with the group 's 130 franchisees the achievements of store teams .
Past events have seen Moore hand out gongs dressed up in lederhosen ( ahead of a Domino 's promotion around the World Cup in Germany ) , as Marge Simpson , Lieutenant Uhura from Star Trek , and as Marilyn Monroe .
" We have a lot of fun . "
Before drifting into a first job in advertising , Moore dreamed of making his fortune as a bass guitarist , and he clearly enjoys the attention he and Domino 's are getting .
He remains unique among leisure sector bosses , claiming recessionary pressures are actually benefiting his business .
It is a bold claim , and one that will be further tested this year and next .
But Moore remains resolutely confident , comparing the bigger , stronger Domino's of today with the 37 stores that limped through the recession of the early 1990s when he first joined the business .
A store in Barking came close to going under when the Dagenham Ford plant went down to a three - day week in 1991 , he recalls .
By contrast , fears more recently about the prospects for Domino 's stores in Swindon - where Honda has mothballed a plant and bust retailer Woolworths has shut a distribution centre - proved unfounded .
Local stores continue to show double - digit growth .
When I discovered Troika Games , I had never heard of the company 's three founders , Leonard Boyarsky , Jason Anderson and Tim Cain .
I did n't know they were legends in the gaming field , responsible for Interplay 's Fallout .
I just knew they blew up my computer .
Troika 's last game , Vampire : The Masquerade - Bloodlines , was modeled after the World of Darkness universe created by tabletop developer White Wolf , and a game within that universe , Vampire : The Masquerade , was my first real introduction to what gaming could be .
My cousin , visiting from college one summer , inundated my 10 - year - old head with words like Malkavian , Caitiff , Prince and Diablerie .
Every night during his stay , we 'd sit hunched over a table in a room lit only by a candle , and he'd weave a story where I could influence the world , grow powerful , even stop a minor god from destroying the world .
Until that point in my life , I 'd played nothing but sports games ; participating in a story was entirely new to me .
Bloodlines was love at first install .
The game perfectly captured Vampire 's spirit , demanding your avatar to make the best of multiple bad decisions ; make allies and betray them ; and ultimately choose between trying to save every vampire in the city , or to control them .
I could n't stop playing .
Just four hours into the game , I was addicted .
I 'd already prepared my fake cough to call in sick to work the next day when it happened :
As I was navigating Los Angeles , trying to gather some intelligence on a vampire with too high a profile , I heard something inside my computer click .
The click turned into a grind , and then my computer shut down and would n't turn back on .
At all .
By the time I 'd replaced all the parts that went blooey , it was December , and the first thing I did was re-install Bloodlines - along with a newly - released patch .
It was January before I 'd finished my first go through the game , and after coming up for air , I headed over to Troika 's official site to see what else they had planned .
Despite the computer nuking , they had earned themselves a very loyal customer .
I was shocked to learn that they had laid off all but their three founders , although in hindsight I suppose I should n't have been ; the last patch they released for Bloodlines was the final official bit of code Troika would ever produce .
" Great Ideas .
Never Enough Testing . "
Boyarsky , Cain and Anderson 's creative vision first came together at Interplay .
Together , the three worked on Fallout , the critically - acclaimed , post - apocalyptic RPG that has lived on in the hearts and minds of PC gamers as a sterling example of gaming done right .
Cain was credited as Producer , Boyarsky as Art Director and Anderson as a Lead Artist .
Work began on a sequel , but the three " were unable to come to an agreement with Interplay as to how our next team should be structured , " says Jason Anderson .
The three also ran into a lot more corporate attention after Fallout 's success , Leonard Boyarsky tells me in a separate interview .
Between that and Interplay 's growing pains - the company 's expansion was turning the culture bad - Anderson , Boyarsky and Cain struck out on their own .
Boyarsky says , " Interplay had been a great place to work , and we felt that it was losing a lot of what we felt was great about it , and that they were making a lot of bad decisions that would destroy the company .
We were about five or six years early on that , but we saw the writing on the wall .
If Baldur 's Gate had n't hit big , Interplay might well have imploded much earlier , but we left about a year before BG was even released . "
Exposure to chemicals used in plastics may be linked with childhood obesity , according to results from a long - term health study on girls who live in East Harlem and surrounding communities that were presented to community leaders on Thursday by researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center .
The chemicals in question are called phthalates , which are used to to make plastics pliable and in personal care products .
Phthalates , which are absorbed into the body , are a type of endocrine disruptor — chemicals that affect glands and hormones that regulate many bodily functions .
They have raised concerns as possible carcinogens for more than a decade , but attention over their role in obesity is relatively recent .
The research linking endocrine disruptors with obesity has been growing recently .
A number of animal studies have shown that exposing mice to some endocrine disruptors causes them be more obese .
Chemicals that have raised concern include Bisphenol A ( which is used in plastics ) and perfluorooctanoic acid , which is often used to create nonstick surfaces .
However , the East Harlem study , which includes data published in the journal Epidemiology , presents some of the first evidence linking obesity and endocrine disruptors in humans .
The researchers measured exposure to phthalates by looking at the children ’s urine .
“ The heaviest girls have the highest levels of phthalates metabolites in their urine , ” said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan , a professor of pediatrics at Mount Sinai , one of the lead researchers on the study .
“ It goes up as the children get heavier , but it ’s most evident in the heaviest kids . ”
This builds upon a larger Mount Sinai research effort called “ Growing Up Healthy in East Harlem , ” which has looked at various health factors in East Harlem children over the last 10 years , including pesticides , diet and even proximity to bodegas .
About 40 percent of the children in East Harlem are considered either overweight or obese .
“ When we say children , I ’m talking about kindergarten children , we are talking about little kids , ” Dr. Landrigan said .
“ This is a problem that begins early in life . ”
The Growing Up Healthy study involves more than 300 children in East Harlem , and an additional 200 or so children in surrounding community .
The phthalate study follows a separate group of about 400 girls in the same communities , who range in age from 9 to 11 .
One thing researchers have found is that the levels of phthalates measured in children in both studies are significantly higher than the average levels that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have measured for children across the entire United States .
The findings may presage a new approach to thinking about obesity — drawing environmental factors into a central part of the equation .
“ Most people think childhood obesity is an imbalance between how much they eat and how much they play , ” Dr. Landrigan said .
But he thinks the impact of endocrine disruptors on obesity could be more significant than many people believe .
“ Most people think it ’s marginal , ” he said , paling in comparison with diet and exercise .
But he likened it with the impact of lead on a child ’s I.Q.
“ Lead never makes more than 3 or 4 percent difference in margin , but 3 to 5 I.Q. points is a big deal , ” he said .
Of course , at this stage , researchers cannot say if the exposure actually causes obesity , simply that it seems to be linked .
“ Right now it ’s a correlation ; we do n’t know if it ’s cause and effect or an accidental finding , ” Dr. Landrigan said .
“ The $ 64,000 question is , what is causal pathway ?
Does it go through the thyroid gland ?
Does it change fat metabolism ? ”
The National Children ’s Study , which will follow 100,000 children from across the country from birth to age 21 , will look more broadly at endocrine disruptors and other issues .
“ Some of the clues that come out of East Harlem will actually be pursued in the larger one , ” Dr. Landrigan said .
Meanwhile , Dr. Landrigan advised people to reduce their exposure to phthalates as a precautionary measure .
“ You ca n’t avoid them completely , but you can certainly reduce their exposure , ” he said .
It ’s somewhat difficult to do , since many things do not contain labels identifying phthalates , and in the case of perfumes they can simply be labeled as “ fragrance . ”
Phthalates are found in certain personal care products ( like nail polish and cosmetics ) , though recent regulation has encouraged companies to reduce or eliminate them .
They are also found in common everyday objects , including vinyl siding , toys and pacifiers .
A number of environmental Web sites , including The Daily Green , have advised certain strategies , including learning to recognize the abbreviations for certain common phthalates and to prefer certain kinds of recyclable plastics over others .
On Thursday ( Sept 18 ) , at 11 am the Federal Reserve noticed a tremendous draw - down of money market accounts in the U.S. , to the tune of $ 550 billion was being drawn out in the matter of an hour or two .
The Treasury opened up its window to help and pumped a $ 105 billion in the system and quickly realized that they could not stem the tide .
We were having an electronic run on the banks .
They decided to close the operation , close down the money accounts and announce a guarantee of $ 250,000 per account so there would n't be further panic out there .
If they had not done that , their estimation is that by 2 pm that afternoon , $ 5.5 trillion would have been drawn out of the money market system of the U.S. , would have collapsed the entire economy of the U.S. , and within 24 hours the world economy would have collapsed .
It would have been the end of our economic system and our political system as we know it .
We are no better off today than we were 3 months ago because we have a decrease in the equity positions of banks because other assets are going sour by the moment .
We live in a world of social constructions .
Even before our bodies physically enter the world they are framed .
Much of our life is spent performing the different roles that have been thrust upon us .
In many cases , the identities that we are forced to take on are contrary to any form of social equality .
The majority of the planet negotiates at least one ism and in so doing we have a tendency to privilege our experience over the experience of another , rather than being cognizant of the ways in which the isms interact .
We have come to see resistance as seeking power , yet this approach is problematic because we socially understand power as the ability to oppress another .
The British Psychological Society ’s Division of Occupational Psychology performed a study in which they concluded that homophobia was more prevalent than racism .
I believe that it is essential to note that both racism and homophobia are evils within our society .
However , the desire to rank oppressions is a false project .
Even asking the question of prevalence assumes that a form of “ good ” oppression exists .
It further ignores that there are many people who must negotiate multiple sites of oppression .
If we begin to question by asking which is worse , homophobia or racism , we are purposefully ignoring the experience of people of color that identify as same gender loving .
This “ study ” involved questioning 50 people to ascertain their beliefs in regard to homophobia and racism , and from there they drew the conclusions that homophobia was a larger social problem .
Asking 50 people what their thoughts are is hardly a scientific study .
Regardless of how random the subjects are , nothing can be determined in this manner .
To add insult to injury it was determined that “ gay is the new black ” .
“ Gay is the new black ” frames a gay and lesbian identity as specifically white .
It says to the world that homophobia is wrong because white gays and lesbians are being treated like blacks and it is this – and not the evil of homophobia – that we must seek to challenge .
The largely white male run gay and lesbian organizing groups have continually failed to use an intersectional approach to their organizing .
Gay marriage has become the latest organizing push and to justify this choice over the issues that have been cited by people of colour who are same gender loving , they have continually employed strategies that are racist and / or sexist .
As long as there are those that are both gay and black , gay can never be the new black .
It is white privilege that causes this issue to be framed in this way .
Powerful white leaders in the gay and lesbian community have so over - valued whiteness that they have failed to see the racism that is inherent in this kind of organizing .
No study can measure which is worse , because black gays and lesbians do exist .
The GLB community frame organizing around a desire to achieve equality , but the question we fail to ask is equality for whom .
The white elite of the GLB community do not seek equality with people of colour , they seek equality with white cisgendered heterosexuals , which is problematic .
Continually we see the argument of “ we are just like you ” , however the “ you ” in question is necessarily white , affluent and largely male .
There is this sense that certain people are being robbed of their ability to properly benefit from white privilege because of homophobia .
Having the ability to oppress another is often how we denote hierarchal position .
If a white male must negotiate homophobia , he cannot benefit from his white privilege in full and this causes resistance .
If gay organizing were truly about equality , the voices of people of colour would be equally reflected and every possible intersection would be represented .
I have yet to see the inclusion of people that are differently abled or even a decent cross section of people by age .
A movement that privileges certain bodies cannot be about striving for equality ; it can only be about asserting power to oppress another .
Until the GLB community fully embraces intersectionality it will continue to fail in its organizing efforts .
One cannot assert privilege to fight social injustice as it simply reaffirms the idea that a hierarchy of bodies is not only natural but correct .
While racism is not an issue that is unique to the GLB community , the failure on the part of some to own the fact that racism has been a large part of their organizing efforts has caused the alienation of many potential allies .
It is hard to be sympathetic to a movement when you see yourself constantly positioned as the “ other ” .

Looking back at previous post , I have touched on the subject of bound tits , femdom and the CBT that can go with that , so today I thought I would take a brief look at pussy play .
As you know one of the most erotic and sensitive parts of a woman ’s body is her pussy , and there are many ways to heighten the sensations and feelings to this part of her , and if you are the owner of a pain slut then the various ways can involve more extreme measures but that is something for the Master and slave to experiment with until they reach a comfortable limit which pleases them both .
For those new to pussy play I like to start off with clothes pegs , these are cheap and easily available and they have a ‘ bite ’ but are not as intense as the metal clamps available .
Once the sub / slave is used to these then you can move on to other things , wax for example is another good one , see my tips and guide here for more on this subject .
The only limit to the BDSM life is your limits , and each is different , as with all things , safety is important and knowing your sub or slave is a must , let them guide you as to what they like , this is not a sign of weakness but a sign of a good Dom / Master
Have fun and enjoy all that this life can offer you

Packer tries to understand why the GOP fringe is more powerful than the Democratic fringe :
The views of right - wing commentators in the grip of the paranoid style ( Obama is a stealth radical , the Democrats are imposing socialism ) are much closer to mainstream conservative and Republican belief than the views of their counterparts on the left ( the levees in New Orleans were blown up by the government , the White House had something to do with 9/11 ) are to mainstream liberal and Democratic belief .
The reasons are complex , but I would list these : the evangelical and occasionally messianic fervor that animates a part of the Republican base ; the atmosphere of siege and the self - identification of conservatives as insurgents even when they monopolized political power ; the influence of ideology over movement conservatives , and their deep hostility to compromise ; the fact that modern conservatism has been a movement , which modern liberalism has not .

Searching for Habitable Planets
Kepler is designed to measure tiny brightness variations in stars that might indicate orbiting planets .
NASA hopes to find Earth - like planets orbiting stars at a distance that would permit liquid water , potentially allowing them to support life .
Kepler will be placed in an orbit around the Sun , surveying more than 100,000 stars for three years .

Activists are outraged over Obama ’s raid of Emmalyn ’s California Cannabis Clinic in San Francisco , but they should not be surprised .
Obama ’s Attorney General Eric Holder had promised to end federal medical marijuana raids , as conducted by both Clinton and Bush ’s administrations , leaving alone dispensaries operating legally under state law .
Obama broke the spirit of the promise , but not the letter .
The excuse for this last raid was state law violations — supposedly , sales taxes were being evaded .
Now the feds will probably prosecute under federal law .
The state government was not agitating for a crackdown .
Sacramento was not complaining about sales tax evasion .
San Francisco had given a permit to this dispensary .
Aaron Smith from the Marijuana Policy Project notes , “ It is disturbing that , despite the DEA ’s vague claims about violations of state and federal laws , they apparently made no effort to contact the local authorities who monitor and license medical marijuana providers . ”
Furthermore , sales tax violations are rarely handled this way .
The California chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws points out , “ The normal process in such cases is for the Board of Equalization to audit the business in question , NOT for federal agents to enter like storm troopers and steal all of the business ’s inventory . ”
This episode should remind liberal pot activists of the potentially despotic power involved in tax collection .
The power to tax is the power to destroy .
Raids like this are unusual , but not unheard of in mere tax cases .
Presumably , if California ’s marijuana industry was only governed by libertarian law — no violence , no theft , no fraud — there would be far fewer excuses for the feds to step in .
Short of exempting medical marijuana from sales tax altogether , how can future outrages be prevented ?
California should go on the offensive .
It should legalize marijuana , leave its regulation to the market , and , for now , treat it like any other retail good in terms of tax law .
It could do so under the guise of medical marijuana , to protect users and distributors from federal sanction , assuming Obama keeps his promise to the letter .
California could make medical marijuana completely legal — like aspirin or cough syrup — and allow retailers of all types to sell it without license or prescription .
We could see it in nurseries , grocery stores , and pharmacies as an over - the - counter .
It could be made available everywhere .
This would make it much harder for the feds to raid facilities as though they were underground , barely legal operations .
It would expose the contradictions in the drug war .
The Drug War is a total disaster .
It is destined to fail in significantly reducing drug abuse .
It is a violation of personal liberty , an excuse to shred the Bill of Rights , and the major cause of gang violence , whether in our inner cities or on the border with Mexico .
If America ended drug prohibition , the Mexican border violence that has killed thousands over the last couple years would end completely .
Instead , Obama is moving in the wrong direction , sending more troops there .
It is state violence that forced the drug market underground , and every successful breakup of a dominant cartel only opens up a vacuum inevitably filled by other smaller groups violently competing over turf .
The more the government cracks down , the worse it will get .
On medical marijuana , Obama was supposed to signify a shift in policy .
His last DEA raid should put that myth to bed .
By legalizing medical marijuana in 1996 , California forced the issue over whether federal drug laws should supersede local standards .
In terms of public opinion and political pressure , much has been won .
It ’s time to keep pushing .
In Gonzales v. Raich ( 2005 ) , the Supreme Court ’s five liberals all voted for federal supremacy over California ’s medical marijuana laws .
More court cases might not be the answer .
California should instead continue to liberalize its drug laws .
This will , at least , complicate Obama ’s policy of federal raids and further undermine faith in the national government setting drug policy .

Hey , I 'm on Twitter If you 've noticed the mini- feed over in the sidebar , I 'm using Twitter as a way to keep in touch with the vastin between essays ( I 'm on pace for over 25,000 hits this month ; thanks much ) .
I came up with the idea after spending Tuesday afternoon in a hospital waiting room , and realizing that I really wanted to update thewith my iPhone .
So check in even more frequently than usual and enjoy an even deeper peek into whatever the hell it is that I do with my time throughout the week .
Speaking of Waiting Rooms , I just got back from the Dentist 's Office , where I 'm once again cavity - free , yet I feel as if I 've had my molars bashed with an aluminum bat .
They have demanded that I get my wisdom teeth removed this Summer , and I 'm only looking forward to it for the comedic potential and good drugs .
Oh , and it's all covered by insurance , which will eliminate my Plan B Payment Cycle , which called for eight months of cheese sandwiches and a crash course in how to make low - grade methamphetamine .
I enjoyed this week 's episode of .
In order for us to get from Point A to Point B in this series ( or is it Point B to Point C to point A? ) , something needs to happen that causes the Flight 815 'ers ( and stray Dharma folk like Juliet ) to retreat back into the jungle for a final showdown .
Judging by the way things are going down , I predict oneof an Episode 12 .
Deaths and kaboom and whatnot .
And hey , your guess is as good as mine what Sayid 's dusting off of Little Ben does for the outcome of the series .
Did it change the future ?
Did it do nothing ?
Will there still be a purge ?
Did it cause the entire show to no longer exist ?
Dostill exist ?

We ’ve seen a number of Twitter tools for scheduling future tweets , shortening URLs , and tracking click - thrus .
But BrightKit ( not to be confused with the location - aware app BrightKite ) is the sleekest we ’ve seen yet , making it worth a mention .
What makes Bright Kit special is its beautiful interface for managing multiple Twitter accounts .
The Dashboard lets you see all your Twitter accounts at once , while you can also use a pull - down to toggle from one to the other to utilize all of Bright Kit ’s options .
Those options include scheduling Tweets for the future , viewing your pending Tweets , automatically generating short URLs ( of the ow.ly variety ) , and seeing click - thru data on your messages .
You can also setup multiple admins for your BrightKit account , which makes sense given the service is targeting businesses that want to use Twitter .
Here 's what it looks like :
BrightKit also has some intriguing features planned , including geo-location tracking , exportable reports , and offering users the ability to reply directly from within the interface .
Unlike many tools that are simply side projects of developers , this one comes to us from an interactive agency called Invoke .
Similar tools include EasyTweets and Twuffer .
EasyTweets recently added some new features that BrightKit does n't offer yet including being able to view the timelines for all of your accounts , a bookmarklet for sharing links , and integrated search .
But we think BrightKit has the best interface at the moment and recommend it if managing multiple Twitter accounts and creating the illusion of never sleeping are high on your priority list .
Facebook 's latest redesign which has been clearly inspired Twitter 's real - time stream of status updates has had a ton of detractors from all corners .
One of the biggest places where the outcry has centralized is the Facebook Layout vote application which currently has had over a million votes from Face book users with over 94 % against the new changes and almost 600,000 comments , most of which seem to be negative if the hundred or so I read were a representative sample .
One thing I 've wondered is how the folks at Facebook are taking this feedback .
On the one hand , people do n't like changes and the more disruptive the change the more they fight it .
It 's almost comical to go back and read the Time magazine article about the backlash against the news feed from back in 2006 given how much the feature has not only ended up defining Facebook but how significantly it has impacted the social software landscape at large .
On the other hand , sometimes people have a good reason to protest such as the outcry against the privacy destroying Facebook Beacon which eventually inspired a mea culpa from Zuckerburg himself .
Owen Thomas from Valleywag has an article entitled Even Facebook Employees Hate the Redesign which contains the following excerpt
The feedback on Facebook 's new look , which emphasizes a stream of Twitter - like status updates , is almost universally , howlingly negative .
Why is n't CEO Mark Zuckerberg listening to users ?
Because he does n't have to , he 's told employees .
A tipster tells us that Zuckerberg sent an email to Facebook staff reacting to criticism of the changes : " He said something like ' the most disruptive companies do n't listen to their customers . ' "
Another tipster who has seen the email says Zuckerberg implied that companies were " stupid " for " listening to their customers . "
The anti-customer diktat has many Facebook employees up in arms , we hear .
When your application becomes an integral part of your customers lives and identities , it is almost expected that they protest any major changes to the user experience .
The problem is that you may eventually become jaded about negative feedback because you assume that for the most part the protests are simply people 's natural resistance to change .
I tend to agree that disruptive companies do n't listen to their customers in the narrow sense of using them as a barometer to decide what products or features to build .
Customer feature requests are n't the source of input that would spawn a Netflix in a world that had Blockbuster & Hollywood video .
Such disruptive products are spawned from understanding the customers better than they understand themselves .
If you had simply " listened " to Blockbuster 's customers you'd think the best way to compete with them would be to have cheaper late fees or a bigger selection in your store .
Netflix actually went a step further and understood the underlying customer problems ( e.g. even going to a video store is a hassle which is why you end up with late fees in the first place ) and created a product that was truly disruptive .
Using that model of " disruptive companies " the question then is whether the new Facebook is an example of understanding your customers better than they understand themselves or is truly a mistake ?
For my take on the answer I 'll first point out a comment on Valleywag on the redesign
Here 's the problem with the redesign .
Twitter is a micro-blog .
The 140 character Livejournal .
Facebook is not a blog .
In its old form it was a really great PHONEBOOK .
A phonebook that not only updated your acquaintance 's ( most FB friends are not friends ) contact info , but also gave you a general summary of their life .
It was a big picture kind of thing :
Where they are , who they 're dating , what school or job they have , and how to contact them .
It was never about " sharing " your daily thoughts on how great your panini was or omg gossip girl is back !
The livejournal twit - blog crap is messing up the phonebook interface .
This is the crux of the problem with the Facebook redesign .
The expectations around how user relationships were created on Twitter are totally different from how they were on Facebook .
On Twitter , users explicitly decide as part of following someone that they want all of the person 's tweets in their stream .
In fact , this is the only feature of the relationship on Twitter .
On Facebook , you have relationships with people that attempt to mirror your real life so you have your boss , coworkers , school friends and acquaintances all trying to be part of your social graph because FB is really a kind of " rolodex " in the sky .
The fact that you got a news feed was kind of a side effect of filling out your virtual rolodex but it was cool because you got the highlights of what were going on in the lives of your friends and family .
There is a legitimate problem that you were n't getting the full gist of everything your 120 contacts ( average number of Facebook friends ) were doing online but it would clearly lead to information overload to get up to the minute updates about the breakfast habits of some guy who sat next to you in middle school .
Somewhere along the line , it seems the folks at Facebook did n't internalize this fundamental difference in the social context that differentiates user to user relationships on Twitter versus Facebook .
This to me is a big mistake .

There 's an economic crisis going on .
Many people are panicking about this , but Mistwalker 's Hironobu Sakaguchi is n't .
He 's getting poetic .

Writing on his company 's blog , the creator of the Final Fantasy series writes :
These days I feel the hard economic times are a kind act for the planet to restrain human activity .
Economic activity is as important as blood flowing .
However , the blood should be flowing smoothly , which I suppose means the quality of what flows in that stream must be as important .
There is a lot of business behind creating a game , yet I would like to keep 51 % towards " creation " rather than " merchandise . "
I feel it should n't go over 75 % , though .
Setting sights on where the good blood flows .

If you like economic depression , Obama is your man .
The stock market is shouting this message loudly and clearly .
The S & P 500 ( measured by the security SPY ) made a little high at 100.41 on November 4 , 2008 .
The election was the next day .
It has been downhill ever since .
The close on March 2 , 2009 was 70.60 .
This 30 percent decline qualifies as what used to be an ordinary bear market !
Congress and the President could not construct better measures , proposed and enacted , to deepen this depression if they tried .
Congressional Democrats intend to ensconce Democrats as the majority party for the next 25 years or so .
Their chosen method is wasteful pork sold as rational investment .
But by gilding the nests of their chosen constituencies and supporters with huge taxpayer - funded giveaways , they will deepen and lengthen the depression .
The stock market tells us this , but it is easy for stimulus supporters to explain away the stock market ’s drop in other ways .
Obama supporters are likely to extol the good things that his program is doing to revive spending in the economy , and to regard the stock market as an aberrant den of gamblers and thieves who deserve their Bush - induced fate .
Very few men on the street , including my doctor , understand that spending , whether private or government , does not get rid of economic depression ; and the lack of spending does not cause it .
They do not fathom that government spending , borrowing , and taxing will further gash the sinking economy below the water line and send it to its watery grave .
They are more inclined to believe , along with prominent economists , that government spending should be increased by trillions more .
There can not be too much of a good thing .
People automatically think that if everyone does not spend , then how can businesses keep going and hire people ?
How can the economy work ?
Then they think , if people only have money , then they can spend .
If the government spending will only put that money into their hands , this will cause people to spend .
It will jump start the economy , restore business confidence , and all will be well .
This story has a firm hold on the public imagination , but things do n’t work that way .
People in the aggregate can only earn money to spend by working productively .
Money still does n’t grow on trees .
The government does n’t have a money tree either .
Without resorting to inflation , it can only shift money around .
America ’s federal government is a group of Americans who are empowered to tax the rest of us and borrow from anyone in the world .
This money is collected from you , me , and others .
We then have less to spend .
Shifting money from the left pocket to the right pocket does n’t enhance the total amount .
Americans are not unwise enough to accept government money that is rolled off a printing press with absolutely nothing to back it up .
Our government does not do things so crudely .
Its money is printed up for it only after it issues government bonds that promise to pay interest .
For all practical purposes , these bonds are perpetuities on which the promise is made to pay interest forever .
There is no government money tree in this process because the government taxes Americans to pay the interest .
If the government borrows from us and spends more now , we have less to spend now .
The money goes from one pocket to another with no aggregate gain .
The government has another way to borrow .
The central bank ( the FED ) can take the bonds and credit the government ’s bank account .
This exchanges one credit for another credit .
The taxpayer must still pay interest .
The credit created for the government has not directly diminished the taxpayer ’s wealth on his personal account .
There has been no money transferred from taxpayer to government .
The taxpayers have a new liability , nonetheless .
They will be made to pay the present value of the interest payments , which is the value of the bonds .
This may or may not crimp their spending .
It probably will not .
They are unlikely at first to realize that they owe this money .
As time goes on and they have to pay higher taxes , they might realize it .
When the government relieves many people of direct taxes , it hides this burden of the debt for as long as it can .
So what do we have ?
The government can get money from the FED and spend it .
It will seem to many people like money that grows on trees because they do not see the eventual taxes or the current hidden taxes .
The government can spend this money .
It will stimulate people into working at various government - selected projects .
There is , however , no such thing as a free lunch .
If people do not value these projects ( which is usually the case ) or the projects lose money ( which they usually do ) , the welfare of people does not go up .
It goes down , for they are paying for useless work .
Furthermore , the government spending raises costs and prices by bidding labor and materials away from others .
And this prevents those prices from adjusting to levels that make it profitable for businesses to employ people in making stuff that people really want .
There are those who contest the notion that government spending is largely waste .
They imagine brand new bridges , newly - paved roads , and intercity rail transport .
Even if these projects paid off , they are a tiny fraction of all government spending .
And most of these do not pay off .
Government spending only creates wealth if it spends money on things whose return exceeds the cost of the capital used .
The government ’s own operating costs are so high that , viewed as a business , it gets a return on its investments that falls far short of its capital costs .
In other words , the government is like a gigantic money - losing business .
One reason for this is that interest groups get the money .
The image of public - minded officials dispersing the money efficiently is unreal .
Everyone who has spent any time at all looking into the matter of government spending , all regular readers of LRC , all readers of Ideas in Liberty , all readers of the publications of the Independent Institute , etc. , and all those who have not looked into it , but have merely had experience with government , take it for granted that every $ 1 spent by government costs the taxpayer $ 1.25 or more .
Governments routinely destroy wealth .
The case is so overwhelming that anyone who believes otherwise can only be willfully ignorant or blinding himself .
One scholar ( Martin J. Bailey ) , who was far from a radical anti-government person , but who spent many years studying government and trying to write an improved Constitution to mitigate problems with representative government , wrote as follows :
" The leader , if truly well - informed , will know about several barriers to sound government .
We may summarize these as follows .
In existing nations the clash of interests often has powerfully wasteful and detrimental effects , among other reasons because elected professional politicians with almost unlimited authority to enact and administer laws are subject to enormous rent - seeking pressures .
Indeed , they seek out groups that have been unable to solve their own organizational free rider problems and solve them through legislation — e.g. , for labor in the 1930s through the National Labor Relations
Act and more recently for the poor and the u2018homeless . ’
Political discourse in all venues is routinely filled with fraudulent claims , slander and other misrepresentations .
Even if they might wish to enact perfectly constructive , statesmanlike legislation , politicians have no reliable conduit with which to collect valid information about the preferences and values of their constituents .
A fundamental reason for these symptoms is that citizens have no incentive to seek out the truth on public issues , but instead choose rational ignorance and , often , rational non-participation .
See Downs ( 1957 : 238—274 ) .
From this core problem emanate others that permeate government .
Finding a corrective mechanism for this core problem is a necessary condition for overall improvement . "
It helps the cause of liberty when polite and well - mannered experts , people who have studied the matter for years and speak in restrained tones , inform us that politicians cater to interest groups and not the public welfare , that they routinely lie , that they organize interest groups and shake them down , that even if they wanted to , they could not serve the public interest , and that our representative government is wildly dysfunctional .
The image of government restoring confidence by raising and spending money could not be more mistaken .
This is the fantasy of Keynes .
It is the rhetoric of FDR ( " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself " ) .
If business confidence depended on government spending , there would not have occurred any of the last 5 recessions in the U.S. , for government spending rose both before and during these recessions .
And there would have been a recession during the Clinton years when government spending moderated .
The confidence of a businessman depends on the anticipated demand for his goods and services .
He does not invest in plant and hire labor on the basis that the government is spending money on its favorite interest groups .
There are unemployed resources in a depression .
Does n’t the government improve matters by putting these to work ?
There is a large vacant building for lease in a nearby commercial strip .
It used to be a shoe store .
At the same time , there are unemployed men and women in the area .
So far , no business has seen fit to rent the building .
Does the government have a viable business in view ?
This is highly doubtful .
It is not how the government operates .
If it directly hires the building , the chances are that it will hire people to do make - work .
The operation will run a loss , paid for by taxpayers .
Why should they be taxed to pay the unemployed and lose money in the process ?
Nothing is accomplished but a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to the unemployed and an additional loss .
Meanwhile , when business recovers and seeks to satisfy needs of consumers , it finds that its costs are higher because the government has rented the building and hired labor .
The government ’s actions inhibit recovery .
Why should wealth be taken from taxpayers ?
If they would have spent the money on goods , they no longer can .
If they would have invested it , that too is no longer possible .
Meanwhile , there is another effect of government borrowing from the FED .
When the FED credits the government , it creates bank reserves .
This typically sets off a multiple credit expansion among banks .
This stimulates business , but it is a process of credit inflation that leads to a recession or worse .
Ordinarily , business demand for labor and materials is constrained and rationed by the supply of savings .
The FED ’s credit creation , however , causes a lowering of the interest rate .
That relaxes the constraint .
The stimulation causes economic distortions and imbalances and eventual recession .
Imagine that IBM is induced to borrow and to produce a new supercomputer because it thinks that its cost of capital is lower .
It hires people , builds a new production line , and starts churning out new supercomputers .
Other businesses do the same .
But their planned selling prices and costs are predicated on spending , saving , and hiring patterns that no longer exist — the credit inflation changes all of that .
The business activity that comes into the economy affects particular people first and not others , and their spending and saving behavior is not what would have occurred had they not been employed and paid in this new activity .
Furthermore , people change their economic behavior when they observe the activities of others and experience price changes .
The result is that somewhere along the way , some businesses find that their costs are rising beyond what they planned and expected .
Some businesses also find that people are not buying the newly - produced items in the anticipated volume .
The costs are rising because IBM is competing with Apple and many others to hire factors of production .
Some products are not selling because the stimulus is uneven or not neutral in its effects .
To sell their products , some firms have to lower their prices .
Since they still have to pay their debts , they find themselves caught in a squeeze .
This leads to cutbacks .
This affects other firms .
A recession or depression starts .
Government credit inflation is not a free lunch .
The Obamaniacs are not overtly promising more depression via increased government spending , but that is inherent in their program .
If they borrow from the public , it has no net stimulating effect .
If they borrow from the FED , it produces temporary stimulation and inflation and then further depression .
Credit creation through the central bank ultimately sends the economy on a downward course .
The stimulus story is that if people only can get money , they can spend and the economy will rise .
People only can earn money by working .
They earn money by providing something of value to others , like their labor or a good or service .
The money they get entitles them to cash in on the value of their service by choosing to buy the goods or assets that others make available .
The image of money making the wheels of commerce turn is misleading .
The money is a counter , a ticket that allows one to buy an array of goods .
Money is a chit or a voucher .
Money is a credit that can be cashed in against society ’s goods and services ; it is a credit that you can use up as you choose .
When you make money , that money measures something else that is more basic , which is that you have supplied a valuable service or good .
The money is an option to get goods in return at a later time and place of your choosing .
Money is not the problem .
We do not have a depression for lack of money .
The official M1 money supply at this time is almost $ 1.6 trillion .
It was $ 1.4 trillion when the depression began .
The problem is much more subtle .
It has to do with prices and the price system .
It has to do with overcoming problems caused by bad credits that arose when the price system was distorted by inflation .
We have a depression because of the distortions and imbalances in the economy that arose over many years when too many people were induced by the FED to borrow too many credits and use them to buy and produce goods and services .
The image of government spending putting money into people ’s hands is misleading .
When the federal government spends money on windmills , it has to get that money from taxes or borrowing .
When it borrows from the public , it has to raise taxes to pay the costs of the debt .
So we may as well say that all the federal spending is paid for with taxes .
This takes money out of the hands of those who might otherwise spend it or invest it .
The government is n’t jump - starting anything .
If people want to trade goods and do not have enough money to carry out their exchanges , they can always create more .
Money itself is not the problem , as the spending and stimulus story suggests .
What you spend is what you produce .
You can only spend what you produce .
( If you borrow and spend , you must eventually pay that back with your production . )
If Iowa corn farmers want to buy Chinese pots and pans , they have to produce corn .
If the Chinese want to buy Iowa corn , they have to produce pots and pans .
They do n’t want our dollars to eat anymore than we want their yuan to cook with ; these currencies are only media of exchange .
We can always arrange means of paying each other .
The real problem is that the production of goods has been dis-arranged and that many firms have to restructure .
Many will go bankrupt and liquidate .
Many will lay off workers .
The adjustments take time .
This is not now a problem of money and credit , although it was brought about by central banking ’s excessive money and credit .
It is now a problem of real production being interrupted because it is not geared to producing what people want to and can buy at current prices .
When a lot of us do not have the means to spend , it is because we are not producing enough product that others want at prices they are willing to pay .
That happens because inflation has distorted the price system and production .
In this situation , government spending does not restore the production system to one that caters to people ’s wants and demands .
Government spending does the opposite .
It induces men and materials into work that is not in demand .
This lengthens the period of adjustment back to normal production .
It causes even more distortion by bidding labor and materials away from businesses and into lines of work promoted by government .
It creates a new inflation and price distortions that must cause more depression .
Furthermore , as we know , the government spending itself is on wasteful activities .
The government spending under Bush and Obama is piling up immense new liabilities and debts .
Americans are trying to save more .
The data on their private account show this clearly .
The personal savings rate in January of this year is 5 percent .
From 2005 to April of 2008 , it averaged just under 0.5 percent .
Meanwhile their government is frustrating their actions by incurring immense new debts .
Sadly , spending is not the end of the story of the Obama administration .
Its tax and regulatory policies are equally destructive .
It is certain that higher capital gains taxes , estate taxes , income taxes , and carbon taxes will provide new depressing effects on the American economy .
The federal government ’s projects now include a growing array of wealth - destroying investments that include AIG , Citigroup , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , the auto industry , and other major banks .
Since the Democrat victory in November , the stock market has been discounting these negatives .
It will continue to do so as long as these negatives continue and worsen .
At present , the Obama administration is still serving up a daily diet of negative shocks to the economy and the stock market .
It is frustrating the recuperative powers of Americans , just as it is frustrating their attempts to save and put the American house in order .
If this is not an example of the evils of our federal government and of our form of representative constitutional government , I do n’t know what is .

Eine Studie des Forschungsinstituts RAND versucht Zusammenhänge zwischen dem organisierten Verbrechen , Urherberrechtsverletzungen und Terrorismus herzustellen .
In dem 182 - seitigen Dokument mit dem reißerischen Titel " Film Piracy , Organized Crime , and Terrorism " äußern die Autoren die Vermutung , dass Terroristen sich auch über Filmpiraterie finanzieren könnten .
Schon der Vorspann greift vage und spekulative Formulierungen über " kriminelle und vielleicht terroristische Gruppen " auf .
Nachdem die ersten Kapitel definieren , was man eigentlich unter Terrorismus , organisiertem Verbrechen und " Film Piracy " im einzelnen zu verstehen habe , folgen Fallstudien in denen es um Überschneidungen der beiden Phänomene geht .
Zusammenhänge zwischen kommerziellen Raubkopierern und dem organisierten Verbrechen sollen 14 Fallstudien aus Nordamerika , Großbritanien , China , Italien , Hong Kong und anderen Gebieten belegen .
In ganzen drei Fällen gelingt es den Autoren zu belegen , dass dabei erwirtschaftete Gelder auch an Gruppen gelangt sind , die im Verdacht stehen , an terroristischen Aktivitäten beteiligt zu sein .
Sie kommen zu dem Schluss , dass es am Ende ziemlich auf dasselbe hinauslaufe , ob es bei illegalen Filmkopien um Profit oder Terrorismus gehe : Im Endeffekt dienen Raubkopien dazu kriminelle Organisationen zu finanzieren .
So seien Raubkopien nicht nur eine Gefahr für die Medienindustrie , sondern auch für die öffentliche und nationale Sicherheit .
Zu guter Letzt schlagen die Autoren in einem Fünf - Punkte - Plan unter anderem vor , dass sich internationale Gremien wie die G8 - Versammlung des Themas Raubkopien stärker annehmen sollten , der Begriff " organisierte Kriminalität " auch auf Raubkopien im großen Stil erweitert werden müsse und die Strafverfolgung grenzüberschreitend erfolgen darf .
Ein Problem seien auch die leichten Strafen für Raubkopierer .
Finanziert hat diese Studie die Motion Picture Association ( MPAA ) , wobei die Autoren betonen , dass sie deshalb nicht " notwendigerweise " auch deren Meinung wiedergeben würden .
Man habe sich sogar Mühe gegeben , diese Rahmenbedingungen zu beachten .

NEW 4/10/09 :
There is an update to this post , see below the “ read the rest of this entry ” – Anthony
Guest Post by Richard Lindzen , PhD .
Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology , Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Science , MIT
This essay is from an email list that I subscribe to .
Dr. Lindzen has sent this along as an addendum to his address made at ICCC 2009 in New York City .
I present it here for consideration .

Simplified Greenhouse Theory
The wavelength of visible light corresponds to the temperature of the sun ’s surface ( ca 6000 oK ) .
The wavelength of the heat radiation corresponds to the temperature of the earth ’s atmosphere at the level from which the radiation is emitted ( ca 255 oK ) .
When the earth is in equilibrium with the sun , the absorbed visible light is balanced by the emitted heat radiation .
The basic idea is that the atmosphere is roughly transparent to visible light , but , due to the presence of greenhouse substances like water vapor , clouds , and ( to a much lesser extent ) CO2 ( which all absorb heat radiation , and hence inhibit the cooling emission ) , the earth is warmer than it would be in the absence of such gases .
The Perturbed Greenhouse
If one adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere , one is adding to the ‘ blanket ’ that is inhibiting the emission of heat radiation ( also commonly referred to as infrared radiation or long wave radiation ) .
This causes the temperature of the earth to increase until equilibrium with the sun is reestablished .
For example , if one simply doubles the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere , the temperature increase is about 1°C .
If , however , water vapor and clouds respond to the increase in temperature in such a manner as to further enhance the ‘ blanketing , ’ then we have what is called a positive feedback , and the temperature needed to reestablish equilibrium will be increased .
In the climate GCMs ( General Circulation Models ) referred to by the IPCC ( the UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) , this new temperature ranges from roughly 1.5 °C to 5°C .
The equilibrium response to a doubling of CO2 ( including the effects of feedbacks ) is commonly referred to as the climate sensitivity .
Two Important Points
1. Equilibration takes time .
2 . The feedbacks are responses to temperature – not to CO2 increases per se .
The time it takes depends primarily on the climate sensitivity , and the rapidity with which heat is transported down into the ocean .
Both higher sensitivity and more rapid mixing lead to longer times .
For the models referred to by the IPCC , this time is on the order of decades .
This all leads to a crucial observational test of feedbacks !
The Test : Preliminaries
Note that , in addition to any long term trends that may be present , temperature fluctuates on shorter time scales ranging from years to decades .
Such fluctuations are associated with the internal dynamics of the ocean - atmosphere system .
Examples include the El Nino – Southern Oscillation , the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , etc .
These fluctuations must excite the feedback mechanisms that we have just described .
The Test
1 . Run the models with the observed sea surface temperatures as boundary conditions .
2 . Use the models to calculate the heat radiation emitted to space .
3 . Use satellites to measure the heat radiation actually emitted by the earth .
When temperature fluctuations lead to warmer temperatures , emitted heat radiation should increase , but positive feedbacks should inhibit these emissions by virtue of the enhanced ‘ blanketing . ’
Given the model climate sensitivities , this ‘ blanketing ’ should typically reduce the emissions by a factor of about 2 or 3 from what one would see in the absence of feedbacks .
If the satellite data confirms the calculated emissions , then this would constitute solid evidence that the model feedbacks are correct .
The Results of an Inadvertent Test
Above graph :
Comparison of the observed broadband LW and SW flux anomalies for the tropics with climate model simulations using observed SST records .
The models are not given volcanic aerosols , so the should not expected to show the Mt. Pinatubo eruption effects in mid-1991 through mid-1993 .
The dashed line shows the mean of all five models , and the gray band shows the total rnage of model anomalies ( maximum to minimum ) .
It is the topmost panel for long wave ( LW ) emission that we want .
Let us examine the top figure a bit more closely .
From 1985 until 1989 the models and observations are more or less the same – they have , in fact , been tuned to be so .
However , with the warming after 1989 , the observations characteristically exceed 7 times the model values .
Recall that if the observations were only 2 - 3 times what the models produce , it would correspond to no feedback .
What we see is much more than this – implying strong negative feedback .
Note that the ups and downs of both the observations and the model ( forced by observed sea surface temperature ) follow the ups and downs of temperature ( not shown ) .
Note that these results were sufficiently surprising that they were confirmed by at least 4 other groups :
Chen , J. , B.E. Carlson , and A.D. Del Genio , 2002 : Evidence for strengthening of the tropical general circulation in the 1990s .
Science , 295 , 838-841 . Cess , R.D. and P.M. Udelhofen , 2003 : Climate change during 1985 – 1999 : Cloud interactions determined from satellite measurements .
Geophys .
Res. Ltrs. , 30 , No. 1 , 1019 , doi:10.1029/2002GL016128 . Hatzidimitriou , D. , I. Vardavas , K. G. Pavlakis , N. Hatzianastassiou , C. Matsoukas , and E. Drakakis ( 2004 )

Clement , A.C. and B. Soden ( 2005 )
The sensitivity of the tropical - mean radiation budget .
J. Clim. , 18 , 3189 -3203 .
The preceding authors did not dwell on the profound implications of these results – they had not intended a test of model feedbacks !
Rather , they mostly emphasized that the differences had to arise from cloud behavior ( a well acknowledged weakness of current models ) .
However , as noted by Chou and Lindzen ( 2005 , Comments on “ Examination of the Decadal Tropical Mean ERBS Nonscanner Radiation Data for the Iris Hypothesis ” , J. Climate , 18 , 2123-2127 ) , the results imply a strong negative feedback regardless of what one attributes this to .
The Bottom Line
The earth ’s climate ( in contrast to the climate in current climate GCMs ) is dominated by a strong net negative feedback .
Climate sensitivity is on the order of 0.3°C , and such warming as may arise from increasing greenhouse gases will be indistinguishable from the fluctuations in climate that occur naturally from processes internal to the climate system itself .
An aside on Feedbacks
Here is an easily appreciated example of positive and negative feedback .
In your car , the gas and brake pedals act as negative feedbacks to reduce speed when you are going too fast and increase it when you are going too slow .
If someone were to reverse the position of the pedals without informing you , then they would act as positive feedbacks : increasing your speed when you are going too fast , and slowing you down when you are going too slow .
Alarming climate predictions depend critically on the fact that models have large positive feedbacks .
The crucial question is whether nature actually behaves this way ?
The answer , as we have just seen , is unambiguously no .
UPDATE : There are some suggestions ( in comments ) that the graph has issues of orbital decay affecting the nonscanner instrument ’s field of view .
I ’ve sent a request off to Dr. Lindzen for clarification .
– Anthony
UPDATE2 : While I have not yet heard from Dr. Lindzen ( it has only been 3 hours as of this writing ) commenter “ wmanny ” found this below , apparently written by Lindzen to address the issue :
“ Recently , Wong et al ( Wong , Wielicki et al , 2006 , Reexamination of the Observed Decadal Variability of the Earth Radiation Budget Using Altitude - Corrected ERBE / ERBS Nonscanner WFOV Data , J. Clim. , 19 , 4028 - 4040 ) have reassessed their data to reduce the magnitude of the anomaly , but the remaining anomaly still represents a substantial negative feedback , and there is reason to question the new adjustments . ”
I found the text above to match “ wmanny ’s ” comment in a presentation given by Lindzen to Colgate University on 7/11/2008 which you can see here as a PDF :

UPDATE3 : I received this email today ( 4/10 ) from Dr. Lindzen .
My sincere thanks for his response .
Dear Anthony ,
The paper was sent out for comments , and the comments ( even those from “ realclimate ” ) are appreciated .
In fact , the reduction of the difference in OLR between the 80’s and 90’s due to orbital decay seems to me to be largely correct .
However , the reduction in Wong , Wielicki et al ( 2006 ) of the difference in the spikes of OLR between observations and models cannot be attributed to orbital decay , and seem to me to be questionable .
Nevertheless , the differences that remain still imply negative feedbacks .
We are proceeding to redo the analysis of satellite data in order to better understand what went into these analyses .
The matter of net differences between the 80’s and 90’s is an interesting question .
Given enough time , the radiative balance is reestablished and the anomalies can be wiped out .
The time it takes for this to happen depends on climate sensitivity with adjustments occurring more rapidly when sensitivity is less .
However , for the spikes , the time scales are short enough to preclude adjustment except for very low sensitivity .
That said , it has become standard in climate science that data in contradiction to alarmism is inevitably ‘ corrected ’ to bring it closer to alarming models .
None of us would argue that this data is perfect , and the corrections are often plausible .
What is implausible is that the ‘ corrections ’ should always bring the data closer to models .
Best wishes ,
Dick

Defense Department Threatens Gitmo Lawyer With Jail for Writing to President Obama
Created : April 06 , 2009 14:33 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
This story , which was reported in The Guardian and confirmed by publicly filed court documents , is one of the stranger means the Obama administration has used thus far to keep quiet the sins of its predecessor .
As I ’ve written before , lawyers representing the ex-Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed have been complaining that the U.S. government is forbidding the release of evidence that the Ethiopian - born U.K. resident was tortured in U.S. custody .
In February , Clive Stafford Smith , director of the nonprofit organization Reprieve , which represents many Guantanamo Bay detainees , sent President Obama a letter saying that the Defense Department was not letting Obama see the evidence .
Smith suggested that , as the commander - in - chief , Obama may want to change that .
Well , officials from the Department of Defense who make up a “ privilege review team , ” which monitors and censors communication between Guantanamo prisoners and their lawyers , did n’t like that at all .
So in March , they filed a report with a federal court in Washington , D.C. , calling the Reprieve lawyers ’ letter “ unprofessional ” and charging that they ’d violated the court ’s protective order , which protects classified evidence .
The odd thing about it was the letter to President Obama contained no evidence , and the attached memo discussing the torture was entirely blacked out — illustrating what Smith called the “ bizarre reality ” of the court ’s order , which forbids even the president from seeing the evidence .
So how his this violating a protective order ?
The Defense Department ’s report is n’t clear , but Judge Thomas Hogan has ordered Smith and his colleague Ahmed Ghappour to appear in his court on May 11 and explain why they should not be held in contempt of court — and perhaps jailed for up to six months — for their alleged transgression .
“ What this is really all about is official embarrassment at looking bad . ”
Govs .
Mark Sanford , Bobby Jindal and Sarah Palin led the anti-stimulus charge , but all three submitted letters in recent days asking to be eligible for federal funds .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO GOP govs get dose of stimulus reality
The list of governors threatening to decline federal stimulus money last month read like a list of Republicans considering running for president in 2012 : Govs. Mark Sanford , Bobby Jindal and Sarah Palin led the anti-stimulus charge .
But what began with a bang is ending with something closer to a whimper .
All three of those governors have been forced to scale back their expectations , to varying degrees , as the push of conservative philosophy gave way to the pull of political reality .

All three found that praise from the conservative movement in Washington meant nothing to furious state legislators of both parties .
And in the end , along with other conservative Republican governors , the three submitted letters in recent days asking to be eligible for federal funds , a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget confirmed .
“ We ’ve tried to compromise in a variety of different ways and now we ’ve gotten to … a position well past the halfway mark , ” Sanford told POLITICO in an interview , conceding that , “ I got beaten up pretty bad on it . ”
Sanford is still working to persuade his state Legislature to find cuts to cancel out the new federal spending .
Still , he has been attacked on his state ’s top editorial pages by activists occupying a tent city outside his mansion and by the Republican chairman of the state Senate finance committee , who released a “ chaos budget ” designed to show the downside of Sanford ’s plans .
He responded to critics with a television ad Thursday , arguing that he was sparing his state 's children from future debt .
Jindal , meanwhile , toned down his firm opposition and turned his focus to a much narrower rejection of two pots of money ; Palin , too , has narrowed her objections and promised to work with legislators who want the money .
“ At this point , it looks like everybody ’s on board with the program , ” said Tom Gavin , an OMB spokesman .
The governors ’ shifts from a national ideological offensive against Obama to a defensive damage control approach at home reveals the degree to which Republicans are still struggling to find a coherent path of opposition to the president , and the extent to which governors ’ mansions — often seen as ideal steppingstones to the White House — can derail political careers in tough economic times .
And Democrats have relished the intra-party GOP warfare .
" What we saw was Gov. Sanford playing chicken , and he got run over , ” said Hari Sevugan , a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee .
“ And we 've seen , to varying degrees , others reaping blowback from local communities , as well .
But that 's a natural result of taking a position based on politics instead of doing what 's right . ”
Republican governors faced with the popular federal spending legislation , formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , staked positions on a political continuum , with national conservative support at one end and local approval at the other .
Some , like Govs. Charlie Crist of Florida and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California , kept their approach local .
They campaigned for the legislation with the president and accepted the money enthusiastically .
Schwarzenegger ’s Austrian birth bars him , in any case , from national office .
And Crist was less concerned about angering the conservative movement than about his standing in Florida , where he ’s considering a Senate bid .
Other governors sought a middle ground .
Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota opposed the stimulus but accepted the funding on the grounds that “ Minnesota is a net donor to the federal government , ” making the payments only fair .
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas also noted in his certification letter that his state is a net contributor to Washington .
Perry — along with Palin , Sanford , Jindal and Govs. Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Bob Riley of Alabama — said he ’d reject one portion of the stimulus : unemployment insurance funding that would have covered laid - off part - time workers .
In states whose unemployment programs do n’t currently cover those workers , the shift would have required changes to state law , and governors say they worried that when stimulus funds run out , the expanded unemployment insurance responsibilities will constitute a new tax on state businesses .
But the prospect of even partial rejection of the federal funds has sparked several statehouse uprisings .
Lawmakers , including Republicans in Alaska , Alabama , South Carolina , Mississippi and Texas , moved to make end runs around their governors and accept the money .
Jindal — who became the party ’s most prominent voice against the stimulus in his rebuttal to Obama ’s State of the Union address last month — appears to be rejecting just one other pot of federal cash on top of the $ 98 million in unemployment insurance : $ 9.5 million in health spending .
The local press noted , meanwhile , that he plans to request federal funds for a New Orleans - to - Baton Rouge passenger rail service from the same pot of railroad money he denounced as a vehicle for “ wasteful spending . ”
A Jindal spokeswoman did n’t respond to a request for details about his stance , but he wrote in his certification letter that he would spend the money “ in a way that does not add an undue burden to the current financial situation in our state . ”
Palin ’s reversal was even more abrupt .
She opened the battle March 19 by saying her state would “ not request ” some 31 percent of federal funds .
Facing an uproar from legislators , her lieutenant governor , Sean Parnell , assured the media the next day that Palin was n’t “ rejecting ” the money , just seeking a public debate on spending .
And Palin herself then weighed in , saying the money was still “ on the table . ”
Palin has since pledged to work out differences with her Legislature , and her spokeswoman would only forward a copy of her March 31 certification letter .
“ It is possible that there will be areas where the state will choose not to apply for funds , ” she said , noting that legislators were hearing public testimony and adding that she would apply for it on a “ case by case ” basis .
The concessions in Louisiana and Alabama leave South Carolina ’s Sanford as the only governor resisting large elements of the stimulus beyond unemployment insurance .
Sanford plans to refuse $ 700 million from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund , on the grounds , he said , that it would expand government and impede reform .
“ Once you ’ve got the money , there ’s no need to make the reforms , ” he said of changes he ’s seeking to the state education system .
The state ’s attorney general has said legislators can’t accept the money without the governor ’s cooperation , leading to a charged standoff in Columbia that ’s left Sanford bloodied but , he says , undeterred .
“ Over time we ’ll be vindicated , but it ’s been tough , ” he said .
ATHENS , Feb 25 ( Reuters ) - Greeks disgruntled by their country ’s economic woes ramped up protests against the government on Wednesday , shutting down airports and disrupting many public services .
Public schools and tax offices shut down , and services at ministries and public offices were suspended , as hundreds of workers marched to parliament with banners reading “ No to pension reforms , privatisations and job cuts ” .
“ Government policy ... only burdens workers , the unemployed and the poor , ” public sector umbrella union ADEDY , which represents 500,000 members , said in a statement .
The strikes are the latest in a wave of protests that have put pressure on Greece ’s conservative government , shaken by the worst riots in decades in December and struggling with a sharp economic downturn .
After years of 4 percent growth , Greece is seeing its economy sharply slowing down due to the global financial crisis .
Workers accuse the conservative government , clinging to a one - seat majority in parliament , of only helping the rich .
“ We will continue and intensify our struggle , until our demands are satisfied , ” ADEDY , which called the 24 - hour strike , said .
National carrier Olympic airlines [ OLY.UL ] said 68 of its domestic and international flights were cancelled and four were rescheduled , while private rival Aegean Airlines AGNr .
AT said 36 flights were grounded and 23 others disrupted .
The government , struggling with a huge public debt and fiscal deficits , has launched a 28 - billion - euro ( $ 36 - billion ) bank support plan , saying it meant to pour money into the slowing economy .
The strike was the latest in a series of public protests to hit the ruling conservatives .
December riots were prompted by the police shooting of a teenager but fuelled by discontent over the economy and high youth unemployment .
In January , thousands of farmers protesting low product prices blocked border crossings , causing 11 days of travel chaos across Greece and hurting commercial transport .
They ended the protest after securing a 500 - million - euro aid package .
Truckers went on strike last week , demanding a crackdown on unlicensed transport companies and illegal economic immigrants , who they said were destroying goods and fighting drivers in their effort to stow away on board .
On Wednesday , they ended the five - day strike and blockades at the borders with Bulgaria and Greek ports , after transport ministry officials promised to start talks .
“ Our strike is over , but only for now , ” said the president of Greek truck drivers federation , Apostolos Kenanides .
My favorite Linux tool in DB work is ‘ iostat - x ’ ( and I really really want to see whenever I ’m doing any kind of performance analysis ) , yet I had to learn its limitations and properties .
For example , I took 1s snapshot from a slightly overloaded 16 - disk database box :
avg - cpu : %user %nice %system %iowait %steal %idle 8.12 0.00 2.57 21.65 0.00 67.66
Device : rrqm/s wrqm / s r/s w/s rsec/s wsec /s \ sda 7684.00 19.00 2420.00 498.00 81848.00 5287.00 \ avgrq - sz avgqu-sz await svctm %util 29.86 32.99 11.17 0.34 100.00
I pasted this somewhere on IRC , and got “ does n’t look too healthy ” and that it is disk - bound .
Now , to understand if it really is , one has to understand what iostat tells here .
First line of numbers shows that we ’ve got plenty of CPU resources ( thats because nowadays it is quite difficult to get a box with not enough CPU power , and I / O still seems to be bottleneck ) – and we have more threads waiting for I/O than we have CPU execution ( that sounds normal ) .
Now the actual per-disk statistics are where one should look .
I used to prefer %util over general % iowait ( I could n’t really explain what % iostat is , and I can say what %util is ) .
I do n’t know why , but iostat has most interesting bits at the end , and not so interesting at the start :
%util : how much time did the storage device have outstanding work ( was busy ) .
In proper RAID environments it is more like “ how much time did at least one disk in RAID array have something to do ” .
I ’m deliberately excluding any kind of cache here – if request can be served from cache , the chance is quite negligible it will show up in %util , unlike in other values .
What this also means – the RAID subsystem can be loaded from 6.25 % ( one disk doing the work ) to 100 % ( all of them busy ) .
Thats quite a lot of insight in single value of ‘ 100 % ’ , is n’t it ?

svctm :
Though manual says
“ The average service time ( in milliseconds ) for I /O requests that were issued to the device . ” , it is n’t exactly that when you look at multiple - disk systems .
What it says is , “ when your I / O subsystem is busy , how fast does it respond requests overall ” .
Actually , less you load your system , higher svctm is ( as there ’re less outstanding requests , and average time to serve them goes up ) .
Of course , at some certain moment , when I/ O becomes really overloaded , you can see svctm going up .
One can tweak / sys / block / sda / queue / nr_requests based on this – to avoid overloading I/O controller , though that is really rarely needed .

One of my favorites – how fast do requests go through .
It is just an average , how long it takes to serve a request for a device , once it gets into device queue , to final “ OK ” .
Low = good , high = bad .
There ’re few gotchas here – even though different reads can have different performance properties ( middle of disk , outer areas of disk , etc ) , the biggest difference is between reads and writes .
Reads take time , writes can be instant ( write caching at underlying layers .. ) .
As 80 % of requests were reads , we can try to account for that by doing 11.17/0.8 math , to get 14 ms figure .
Thats quite high – systems that are n’t loaded can show ~5 ms times ( which is n’t that far away from 4 ms rotation time of 15 krpm disk ) .

One of my favorites – how fast do requests go through .

avgqu-sz :
Very very very important value – how many requests are there in a request queue .
Low = either your system is not loaded , or has serialized I/O and cannot utilize underlying storage properly .
High = your software stack is scalable enough to load properly underlying I/O .
Queue size equal to amount of disks means ( in best case of request distribution ) that all your disks are busy .
Queue size higher than amount of disks means that you are already trading I / O response time for better throughput ( disks can optimize order of operations if they know them beforehand , thats what NCQ – Native Command Queueing does ) .
If one complains about I / O performance issues when avgqu-sz is lower , then it is application specific stuff , that can be resolved with more aggressive read - ahead , less fsyncs , etc .
One interesting part – avqu-sz , await , svctm and %util are iterdependent ( await = avgqu-sz * svctm / ( %util/100 )

Quite often will look like a block size of some kind – can indicate what kind of workload happens .
This is already post - merging , so lots of adjacent block operations will bump this up .
Also , if database page is 16 k , though filesystem or volume manager block is 32 k , this will be seen in avgrq -sz .
Large requests indicate there ’s some big batch / stream task going on .

wsec /s & rsec/s : Sectors read and written per second .
Divide by 2048 , and you ’ll get megabytes per second .
I wanted to write this is n’t important , but remembered all the non-database people who store videos on filesystems :)
So , if megabytes per second matter , these values are important ( and can be seen in ‘ vmstat ’ output too ) .
If not , for various database people there are other ones :

This is already post - merging , and in proper I / O setups reads will mean blocking random read ( serial reads are quite often merged ) , and writes will mean non-blocking random write ( as underlying cache can allow to serve the OS instantly ) .
These numbers are the ones that are the I/O capacity figures , though of course , depending on how much pressure underlying I /O subsystem gets ( queue size ! ) , they can vary .
And as mentioned above , on rotational media it is possible to trade response time ( which is not that important in parallel workloads ) for better throughput .

rrqm/s & wrqm/s :
How many requests were merged by block layer .
In ideal world , there should be no merges at I / O level , because applications would have done it ages ago .
Ideals differ though , for others it is good to have kernel doing this job , so they do n’t have to do it inside application .
Quite often there will be way less merges , because applications which tend to write adjacent blocks , also tend to wait after every write ( see my rant on I / O schedulers ) .
Reads however can be merged way easier – especially if application does “ read ahead ” block by block .
Another reason for merges is simple block size mismatch – 16 k database pages on top of 8 k database pages will cause adjacent block reads , which would be merged by block layer .
On some systems read of two adjacent pages would result in 1MB reads , but thats another rant :)

So , after all this , the iostat output above tells us something like :
System has healthy high load ( request queue has two - requests - per- disk )
Average request time is double the value one would expect from idle system , it is n’t too harmful , but one can do better
It is reading 80 40 MB / s from disks , at 2420 requests /s .
Thats quite high performance from inexpensive 2u database server ( shameless plug : X4240 :)
40 MB /s from disks , at 2420 requests /s .

High amount of merges comes from LVM snapshots , can be ignored

Here ’s an interesting paper that will appear in SIGMOD’09 comparing the MapReduce paradigm to parallel conventional databases .
The benchmark study described in the paper showed that the parallel database approach performed significantly faster , although it took longer to load the data .
A Comparison of Approaches to Large - Scale Data Analysis , Pavlo , Paulson , Rasin Abadi , DeWitt , Madden , and Stonebraker .
There is currently considerable enthusiasm around the MapReduce ( MR ) paradigm for large - scale data analysis .
Although the basic control flow of this framework has existed in parallel SQL database management systems ( DBMS ) for over 20 years , some have called MR a dramatically new computing model .
In this paper , we describe and compare both paradigms .
Furthermore , we evaluate both kinds of systems in terms of performance and development complexity .
To this end , we define a benchmark consisting of a collection of tasks that we have run on an open source version of MR as well as on two parallel DBMSs .
For each task , we measure each system ’s performance for various degrees of parallelism on a cluster of 100 nodes .
Our results reveal some interesting trade - offs .
Although the process to load data into and tune the execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system , the observed performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better .
We speculate about the causes of the dramatic performance difference and consider implementation concepts that future systems should take from both kinds of architectures .
Benchmark details available so others can recreate the trials .
US President Barack Obama has announced pay curbs for bankers ; in France , Nicolas Sarkozy is to restrict traders ' rewards .
Here in the UK , part - nationalised banks are still doling out bonuses , while Lord Mandelson bleats that they should consider " how it looks " .
Restraining top bankers ' pay is not a PR exercise , as Mandelson appears to believe ; it is a necessary part of healing and re-making the banking system .
Our politicians should emulate Obama and leave the nationalised bankers in no doubt that their role is now that of public servants , and that they will be paid accordingly .
The Obama plan to cap pay at $ 500,000 has plenty of loopholes , but that does n't detract from its powerful symbolism : excessive rewards will no longer be tolerated .
Mandelson , Darling and Brown , however , still seem to be in the grip of " BankThink " - that warped worldview in which large bonuses are not only reasonable , but necessary .
BankThink maintains that curbing bonuses will lead to a brain drain from the sector .
What brains are those ?
I guess it must be the great intellects who can't see a problem with creating the credit crunch , then asking taxpayers on the average income ( about £ 25,000 - a year , not an hour ) to fund their bonuses .
Adherents to BankThink say big bonuses attract the best people .
They do n't : they attract the soulless , the amoral and the avaricious .
Professions such as teaching and medicine - and , yes , politics - draw in excellent practitioners without ludicrous rewards .
Regulation , of pay or anything else , is anathema in BankThink : we are told it is pointless trying to regulate top pay because some people will find ways round it .
True , but so what ?
Most people will comply with new regulation , and it can drive cultural change ; tougher drink - driving laws , for instance , have made it socially unacceptable to get behind the wheel with a few glasses of Piat d'Or under your belt - unexceptional behaviour in the 1970s .
Bloated executive pay at banks and other firms does not represent a fair reward for talent , as BankThink would have you believe , but a huge market failure engineered with the connivance of weak remuneration committees , venal headhunters and unchallenging shareholders .
It has undermined the moral authority of business leaders , made organisations more resentful and less productive , torn at the fabric of society and torpedoed the work ethic , by severing any recognisable link between effort and reward .
It is not only top bankers , but executives in general , who have stoked the excess .
A US study last year found chief executives at the top 500 companies received pay packages worth , on average , $ 10.5 m - or 344 times the earnings of the average worker .
As Peter Drucker , the management writer , has argued , that ratio ought to be brought right back down - he suggests to the region of 20:1 or 25:1 .
What motivates people is not necessarily absolute sums of money , but how well they are doing in relation to others , and the beauty of linking the boss 's pay to that of the average worker is that his staff 's earnings would have to rise in order for him to earn more .
Ordinary bank staff , many of them on modest salaries , are finding their own small bonuses also under attack .
I sympathise .
They have been badly let down by their bosses ; but a better alignment between the boardroom and the banking hall would reduce the risk of it happening again .
Boardroom clones face up to the truth , now they need to add a bit of diversity
FTSE 100 boards are still stuffed with white , middle - aged , middle - class men , a fact I have lamented in the pages of this newspaper .
At least , though , they seem to recognise it as a problem .
Research commissioned by accountancy firm KPMG found business leaders were aware that their company boards are very narrowly constituted and see life through a lens distorted by class , cultural and gender privilege .
They have n't done anything about it yet , but self - knowledge is a good start .
The KPMG research backs up my view that this lack of diversity led to a " dissent deficit " , which in turn contributed to the financial meltdown : when boards are full of identikit directors , there is unlikely to be enough debate
or challenge .
This is not just about getting more women at the top table : it is also about more diversity in terms of race and social class .
As the credit crunch has shown , a monocultural boardroom is not just outmoded and politically incorrect : it is a commercial weakness .
Second wave of crunch will wipe out pensions
If anyone still doubts the destructive force of the credit crunch , consider the second - wave effects on pensions .
It 's a little noticed fact , but 290 company pension schemes with 120,000 members are already in a queue for a bail - out from the over - stretched government Pension Protection Fund .
Between them , the 225 companies in the FTSE 350 which operate final - salary pension schemes are shouldering a deficit of £ 163bn ; according to a report by actuary firm Hymans Robertson , that shortfall has risen five - fold in the past year in relation to the companies ' market value .
In the case of 37 companies - including industrials such as GKN and all the high - street banks except HSBC - unmatched pension liabilities are in excess of their stock market value .
Industrial companies are still suffering from the last recession , which has left them groaning under a pensions legacy out of all proportion to lean , post - Thatcherite manufacturing ; this time banks and retailers will suffer the strain .
Companies need to have adult conversations with employees and unions and come up with a strategy , but most are remarkably reluctant to embark on this .
From the point of view of shareholders - including , er , pension funds - it is disastrous , as unchecked retirement liabilities will act as a drain on corporate earnings for decades .
From the point of view of pension fund members , it is even worse , as their savings for old age could be at risk .
Why have chief executives mortgaged their businesses to their pension funds in this hugely risky fashion ?
Why have they failed to put in place secure funding for their own staff 's retirement nest eggs ?
It has been all too easy to kick the issue into the long grass .
Most chief executives have shown little urgency to tackle pension problems , since the benefits might not be seen for 30 years , and certainly will not boost next year 's bonus .
The crisis in Britain 's corporate pension schemes is yet another product of short - termism and skewed management incentives .
WASHINGTON --
The CIA destroyed nearly 100 videotapes of interrogations and other U.S. treatment of terror suspects , far more than previously acknowledged , the Obama administration said Monday as it began disclosing details of post - Sept. 11 Bush - era actions .
The interrogations were a highly contentious issue during the administration of President George W. Bush , with many Democrats and other critics saying that some methods used amounted to torture -- a contention Bush and other officials rejected .
A criminal prosecutor is wrapping up his investigation in the matter .
More about terrorism :
Nation | World
More about the CIA :
Nation | World
Monday 's acknowledgment , however , involved a civil lawsuit filed in New York by the American Civil Liberties Union seeking more details of the interrogation programs following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
" The CIA can now identify the number of videotapes that were destroyed , " said the letter submitted in that case by Acting U.S. Attorney Lev Dassin .
" Ninety - two videotapes were destroyed . "
It is not clear what exactly was on the recordings .
The government 's letter cites interrogation videos , but the lawsuit against the Defense Department also seeks records related to treatment of detainees , any deaths of detainees and the CIA 's sending of suspects overseas , known as " extraordinary rendition . "
At the White House , press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters he had n't spoken to the president about the report , but called the news about the videotapes " sad , " and said Obama was committed to ending torture while also protecting American values .
ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said the CIA should be held in contempt of court for holding back the information for so long .
" The large number of videotapes destroyed confirms that the agency engaged in a systematic attempt to hide evidence of its illegal interrogations and to evade the court 's order , " Singh said .
CIA spokesman George Little said the agency " has certainly cooperated with the Department of Justice investigation .
If anyone thinks it 's agency policy to impede the enforcement of American law , they simply do n't know the facts . "
The details of interrogations of terror suspects , and the existence of tapes documenting those sessions , have become the subject of long fights in a number of different court cases .
In the trial of Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui , prosecutors initially claimed no such recordings existed , then acknowledged after the trial was over that two videotapes and one audiotape had been made .
The Dassin letter , dated March 2 to Judge Alvin Hellerstein , says the CIA is now gathering more details for the lawsuit , including a list of the destroyed records , any secondary accounts that describe the destroyed contents and the identities of those who may have viewed or possessed the recordings before they were destroyed .
But the lawyers also note that some of that information may be classified , such as the names of CIA personnel who viewed the tapes .
" The CIA intends to produce all of the information requested to the court and to produce as much information as possible on the public record to the plaintiffs , " states the letter .
The separate criminal investigation includes interrogations of al - Qaida lieutenant Abu Zubaydah and another top al - Qaida leader .
Tapes of those interrogations were destroyed , in part , the Bush administration said , to protect the identities of the government questioners at a time the Justice Department was debating whether or not the tactics used during the interrogations were legal .
Former CIA director Michael Hayden acknowledged that waterboarding -- simulated drowning -- was used on three suspects , including two whose interrogations were recorded .
John Durham , a senior career prosecutor in Connecticut , is leading the criminal investigation , out of Virginia , and had asked that he be given until the end of February to wrap up his work before requests for information in the civil lawsuit were dealt with .
Durham 's spokesman , Tom Carson , had no immediate comment .

Browser testing is much harder than it should be , but a new Microsoft tool announced today at the MIX09 Web Developer Conference in Las Vegas could be the answer to many of our problems .
Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview allows developers to compare how a page is rendered in different browsers at the same time .
The tool is a similar concept to Adobe Meermeer ( reviewed by Josh Catone in December 2008 ) , but SuperPreview can be used as a standalone application and a free version is available .
The SuperPreview team visited customer sites and interviewed web developers to determine the feature set :
Different browsers can be viewed and compared in vertical and horizontal layouts .
Scrolling moves all the pages at the same time .
The pages can be rendered at different browser sizes .
A pixel ruler and full - page thumbnail helps page navigation .
PhotoShop - like window guides can be positioned to check element alignment .
Hovering or clicking highlights individual DOM elements and reports the ID , classes and dimensions .
However , the killer feature is overlay layout : it allows you to stack a partially transparent browser on top of a design mockup or any other browser .
Rendering differences can be spotted in an instant .
Further screenshots ( unreleased development build ) :
The full version of SuperPreview appears in the next release of Microsoft Expression Web and will support IE , Firefox , and Safari .
The team is eager to work with other vendors so additional browsers may appear as the product evolves .
The snappily titled “ Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview for Windows Internet Explorer ” is available for download from Microsoft.com now ( 250 MB and requires . NET ) .
This is a pre-release of the free product and allows you to test IE6 and IE7 ( or IE8 if you have it installed ) .
Several features are missing and the usual beta software warnings apply .
SuperPreview has not undergone usability testing until now .
The team would appreciate bug reports and suggestions , so click the bug icon to send your feedback .

The report said death rates of children and expectant women had not declined Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza suffer from an " ailing landscape " of health services , a new study claims .
The Lancet medical journal report highlights how 10 % of Palestinian children now have stunted growth .
The paper describes the healthcare system in the Palestinian territories as " fragmented and incoherent " .
An Israeli government spokesperson said the Lancet had failed to seek its view , and said many Palestinians had accessed medical care in the country .
Mark Regev , a spokesman for the Israeli government , called the report one - sided .
He said : " This is propaganda in the guise of a medical report . "
Experts from Birzeit University say death rates among children and expectant mothers have failed to decline in recent years .
The plateau is in spite of good ante-natal care and high rates of child immunisation .
The trend for stunting among children is increasing , and the concern is about the long - term effects
Dr Hanan Abdul Rahim
Birzeit University Dr Hanan Abdul Rahim said : " There are gaps in care .
There 's a low level of post -natal care and often it 's not given in a timely manner .
" Mortality rates among infants and under - fives have n't declined much .
This is unusual when compared with other Arab countries that used to have similar rates but have managed to bring them down .
" The trend for stunting among children is increasing , and the concern is about the long - term effects .
It is caused by chronic malnutrition , and affects cognitive development and physical health .
" There are pockets in northern Gaza where the level of stunted growth reaches 30 % .
" It 's very important that women and children have access to quality care . "
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Dr Rahim 's paper mentions a previously published report from the UN , which says more than 60 Palestinian women have given birth at Israeli checkpoints and 36 of their babies have died as a result .
Another paper says the Palestinian health system fails to be effective and equitable .
' Heartbreaking '
The conditions of military occupation are blamed , but so is the political instability of the Palestinian Authority - which has appointed six health ministers in three years .
Israel as a policy enables and encourages people from all over the world to come to Israel for advanced medical treatment
Unit of Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories spokesman
The lead author , Dr Awad Mataria , also from Birzeit University , said : " Political havoc is one of the reasons for the failure of the health system - but this has been exaggerated and perpetuated under occupation .
" Also , the policies of foreign aid donors can be fragmented and contradictory . "
Dr Mataria 's paper note that the Palestinian Authority has received $ 10bn in recent years - mostly donated by the European Union .
But he and his colleagues say health programmes have focused on relief and emergency , rather than on long - term development .
In an editorial accompanying the series , the Lancet 's editor Richard Horton said : " Our series is not about Arab politics , the status of Israel , or existing conventional diplomatic efforts to broker peace . "
He added : " The latest storm of violence to engulf Gaza has been heartbreaking to watch , especially for those who have seen first hand the predicaments faced by health professionals trying to maintain a rudimentary , but ultimately failing , health system there . "
Israeli response
An Israeli government spokesperson from the office responsible for coordination with the Palestinian territories said the researchers had failed to get a full picture of health care in the region .
He said : " In the two year period supposedly covered by the report over 28,000 Palestinians accessed Israel from the Gaza Strip for medical needs .
" Contrary to the indications of the writers , at no time was medical access from Gaza prevented as a policy .
" On the contrary , the only time medical aid in Israel was prevented was as a direct result of a Palestinian decision or on limited occasions when the crossing in to Israel was under direct threat and attack . "
He added : " Israel as a policy enables and encourages people from all over the world to come to Israel for advanced medical treatment it is only natural that our closest neighbour , the Palestinians , enjoy this privilege . "

Colorado Springs - based Focus on the Family gave $ 727,250 in cash and services to the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 campaign in California , according to records released by the California secretary of state , including a $ 100,000 check in late October , just days before the evangelical media empire announced it planned to lay off nearly 20 percent of its employees .
While there has been public scrutiny of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints for its attempts to influence the campaign to reverse a California Supreme Court ruling allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry , Focus on the Family and related donors pumped more than six times as much as the Mormon church did into the ProtectMarriage.com campaign , records show .
Altogether , donations supporting Proposition 8 from Focus on the Family , one of its major benefactors and an offshoot lobbying organization totaled more than $ 1.251 million — just shy of the $ 1.275 million contributed by ProtectMarriage.com ’s largest donor , the Knights of Columbus , the Connecticut - based political arm of the Catholic Church .
In addition to $ 727,250 reported by Focus on the Family , major backer and board member Elsa Prince , the billionaire heiress of Holland , Mich. , donated $ 450,000 to ProtectMarriage.com in two cash chunks and the Washington , D.C. - based Family Research Council , a Christian - right lobbying organization spun off from Focus on the Family and founded in part by Prince ’s foundation , chipped in $ 74,400 .
“ People are keenly aware of how much money was put in by the hate groups , ” said Rick Jacobs , chair and founder of the Courage Campaign , a progressive California organization leading the charge to overturn Proposition 8 in court .
“ It ’s good to get the facts finally out about how much Focus did put in . ”
The Mormon church donated $ 189,000 in nonmonetary expenditures — mostly staff time and airline tickets — to help pass the ballot measure , according to the latest disclosure from the California secretary of state .
The church remains “ under investigation ” by the California Fair Political Practices Commission after a complaint was filed against the church by the anti-Proposition 8 group Californians Against Hate , the Salt Lake Tribune reported Monday .
“ One of the reasons the Courage Campaign highlighted the role of the leadership of the Mormon church in this campaign , ” Jacobs said , “ is that people do not like outside interference .
They certainly do n’t like having right - wing religious organizations telling them how to live their lives . ”
The Proposition 8 campaign was the most expensive social - issue ballot question in national history at just over $ 83 million , with proponents of the marriage ban raising $ 40 million and opponents raising $ 43 million , California election records show .
Voters approved the measure with 52 percent of the vote , but both sides are arguing the constitutionality of the measure in state court .
Focus on the Family donated more to the Proposition 8 campaign than has been reported , The Colorado Independent has found .
A widely reported sum of “ $ 657,000 in money and services ” donated toward the ballot measure by Focus falls short of the total , failing to account for contributions made by the organization as long ago as November 2007 when Focus on the Family helped seed ProtectMarriage.com with a $ 50,000 cash contribution .
The evangelical group spent another $ 35,650 in December 2007 supporting the anti-gay marriage group with Web ads , e-mail blasts , radio broadcasts , printing and postage , according to a disclosure form filed with the California secretary of state .
Total 2008 contributions from Focus on the Family to the Proposition 8 campaign were $ 641,600 , according to disclosure forms filed in January and made available to the public a week ago .
A Focus on the Family spokesman did n’t return a call seeking comment .
In addition — though apart from the $ 727,250 spent directly to pass Proposition 8 — Focus on the Family donated $ 14,915 in 2007 to the Save Our Kids referendum to overturn a California law that says “ no teacher shall give instruction nor shall a school district sponsor any activity that promotes a discriminatory bias because of ” homosexuality , transsexuality , bisexuality , or transgender status .
That campaign did n’t make it to the ballot , but was a precursor to the Proposition 8 campaign .
“ After much prayer , consideration and consultation , ” Save Our Kids organizers wrote on their Web site , the group decided to “ suspend the Save Our Kids campaign to allow our staff and supporters to dedicate themselves to the Marriage amendment ( Proposition 8 ) . ”
“ We were disgusted that a group like Focus on the Family would take people ’s money and dump it into a campaign here in California to try to take rights away from people , ” Jacobs said , although he tempered his disgust with delight at the layoffs that hit the ministry right after the election .
“ There is a decreasing market for hate , ” he said , “ and I think that ’s what Focus on the Family is reaping right now . ”
Focus on the Family announced on Nov. 17 that it planned to cut 202 jobs companywide , dropping the number of employees to about 950 , The Colorado Independent reported .
It was only the latest in a series of layoffs and cutbacks suffered by the Christian ministry , which also supports a massive CD , DVD , radio and Web - based enterprise .
At its height , the organization , which has its own ZIP code in Colorado Springs , employed more than 1,500 people .
Michigan - based auto - parts heiress Elsa Prince — whose son , Erik Prince , is the founder and CEO of Blackwater Worldwide , the controversial private security firm with annual contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan worth an estimated $ 500 million — has been closely tied to Focus on the Family for decades .
She and her late husband , Edgar , have been key benefactors to Focus and its lobbying arm , the Family Research Council , whose lavish headquarters was financed by Elsa as a memorial after her husband died .
“ Anybody who is investing in Focus in the Family ought to understand it ’s an investment in a losing organization , ” Jacobs said .
“ In the course of time , they ’ll become as extinct as the wooly mammoth . ”

Great Wall of China
The most comprehensive and technologically advanced survey of China ’s Great Wall has discovered the ancient monument is much longer than previously estimated , state media reported .
However the project has also shown the World Heritage - listed site is in danger of disappearing in many places due to road construction and other forms of development , as well as extreme weather , the China Daily said .
The wall , built over centuries to keep foreigners out of China , stretches for 8,851.8 kilometres , much further than common estimates of 5,000 kilometres , according to the findings of the survey .
The defensive structure includes 6,259.6 kilometres of actual wall , plus 359.7 kilometres of trenches and 2,232.5 kilometres of natural barriers such as hills and rivers .
The two - year mapping project , carried out by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage , involved using global positioning systems and infra-red technology .
Previous estimates were mainly based on historical records , rather than physically mapping each section .
By tracking thoroughly across mountains and through deserts , unknown parts were uncovered .
State Administration of Cultural Heritage director Shan Jixiang was quoted as saying the survey had helped clear up an ancient mystery over its length but also highlighted many problems in trying to preserve it .
“ The Great Wall is under great threat , climate change and the country ’s massive infrastructure building being the biggest two , ” the China Daily quoted Shan as saying .
The first parts of the Great Wall were built more than 2,000 years ago , then rebuilt and extended during the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 to 1644 AD ) amid the threat of invading northern tribes .

Classic Homo erectus fossils in Zhoukoudian caves are more than 700,000 years old .
A replica Homo erectus skull reconstructed from some of the Zhoukoudian fossils .
Nature
Researchers have sifted the sands of time to show that Homo erectus lived at China 's most famous anthropology site at least 250,000 years earlier than was thought .
The new date means that this early human ancestor â€ " the first lineage to migrate out of Africa â€ " prospered in an earlier , colder climate , and its physical development in China matched that in Africa , where the species first evolved .
Discovered in 1918 , the Zhoukoudian caves near Beijing have yielded surprises for nearly a century .
Layers in the hillside cave system overlooking a river valley have produced some 17,000 stone artefacts and fossils of 50 H. erectus individuals , including six skulls .
The species had a distinctive barrel - shaped torso and stood 145â €" 180 centimetres tall , walking upright in a similar way to modern humans ( Homo sapiens ) .
Now , work by a team of scientists based in China and the United States reveals that the Zhoukoudian cave fossils are about 770,000 years old â€ " much more ancient than previous estimates of 230,000â € " 500,000 years .
The new dates are based on the effects of cosmic rays on aluminium and beryllium isotopes in miniscule quartz grains â€ " which Chinese researchers meticulously selected from sedimentary sand in weeks of painstaking work .
The isotopic method was also applied successfully to three quartz tools .
The research is published in Nature1 .
" This is a catalyst for a new era of re-dating , " says palaeoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the University of Iowa at Iowa City , who was not involved with the work but has co-authored an accompanying News & Views article in Nature2 .
Cosmic dating
The aluminium / beryllium technique offers new opportunities for re-dating other palaeoanthropology locations , particularly in China where the age of sites is difficult to determine because of the lack of more easily dateable volcanic ash .
The method works for samples up to at least 3 million years old .
Guanjun Shen of Nanjing Normal University , one of the authors of the new study , says these studies are already underway .
" We are collecting samples from early Pleistocene hominin archaeological sites in China , " he says , " Notably at Xiaochangliang and Majuangou in the Nihewan basin of Hebei Province . "
This is northwest of Beijing , where this region 's earliest H. erectus lived .
To secure the new dates , Shen collaborated with co-author Darryl Granger at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana .
First , the team had to select clear , white quartz crystals that were buried with the fossils , not grey ones that might have been washed in later .
This meant tedious grain - by - grain examination of sediment .
One student working for eight hours could only isolate two grams of quartz , Shen says .
Because 60â €" 100 grams is needed for each test , Shen says : " I had to mobilize my students to work for weeks , work not so easily conceivable by my US collaborator . "
The dating method is based on the radioactive decay of 26Al and 10 Be isotopes .
While they 're on Earth 's surface , the two isotopes within the quartz are produced at a known ratio through exposure to cosmic radiation .
When sediment buries the quartz , the generation of isotopes by cosmic rays nearly stops .
The researchers dated the fossils by determining the isotopic content of the quartz and calculating backwards to work out the ratio of the two isotopes when the quartz was buried .
Ancient migrants
More precise dates will fill in gaps about the migrations of H. erectus into northern China and to Java in Indonesia , which occurred at least 1.6 million years ago .
H. erectus evolved about 2 million years ago in equatorial Africa , possibly surviving to 50,000 years ago in Indonesia .
Some anthropologists argue that there may have been two H. erectus migrations : the first along the southern Asian coast to Java , the other through Georgia then across northern China .
But Philip Rightmire , a palaeoanthropologist at Harvard University , is n't convinced .
" I do n't want to speculate on migration routes until there is more evidence , " he says , such as from a fossil site in Pakistan .
But he says the new dates clearly show that Zhoukoudian H. erectus developed physically in the same way as African H. erectus fossils found at the Tighenif site ( previously known as Ternifine ) in Algeria .

3 Perfect Places to Befriend a Buddhist Monk
1. Luang Prabang , Laos
Luang Prabang is an enchanting town in Southeast Asia .
It has numerous Buddhist Temples ( Wats ) that are filled with novices and monks practicing their faith .
For the traveler , Luang Prabang provides an unmatched opportunity to converse with the novices ( individuals who are studying in preparation for full ordination ) of the temples .
Each day novices study a variety of subjects including language courses .
English has become increasingly popular among novices who will either become fully ordained monks or return to Lao society .
The easiest way to build a conversation with novices or monks is to spend a significant amount of time on the grounds of one of the many temples .
In most cases you can approach one of its residence and ask a few questions about Buddhism to open a dialogue .
After a few minutes , you will be immersed in a discussion about a variety of topics ranging from faith to your homeland .
Luang Prabang has seen a significant growth in tourism over the past few years .
Be thoughtful in your approach with the temples and its residence .
Remember that this is their place of worship and their home .

2. Mahabodhi Temple of Bodh Gaya , India
Bodh Gaya , India is where Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment .
There are few places on earth that match the peacefulness of its Mahabodhi Temple , which was built at the Bodhi tree where the Buddha sat under around 530 BCE .
Visitors to hectic India will be particularly relaxed sitting among countless Buddhist monks who make journeys to India to pay respect to the Buddha and to collect falling leaves from the famous Bodhi tree .
If you ’re lucky , you may be meditating next to the singing Thai monk who visits the temple regularly .
He happens to have an affinity for tying Western music to Buddhist philosophy .
You will likely hear : “ keep smilin ’ , keep shinin ’ . ”
Knowin ’ you can always count of me , for sure ” or “ let it be , let it be .
Whisper words of wisdom , let it be . ”
The great philosopher will also help you deal with India ’s stifling heat with his little bottle of Thai Ang Ki , which cools your skin when added to a sprinkling of water .

3. Vang Vieng , Laos
If you can remove yourself from the crowds of young backpackers who are rock climbing , tubing down the river , and watching Friends re-runs in the restaurants of the city , Vang Vieng offers an opportunity to learn a lot about the life of Buddhist monks .
You can wake up at the crack of dawn to donate food stuffs to the lines of novices along the main street of the town collecting for their temples ’ lunch .
Later , it ’s possible to attend prayer sessions at the local wats .
At one temple , the monks invited us to partake in the prayer ritual along with subtle lessons in etiquette .
There were fewer novices and monks who spoke English than at Luang Prabang , but an equal number of smiling faces ready to greet travelers who are interesting in Lao culture or Buddhist teaching .
If you ’re seeking detailed explanations about Buddhism consider asking for the monk , at the main residency , who teaches English to novices .
Read about rock climbing in Laos or the six steps to a luck Chinese New Year .

AROUND DA WORLD
This is probably the most accessible and well produced track of all .
I absolutely love it and it really shows my European music influenced beats .
The drum track is essentially drum and bass but it originally had a too staccato mechanical feel .
So adding the constant arpeggiators through a high pass filter gave it more momentum without sounding too bottom heavy .
It was also my chance to add screaming guitar riffs that really gives it intensity and dynamics .
The airplane sample at the end really does give it an “ international ” effect symbolic of the song .
No , I wo n’t tell you which 80s record the sample was lifted from . 😉
YOU FEATURING MICHAEL BRAXTON
This is another one of my favorites .
Originally it was a track no artist wanted but I always knew it had potential .
Bestruck ’s lyrics and delivery flowed well .
A great catchy hook along side next Braxton family crooner Michael Braxton ( Toni Braxton ’s brother ) .
Additional vocal arrangements by my good friend David Fenton .
We must have recorded 25 vocal tracks layered and mixed together for the chorus for harmony .
My little cousin Trang added the laugh track in the beginning and end of the song which added a more personal dimension .
I always try to involve friends and family in something I love doing and felt it was perfect .
I think this is the only song Bestruck did NOT have any disaggreements with me on ( laughs ) .
MOMMY CAN’T ALWAYS
This was a crowd pleaser at the Trocadero show .
The song was written in memory of Bestruck ’s late mother .
I love his lyrics because they really do inspire people from all backgrounds to live up .
You may notice the resemblance in the beat with 50 Cent ’s In Da Club .
No , it was n’t a sample .
It just turned out that way .
The chorus part was actually Bestruck himself and not a girl .
His voice was pitch shift using an MPC drum sampler .
For the live show , we did have R&B singer Michaelle Taylor sing it and she killed it !
Check out the clip on the Amazon MP3 music player .
STOMP
This song was heavily influenced by my love for the NEPTUNES / N.E.R.D and Recoil ( Alan Wilder ex Depeche Mode ) .
I performed the drums and congas at Gamble and Huff studios and later tweaked , chopped , and reprocessed them in my lab .
Strange note : you may think drums are loud instruments and thus easy to record but it must have taken 4 hours to get right .
I was in the moment playing and when I heard the playback , it sounded like someone hitting cardboard paper .
BEAT IT UP FEATURING ASHANTI
My first track with Bestruck .
It sounds a bit strange and electronic to me in an endearing way .
Very different .
Bestruck ’s girlfriend Ashanti did some vocals on the track .
I thought she was very sweet and nice .
And then when she went into the vocal booth , a whole new raunchy side came out .
It raised some eye brows in the control room .
Frankly , when I first started arranging , I did n’t even know how know the number of bars ( measures ) or how to slice beats together .
INSTRUMENTAL LUST
I really liked this song but could n’t find the right rapper on it so I just released it as an instrumental .
I think it has some nice breaks and textures in there .
Some people find it unusual that I am very proud of finishing a hip hop album apart from my Delta Dreams moniker .
However , it is something that I always wanted to do for a very long time .
I think it turned out well and crosses musical and racial boundaries .
I am also grateful I worked with some good people : Bestruck , Sean ( Bestruck ’s manager ) , David Abraham ( friend ) , Pascal Volberg ( engineer ) .
Thanks for reading ( and listening ) !

Scrap It
Pay drivers to scrap their cars ?
We might as well burn ten - pound notes in power stations .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 10th March 2009
The magic numbers spin before our eyes .
No one can grasp the scale of the hand - outs , or understand how public money which did n’t exist – could never exist – for hospitals or schools or public toilets begins to flow as soon as the bankers fall to their knees .
We are punch drunk , reeling , uniquely vulnerable – because none of it makes sense any more – to new demands from every species of scrounger .
So prepare yourselves , ladies and gentlemen , for the worst scam of all .
It ’s another reward for failure , but this one offers no prospect of rescuing the economy .
Thanks to its cunning disguise as an environmental measure , we seem willing to be conned .
I want to show you why we should resist it .
I ’m talking about the scrappage payments being proposed by almost everyone linked to the motor industry : the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders ( 1 ) , most of the big car firms ( 2 ) , the AA( 3 ) and the unions .
Lord Mandelson is said to be a fan ( 4 ) .
They argue that drivers should be paid around £ 2000 a head to scrap their old cars and buy new ones .
As well as saving the jobs of hundreds of thousands of workers , this , they say , will catalyse a low carbon transport revolution .
It ’s bunkum .
Let ’s start by getting a misconception out of the way .
The media are reporting the proposal as a subsidy for switching to smaller , more efficient cars .
But the manufacturers have called for no such thing .
The model they keep referring to is Germany ’s .
Here drivers are being offered E2500 to trade in cars at least nine years old for new models .
The only requirement is that the new cars meet the Euro 4 standard on exhaust emissions ( 5 ) .
This is another way of saying all cars : since 2005 every new car on sale in the EU has to meet this standard , which has nothing to do with CO2 .
So £ 2000 from the government could help you trade in your old Citroen C1 for a new Porsche Cayenne .
There is a simple way of working out whether or not a green subsidy is worthwhile : how much does it cost to save a tonne of carbon dioxide ?
No one appears to have done this yet so , if you ’ll bear with me , I ’ll attempt it here .
I ’ve had to make a few assumptions where data do n’t exist , but it gives us a rough idea of what we are exposing ourselves to ( all the sources , as usual , are on my website ) .
Let ’s imagine that the average age of the scrapped cars is 12 years .
In 1997 new cars in the UK produced an average of 189.8 grams of CO2 per kilometre ( 6 ) .
If they ’ve become 10 % less efficient since then , their average output will be 208g / km today .
Cars manufactured this year will put out an average of around 160g / km ( 7 ) , which means a saving of 48g / km .
This translates – with a mean annual driving distance of 16,500 km ( 8 ) – into a cut of 792 kg / car / year .
Assuming that drivers are each paid £ 2000 , that ’s a cost of £ 2525 for every tonne of CO2 avoided , divided by the average age of the cars on the road – 4.9 years .
You ’d get almost as much value for money by reclassifying ten - pound notes as biomass and burning them in power stations .
The management consultants McKinsey have calculated the costs of saving CO2 by other means ( 9 ) .
We could do it for £ 3.50 a tonne by investing in geothermal energy , or £ 9 if we put our money into nuclear power plants .
Mini hydroelectric schemes would save money as well as carbon against normal electricity prices .
So would energy efficiency : switching from incandescent light bulbs to light - emitting diodes , for example , saves £ 80 for every tonne of CO2 you cut .
I would have liked to give you some transport comparisons , but McKinsey does n’t publish figures for public transport or for promoting walking or cycling ( a McKinsey consultant would n’t be seen dead on a bus ) .
Nor , as far as I can discover , does the government .
The carbon payback for other projects – creating better cycle lanes in towns and coach lanes on motorways , helping children to walk to school , better enforcement of speed limits , better timetabling for buses – is likely to be hundreds or thousands of times higher than any returns from the scrappage scam .
In fact I have grossly overstated the scheme ’s value for money .
My rough figures take no account of the rebound effect : when driving costs you less ( after buying a more efficient car ) , you are likely to travel further ( 10,11 ) .
Nor have I considered the fact that many people would have bought new cars anyway , which means they ’ll be given the money for nothing .
Without this subsidy , others might have stopped driving altogether and started cycling or using public transport instead : in this case the scrappage scheme will have raised their emissions .
Nor did I calculate the carbon costs of manufacturing the new cars .
A paper published in 2000 by the journal Transportation Research comes to even grimmer conclusions : that replacing old cars with new ones increases carbon pollution ( 12 ) .
Because between 15 and 20 % of a car ’s emissions are produced during its manufacture , the optimal age for a car , the paper says , is 19 years .
( The average age of the UK ’s fleet is 4.9 years ( 13 ) ) .
If the paper ’s assumptions hold ( they may be out of date now ) , it would make more sense for the government to pay us to keep our old bangers on the road .
Low - carbon transport ?
Pull the other one .
Scrappage schemes are nothing but hand - outs for the car firms , resprayed green to fool the incautious buyer .
The motor trade wants the money because it ’s collapsing .
Some companies – notably Vauxhall and the rest of the General Motors group – are in imminent danger of insolvency ( 14 ) .
So the question changes : should we support them regardless of their impact on the environment ?
No .
State aid rules forbid scrappage schemes from discriminating between cars made here and cars made abroad .
So , given that British car plants assemble only around 15 % of the vehicles sold in this country ( 15,16 ) , and given that the motor industry is highly automated and has vast capital costs , this subsidy is likely to be just as bad at saving jobs as it is at saving carbon .
Every pound we spend on driving is a pound withheld from the alternatives , many of which ( such as buses and trains ) employ far more people for the same amount of money .
This leaves only the value of preserving the industry for its own sake .
It is hard to think of a less deserving cause .
The motor companies have repeatedly failed to anticipate trends in demand .
They have carried on producing thunderous gas guzzlers long after the market collapsed .
Every so often the bosses wring their hands about jobs , put out the begging bowl , get the money then shaft their workers anyway .
Like the bankers they have wrecked their own industry .
And like the bankers they want the rest of us to pay .

The average price of gasoline has climbed above the $ 2 mark yesterday , marking Â the first time sinceÂ mid November 2008 that gas prices have been so “ high . ” Â
Since theÂ the first of the year the price of gasoline has risen 25 % , or roughly 40 cents per gallon , and chances are pretty good prices will continue a gradual climb through the summer months .
Currently 27 states and Washington , D.C. are reporting an average gas price above $ 2 per gallon , with Hawaii being the most expensive at $ 2.50 . Â
Utah currently has the lowest state - wide average price at $ 1.79 per gallon .
It certainly is n’t unusual for the price of gas to rise around this time of year , as refineries switch to more epensive “ summer blend ” gas — which has extra additives to help with emissions and smog — and consumers begin to travel more .
With the economy being as sluggish as it is , it is fairly safe to say that most consumers are n’t thrilled about the prospects of paying more at the pump , especially now that more of us are watching our finances down to the penny . Â
That being said , chances are pretty good that consumers wo n’t have to deal with an incredible spike in prices along the lines of what happened in 2008 . Â
As I ’m sure you remember , gas prices jumped to over $ 4 a gallon for the first time ever last summer , so to get back to that level , using simple math , gas prices would have to double over the next couple of months .
Â
Barring any unforseen catestrophies , even $ 3 gas seems pretty unlikely for most , if not all of the country .
Angry protests greeted returning soldiers in Luton Conservative MP David Davies has called on abusive protests against serving military personnel to be outlawed .
The Monmouth MP has tabled an amendment to a bill governing religious hatred that would extend protection to the Armed Forces .
It would make it an offence to incite hatred against serving soldiers .
He was responding to a small group of anti-war protesters who this week demonstrated in Luton at the homecoming parade of the Royal Anglian Regiment .
They held placards saying " Anglian soldiers go to hell " and " Butchers of Basra " .

Two people were arrested as 200 soldiers marched through the town centre to mark their return from Iraq .
They were members of the public who reacted to the protests .
Mr Davies , a member of the home affairs select committee , told the BBC the same protection which outlaws abusive behaviour outside mosques and other places of worship should be extended to the military .
" What I 'm suggesting is that British soldiers , who I think are our finest young men and women , the cream of society , should also be protected from that sort of gratuitous abuse they experienced last week , " he said .
" I 've taken the religious hatred bill and taken out all references to religion and I 've changed it to uniformed military personnel on official duties and if that 's tabled and passed , that would give British soldiers the same rights . "
' Drop charges '
Anger should not be directed at the soldiers who are helping to rebuild those countries and who deserve our support because they are underpaid and do not get proper equipment or medical treatment , Mr Davies added .
" If they were anti-war protesters , they should have come down to Parliament and protested in a peaceful way , " he said .
" There are lots of people in this country , and I 'll admit that I 'm one of them , who have concerns about the way in which we were taken to war . "
He also called for charges brought against individuals in Luton who allegedly hurled abuse at the protesters to be dropped .
Abu Omar , who went to the demonstration but could not get inside the police cordon , said : " All soldiers made a decision to be part of the Army and to go to Iraq and unleash 36,000 rounds of bullets .
" So these people committed crimes over there and the protests were not about inciting violence or anything but rather to voice the opinion that these people have done war crimes .
Everyone is upset over this . "
He claimed the soldiers had committed acts of terrorism in Iraq and destroyed the country 's infrastructure .
Soldiers need to be held to account , he said , and they should not be above the law .

When I walk through the streets of New York , I pass strange rooms where people are doing strange things .
Some folks are attached to madly spinning wheels .
Others are straining to keep metal bars from crushing them .
Still others jump around in unison as someone yells at them .
It all looks like something out of Dante 's Inferno .
And the most ...
Engineers in Iceland are set to convert carbon dioxide to solid rock as a way to tackle global warming .
The experts want to exploit the country 's volcanic origins to dispose of up to 30,000 tonnes of the greenhouse gas each year .
They expect the gas to react with layers of volcanic rocks deep beneath the surface to form minerals that will lock the carbon pollution away for millions of years .
" This is a well - known natural process , " said Holmfridur Sigurdardottir , project manager .
" We are just trying to imitate what nature is doing . "
The project will take CO2 produced by an Icelandic geothermal energy plant and dissolve it in water under high pressures .
It will then pump the solution into layers of basalt about 400 - 700 m underground , and watch what happens .
Laboratory experiments suggest the dissolved CO2 will react with calcium in the basalt to form solid calcium carbonate .
Sigurdardottir said : " In the lab it takes a few days to a few weeks .
We want to see what happens in the field and whether we can do it on the scale required . "
The project , called Carb - fix , is a form of carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) .
Such schemes usually aim to pump the CO2 into deep saltwater reservoirs , where the high pressure is expected to keep the gas dissolved and trapped underground .
Mineral storage offers a safer bet , Carb - fix says , because there is less chance of leakage .
Domenik Wolff - Boenisch from the University of Iceland , who works on the project , will tell the annual meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna next week that " storage of carbon dioxide as solid carbonate in basaltic rocks may provide an ideal solution " .
The project is scheduled to begin pumping down the dissolved CO2 in August , Sigurdardottir said .
It will take about a year before the team knows whether the gas is converting to minerals as expected .
The incredible bearded woman : Keira Knightley gets blown away on set
With her razor - sharp cheekbones and pouty lips , Keira Knightley is the last person you 'd describe as manly .
But spotted filming her new movie in Somerset yesterday , it looked like the actress was auditioning to become a Victorian circus freak .
A strong gust of wind blew the 24 - year - old 's long locks across her famous features , making her look like she had grown a beard .
Blown away : Keira Knightley looks like a bearded woman after an unfortunate gust of wind covers her famous features
Keira is currently in the Victorian seaside town of Clevedon filming her upcoming movie Never Let Me Go , adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro 's best - selling novel .
Dressed in school uniform , Keira spent the day shooting scenes on a Grade I listed pier as she was watched by hundreds of curious locals .
In the film , Keira plays Kathy H , a woman who tells the story of her childhood at boarding school and unusual life .
It is a tale of a dystopian Britain , where humans are cloned to provide donor organs for transplants .
Friends reunited : Keira chats to co-star Carey Mulligan - who played Kitty Bennett in Pride and Prejudice - in - between takes
Kathy and her few classmates have no contact with the outside world and later find out they are being raised as donors .
The film , directed by Mark Romanek also stars Charlotte Rampling , Andrea Riseborough and Carey Mulligan - who played Keira 's on - screen sister Kitty Bennett in Pride & Prejudice .
As well as Never Let Me Go , Keira has a string of films lined up , including London Boulevard , My Fair Lady and The Beautiful And The Damned .
The actress recently admitted how hard it was for her to balance her relationship with Young Victoria actor Rupert Friend and her busy career .
Youthful : Keira plays a pupil at an isolated boarding school in the movie
She told the Australian edition of Marie Claire : ' It 's hard to have a relationship when you 're working so much .
But then you have to think , " What is actually important in life ?
Is career your only thing ? "
' If it is , then it 's easy , but if it is n't that 's sad , because there 's going to come a day when you 're left lonely .
It 's a difficult balance .
' I think you 've got to strive for balance .
It 's the striving that counts .
' If you 're someone like me , who has always been very driven , to suddenly step back and decide , " Well , love is the only thing " , then you need to build up your relationships . '
Sooners Blake Griffin Is 2 Cool 4 School
Total Pro Sports –
Have you ever wondered what a college basketball star does when he is not on the court playing for his schools team ?
Thanks to a tip sent to us by a student who attends the University of Oklahoma , that features a picture of Sooners forward Blake Griffin partying with 3 of his lovely little girlfriends and giving the camera man the middle finger .
If this was someone else other than Blake Griffin of the Oklahoma Sooners , this definitely would have been an issue with his head coach Jeff Capel .
But the recent College Basketball Player Of The Year has lead his team to the Elite 8 and is one game away from the Final Four .
So what does the middle finger represent to Blake Griffin ?………… First Over all in this years NBA Draft .
I remember my days of college and they were nothing like these experiences , so all the power to these guys that manage to get an education , play the game they love and party like Rock Stars .

Bob Munden ( born February 8 , 1942 , Kansas City , Missouri , United States ) is a Fast Draw competition shooter who now undertakes fast draw exhibition shooting .
Bob Munden holds many fast draw world records and is recognized in the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest gun ever .
In addition to competition , Bob Munden has achieved several extraordinary feats of shooting , including hitting coins thrown into the air and splitting playing cards thrown into the air , all on demand .
Much fast draw shooting takes place with blank ammunition but Bob Munden has achieved several feats with regular ammunition loaded to full power .
For example , as a demonstration , Bob Munden competed in Bianchi Cup match and finished in the money using a Colt Single Action and full power ammunition .
[ 2]
Bob Munden started his shooting career when he competed in Jeff Cooper 's Big Bear " Leatherslaps " shooting competitions at Big Bear Lake , California in the 1950s .
The Leatherslaps became the South Western Combat Pistol League ( SWCPL ) .
His shooting prowess showed early when he came second in 1958 using a Colt .45 Single Action borrowed from Jeff Cooper .
Since taking up exhibition shooting , Bob Munden has given many demonstrations to audiences , sometimes with John Satterwhite .
Bob Munden has also given shooting demonstrations on television shows the world over .
While Munden 's abilities appear remarkable , there are a few tricks to the trade , as competitors , critics , and even Munden himself have pointed out .
For one , Munden does not use period correct firearms , holsters , or other hardware when demonstrating action shooting .
His weapons are heavily modified , and the holsters used are specialized for quick draw yet are impractical for daily wear for the time period they represent .
Furthermore , the use of blanks creates the illusion of accuracy while fast drawing , when in fact just aiming a gun loaded with a blank cartridge in the general direction of a balloon ( one of Munden 's choice targets ) at close range will destroy the target where a live round would likely miss .
Firing blanks also means a very low recoil which in turn provides for a rapid succession of rounds to be fired , yet in real life applications would be pointless .
SEATTLE 
Last summer , city officials here became the first in the nation to approve a fee on paper and plastic shopping bags in many retail stores .
The 20 - cent charge was intended to reduce pollution by encouraging reusable bags .
But a petition drive financed by the plastic - bag industry delayed the plan .
Now a far broader segment of Seattle ’s bag carriers  its voters  will decide the matter in an election in August .
Even in a city that likes to be environmentally conscious , the outcome is uncertain .
“ You have to be really tone - deaf to what ’s going on to think that the economic climate is not going to affect people , ” said Rob Gala , a legislative aide to the city councilman who first sponsored the bill for the 20 - cent fee .
Regarded by some as a symbol of consumer culture wastefulness , plastic bags have been blamed for street litter , ocean pollution and carbon emissions produced by manufacturing and shipping them .
I took it the vet , who said it was a boy - kitten , approximately 8 weeks old , and in good health .
He wormed it and got rid of some ear mites .
Taking him to the vet was fun , because I did n't have a cat basket .
I had to fence him in at the back , and hope he did n't escape !
The odd thing was that the vet was pretty sure that until the previous 24 - 48 hours he was well looked after , and after taking him back home that seemed even more likely .
He developed properly , he was not malnourished , he had no obvious signs of worms or any other parasites , and no obvious fleas .
Back in my flat , he ate and lapped kitten milk quite happily , maybe he had been just shocked earlier ( being tied up in a black bin bag with a dead sibling would be quite a nasty experience ! )
And he used a litter tray with no need for training or encouraging him to do so .
He seemed bright and curious , and he liked people - he purred when he was stroked , and climbed all over people to check them out .
He was not actually a black kitten either - when we washed him at the vet's ,
he turned out to be a white kitten all over apart from a tabby - black tail
and a small black splodge between his ears ; he 's the whitest cat I'd
seen .
It seems that he was socialised , so must have spent his early weeks being nicely looked after by people - yet suddenly he is tied in a sack with his sibling and left to die .
I wonder what tale of human heartache might lie behind Elijah 's brush with death ?
From Blue Skin to the Werewolf Syndrome , some of the most rare skin diseases and skin conditions ever seen .
1 Argyria : Blue Skin , a real - life Smurf
A condition caused by the ingestion of silver , the Argyria ‘s most dramatic symptom is that the skin becomes blue or bluish - grey colored .
On 2008 , ABC reporters interviewed Paul Karason , 40 year - old who ’s skin turned blue after he used colloidal silver to ease his ailments .
It started a decade ago , when he saw an ad in a new - age magazine promising health and rejuvenation through colloidal silver .
Karason sent away for a kit for making colloidal silver — a home brew of microscopic silver particles suspended in water .
For a while , he was drinking at least 10 ounces a day as a cure for arthritis .
” I had arthritis in my shoulders so bad I could n’t pull a T - shirt off .
And the next thing I knew , it was just gone . ” he explained the media , but these claims have no basis in science and after a couple of months , his whole skin turned blue .
“ I kind of hoped it would fade off ! ”
But it did n’t fade off .
Argyria is permanent .
2 Human Pappiloma Virus : meet the Tree Man
After a severe Human Pappiloma Virus ( HPV ) infection , Dede Koswara , a 35 - year - old Indonesian fisherman , was dubbed the “ tree man ” because of the gnarled warts all over his body .
He first noticed the warts on his body after cutting his knee as a teenager .
Over time , Dede was sacked from his job , deserted by his wife and shunned by neighbours as the horn - like extensions covered much of his body and stopped him working .
He has two children .
After his case received widespread publicity , donations from the public and government help allowed him to get treatment , and in 2008 , six kilos of warts were surgically removed from his body .
3 Hypertrichosis : the Human Werewolf Syndrome
Well known among skin conditions , Hypertrichosis is a medical condition that causes excessive growth of hair in areas where hair does not normally grow .
It may be present over the entire body , or you could have it in only one or more areas .
Some individuals will be born with the condition and others will develop it later on in life .
Congenital Hypertrichosis is very rare .
In fact , it is so rare that there have been only 50 verified cases since the Middle Ages .
On 2008 , the press interviewed Pruthviraj Patil , an 11 - year - old indian boy who ’s face and body are covered with hair .
He rarely leaves his home village in India because of the cruelty of strangers .
Pruthviraj ’s family has tried homeopathy , traditional Indian Ayurvedic remedies even laser surgery without success , and he ’s now appealing to doctors to help him find a permanent cure since even after laser treatment the hair grows back .
4 Blaschko’s lines : strange stripes all over the body
An extremely rare and unexplained phenomenon of human anatomy , Blaschko ’s lines were first presented in 1901 by German dermatologist Alfred Blaschko .
Neither a specific disease nor a predictable symptom of a disease , Blaschko ’s lines are an invisible pattern built into human DNA .
Many inherited and acquired diseases of the skin or mucosa manifest themselves according to these patterns , creating the visual appearance of stripes .
The cause of the stripes is thought to result from mosaicism ; they do not correspond to nervous , muscular , or lymphatic systems .
What makes them more remarkable is that they correspond quite closely from patient to patient , usually forming a “ V ” shape over the spine and “ S ” shapes over the chest , stomach , and sides .
5 Vitiligo : white patched skin
Vitiligo is a skin condition where the cells that make the pigment in your skin , the melanocytes , get destroyed .
This causes white patches to appear on your skin , and this disease may affect any area of skin .
These patches also show up on your mucous membranes and the retina of your eyes .
Symptoms include white or gray hair on the patches , as well as the white patches on your skin , mucous membranes , and eyes .
The precise cause of vitiligo is complex and not fully understood .
There is some evidence suggesting it is caused by a combination of auto- immune , genetic , and environmental factors .
The population incidence worldwide is considered to be between 1 % and 2 % .
6 Tungiasis : fleas burrow into the skin and lay eggs
Tungiasis is a skin infestation of the Tunga penetrans flea , found in the tropical parts of Africa , Caribbean , Central and South America , and India .
This fleas burrow into the skin and lay eggs , creating a disease which is actually endemic in Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago , where in the 1980s the prevalence of tungiasis among children approached 40 % .
7 Dermatographia : overly sensitive skin
Dermatographia is a rare condition where the skin is overly sensitive to minor injuries ; even light scratches will cause it to become red and raised .
The person ’s immune system exhibits hypersensitivity , via skin , that releases excessive amounts of histamine , causing capillaries to dilate and welts to appear ( lasting about thirty minutes ) when the skin ’s surface is lightly scratched .
In 2008 , Neatorama featured artist Ariana Page Russell , who decided to use her medical condition as the basis for art , with some amazing results .
Web browsers originated as applications that people used to view static web sites sequentially .
As web sites evolved into dynamic web applications composing content from various web sites , browsers have become multi-principal operating environments with resources shared among mutually distrusting web site principals .
Nevertheless , no existing browsers , including new architectures like IE 8 , Google Chrome , and OP , have a multi-principal operating system construction that gives a browser - based OS the exclusive control to manage the protection of all system resources among web site principals .
In this paper , we introduce Gazelle , a secure web browser constructed as a multi-principal OS .
Gazelle ’s Browser Kernel is an operating system that exclusively manages resource protection and sharing across web site principals .
This construction exposes intricate design issues that no previous work has identified , such as legacy protection of cross - origin script source , and cross-principal , cross-process display and events protection .
We elaborate on these issues and provide comprehensive solutions .
Our prototype implementation and evaluation experience indicates that it is realistic to turn an existing browser into a multi-principal OS that yields significantly stronger security and robustness with acceptable performance and backward compatibility .

( CNN ) -- Larry Jukes said he remembers when he could buy 10 cigarette packs for $ 2.50 .
Coloradan Larry Jukes says he 's upset about the hike but does n't expect it will persuade him to quit smoking .
But he'd now take the days when -- just last month -- he could buy his carton of choice for $ 49 .
Thanks in part to the largest - ever federal cigarette tax increase -- a nearly 62 - cents - a - pack hike that starts Wednesday but was reflected in many prices earlier -- Jukes on Tuesday paid more than $ 58 for a 10 - pack carton at the Cigarette Store in Denver , Colorado .
That same store was selling it about $ 9 cheaper weeks ago .
Jukes and other shoppers there said they feel stuck and taken advantage of .
" They 're picking on us poor people , the ones that smoke , " Jukes , a 65 - year - old who has been smoking since he was a teen , said of the government .
" They have been for years . "
Watch Jukes argue smokers are unfairly targeted »
The cigarette excise tax that tobacco companies must pay the federal government rose Wednesday by 61.6 cents per pack , or $ 6.16 per carton .
The tax now comes to about $ 10.10 per carton , or $ 1.01 per pack .
But major tobacco companies began incorporating that increase into their prices to wholesalers in March .
And the companies , wholesalers and retailers in many cases gave prices a boost beyond the tax increase , in part to make up for an expected drop in sales caused by the hike , some of them said .
" We do n't anticipate another raise for Wednesday .
The [ March increase in prices ] was the raise , " said Mary Szarmach , vice president at Colorado - based Cigarette Store Corp. , which operates 85 stores in five states .
" The manufacturers took what they needed beyond [ the tax increase ] to maintain their profit margin and take care of what they think will be diminishing sales .
...
" And to maintain gross profit margin , retailers in general tacked on a little , too . "
Watch how and why the tax hike was instituted »
If the increase does scare off customers , 83 - year - old Gloria Egger is n't likely to be one of them , she said .
She said she 's upset at the government for raising the tax , but Egger , who has been smoking since she was 18 , is n't likely to quit .
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on the tobacco tax increase
" I think it 's ridiculous .
...
They 're picking on smokers , " Egger said at the Denver store , where she bought two cartons Tuesday .
" I think they 're trying to run the tobacco companies out of business .
" As old as I am , I 'm not going to quit smoking , regardless of what they do . "
See other reactions to the tax hike »
Federal taxes also are going up Wednesday on other tobacco products , including cigars .
Federal per-cigar taxes , which vary based on weight and price , used to be capped at 4.9 cents but now are capped at 40.26 cents .
The tobacco tax hikes , which President Obama signed into law in February , will be used to finance an expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP .
The expansion , which will cost $ 35 million over five years , is expected to secure federally funded health care for an additional 4 million children .
Before the expansion , SCHIP covered almost 7 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but ca n't afford private insurance .
Dave Bowersox , who bought a box of Prime Time Little Cigars at the Denver store Tuesday , said he 's fine with the tobacco tax increases .
" I think tobacco , alcohol , that kind of stuff should be taxed instead of gasoline and food -- things that are necessary for people to survive , " Bowersox said .
But near Orlando , Florida , cigar smoker Leah Fuller called the hikes " ridiculous . "
" There are [ other ] things that you could be targeting in the U.S. right now .
Why the tobacco industry ? "
Fuller said .
" I , personally , smoke cigars to relax .
Why am I being punished for it ? "
Jeff Borysiewicz , founder of Orlando - based Corona Cigar Co. , said he believed the federal tax hike will cause cigar sales to drop .
And he said the increase comes as Florida is considering a $ 1 - per - cigar state tax hike .
iReporters debate whether the change in price is fair »
Cigarettes , too , have been hit by state excise tax increases .
Since January 2002 , the average state cigarette tax has increased from 43 cents per pack to $ 1.21 per pack , according to the Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids .
A conservative estimate for the average per-pack cigarette price in the U.S. , based on data collected from states and territories at the end of 2008 and adjusted for the federal tax increase , is $ 4.80 , the group 's Eric Lindblom said .
Tobacco company Philip Morris USA raised list prices for its major brands by about 71 cents per pack last month " in direct response to the tax increase , " said Bill Phelps , spokesman for Philip Morris ' parent company , Altria .
RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. on March 16 raised its cigarettes ' list prices by 41 to 44 cents per pack and , in many cases , reduced discounts to retailers , basically keeping " our pricing in line with the competition , " spokesman David Howard said .
" The federal tax increase was the primary driver , " Howard said .
Both companies said they expect a decrease in sales , with Howard noting industry analysts have estimated a drop of 6 percent to 8 percent .
One factor in Philip Morris ' decision to increase list prices beyond the tax hike was the company 's expectation that the new tax level will decrease sales , Phelps said .
Not all U.S. sales declines would be due to smokers quitting , Phelps said .
" Tax increases create an incentive for people to bring cigarettes into the country illegally -- [ from places ] where they do n't have to pay that higher tax , " Phelps said .
Nick Hamad , a tobacco store owner in Seattle , Washington , said he thinks the tax will ruin the American tobacco industry .
" If we lose the sales , the state will lose the revenue , " he said .
" We will be hurt , the state will be hurt and eventually the consumers are being hurt . "
As for Jukes , higher prices probably wo n't force him to quit smoking , he said .
" I 've been smoking about 50 years , " Jukes said .
CNN 's Jason Hanna , Jim Spellman , John Couwels , Alan Silverleib and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report .
All About Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids • Barack Obama
Fifteen years ago almost to the day , I was sitting in a bar in Ghent eating chicory and chips and trying to make sense of Het Nieuwsblad 's coverage of the forthcoming Ronde van Vlaanderen bike race .
In Flanders this race – which will be run on Sunday – is the sporting event of the year .
It 's Wimbledon , the Grand National and the FA Cup final all rolled into one .
On the plane over I had sat next to a conceptual artist from Oudenaarde who had spent a weekend on Tyneside getting a Celtic design tattooed on his shin .
When I mentioned the Ronde , he rolled his eyes .
" People think the Flemish are obsessed with cycling , " he said , " but obsession is not the right word .
It is more like a neurosis . "
Likening a national interest in bicycle racing to mental illness may seem an exaggeration , but anybody who has spent time in Flanders in the week leading up to the Ronde will regard it as a typical Flemish understatement .
The previous year I had travelled to Belgium to watch the midweek Ghent - Wevelgem race .
On the slopes of the Kemmelberg near Ypres , I stood next to a young woman who , as the riders pedalled past , held up her 10 - month - old son and whispered their names into his ear – Nelissen , Vanderaerden , Capiot – softly , devoutly , like somebody reciting the catechism .
Het Nieuwsblad carried a profile of Flandrian cycling hero Johan Museeuw .
As a small boy I had , belatedly , learned to read by studying the backs of the football cards that came with Barratt 's bubblegum .
This had left me with the vague feeling that I might master a foreign tongue simply by staring at Gazzetta dello Sport or Marca .
This policy had worked , more or less , with L'Equipe , though it had skewed my vocabulary to such an extent that while capable of a relatively fluent discourse on Paul Gascoigne 's latest crisis , I could n't buy a train ticket without pointing and making chuff - chuff noises .
Het Nieuwsblad had always proved a good deal less penetrable than L'Equipe .
This was because it was written in Dutch , a language that seems to include far more vowels than are strictly necessary .
In fact , looking at Het Nieuwsblad 's piece that lunchtime , I became convinced that at some point the Flemish publishers had bought up a job lot of As , Es and Us and told the printers they were n't getting any more consonants until they 'd used them all .
As my mind wandered in this witless fashion , the owner of the bar , a kindly middle - aged lady who wore a floral pinny and a look of unfathomable disappointment , arrived with a glass of beer I had n't ordered .
" It is from the Germans , " she said , indicating a thirtysomething couple sitting on a nearby table .
When I looked across , the man raised his glass and the woman smiled .
I smiled back and , taking this as an invitation , the Germans came over .
Having established that they were not disturbing my peace , they began to ask me about the Tour of Flanders .
Was Museeuw as strong as everyone said , the man asked .
Because , his wife added , there were rumours of a knee injury .
What of Andre Tchmil ?
And how would the weather affect Fabio Baldato ?
The Germans asked their questions and when I answered they listened very attentively , nodding in approval at my obvious wisdom .
It was all very flattering , like being the subject of a South Bank Show special .
In such circumstances it is difficult not to become pompous , and after a while I eased back in my chair and began speaking more slowly , with orotund flourishes , until I began to sound rather as the Yorkshire cricket broadcaster Don Mosey used to when delivering his close of play summary on Test Match Special .
Before they left , the German couple asked if they might have their photo taken with me .
The bar owner took the snap and the Germans sat on either side of me , putting their arms quickly and bashfully around my shoulders as she called for us to smile .
" Super , " the man said , shaking my hand .
" We will see you at the race on Sunday also I 'm sure ? "
After they had gone , the bar owner came over to pick up the empty glasses .
" That is funny , " she said with a dry chuckle .
I asked what was funny .
" Those Germans , " the lady said , nodding in the direction of the door .
" You see , they thought you were Edwig van Hooydonck . "
Van Hooydonck is a Flemish racer who had won the Ronde in 1989 and 1991 .
He was tall and thin and beaky , with reddish blond hair .
" I might have thought you were him too , " the lady said , " except , of course , that you do n't speak Dutch . "
I asked who she wanted to win the Ronde .
" I do n't care , " she said .
" As long as they are Flemish .
And if not a Fleming , then someone like a Fleming . "
She meant gritty , tough , stoic and down - to - earth .
The sort of man who might travel the world making millions from racing but still take his family holidays at De Panne or Oostduinkerke .
" As Museeuw says , " the bar owner said , pointing at the newspaper , " you do n't have to be Flemish to be a Flandrian . "
Tom Boonen , who is Flemish and a Flandrian , is this year 's favourite .
Sadly I wo n't be there , so if you see someone who looks like me , the chances are it will be Edwig .

Explanation : Some 3 million light - years distant in nearby spiral galaxy M33 , giant stellar nursery NGC 604 is about 1,300 light - years across , or nearly 100 times the size of the Orion Nebula .
In fact , among the star forming regions within the Local Group of galaxies , NGC 604 is second in size only to 30 Doradus , also known as the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud .
This space - age color composite of X - ray data ( in blue hues ) from the Chandra Observatory , and Hubble optical data shows that NGC 604's cavernous bubbles and cavities are filled with a hot , tenuous , X - ray emitting gas .
Intriguingly , NGC 604 itself is divided by a wall of relatively cool gas .
On the western ( right ) side of the nebula , measurements indicate that material is likely heated to X - ray temperatures by the energetic winds from a cluster of about 200 young , massive stars .
On the eastern side the X - ray filled cavities seem to be older , suggesting supernova explosions from the end of massive star evolution contribute to their formation .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
January was one of the worst months for layoffs ever , with nearly a quarter - million job - cut announcements grabbing headlines .
But the real problem in the U.S. labor market today is n't layoffs .
It 's a hiring freeze that is gripping most work places - and has not gotten nearly as much attention as the job cuts .
" The hiring rate has caved .
That 's why the job market is as bad as it is , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist with Moody 's Economy.com .
" Given this low hiring rate , unemployment would still rise even if layoffs were falling . "
The government 's key employment report , released Friday morning , does n't detail hiring and job openings .
It instead gives overall change in the number of workers on U.S. payrolls .
It was another terrible report , with employers shaving 598,000 jobs off of U.S. payrolls , the biggest drop in 34 years .
The unemployment rate climbed to 7.6 % , which was a 16 - year high .
Both results were worse than economists ' forecasts .
But since 2000 , the Labor Department has also tracked hiring , job openings and layoffs .
And the most recent readings on those statistics show that the level of hiring and job openings has actually tumbled more than layoffs have soared .
Through November , the number of layoffs was up 17 % from year - earlier levels .
But the amount of workers who were hired during November was down 26 % , and the number of job openings tumbled 30 % .
While layoffs are likely up from the November levels , the hit to hiring has also gotten much more severe , according to experts .
And that means that once people do lose their job , it 's going to be even tougher to find a new one .
The Conference Board 's tracking of online job listings shows a decline of more than 1 million listings in the last two months alone .
That 's a 23 % decline in postings since November .
The weakness in job postings is widespread , with only two states , North Dakota and Wyoming , having fewer unemployed people than advertised job openings .
During the last recession in 2001 , there was not nearly as sharp a drop in hiring and job openings .
In fact , the hiring and job opening rates , which compare new hires and openings to the overall number of workers , are both at their lowest level on record .
And economists say that even if the number of layoffs peaks soon , the pace of hiring and job openings may remain soft for months to come .
" The issue of hiring is often overlooked , " said Gad Levanon , senior economist for The Conference Board .
" But it 's the key to the labor market .
In the last recession , layoffs reached their peak in late 2001 .
But hiring did n't reach its lowest level until 2003 , and that 's when the job losses finally ended . "
Andrew Reina , practice director for job placement firm Ajilon Finance Solutions , said hiring freezes are now the rule at most companies .
" A lot of our clients are looking at hiring freezes , certainly in the short term , and most likely through the first half of this year , " he said .
Economist Robert Brusca of FAO
Economics added that hiring freezes are an easier way for many companies to reduce work forces than layoffs , since even in bad times people will leave companies on their own .
And he said the hiring freezes wo n't end until companies have some confidence that the economy and demand for their products are ready to turn around .
" It 's pretty clear that fear is running the show right now , " he said .

Built for years of uninterrupted use in the toughest conditions , its ease of use will amaze you almost as much as its beauty .
Lindsay Lohan is in negotiations to star in a Vegas strip act called Peepshow .
Peepshow currently has Mel B from the Spice Girls and Dancing With the Stars winner and General Hospital actress Kelly Monaco in the leads .
Kelly Monaco will be leaving Peepshow in the next couple of months so she can return to the filming General Hospital .
According to reports , Lindsay is in late stage negotiations to take over Kelly ’s role in the show .
According to Fox News :
Word on the street for quite some time has been that newly - single Lindsay Lohan is strapped for cash and unemployed , but it looks as though the 22 - year - old may have finally found her forte : starring in a topless show in Sin City .
Lohan flew from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on Saturday on the private plane of the producer of Mel B. and Kelly Monaco ’s “ Peepshow ” to attend the grand opening of the sexy striptease production , but made the trip more importantly because she had a meeting scheduled with director and Broadway big - wig , Jerry Mitchell .
“ Peepshow ” is designed to have rotating leads and according to very close inside sources , Lohan is in official negotiations to take over from Monaco who wants to move on and get back to work on “ General Hospital , ” however Mel B. reportedly intends to stay on once her three - month contract is finished .
“ People forget that she ( Lohan ) is a “ triple threat ” she can act and sing and dance , ” said our source .
“ She feels that this would really revitalize her career and give her some serious theater cred . ”
Most newspaper websites are doing a bad design job in making their stories readable .
Too many are using :
small fonts ,
long off - putting paragraphs ,
no subheadings ,
no in - content boxes or pictures , and
no in - content links .
To explain more , I ’ve written a companion post on online readability ( design , not writing – and this post was first published here ) .
And here ’s an example each of their news stories so you can see the issue : Daily Mail , Express , FT , Guardian , Independent , Mirror , Sun , Telegraph , Times .
Main readability design mistakes
This table summarises the main ways they are going wrong .
Tiny fonts
They are all using font sizes that are too small for comfortable reading on copy - heavy pages .
Only the Guardian , Independent , Mirror and Telegraph offer obvious controls for resizing text .
But most of the sites use 12 or 13 px fonts for body copy .
I think this is too small to be the default – 16 px is a much more readable size .
Only the Guardian comes anywhere near this .
No sub -headings
Astonishingly , not a single major newspaper site uses sub headings in its news stories , ( apart from the Sun occasionally ) despite this having been a generally accepted web readability recommendation since 1997 when it comes to helping people read webpages .
Long paragraphs
Nearly half use long paragraphs , serving up great slabs of unappealing copy .
This makes the pages hard to scan and read – again , despite using shorter paragraphs online being a standard online guideline .
Bad readability
These three are vying for last place when it comes to readability .
I ca n’t believe anyone could comfortably read these pages for long :
Express – A small font , expressed in absolute pixels , so Internet Explorer users can’t even make it bigger .
And the Express full - justifies its copy , making it harder to read as the gaps between words are different on each line .
A complete pig ’s ear .

Independent – A small font combined with multi-sentence paragraphs .
A readability nightmare , even if there is a text - resize control .

Daily Mail – The Mail does a good job of breaking up its pages with pictures .
But its font size is too small , and there are no subheadings in the copy to help the user understand what the story is about or give the eye a rest .
Fairly poor readability
Mirror –
There ’s a font size control ( although this is a poor second to having a big enough font in the first place ) .
And although it ’s only 12 px , the Mirror is at least using Verdana which is easier to read than Arial at small sizes .
This , plus its use of short paragraphs , rescued it from the ‘ bad ’ list .

Telegraph – Default font size is too small ( smaller than that of the Times and FT ) , although there is a control to make it bigger .
It uses short paragraphs , but for me it ’s all still too hard to read .

Someone introduce the CMS people to the return key … FT – The font is starting to get big enough .
But while it ’s paragraphs tend to be only one or two sentences , the sentences themselves tend to be long .
You ’d still have to really want to read a story to plough to the end of it .

Guardian –
Its font size is almost big enough for my liking , and I nearly put it in the ‘ getting there ’ list .
But its paragraphs are too long , and there are no in - content devices ( boxes etc ) to break up the copy .
Getting there
Sun – A nice big font , short paragraphs , copy broken up with images , and occasional sub - headings .
Probably the best of them – some more sub - headings would really help though , and I ’m not convinced by the Georgia font or the occasional use of italics .
Newspaper website readability : table notes
Verdana and Arial are the same height at a given size , but Verdana is wider .
At small font sizes , Verdana will be easier to read as it will look bigger .
At bigger font sizes , it appears to stretched .
The Sun is using Georgia , so its font sizes ca n’t be directly compared to the others – at a given size , Georgia looks smaller than Arial and Verdana .
The Sun is also using SIFR to replace standard web fonts with a custom one in its headlines .
The Guardian is the only site to use in - copy links .
These are a good idea to help people read a page , as they draw the eye and encourage people to keep reading .
However , the Guardian has an annoying habit of linking keywords to its own pages when you might think they are external links .
The Independent treats its own stories ( standfirst , long paragraphs ) differently to agency - sourced ones ( no standfirst , short paragraphs ) .

Police officers must remember they are " the servants and not the masters " of the people , the head of the police watchdog said yesterday as he condemned the practice of concealing shoulder numbers as " unacceptable " .
Nick Hardwick , the chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , said he would appear before the Home Affairs Select Committee as the fallout surrounding allegations into the use of police force at the G20 protests grew more acrimonious .
Mr Hardwick said he had " serious concerns " about front - line supervision of officers at this month 's demonstrations .
The IPCC launched a third investigation yesterday into police tactics after a 23 - year - old London man claimed he was assaulted by a Metropolitan Police officer .
" Why was that happening ?
Why did the supervisor not stop them ?
What does that say about what your state of mind is ? " he asked .
" You were expecting trouble ? "

Mr Hardwick 's comments came as former Metropolitan Police Commander John O'Connor warned that the current Met chief , Sir Paul Stephenson , risks losing the support of rank and file officers if the investigation into allegations of abuse became a " witch hunt . "
And Sir Ken Jones , the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) , moved to defuse the situation by praising the " vast and overwhelming majority " of officers who , he said , deserved public support .
The chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee , Keith Vaz , said MPs would examine the G20 controversial " kettling " tactic used to contain demonstrators as well as " what happened at the G20 protests " and the scope of the IPCC investigation .
A new video emerged yesterday of two further incidents which occurred at the Climate Camp demonstration in Bishopsgate .
The first involved Alex Cinnane , 24 , an IT technician from London , who is shown being hit on the head with a riot shield by an unidentified , partially masked officer .
The other shows an officer punching an unidentified male demonstrator in the jaw as the crowds retreat from an advancing police line .
By Friday , the IPCC had received more than 185 complaints about the G20 protests , including 90 about the use of force , from witnesses as well as alleged victims .
Mr Hardwick said that the recent trend of digital cameras and mobile phones for photographs and video footage was providing the IPCC with invaluable evidence as well as " challenging " police .
" They have to respond to the fact that they are going to be watched , there is going to be evidence of what they have done , " he said .
Mr Vaz said that the amount of amateur and CCTV footage meant police actions were " much more open and much more transparent " .

Mr Vaz also called for a broader debate about the right to protest and the responsibilities of policing .
" It 's got to be a democratic question of how do we want to be policed ?
That needs a proper parliamentary discussion , " he said .
" The choices we make as a society about that are n't consequence - free .
There are tricky balances to be struck . "
But temperatures were rising among protesters as some warned that this year 's May Day demonstrations could be some of the most dramatic yet .
The United Campaign Against Police Violence , a coalition formed in the wake of the G20 protests , met last weekend to discuss plans .
" We 're trying to stop London on May Day in memory of all those who have died in police custody , " said Chris Knight , a founding member .
" If police officers have n't got the message at that stage , we may have to take it into our own hands . "
Others have called for riot police to wear large football - shirt style numbers on their fronts and backs so that it is harder for them to conceal their identity .
A report published by The Camp for Climate Action over the weekend deemed policing as " violent and disproportionate " though not dissimilar to the type of policing experienced at other climate camps .

A curator at a Japanese museum has accidentally dropped and broken a 2,200 - year - old glass artefact .
The relic was on loan from another museum .
The antique was made of 46 cylinder - shaped pieces of sky blue glass threaded together , and was unearthed 20 years ago in south - west Japan .
The piece was being moved when the curator of a museum in western Japan dropped it from a height of about 70 centimetres .
Despite landing on a carpeted floor more than 10 of the glass pieces shattered .

Two hundred schoolchildren in Britain , some as young as 13 , have been identified as potential terrorists by a police scheme that aims to spot youngsters who are “ vulnerable ” to Islamic radicalisation .
[ efoods ]
The number was revealed to The Independent by Sir Norman Bettison , the chief constable of West Yorkshire Police and Britain ’s most senior officer in charge of terror prevention .
He said the “ Channel project ” had intervened in the cases of at least 200 children who were thought to be at risk of extremism , since it began 18 months ago .
The number has leapt from 10 children identified by June 2008 .
The programme , run by the Association of Chief Police Officers , asks teachers , parents and other community figures to be vigilant for signs that may indicate an attraction to extreme views or susceptibility to being “ groomed ” by radicalisers .
Sir Norman , whose force covers the area in which all four 7 July 2005 bombers grew up , said : “ What will often manifest itself is what might be regarded as racism and the adoption of bad attitudes towards ‘ the West ’ .
“ One of the four bombers of 7 July was , on the face of it , a model student .
He had never been in trouble with the police , was the son of a well - established family and was employed and integrated into society .

U.S. Rep. Jared Polis released the following statement this afternoon apologizing for remarks he made over the weekend that new media “ killed ” the Rocky Mountain News and the outcome was “ mostly for the better . ”
“ I apologize to the entire Rocky Mountain News family and anyone who was offended by my recent remarks , ” the Boulder Democrat said .
“ I did not mean to offend nor to show anything less than a strong sense of remorse for the loss of the Rocky .
Like many Colorado residents , I grew up reading the Rocky Mountain News , and its demise and the loss of over 200 jobs is a major blow to our community , especially in these troubled times . ”
Polis , a first - term congressman , drew attention Monday for remarks he made to the Netroots Nation in Your Neighborhood event in Westminster on Saturday .
“ I have to say , that when we say , ‘ Who killed the Rocky Mountain News , ’ we ’re all part of it , for better or worse , and I argue it ’s mostly for the better , ” he said , according to a recording posted online .
“ The media is dead , and long live the new media , which is all of us , ” Polis continued
The Rocky Mountain News published its final edition on Friday , just weeks shy of its 150th birthday .
The fact is that many people served by these projects  including children with absent fathers , addicts and prisoners  form a captive audience .
It can not be easy to say no to a proselytizer if saying yes means a warm bed in a homeless shelter , extra help for a child or more privileges while serving jail time .
Embrace Jesus as your savior and , who knows , you may get early parole .
Furthermore , as Mr. Mohler points out , there is also a peril to religious independence from government in these programs .
What government gives , government can take away .
What happens if hard - pressed African - American churches serving poor communities  where enthusiasm for faith - based initiatives has always been high and has only intensified during the current economic crisis  come to rely on government money and the rug is pulled out from under them by a future administration ?
Those who argue in favor of more religious involvement in government , and vice versa , always claim that the First Amendment does not mandate separation of church and state but simply prohibits state preference for any church .
But even by that religion - infused standard , faith - based aid cannot help but favor some religions over others .
For instance , nearly all non-Orthodox Jewish groups and liberal ecumenical religious organizations are opposed to government subsidy .
How can it not violate the First Amendment to set up a program that even by default favors those groups eager to jump on the federal gravy train ?
The other canker at the heart of faith - based initiatives is the assumption that religiously based programs work better than secular and government efforts .
For the faithful , though , the efficacy of these programs is an article of faith , not a conclusion supported by objective evidence .
Back in 2003 , there was a flurry of excitement surrounding a study that at first glance seemed to suggest that participants in Mr. Colson ’s prison programs in Texas had been rearrested at much lower rates than other released prisoners .
There was just one problem : the study excluded everyone who quit the program in prison  two - thirds of the starting group .
It is as if the Department of Education were to measure the success of public schools by not counting dropouts .
This ought to give pause to Mr. Obama , who has spoken so often about restoring evidence and science to public policy - making .
President Obama might also take a moment to reread the religious freedom act passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1786 , with strong support from both Baptists and freethinkers .
That law , which prohibited tax support for religious teaching in public schools , became the template for the establishment clause of the First Amendment and also helped establish our American tradition of government freedom from religious interference and religious freedom from government interference .
Yet we are moving blindly ahead with faith - based federal spending as if it were not a radical break with our past .
If faith - based initiatives , first institutionalized by the executive fiat of a conservative Republican president , become even more entrenched under a liberal Democratic administration , there will be no going back .
In place of the First Amendment , we will have a sacred cash cow .
SAN FRANCISCO , March 9 ( UPI ) --
San Francisco officials said the mess left by this year 's massive Valentine 's Day pillow fight has led them to take another look at the " flash mob " phenomenon .
The pillow fight , which marked its fourth year in February , involved an estimated 1,500 to 3,000 people at Justin Herman Plaza and left the city with thousands of dollars worth of damages and cleanup costs , the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday .

Lisa Seitz Gruwell of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department said organizers of the event must begin taking responsibility for the event , " otherwise we are going to have to find a way to shut it down . "
However , officials said it is difficult to track down the organizers of the pillow fight since it is part of the flash mob fad , in which events are largely promoted through the Internet , text messaging and word of mouth .
Flash mobs typically involve a large group of people gathering in a public place , engaging in unusual behavior and dispersing .
Mohammed Nuru , deputy director of the Department of Public Works , said the city had to dispatch 69 employees and an extra street sweeper truck to clean up after this year 's pillow fight .
" It was quite a mess , much more than we have experienced in previous years , " he said .
" Everywhere was feathers . "
5 Things You Didn't Know About Arms Dealers
This is What You Need To Know About The Arms Trade
Page 1 of 2
Within your circle of friends and acquaintances , you probably know some doctors , some lawyers , some artists , and maybe even an actor or a professional athlete .
But chances are you do n't know any international arms dealers .
What the arms dealer does is pretty straightforward :
He sells arms .
But there are obviously plenty of aspects of this profession that remain hidden to most .
Here are five of them .
1- Dealing arms is n't illegal
Believe it or not , dealing in private arms is a perfectly legal profession in most countries .
In fact , few countries have any laws at all that forbid brokering an illegal arms deal .
Remember ; the broker is usually nothing more than a middleman with a phone , a computer and a bank account .
When arms dealers do find themselves in trouble , it is often when they run afoul of international law by engaging in high - profit , illegal transactions .
In these instances , it is not specific arms - dealing laws that are being broken , but rather import and export laws , or U.N. sanctions that are being circumvented .
While some arms dealers concede that better laws and serious enforcement efforts might curb or stop the arms trade , the dirty little secret of the business is that , although we all profess to despise them , virtually every country on the planet needs and wants arms dealers .
For that reason , most arms dealers , even those who make illegal deals , operate without significant interference — and , in some cases , tacit approval .
2- The AK - 47 is often used as a loss leader
That AK - 47 assault rifle is everywhere , and it costs about $ 75 to buy , transport and sell .
But many of the high - profile arms dealers do n't bother with this gun at all because the margins it offers are too low .
In fact , some dealers use these rifles as a loss leader , giving them away at first .
After they have established a rapport with the buyer ( remember ; this is a business built exclusively on trust , as there are seldom courts to turn to if the other party breaks the deal ) , the dealer can then sell the buyer on a more sophisticated line of arms .
The arms dealing industry benefits greatly from the nature of war , which is fundamentally competitive .
If your adversary has only knives , guns will suffice , but when they get guns , you 'll want tanks .
Guns need not be COD , and how much a dealer earns ...
Application fees will be abolished and a new Freedom of Information umpire will be created under sweeping changes to Freedom of Information laws announced by the Rudd Government today .
The biggest changes to the FOI Act since it was passed in 1982 are designed to make it far easier for people to get hold of government information and to force government departments routinely to publish information now kept secret .
An information commissioner 's office will be created and an FOI commissioner will act as an independent monitor for the new laws under the changes .
The office of information commissioner is borrowed from overseas models , which have been far more successful in getting governments to release sensitive information .
When governments refuse to disclose information , applicants will have the right to complain to the FOI commissioner , who will have the power to order the release of documents .
MySpace
Citigroup — the mega - bank that managed its own finances so badly that it has required three taxpayer bailouts totaling at least $ 45 billion so far — is preaching fiscal responsibility to young people .
This week , the company began pitching a Visa credit card to MySpace users called Citi Forward , with the slogan , “ Actions speak louder than words . ”
Cardholders receive bonus points with each charge , which can be used for concerts , movie premieres and music downloads .
They also earn points worth a buck or so for good deeds , such as donating canned goods to the hungry .
If consumers pay on time for three months in a row , they can qualify for a quarter - point reduction in the card ’s 14.24 percent interest rate , with rates going down as much as two percentage points after two years of on - time payments .
On the other hand , a late payment quickly doubles the interest rate to 29.99 percent , according to the card ’s terms and conditions .
Citi and MySpace have not just created a credit card , however .
They are marketing a way of life , complete with a manifesto :
“ I am Generation Forward .
I look not backward , but forward .
I reject the selfish ways of the past .
The environment , the economy , our very security …
They ’re the consequences of people not thinking about consequences .
The world I ’m inheriting makes me different .
I ’m not afraid of what might happen , but energized by what could happen .
For my generation , forward is n’t just a word .
It ’s a way of life .
I believe actions speak louder than words .
I believe in the power of making good visible .
I believe in sharing the wealth , spreading the peace , helping the
unfortunate , recycling , alternative energy sources , exercise , eating
healthy , giving back , spending wisely and setting a good example .
I believe that if bad things happen when I do bad ,
good things should happen when I do good .
I believe in good design , keeping my word , paying on time , using the
Internet instead of paper and fiscal responsibility .
I am Generation Forward .
I ’m the first generation to have a credit card named after me .
Imagine !
A credit card that rewards you for doing the right thing .
I am Generation Forward . ”
As the tech - news blog ReadWriteWeb wrote Wednesday , “ How much more surreal could this get ? ”
Tracy Akselrud , the MySpace spokeswoman for the Citi partnership , declined to discuss the relationship .
Jeanette Volpi , Citi ’s spokeswoman for the partnership , said the bank ’s research showed that customers wanted a card that rewarded them for good behavior .
“ We are giving customers want they want , ” she said .
Ms. Volpi refused to address the obvious disconnect in the marketing message : Citi is telling the younger generation to act responsibly even though the old folks running the nation ’s banks are no models of financial rectitude .
Just imagine if Citi were to follow its own rules and “ set a good example ” for those young MySpace users .
Instead of simply taking a second and third government handout after it blew through the first one , Citi could pay back the taxpayers at 29.99 percent interest , the same rate it will charge MySpace cardholders who miss a payment .
Instead of keeping those unearned billions in bonuses , Citi ’s executives could “ believe in sharing the wealth ” and give some money back to shareholders , who have seen their stock plunge to $ 1 a share .
Instead of getting more government cash as they fritter away ever more of the bank ’s capital , Citi ’s bankers could earn points towards rides on the company jet as they make timely repayments of the taxpayers ’ money .
What about it ?
Nah .
That responsibility stuff is for the chumps of Generation Forward .
Poll , after poll , continues to show that the American Public is standing behind this president , while the Republicans are just spinning out of control .
The public do n't blame the mess of the economy on President Obama , they believe he inherited it and Michelle Obama has the best poll numbers of a First Lady .
Some are comparing FLOTUS to Eleanor Roosevelt .
As for the GOP ?
Their nasty rhetoric and divisive tricks have just turned the public off to them .
No wonder King Rush is taking control .
In the survey , 68 percent have a favorable opinion of the president , including 47 percent whose opinion is " very positive " — both all - time highs for Obama in the poll .
Moreover , 67 percent say they feel more hopeful about his leadership and 60 percent approve of his job in the White House .
[ snip ]
Just 26 percent view the Republican Party positively , which is an all - time low for the party .
That 's compared with 49 percent who have a favorable view of the Democratic Party .
In addition , a combined 56 percent say the previous Bush administration deserved " almost all " of the blame or a " major part " of the blame for the partisanship in Washington , and a combined 41 percent say the same of congressional Republicans .
[ snip ]
Also , the public overwhelmingly believes the GOP 's opposition to Obama 's policies and programs is based on politics : 56 percent say they 're trying to gain political advantage , versus 30 percent who say they 're standing up for their principles .
Finally , Americans do n't seem to have confidence in the Republican Party when it comes to the economy .
By a 48 - 20 percent margin , they think the Democratic Party would do a better job of getting the country out of the recession .
Republicans ,
Hart argues , " have been tone deaf to the results of the 2008 election ...
They never heard the message .
They continue to preach the old - time religion . "
McInturff , the GOP pollster , agrees .
" These are difficult and problematic numbers . "
An Oklahoma City man who announced on Twitter that he would turn an April 15 tax protest into a bloodbath was hit with a federal charge of making interstate threats last week , in what appears to be first criminal prosecution to stem from posts on the microblogging site .
Daniel Knight Hayden , 52 , was arrested by FBI agents who identified him as the Twitter user CitizenQuasar .
In a series of tweets beginning April 11 , CitizenQuasar vowed to start a " war " against the government on the steps of the Oklahoma City Capitol building , the site of that city 's version of the national " Tea Party " protests promoted by the conservative - leaning Fox News .
" START THE KILLING NOW !
I am willing to be the FIRST DEATH ! , " read a tweet at 8:01 PM that day .
" After I am killed on the Capitol Steps , like a REAL man , the rest of you will REMEMBER ME !!! , " he added five minutes later .
Then : " Send the cops around .
I will cut their heads off the heads and throw the[m ] on the State Capitol steps . "
Hayden 's MySpace page is a breathtaking gallery of right wing memes about the " New World Order , " gun control as Nazi fascism , and Barack Obama 's covert use of television hypnosis , among many others .
In addition to the threats , many of Hayden 's tweets fixated on another Oklahoma City man whom he erroneously believed was in charge of the city 's tea party demonstration .
" He seemed to know stuff about me , but I do n't know how or why , " says Earl Shaffer .
" He called me a few days before that tea party and let me know somehow he got my name as one of the organizers .
I do n't have the energy . "
Shaffer told Hayden that he was n't a tea party organizer , but Hayden continued to tweet baffling messages about the 58 - year - old retiree , posting his phone number in one .
Hayden 's penultimate tweet at 12:49 AM on April 15 returned to the subject of his martyrdom .
" Locked AND loaded for the Oklahoma State Capitol .
Let 's see what happens . "
The FBI arrested ( .pdf ) him at his home later that day , according to the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Oklahoma City , which otherwise declined to comment on the case .
Despite the odd phone call from Hayden , Shaffer planned on joining the tea party himself .
He was headed there when he spotted what turned out to be FBI agents watching him from their car around the corner .
Like a real Oklahoman , he confronted the feds , who advised him that he could be arrested if he went to the demonstration .
" They asked if I knew [ Hayden ] , and I told them no , " he says . "
They asked me questions about how I heard about the tea party , and I told them I heard about it through that talk show host Glenn Beck . "
Hayden was arraigned on the 16th , and ordered released to a halfway house pending trial – a move that suggests the magistrate judge does not consider him a genuine threat .
Hayden 's attorney declined to comment .
California - based Twitter did not respond to an inquiry by Threat Level .

As detailed in BLONDES , we all pick up on pupil size unconsciously , and the size of a person ’s pupils affects our perception of his or her attractiveness and desirability .
The pupil dilates and becomes up to ten times larger when a person is emotionally or sexually aroused .
That pretty much explains why men prefer women with big pupils .
And women ’s general preference for men with medium - sized pupils is also explainable : we do n’t want men who are overaroused …. and potentially out of control sexually .
Unless , of course , when we want them to be .
This explains the outcome of the latest pupil - size study by Peter Caryl and his colleagues at the University of Edinburgh .
The psychologists found that women who were in the fertile part of the cycles — in particular , four days before ovulation — had a stronger preference for large - pupiled men .
Previous experiments also found that women who prefer “ bad boys ” had a preference for guys with big pupils .
Big pupils may be part of a suite of male sexual cues — like strong chins and aggressive behavior — that turn women on , some more than others , and more strongly during certain days of the cycle .
Of course , the researchers only asked women to rate pictures of men , not actual in - the - flesh subjects .
There might be a big difference .
A woman likely to conceive might in theory prefer a bulked - up pie-eyed hunk — but in real life the oaf might send her running .
WASHINGTON — Though job losses accelerated last month , the United States has not yet hit bottom .
In a bleak report on Friday , the Labor Department said that almost 600,000 jobs disappeared in January and that a total of 3.6 million jobs had been lost since the beginning of the recession in December 2007 .
The unemployment rate , meanwhile , rose to 7.6 percent , from 7.2 percent a month earlier .
Losing more than a half million jobs in each of the last three months , the country is trapped in a vortex of plunging consumer demand , rising joblessness and a deepening crisis in the banking system .
The contraction in jobs is already steeper than in any recession since at least the early 1980s .
But economists warn that several more shoes are about to drop .
The first is the growing severity of the global recession , which has already started to choke off exports from the United States .
Growth in China has slowed to a fraction of its usually brisk pace , leading to brutal downturns in South Korea , Japan and other Asian nations .
Much of Europe has slipped into a recession , too .
We ’ve commented from time to time that a possible financial flashpoint is countries that got themselves in the same fix as Iceland , of having a banking sector engaged in the generally risky practices that were standard form recently , and was outsized relative to the economy ( Willem Buiter also points out that that precarious situation is made worse by having your own teeny currency ) .
While Ireland is in that position , a more immediate trigger for trouble is Eastern Europe .
We ’ve mentioned in particular the precarious position of Austria , which was a big lender to the region .
As Ambrose Evans - Pritchard remarks in the Telegraph :
Austria ’s finance minister Josef Pröll made frantic efforts last week to put together a € 150bn rescue for the ex-Soviet bloc .
Well he might .
His banks have lent € 230bn to the region , equal to 70 pc of Austria ’s GDP .
“ A failure rate of 10 pc would lead to the collapse of the Austrian financial sector , ” reported Der Standard in Vienna .
Unfortunately , that is about to happen .
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) says bad debts will top 10 pc and may reach 20 pc .
The Vienna press said Bank Austria and its Italian owner Unicredit face a “ monetary Stalingrad ” in the East .
Mr Pröll tried to drum up support for his rescue package from EU finance ministers in Brussels last week .
The idea was scotched by Germany ’s Peer Steinbrück .
Not our problem , he said …..
Yves here .
Recall we said a few days ago ( based on admittedly a small number of conversations , but the Austrian and German businessmen were knowledgeable ) that the Austrian banks were widely known to be bankrupt , that Austrians knew they needed to be rescued and would need help .
The Austrians were highly confident that Germany would fund a bailout , and the Germans were mystified that the Austrians were so certain .
The Germans ’ doubts appear to have been well founded .
Back to the piece :
Stephen Jen , currency chief at Morgan Stanley , said Eastern Europe has borrowed $ 1.7 trillion abroad , much on short - term maturities .
It must repay – or roll over – $ 400 bn this year , equal to a third of the region ’s GDP .
Good luck .
The credit window has slammed shut … .
“ This is the largest run on a currency in history , ” said Mr Jen .
In Poland , 60 pc of mortgages are in Swiss francs .
The zloty has just halved against the franc .
Hungary , the Balkans , the Baltics , and Ukraine are all suffering variants of this story .
As an act of collective folly – by lenders and borrowers – it matches America ’s sub - prime debacle .
There is a crucial difference , however .
European banks are on the hook for both .
US banks are not .
Almost all East bloc debts are owed to West Europe , especially Austrian , Swedish , Greek , Italian , and Belgian banks .
En plus , Europeans account for an astonishing 74 pc of the entire $ 4.9 trillion portfolio of loans to emerging markets … .
Whether it takes months , or just weeks , the world is going to discover that Europe ’s financial system is sunk , and that there is no EU Federal Reserve yet ready to act as a lender of last resort or to flood the markets with emergency stimulus … .
Erik Berglof , EBRD ’s chief economist , told me the region may need € 400bn in help to cover loans and prop up the credit system … .
The sums needed are beyond the limits of the IMF , w…We are nearing the point where the IMF may have to print money for the world , using arcane powers to issue Special Drawing Rights .
Its $ 16bn rescue of Ukraine has unravelled .
The country – facing a 12 pc contraction in GDP after the collapse of steel prices – is hurtling towards default , leaving Unicredit , Raffeisen and ING in the lurch .
Pakistan wants another $ 7.6 bn .
Latvia ’s central bank governor has declared his economy “ clinically dead ” after it shrank 10.5 pc in the fourth quarter …
“ This is much worse than the East Asia crisis in the 1990s , ” said Lars Christensen , at Danske Bank .
This is looking ugly indeed , and that ’s before you consider that European banks are on average much more leveraged than their US counterparts .
TO the long list of things I do horribly  break dancing , dusting and gardening , among them  I can now add one more : shaving with a straight razor .
So it became clear as the blood dripped  no , let ’s say flowed  down my cheek one recent Sunday morning inside F.S.C. Barber in the West Village in Manhattan .
It was less than a minute after my five fellow students and I  all in our 20s and 30s  took blades to our faces at Cut Throat 101 , the appropriately named , $ 70 shaving class given on the first Sunday of every month at 10:30 a.m .
F.S.C.’s Village location at 5 Horatio Street ( the original is at 8 Rivington Street on the Lower East Side ) is outfitted with antique Koch leather barber chairs from the 1930s , old - fashioned milk - glass lights and a floor of salvaged oak from Appalachia , among other absurdly genuine things .
The shop ( 212-929-3917 ) provides old school pampering for men who ca n’t bear to pay $ 100 for a haircut but want something better than the hair butcher at the corner .
( F.S.C. charges $ 75 for a haircut and a shave . )
“ We ’re trying to blur the line between a hair salon and a barbershop , ” explained Shorty Maniace , the head barber and my shaving teacher for a day .
“ Men get the quality of a salon , plus the social aspect , without having to hear about Britney Spears or Prada pumps . ”

Israeli Envoy Brags of " Thwarting An Attempt to Act Against Us "
An attempt by the British government and other members of the United Nations Security Council to condemn Israel ’s attack on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency headquarters in the Gaza Strip was foiled today , after Israel found out about the attempt and demanded United States ambassadors prevent it .
According to Israel ’s Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Carmon “ this is the first time we have succeeded in thwarting an attempt to act against us thanks to reliable firsthand information received from the Foreign Ministry and the IDF . ”
European Union ambassadors called the meeting following the attacks , but the Israeli diplomats alerted the United States to it and the later prevented the council from achieving a resolution .
Instead , Security Council President Jean - Maurice
Ripert made a speech calling for both sides to stop fighting .
The attack on the compound destroyed several tons of food and fuel aid intended for Gaza ’s civilian population and injured three aid workers .
The United States has stymied several attempts by the United Nations Security Council to bring an end to the fighting in the Gaza Strip .
Perceived Israeli influence over US policies was brought to the fore this week when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert claimed to have ordered President Bush to abstain from voting on a Friday vote on a Gaza ceasefire .
As a child , I spent hours in an inconspicuous garden shed somewhere in Oxford building plastic model kits .
Spitfires and Bf 109s were popular among my schoolmates , but I was strangely drawn to the kite - like form of WWI aircraft .
The Sopwith Pup was my absolute favorite .
There was something endearing about its simple shape , and I doodled squadrons of marauding Sopwiths on any scrap of paper that fell within arm 's reach .
Airdrome Aeroplanes in Holden , Missouri manufactures a broad range of WWI kitplanes , including the Fokker DR - 1 Triplane , various Nieuports and -- wonder of wonders -- the stunning full scale Sopwith Pup pictured here .
A deluxe airframe kit costs $ 12,495 and includes everything from the rudder and fuselage to the engine mount and cowling .
You 'll need to add an extra $ 195 to get your hands on the machine gun kit .
If you 're skilled , it will take about 400 hours to turn a few boxes of parts into a flyable airplane .
Power comes from a decidedly modern 110 hp Rotec R2800 7 - cylinder radial engine and there 's room for basic instruments in the single seat cockpit .
Officially known as the Sopwith Scout , A total of 1,770 Pups were manufactured by the Sopwith Aviation Company between 1916 and 1918 .
The Pup proved to be a nimble combat aircraft and dominated the skies when it arrived on the battlefield in October 1916 .
However , it was quickly outclassed by formidable new German aircraft and was pulled from combat in the face of mounting losses a year later .
The Pup went on to have a second life as a capable training aircraft .

You may not realize it , but here in the US , our internet kinda sucks .
We pay more money for less speed than just about everyone else in Europe and Asia .
The town of Wilson , in North Carolina , got fed up with this and decided to form their own community ISP , called Greenlight , which was unsurprisingly able to compete so effectively with more traditional companies like Time Warner that you ca n’t even really call it competition :
For example , the city offers an expanded basic cable ( 81 channels ) , 10 Mbps ( download and upload ) , and a digital phone plan with unlimited long distance to the U.S. and Canada , all for $ 99.95 .
A comparable plan from Time Warner Inc. , with six fewer channels ( no Cartoon Network , Disney , The Science Channel , ESPNU , ESPN News , or ESPN Classic ) and lower upload speeds costs $ 137.95 , for an introductory rate , which lasts a few months and then will likely be ratcheted up .
Greenlight also offers every single cable channel plus premium channels , unlimited phone service , and 20 mbps internet for $ 170 ( Time Warner ’s fastest available service is 15 mbps ) .
And as if that was n’t enough , Greenlight even has a 100 mbps service .
Oh , and you know what else ?
They have 24/7 local phone support and actually respond to feedback from their community .
See ?
It ’s so much better , it ’s not even funny .
So , you ’d think that in light of this , Time Warner would realize that their overpriced and underperforming services would need an overhaul to remain competitive in a world that depends so heavily on internet .
Instead , Time Warner is lobbying the North Carolina senate to pass legislation outlawing community ISPs .
And it ’s apparently working , too , which I can’t figure out because what could possibly be wrong with providing a better service to people at a cheaper price ?
Time Warner ’s argument is that they ca n’t compete against a community - owned ISP that ’s able to provide services at cost , but it seems to me that the real issue is that Time Warner ’s services cost a lot , and they suck , and that ’s why there ’s no competition .
If Time Warner wants to complain about competition , maybe they should first try to get competitive , instead of attempting to outlaw anyone who does things better than they do .

Not that there 's a shortage of attention - grabbing things to do in
Orlando , but during a recent trip , my wife and family and I made the
40 - mile trip due east to Titusville for what turned out to be an awesome day without a queue , turnstile , or cartoon character in sight .
First stop : The Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge .
My daughter 's a big animal enthusiast – and it's not just the cuddly stuff .
She 'll fill the DVR with those not - for - the squeamish emergency vet shows .
Walking the looping path behind the visitor center , she shot this photo of a nine - banded armadillo we found nosing through the underbrush ( And who knew these things had ears like Rodians ? ) , and this one of a close encounter with an eight - foot alligator that glided up to the shore right in front of us , near enough that we could see its nostrils flaring with each breath .
After leaving the refuge , we headed for the seashore itself – there 's a
$ 3 per adult charge collected at a guard house along the way .
( Take note : Canaveral National Seashore is a largely untouched place , so there 's no running water restrooms or food stands or any other conveniences .
It 's gorgeous . )
The access road we took in runs along the northern edge of Kennedy Space Center .
I 've been a space exploration nut for pretty much three - plus decades now – seeing space shuttle launches is one of the things I truly miss about living in Central Florida – and I still get a thrill out of just being near Kennedy , looking through the binoculars at the mammoth
Vehicle Assembly Building and the gantries and platforms and cables and giant liquid oxygen tanks of Launch Complex 39 .
So we 're driving toward the shore and I catch a glimpse of orange on the far pad , and I realize it 's the external fuel tank of a shuttle –
Atlantis , as it turns out , scheduled for a May 12 launch .
We park the cars and I can't take my eyes off it : I 'm recording shaky video through the binoculars , and thankful every second that my friend Jim is there with his professional - grade camera .
My daughter climbs up to the railing of the walkway we 're on and stands next to me , peering over the marshes , and we 're talking about the size of the buildings and the big crawlers NASA
uses to move the shuttles around , and the escape cables from the orbiters
Even just sitting there , the orbiter itself hidden from view , it 's magnificent .
And between now and the launch date , you can head out there for the rare chance to see two shuttles on the pad for what will probably be the last time .
So for less than it would have cost us to park our two cars at any of the big Orlando - area theme parks , we got armadillos , alligators and spaceships , all within five minutes of pristine , wide - open beach .
The happiest place on Earth is where , again ?
DURHAM , N.C. -- Gerald Henderson was at the center of another pivotal play in a Wake Forest - Duke game .
This time , it worked out in the Blue Devils ' favor .
Henderson scored a career - high 35 points to lead No. 9
Duke past the eighth - ranked Demon Deacons 101- 91 on Sunday night , using a big night to make up for a miscue in the teams ' last meeting that sent the Blue Devils to a costly loss .
Jon Scheyer added a career - high 30 points in his second straight start at point guard for the Blue Devils ( 22 - 5 , 8 - 4 Atlantic Coast Conference ) .
They twice led by 22 points in the first half and let Wake Forest creep within two points before finally sealing the game with a late 16 - 6 run keyed by Henderson .
" When you 're up , it 's easy to relax , so we just had to really get tough , " Henderson said .
" You have to be aggressive throughout the whole game . "
They moved into a three - way tie for second in the league standings behind North Carolina , and now they finish the season with three of their last four games away from cozy Cameron Indoor Stadium .
Jeff Teague scored 28 points and James Johnson added 26 for the Demon Deacons ( 20 - 5 , 7 - 5 ) .
They shot 61 percent but allowed Duke to hit 54 percent of its attempts -- the worst performance of the season by the ACC 's stingiest defense .
" If somebody would have said we were going to score 91 points and we'd lose , I think I would have called him a liar , " Wake Forest coach Dino Gaudio said .

There 's no shortage of chassis at this year 's CeBIT trade show , but Thermaltake 's celebrating its 10th anniversary with this revolutionary offering :
It 's called " Level 10 " , and it 's simply dazzling .
Taking the compartmentalised approach to the next level , the unusual chassis houses the majority of components in their own little space - envisioned by the six hard - disk - holding bumps .
We 've no idea if it 's actually any good in terms of functionality , but we love a bit of innovation and Thermaltake 's engineers claim to have built this one from the ground up .
Allowing access to all the internal components is an access panel over at the back , but , sadly , it 's too soon to take a look inside .
As far as first impressions are concerned , it 's damn cool , and it wo n't be long until we get all the details as Thermaltake will be fully detailing the Level 10 at COMPUTEX in June .
We 'll be on hand to get all the details , this is easily the most interesting chassis we 've seen all year .
Built with 65,000 bricks , the Lego space shuttle that replicates a real launch
With painstaking detail , two Lego fans have reconstructed a space shuttle launch that looks remarkably like the real thing .
Complete with flashing booster lights and a vocal countdown , the Lego creation does everything but lift off .
Lego launch :
The replica space shuttle that took more than a thousand hours to make
It took its two Japanese makers 1,590 hours to build using 65,000 bricks and is currently on display at the Nasu Highland amusement park in Japan .
And the duo responsible still have n't had enough of Lego building - they are now attempting to create the tallest ever Lego tower .
Earlier this week a Danish court decided that an ISPs have to block access to The Pirate Bay .
In response to the judgment , three ISPs have already announced that they will take the case to the Supreme Court .
In addition , The Pirate Bay itself now says it will sue the anti-piracy outfit IFPI if the ISPs fail to overturn the ruling .
The decision to block The Pirate Bay has once again ignited a debate on Internet filtering , the responsibilities of Internet providers and the legal status of BitTorrent sites .
The IFPI – the RIAA ’s global partner – has chalked up a small victory this week , but the fight is far from over .
Peter Sunde , co-founder of The Pirate Bay told TorrentFreak that they are seriously considering suing the IFPI for unfair competition .
“ They have had a monopoly on distribution and we ’re breaking that monopoly , and in turn they sue people that allow access to our distribution method , ” he said .
Meanwhile , all other BitTorrent sites are still accessible in Denmark , and thus far the IFPI has n’t announced it will go after any of them .
This , together with the fact that there are several tricks to get around the block , make their legal strategy look like a personal vendetta against The Pirate Bay instead of an effective measure against piracy .
Before The Pirate Bay takes action against the IFPI , they will first await the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal that the three ISPs – DC , Telia and Telenor – announced earlier this week .
If the appeal is unsuccessful , and when they find the perfect lawyer to represent them , The Pirate Bay will sue IFPI .
The IFPI seems to be looking forward to yet another confrontation .
“ Peter Sunde is welcome to sue us , ” Jesper Bay , the head of the Danish IFPI told Comon.dk in a response to the news .
Ironically , one of the websites explaining how to get around the Danish blockade carries Jesper Bay ’s name .
For now , the Pirate Bay team has another court case to focus on .
In two weeks their trial in Sweden kicks off , where the IFPI will also be one of their opponents .
To be continued .
Update : Initially we reported that all Danish ISPs have to block the Pirate Bay .
This is not the case .
The latest court decision is a preliminary injunction against DMT .
This means that it is only binding against ISPs owned by DMT ( thanks Ole ) .
The producers of the Australia film Two Fists One Heart have released footage that did n’t make the final cut under creative commons for anyone to use and mash up as long as they link back to the promotional site for the film .
The release of over 30 minutes of footage , backed by Disney through Beuna Vista International ( Australia ) , is believed to be a world first for a commercially backed movie .
Two Fists , One Heart producer David Elfick took the decision to embrace the web for promotion , and hired the services of Norg Media head Bronwen Clune for the promotion .
So far , the online reachout has included a series of viedos on “ how to throw a punch ” ( available naturally at howtothrowapunch.com ) ; if the title has n’t given it away , the movie in based around boxing .
Norg Media ’s Bronwen Clune told The Inquisitr that she wanted to try something more .
“ I thought we could push the envelope more .
It ’s not often you get the ear of major film players and personally I have always thought creative commons is an underutilized concept in the film industry .
I see this as an opportunity to prove in some way that the web and it ’s culture of sharing and share - alike is a good thing for creative industries . ”
Bronwen explains : “ the producer mentioned that they had a lot of great footage they were n’t able to use in the film – more than usual – and I suggested to him we not let it be wasted and we release it for anyone to mashup and play with .
To me , the thought of footage being wasted and unused when someone could make something really creative with it was a real shame .
There are so many people out there cutting great videos and posting them on YouTube , but the biggest barrier is often having the footage to play with .
This way we could give them something to use – and the footage is what professional editors deal with – and promote the film at the same time – it was a win-win . ”
Encouragement to remix the footage is also incentivized .
The best 5 scenes will be posted on YouTube by April 20 will be added to Disney ’s promotional Two Fists , One Heart site , and will have access to Bill Russo for editing advice and career assistance .
Footage from Two Firsts One Heart is available for download from Cut Your Own Scene .
This week , Oprah aired her exclusive look inside the Yearning for Zion Ranch , the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints compound that was raided around this time last year .
For me , the most interesting part of her visit was when she spoke with some teen girls and asked them frank questions about their lives and faith .
There are n’t any clips other than this one , which is n’t very indicative of the segment , and the print version does n’t mention a single girl by name .
I ’m unsure whether the girls asked not to be named , but I have a hunch that their names were simply omitted since Oprah referred to them by name in the television version .
Oprah ’s questions and remarks about their lives and faith were often condescending , expressing obvious skepticism that these women had the final say on whom they marry .
She was surprised that the girls had cell phones and watched TV on occasion ( though we ’re told there is no TV on the ranch ) .
The media ( including Oprah ) have framed these women with an outdated image of obedience and conformity that seems incongruous with modernity .
This narrative is often one framed around religious women , especially around religions that are seen as cultish or very traditional .
Several of Oprah ’s comments and questions highlighted this arrogant narrative : when asking the girls about polygynous marriage , her tone indicated the idea was distasteful , even after the girls explained their belief in and acceptance of the practice as a part of their faith and lifestyle .
Another example is when Oprah remarked that all of the girls ’ dresses looked alike .
The girls , however , can tell the difference between the dresses , knowing that the differences are in the details .
They explain that their bodies are sacred , and so they cover them .
Oprah then asked them if they ever take their dresses off .
“ Of course , ” they say .
“ When we go to sleep . ”
These questions struck me as startlingly similar to ones that Muslim women are often asked about their headscarves and their own lives .
“ Do you ever take that off ? ” “ Will your parents force you to marry ? ”
Those who do n’t grow up knowing the intricacies of abaya or headscarf styles do n’t know how to tell one from another , just like the FLDS ’ girls ’ clothes , dubbed “ prairie dresses ” , were distinguishable to them because they were part of that fashion “ culture . ”
“ Brainwashed ” is a term often used or implied when referring to religious women .
Oprah ’s interview with Betty , an FLDS woman who was taken from the YFZ Ranch by her mother when she was 16 and who moved back to the Ranch when she was 18 , highlights this part of the dominant narrative on religious women .
Betty states that her mother assumes she is “ brainwashed ” , but she says she “ rejoined FLDS because she wanted to return to her old life , family and religion . ”
The FLDS women and girls say that they are still recovering from last year ’s raid .
It ’s obviously left a large psychological impression , judging from some of the women ’s emotional recounts of the ordeal .
This could account for their enthusiastic and adamant affirmations of their faith and their way of life .
They may have whitewashed anything negative about their way of life as a reaction to the overwhelmingly negative media portrayal of their religion , or in fear of another raid .
Or they might actually be happy .
Either way , Oprah ’s visit to the ranch was not illuminating or fresh .
Because it recycled the same narratives about religious women as outdated and brainwashed , the only thing different about this program was the religion of the women interviewed .
Remember Ron Paul ?
Congressman Ron Paul ?
The long - term libertarian - like representative from Texas who 's even older than McCain ?
The guy with a leased blimp who sought the Republican presidential nomination last year and came within something like 1,000 delegates of upsetting the Arizonan .
Paul lasted a lot longer than Romney , who had to write off some $ 40 million of his own dough .
And Paul 's hundreds of thousands of dedicated supporters way - outraised that preacher Huckabee who 's now all over Fox News , which , btw , is the network that barred Paul from its New Hampshire GOP debate because he had no chance .
Although , to be fair and balanced , Paul had done better in Iowa than Giuliani or that D.A. Thompson guy , what 's his name Frank or Fred .
Thank goodness
Fox protected its viewers from this Texan , who used to be an ob - gyn .
So Paul marched all the way to St. Paul , past that ex-New York mayor , who the mainstream media said was the certain GOP nominee until he was n't ; Giuliani made it only a few hours past Florida .
Here 's how silly Ron Paul is :
He set a budget for his campaign and lived within it .
Flew commercial .
Stayed at Super 8's .
No motorcades .
In fact , he ended with no deficit , which is how he thinks the federal government should operate .
In point of fact , Paul ended his campaign with a surplus .
Can you imagine anything so silly in this day and age ?
Paul warned all during his campaign about a looming economic disaster if government just kept growing and growing and printing more money like Republicans and Democrats wanted .
Many said he was loony .
His noisy followers too .
Today , just because the old geezer predicted correctly , Paul thinks someone will listen to him ?
Get real !
Paul was on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday , and he absolutely amazed the reporters by patiently explaining that we got into this national financial whirlpool by spending too much government money , and so the solution was probably not to spend even more government money .
Ever heard anything so wacky ?
You can listen for yourself on the video below .
But in a nutshell , here 's the craziness Paul peddles : " We should be cutting spending .
We should be trying to live within our means and not just try to spend our way out of a recession that was brought upon us by too much spending and too much borrowing and too much printing - press money . "
LOL !
Oh , and here 's something else .
Paul says the reason housing prices are falling is because there 's too much housing on the market , something about supply exceeding demand .
So , Paul reasons , instead of spending hundreds of billions of deficit dollars to build more houses , making the supply even larger , politicians should risk unpopularity , cut spending and taxes and let the market settle out .
And the startled reporters point out that would mean thousands could lose the homes they can't afford .
And Paul said yes , something like 8 % .
But how much help has spending hundreds of billions been so far ?
So spending hundreds of billions more will work better ?
And they thanked him for his time .
Watch for yourself .

SINGAPORE , March 9 ( Reuters ) - Acidifying oceans caused by rising carbon dioxide levels are cutting the shell weights of tiny marine animals in a process that could accelerate global warming , a scientist said on Monday .
William Howard of the University of Tasmania in Australia described the findings as an early - warning signal , adding the research was the first direct field evidence of marine life being affected by rising acidity of the oceans .
Oceans absorb large amounts of CO2 emitted by mankind through the burning of fossil fuels .
The Southern Ocean between Australia and Antarctica is the largest of the ocean carbon sinks .
But scientists say the world 's oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb more planet - warming CO2 , disrupting the process of calcification used by sea creatures to build shells as well as coral reefs .
Laboratory experiments had earlier predicted these impacts .
Howard and co-author Andrew Moy , also of the University of Tasmania , studied the shells of tiny amoeba - like animals called foraminifera in the Southern Ocean and compared the shell weights to data from sediment core records dating back 50,000 years .
Their findings , which appear in the latest issue of Nature Geoscience , show shell weights of modern - day foraminifera falling between 30 and 35 percent .
" The big challenge will be how do we scale up this kind of change to understand what it means for the ecosystem .
And to be honest , we do n't know yet , " he told Reuters .
The implications for climate change were clearer , he said .
CARBON TRANSFER
Foraminifera , which live on the ocean 's surface , play a major role in trapping CO2 and transporting it to the ocean depths where it can be locked away for decades or more .
Disrupting this process could accelerate climate change .
Foraminifera , he said , comprise a significant proportion of all the carbonate shell material produced in the ocean .
" Their presence and production helps facilitate the sinking of organic matter from the surface layers of the ocean into the deep ocean , " said Howard , project leader of the ocean acidification team at the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre .
" That translates into the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere into the deep ocean .
If these organisms are not calcifying as much it may translate into a reduction in the carbon transfer from the atmosphere . "
Oceans are alkaline and Howard said that a century ago , oceans had a pH of 8.2 , with a pH of 0 being battery acid and 13 being household bleach .
Oceans were now just under 8.1 , he said .
" We 've already changed the pH of the ocean by about 0.1 .
At these levels this represents about a 30 percent increase in the acidity of the oceans , " Howard said .
" Anything that makes a shell is going to have a hard time making that shell . "
The big challenge was understanding the ocean 's response to climate change and what happens to ecosystems .
The Southern Ocean was one of the first areas scientists will see this kind of shift , Howard said , in part because it is a major carbon sink .
" There 's no question acidification is going to affect every part of the ocean because every part of the ocean is taking up CO2 from man-made emissions , " he said .

Excitement is an ephemeral phenomenon .
As was Pontiac .
It had its glorious day in the sunshine of the exciting sixties .
Pontiac was like the polite , quiet middle child who ran away to California in the early sixties , became a huge star , crashed in 1970 , and played the county fair nostalgia circuit ever since .
In between repeated bouts in rehab .
And now we ’re here to pay our last respects .
Not only was Pontiac the “ quiet ” child in the GM household , it was also the unplanned “ accidental ” child .
Created in 1926 as a minor lower priced “ companion ” to Oakland , one of GM ’s original five car companies , Pontiac survived its mother ’s death in the Depression .
To save costs , GM ’s President Alfred Sloan had Pontiac share a lengthened Chevrolet body and chassis as well as other major components .
It became a tarted - up Chevy , and with Pontiac ’s first straight - eight engine in 1933 , a more powerful one .
Thus badge - engineering was born .
In Sloan ’s “ a car for every pocketbook ” dictum , Pontiac became the ( realistic ) aspiration for the Chevy driver of the thirties .
Pontiac ’s prices slotted in exactly between the most expensive Chevy range and the cheapest Oldsmobile .
But Sloan ’s religiously hierarchical structure collapsed at the beginning of the Depression .
And by the fifties , the divisions were all over each other .
It was like a new twist to a professional wrestling tag team match : The GM Mid-Price Thee Stooges .
And although the GM team made sure to make it look like they were also fighting with each other , it did n’t really matter , as long as the real competition was flattened .
The competition ’s contestants like Edsel and DeSoto were tossed out of the ring , permanently .
Mercury , Dodge and Chrysler were left bloody .
And it was n’t ketchup either .
But Pontiac was the laggard of the GM team until 1959 .
That ’s when it reinvented itself , started working out in earnest , grew a “ wide track , ” and let its ( now dyed blonde ) hair grow long .
And overnight , it became the Star( Chief ) .
Instantly , Pontiac jumped to fourth place in US sales .
The dreamy 1960 “ Wide Track Pontiac ” ads as rendered by Fitzpatrick and Kaufman are icons of the time when Americans were ready to fully embrace image , youthfulness , style , and most of all , excitement .
Pontiac ’s decade had arrived .
Unarguably the best styled cars of the sixties , Pontiac jumped to third place in 1962 and held that spot though the decade .
It was a crushing blow to Chrysler ’s Plymouth division , which had claimed that perch since the late twenties .
And in doing so , Pontiac sucked Chevy right into the GM tag team spectacle .
And before long , even Caddy would be in the ring too , fighting for the working - man ’s attention ( and suspension of disbelief ) .
But all during the sixties , Pontiac had the moves to keep the eyes on it .
The first was the 1963 Grand Prix coupe .
It had the exclusiveness and formal elegance of the Buick Riviera coupe , at about three - fourths the price .
But Pontiac really wowed the crowds with its 1964 GTO .
Now here was something that had n’t been seen before .
Drop - kick the big 389 into the light , mid-size Tempest , along with suspension , tire , appearance and interior upgrades , and the affordable American enthusiast car reached its zenith .
In this pre-BMW era of fossilized British roadsters , the GTO overwhelmingly had the best overall performance / dollar equation .
Pontiac was BMW before BMW was cool ( or available ) .
But like for so many stars of the sixties , the seventies were not kind to Pontiac .
Its flabby beltline was clearly showing .
What remaining life forces it could muster were all concentrated on one remaining move , the Trans Am .
And even that became a bit of a joke after one too many times .
Pontiac ’s star had passed , and it tumbled out of the coveted number three spot .
Now its moves were reduced to pathetic little imitations of Chevrolet : Phoenix , Astre , Sunbird , J- 2000 , T - 1000 , etc .
Having lost its mojo , Pontiac also began endless self - conscious attempts to capture the BMW cachet , like with the original 1973 Grand Am .
Oddly enough , Pontiac ’s last - ditch BMW - caricatures enjoyed a brief revival of interest during the mid-eighties .
But the crowd that was paying ( not very much ) was not exactly a highly coveted demographic .
As in this uncharitable description of the stereotypical driver of a ( red ) Grand Am : “ a nail manicurist who lives in a trailer with an unemployed ( former wrestler ? ) boyfriend ” .
Pontiac had become the Wal - Mart BMW .
Be careful what you wish for .
Despite a few desperate last - ditch twitches induced by steroids smuggled in from Australia , Pontiac was tossed out of the ring for good .
And the once - invincible GM tag team is desperately looking for signs of life among its few bloodied remaining members .
There is an old adage on Wall Street that no one rings a bell at major market tops or bottoms .
That may be true in normal times , but as many have noticed , we are now completely through the looking glass .
In this parallel reality , Ben Bernanke has just rung the loudest bell ever heard in the foreign exchange and government debt markets .
Investors who ignore the clanging do so at their own peril .
The bell ’s reverberations will be felt by everyday Americans , whose lives are about to change in ways few can imagine .
While nearly every facet of America ’s economy has been devastated over the past six months , our national currency has thus far skipped through the carnage with nary a scratch .
Ironically , the U.S. dollar has been the beneficiary of the global economic crises which the United States set in motion .
As a result , our economy has thus far been spared the full force of the storm .
This week the Federal Reserve finally made clear what should have been obvious for some time — the only weapon that the Fed is willing to use to fight the economic downturn is a continuing torrent of pure , undiluted , inflation .
The announcement should be seen as a game changer that redirects the fury of the financial storm directly onto our shores .
In its statement , the Fed announced its intention to purchase an additional $ 1 trillion worth of U.S. treasury and agency debt .
The purchases , of course , will be made with money created out of thin air through the Fed ’s printing presses .
Few can doubt that they will persist with these operations until the economy returns to its former health .
Whether or not this can ever be accomplished with a printing press alone has never been seriously considered .
Bernanke himself admits that we are in uncharted waters , with no map or compass , just simply a hope that more dollars are the answer .
Rather than solving our problems , more inflation will only add to the crisis .
Falling asset prices , the credit crunch , declining consumer spending , bankruptcies , foreclosures , and layoffs are all part of the necessary rebalancing of our economy .
These wrenching movements , however painful , are the market ’s attempts to resolve the serious problems at the root of our bubble economy .
Attempts to literally paper - over these problems will lead to disaster .
Now that the Fed has recklessly shown its hand , the mad dash to get out of Treasuries and dollars should not be far off .
The more the Fed prints to buy bonds the less the dollar is worth .
Holders of our debt ( read China and Japan ) understand this dynamic .
We must expect that they will not only refuse to buy new bonds , but they will look to unload those bonds they already own .
Under normal circumstances , if creditors grew concerned that inflation was eating into their returns , the Fed would raise interest rates to entice them to buy .
However , the Fed will avoid this course of action as it fears higher rates are too heavy a burden for our debt - laden economy to bear .
To maintain artificially low rates , the Fed will be forced to purchase trillions more debt then it expects as it becomes the only buyer in a seller ’s market .
Just last week , Chinese premier Wen Jiabao voiced concern about his country ’s massive investments in U.S. government debt .
In the most unequivocal statement yet by the Chinese leadership on this issue , Wen made it plain that he was concerned with depreciation , not default .
With his fears now officially confirmed by the Fed statement , we must wonder when the Chinese will finally change course .
There is a growing consensus that if China no longer wants to buy our bonds , we can simply print the money and buy them ourselves .
This naïve view fails to consider the consequences implicit in such a change .
When the Treasury sells bonds to China , no new dollars are printed .
Instead , China prints yuan which it then uses to buy treasuries .
This effectively allows America to export its inflation to China .
However , now that we will be printing the money ourselves , the full inflationary impact will fall directly on us .
With such a policy in place , America has now become a banana republic .
It wo n’t be too long before our living standards reflect our new status .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Scientists have developed a polyurethane coating that heals its own scratches when exposed to sunlight , offering the promise of scratch - free cars and other products , researchers said on Thursday .
“ We developed a polymeric material that is able to repair itself by exposure to the sun , ” said Marek Urban of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg , whose study appears in the journal Science .
“ In essence , you create a scratch and that scratch will disappear upon exposure to the sun , ” Urban said in an interview on the Science website .
The self - healing coating uses chitosan , a substance found in the shells of crabs and shrimp .
This is incorporated into traditional polymer materials , such as those used in coatings on cars to protect paint .
When a scratch damages the chemical structure , the chitosan responds to ultraviolet light by forming chemical chains that begin bonding with other materials in the substance , eventually smoothing the scratch .
The process can take less than an hour .
Urban said the new coating uses readily available materials , offering an advantage over other self - repairing coatings , which he said were “ fairly elaborate and economically unfeasible . ”
The team tested the compound ’s properties using a razor - blade - thin scratch .
“ We have n’t done any of the tests to show how wide it can be , ” Urban said in a telephone interview .
He said the polymer can only repair itself in the same spot once , and would not work after repeated scratches .
“ Obviously , this is one of the drawbacks , ” he said , adding that the chances are low of having two scratches in exactly the same spot .
Howell Edwards , who leads the chemical and forensic sciences division of the University of Bradford in Britain , said the findings were novel .
“ Clearly , there are future applications of this work in the repair of automotive components , which extensively use polyurethane polymers , that have suffered minor damage , ” Edwards said in a statement .
Urban said the coating could be used in packaging or furniture or anything that requires a high - performance type of coating .
“ You can dream up anything you desire , ” he said .
Urban said his team has patents pending on the material and is considering commercialization .

Electron microscopy of the anthrax sent to media outlets and politicians in 2001 provided vital clues to how spores were prepared ( Images : Sandia National Laboratory )
KEY forensic evidence in the US anthrax attacks of 2001 has been revealed .
The FBI had previously prevented the scientists involved from speaking publicly about their findings in case this interfered with court proceedings , but last August , after chief suspect Bruce Ivins committed suicide , the case collapsed and the FBI lifted many of the restrictions .
This week , some of the scientists involved revealed their results at a scientific meeting in Baltimore , Maryland .
These show how …
An underwater volcano has erupted close to the Tonga coast , in the South Pacific ocean .
Scientists sailed to inspect the the volcano , which has been shooting smoke , steam and ash into the air near the low - lying twin volcanic islands of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai .
Local authorities said coastal villages close to the active volcano were not yet at risk , and that no warnings had been issued .
Alcohol misuse is a major problem for the NHS
The government 's top medical adviser has drawn up plans for a minimum price for alcohol which would double the cost of some drinks in England .
Under the proposal from Sir Liam Donaldson , no drinks could be sold for less than 50 pence per unit of alcohol they contain .
It would mean most bottles of wine could not be sold for less than £ 4.50 .
Cabinet minister Douglas Alexander said the government would consider what Sir Liam had to say in his report .
But Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell said ministers had no intention of going ahead with something that would punish the responsible majority of drinkers .
The proposal is aimed at tackling alcohol misuse and is set out in Sir Liam 's annual report on the nation 's health .
This would hit the pockets of hard - working families who are already struggling to make ends meet
David Poley , Portman Group A Department of Health spokeswoman said : " We have not ruled out taking action on very cheap alcohol - it 's clearly linked to people drinking more and the subsequent harm to their health . "
She said more work needed to be done to make sure action was " appropriate , fair and effective " but decisions would take the " wider economic impact during this difficult time " into account .
Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said it was important to deal with people 's attitudes and not just the supply and price of alcohol .
The Liberal Democrats backed Sir Liam 's stance and said putting an end to " pocket - money priced alcohol " would influence drinking behaviour .
Industry reaction Carys Davis of Alcohol Concern said that setting a minimum price for alcohol would help deter youngsters from binge drinking .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The way forward is to tackle the causes of alcohol addiction - raising the price would simply exacerbate the problem Ian Cheese , London , UK Dr Chris Record , a liver specialist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle , said there was a " very , very close link between price and consumption " and increasing the price of alcohol would " target those people that are drinking at harmful or hazardous levels " .
A Tesco spokeswoman said : " If government comes forward with a package of proposals including minimum alcohol pricing , we would enter into discussions positively " .
The Portman Group , set up by drinks manufacturers to promote sensible drinking , opposes the plan .
Portman chief executive David Poley said : " This would have a marginal effect on harmful drinkers but force hard - working families to pay more for a drink . "

Advertisement Earlier this month the Scottish government published plans for a minimum price per unit of alcohol , which is strongly opposed by retailers and the drinks industry .
No price threshold was set .
Setting a minimum price could have a particular impact on " own brand " or " value pack " beers and ciders .
Sir Liam 's report is due to be published on Monday .
The proposals as they stand do not apply to Wales or Northern Ireland .
The BBC 's health correspondent Adam Brimelow said Sir Liam 's recommendation would not automatically become government policy .
But he said Sir Liam was influential and had advocated a ban on smoking in public places long before it became law .
Scots plan on cheap alcohol
The NHS bill for alcohol abuse is an estimated £ 2.7 bn a year .
The most recent figures show hospital admissions linked to alcohol use have more than doubled in England since 1995 .
Alcohol was the main or secondary cause of 207,800 NHS admissions in 2006 / 7 , compared to 93,500 in 1995 / 96 .
The figures include hospital admissions for a specific alcohol - related condition - such as liver disease , but also admissions where alcohol is a contributory factor but not the main cause - such as falls due to drunkenness .
Of hospital admissions in 2006 / 7 specifically due to an alcohol - related diagnosis , almost one in 10 were in under 18 year olds .
The number of alcohol - related deaths in England has doubled since the early 1990s to nearly 9,000 a year .

What are these ?

I ’ve got 2 large boxes completely full of old cassette tapes ( remember those ? ) in my closet .
There are probably over 400 tapes sitting there , degrading , losing their magnetic information , slowly dissolving into silence , or perhaps more correctly , white noise .
Will I ever listen to any of these again ?
Probably not .
Heck , I do n’t even own a tape player .
Even if I did want to listen to any of them one day , I ’m sure I ’d be considerably disappointed in the sound quality ( if there was any music still on them at all ) , after having been spoiled with CD ’s for so long .
I have no idea why I still keep them .
Perhaps it ’s one part nostalgia mixed with one part being a bit of a pack rat and one part denial .
Or maybe it ’s just the fond memories of seeing cassettes completely unraveled on the side of the road – their former owners apparently hanging them out the window to see how far they would stretch behind the car .
Cassette Tape Art
Well , artist Erika Iris Simmons has definitely done something useful with her tapes .
She is an artist who specializes in using non-traditional media such as old books , audio cassettes , playing cards , magazines , credit cards , basically whatever he can find .
She says :
It feels great to work with strange , older materials .
Things that have a mind of their own .
Most everything I use has been thrown away or donated at some point .
Past its prime , like some of the finest things in the world .
What she ’s created with some old cassette tapes and reel tapes is simply remarkable .
Using these old tapes , she has turned them into works of art in a series that she calls “ Ghost in the Machine . ”
The series portrays celebrities and musicians such as Marilyn Monroe , Bob Dylan , Robert DiNero , Jimi Hendrix , Ian Curtis , and Jim Morrison .
Jim Morrison :
The “ Reel ” Marilyn Monroe :
Robert De Niro :

Incredible , are n’t they ?
You can find more of her work on flicker .

( CNN ) --
With its energy - gobbling casinos , Atlantic City , New Jersey , is n't exactly known as a city that conserves electricity .
Its motto : " Always turned on . "
Atlantic City 's convention center , in the lower center of this photo , has the largest solar - paneled roof in the U.S .
This oceanside gambling mecca seems an unlikely place for a pioneering solar energy project .
But at a ceremony scheduled for Thursday , city and state officials commemorated the city 's convention center , newly powered in part by the largest single - roof solar - panel array in the United States .
The 13,321 photovoltaic panels will produce an average of 26 percent of the convention center 's energy , according to consultants .
The panels cover most of the roof 's usable space , leaving room for walkways and other equipment .
" We estimate that we are going to save $ 4.4 million over the 20 years of the contract [ with the solar provider ] , " said Jeff Vasser , president of the Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority .
In greener terms , authorities estimate the solar panels will avoid the release of 2,349 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere -- equivalent to removing 390 passenger vehicles from the road or reducing oil consumption by 4,956 barrels per year .
" This is something we started thinking about when Gov . [ Jon ]
Corzine came out with his energy master plan , " Vasser said .
" We thought , looking at our roof , that we would have a perfect opportunity to take the lead for New Jersey . "
When the Atlantic City Convention and Visitor 's Authority received its electric bill in January , there was a significant difference from the year before .
Despite relatively short days and weak winter sunlight , the panels produced 15 percent of the convention 's center 's power .
Corzine 's energy plan for the state went into effect in October .
One of its five goals is : " Invest in innovative clean - energy technologies and businesses to stimulate the industry 's growth in New Jersey . "
The governor has played in key part in inspiring businesses to look at solar options , Vasser said .
The convention authority did n't set out to have the largest solar setup on one roof .
The group had been thinking for several years of ways to be greener and to save money , Vasser said .
It became apparent as they talked to consultants that the bigger the solar array , the better .
Vasser sees convention centers as ideal places for solar arrays .
They are big , boxy buildings with a lot of empty space on their mostly open , flat roofs .
He thinks adding solar power should be an easy decision as long as the roof has good exposure to the sun .
The hardest choice , he said , was picking the most cost - effective way to add panels to the 500,000 - square foot building .
After considering the option of buying the panels outright and having them installed , the convention center authority signed an agreement with Pepco Energy Services of Arlington , Virginia .
Pepco owns the equipment and sells the power generated by the panels to the convention center .
Another factor that made the agreement more attractive was that as a public entity , the convention center is not eligible for federal tax credits .
As a private company , Pepco is .
Pepco , which provides electricity from a variety of traditional and green sources , believes solar power is an important part of the nation 's future .
" I think it 's going to do a lot for reducing our dependence on oil and will have all kinds of positive effects , not only on geopolitics but on the cost of the energy in this country , " said David Weiss , president and COO of Pepco . " [ Solar ] plants like this are what are going to make it happen . "
One of the advantages about having solar panels on buildings is that you use a free source of energy to produce power where it is being used , said Tom Hunton , CEO of American Capital Energy , the subcontractor on the project .
When electricity is generated at a coal or nuclear plant , some of it disappears as it travels through transmission lines to homes and businesses .
But , despite the fact that there have been many engineering and manufacturing improvements to solar panels over the past 50 years , solar energy is still too expensive for mass use , he said .
" But eventually solar power will be a major source of power in the United States .
It 's just a matter of time . "
Atlantic
City will continue to play host to renewable energy projects like large solar arrays , Vasser said .
" There 's a lot of neon and bright lights here , but I think everyone is conscious of saving energy and being conscious of our environment , " he said .

It 's even more disgusting than we heard yesterday .
According to the Wall Street Journal , AIG , the financial giant that has taken more than $ 170 billion of our money to save it from extinction — and given lots of it to other financial companies — is paying almost half a billion dollars in bonuses ( my emphasis in first quoted paragraph )
to employees in its financial products unit .
That division was at the heart of AIG 's collapse last fall , which compelled the U.S. government to provide $ 173.3 billion in aid to keep it running ….
Those payments are in addition to $ 121.5 million in incentive bonuses for 2008 that AIG will start making this month to about 6,400 of its roughly 116,000 employees .
AIG , which was rescued in September as it faced potential bankruptcy , is also making over $ 600 million in retention payments to over 4,000 employees .
Together , the three programs could result in roughly $ 1.2 billion in retention and bonus payments to AIG employees .
Who 's worse ?
The legislators and executive - branch people who let this happen , or the AIG executives who are showing themselves to be supremely greedy , and who must be laughing at the rest of us by now .

Dear Readers :
The following is an exchange I had earlier this week with a mom who wrote to this blog .
It shows how those of us who trust our own eyes , and guts , and neighborhood , and children can get beaten down … and rise up again .
A WOMAN NAMED LORI WROTE : I went searching for your story after an experience last night .
My 10 - year - old son wanted the chance to walk from our house to soccer practice behind an elementary school about 1/3 mile from our house .
He had walked in our neighborhood a number of times with the family and we have driven the route to practice who knows how many times .
It was broad daylight – 5:00 pm .
I had to be at the field myself 15 minutes after practice started , so I gave him my cell phone and told him I would be there to check that he made it and sent him off .
He got 3 blocks and a police car intercepted him .
The police came to my house — after I had left — and spoke with my younger children ( who were home with Grandma ) .
They then found me at the soccer field and proceeded to tell me how I could be charged with child endangerment .
They said they had gotten “ hundreds ” of calls to 911 about him walking .
Now , I know bad things can happen and I was n’t flippant about letting him go and not checking up , but come on .
I live in a small town in Mississippi .
To be perfectly honest , I ’m much more concerned about letting him attend a birthday party sleepover next Friday , but I ’m guessing the police would n’t be at my house if I chose to let him go ( which I probably wo n’t ) .
I WROTE BACK : Incredible !
It ’s like the Salem Witch trial era , when people were hallucinating witchcraft .
Today we hallucinate horrific danger in the safest of settings .
I am so sorry you – and he – went through this !
LORI WROTE : I appreciate you responding .
I was more than a little upset yesterday and second - guessing my actions .
I tend to actually be more of a hovering parent , so even though I was nervous about my son going on his own yesterday I really did n’t think it was a bad decision .
I really resented the police officer trying to lecture me about how the streets are n’t safe .
Rather than give in to the hysteria or naively ignore the danger , I think I ’m going to go down to the police office and ask to see detailed statistics about what happens on our streets in the afternoon hours .
I ’d like to base my decision on facts rather than hysteria .
‘ Course , I do n’t quite know what to do about the “ hundreds ” of people who called 911 when they saw him on the street .
I ca n’t imagine that many people even saw him in 3 blocks in a mostly residential neighborhood .
But , if they were watching out for him , that just makes me feel like he was that much safer .
I WROTE encouraging her to go get those statistics and keep me posted .
She did !
LORI WROTE : Guess what .
I just got an apology from the Chief of Police .
I emailed him this afternoon to ask for stats and explain what happened .
He called me almost immediately , assured me that I lived in a safe neighborhood , and apologized for the officer ’s conduct .
He asked if I really wanted the stats , or if I just wanted to know that I was right .
I told him that knowing that I was right was enough for me .
I still do n’t know what I can do about the people who call 911 because they see my son on the street alone , but at least I do n’t feel like a naïve mother anymore .
And , I like our chief of police even more J .
He promised to handle this himself with the officer .
FREE -RANGE MORAL OF STORY :
It takes fortitude to trust your own instincts , especially when well - meaning ( but deranged ) authorities tell you not to .
But in times of mass hysteria , that is what ’s required .

Why are we asking this now ?
Russia 's President , Dmitry Medvedev , addressed a combined meeting of the country 's senior officers and top brass earlier this week , where he set out sweeping plans to modernise and upgrade the armed forces .
It was the first time he had spoken at such a gathering in his capacity as President , and the occasion was widely seen as as underlining his status as commander - in - chief , a year after his election .
Did Medvedev warn that Russia was re-arming ?
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Yes and no .
Outside Russia , many reports implied he had given the West notice of a new arms race in stressing Russia 's intention to enhance its nuclear capability .
He did say a long - range nuclear missile capacity would remain key to Russia 's defence .
But his central theme was not re-armament – nuclear or conventional – but the urgent need for Russia to modernise its armed forces in every respect : from structures and equipment to servicemen's pay and conditions .
So he was soft on the West ?
Not exactly .
He had a sideswipe against Nato , which – as he put it – " has not curbed its efforts to station some of its military infrastructure close to our borders " .
But you would expect this sort of thing from a national leader speaking to a military audience .
It would have been strange if he had not at least alluded to US plans to station anti-missile installations in former Warsaw Pact countries that now belong to Nato .
But he was careful not to name the US or any other country .
He left the sabre - rattling to his chief of general staff , Anatoly Serdyukov , who accused the US of trying to secure its supplies of raw materials ( ie. oil and gas ) by stationing troops in Central Asia and elsewhere .
Does Russia need military reform ?
And how .
Aside from a new flag and new uniforms , almost everything about the Russian armed forces has remained unchanged since Soviet days .
It is still almost entirely a conscript army .
It retains a ponderous , top - heavy command structure ( with one officer for every two - and - a - half men ) .
Pay is abysmally low ; housing for the rank - and - file is barely civilised , and much hardware is more than 20 years old .
The collapse of the Soviet Union drastically reduced the prestige of the armed forces , whose retreat – first from eastern and central Europe , then from the Baltic States , and then from most other former Soviet republics in Central Asia and the Central Caucasus – was seen by many in Russia as a defeat .
Germany helped , by paying for new housing to resettle many of the troops returning to Russia from East Germany , but that still left a huge shortfall .
Then there were the two Chechen wars , in which Russian forces hardly covered themselves with glory .
What other problems need to be tackled ?
Two especially intractable problems .
The first is corruption .
The armed forces , especially the less prestigious units , were beset by corruption even in the late Soviet period .
But it escalated through the 1990s , as troops hawked everything they could , not just uniforms and firearms , but tanks and other hardware .
Sometime this was for self - enrichment , and sometimes simply to survive .
The second is bullying .
Again , the problem goes back a long way .
The campaign group , Soldiers '
Mothers , came to prominence in the 1980s , and lobbied against brutal induction practices .
Even now , more than 1,000 soldiers a year die from a variety of non-military causes , which include accidents and bullying .
Why has so little been done so far ?
Partly because the logistical problems presented by so many returning troops were so great .
Partly because there were more urgent priorities , such as the need to secure dilapidated nuclear installations – for which Nato supplied finance and expertise .
And partly because Russia had a whole new border to defend after the Soviet Union collapsed and most of its military installations were in the wrong places .
Russia 's most heavily , and expensively , fortified border in 1992 , for instance , was with Norway – because this was the single frontier it still had with Nato – but its greatest post - Soviet vulnerability was its southern flank .
Of course , there was also resistance to reform among members of the top brass , across all services , who feared the threat to their status and expertise .
The loss of the Kursk submarine in August 2000 showed Russia 's military at its most closed and recalcitrant .
What makes reform so urgent now ?
The Russian military and Russian politicians would offer a whole series of reasons .
But there is really only one that explains both the timing and the sense of urgency : the experience of the brief war with Georgia last August .
While Russia " won " , to the extent that it was able to secure Georgia 's two pro-Russian enclaves ( South Ossetia and Abkhazia ) , the campaign exposed embarrassing weaknesses in Russia 's capability .
A bit like Britain having to reorient its Army away from notional tank battles for control of central Europe and towards desert and guerrilla warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq , Russia found itself having to fight Georgia 's upgraded , Nato - compatible forces with Cold War-era structures and equipment .
What did Russia learn from the Georgia war ?
Principally , how inflexible and backward its own forces were .
Russia lost 66 servicemen , including the deputy commander in the field , and four warplanes .
But officers are also said to have been shocked by Georgia 's high - tech capability , including night - sight , which left Russian forces highly vulnerable in the dark .
Ordinary conscripts were seized with envy at the standard of accommodation enjoyed by Georgian troops – and in at least one instance proceeded to trash it in their fury .
The whole experience left Russia 's high command shocked and – for the first time since the Soviet collapse – amenable to change .
Has there been no reform at all since 1992 ?
Not much .
Both Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s and Vladimir Putin between 2000 and 2008 said they wanted Russia to have completely professional armed forces .
But plans were always shelved , primarily for cost reasons , but maybe also because of the risk of higher youth unemployment .
Putin did manage to bring the conscription period down from two years to one for the army ; he also introduced a stipulation that only volunteers would serve in Chechnya .
Pay was raised , but it is still very low , and a programme begun to improve military housing .
But , as Mr Medvedev made clear this week , progress has been slow .
Should the West be concerned ?

By any standards , the Russian military is overdue for reform .
And while more efficient armed forces could present a greater threat , the opposite can also be argued .
Reform should make the Russian military not only leaner , fitter and better equipped , but also more disciplined and more responsible .
This should reduce the threat of unsecured nuclear materials and unruly troops .
In the end , it will not be Russia 's military capability , but its political stance that determines whether it constitutes a threat to the West .
Will President Medvedev succeed in modernising the Russian military ?
Yes ...
* He is determined .
One of his first acts as President was to sack the Chief of General Staff .
* The experience of the war against Georgia proved that modernising the military could not be delayed .
* If Russia wants to increase , or even retain , its international influence , it needs a modern fighting force .
No ...
* Modernising an outdated force of more than 1 million men will take at least a generation .
* The fall in oil and gas prices means that Russia will not be able to afford such a costly project all at once .
* The military is one of Russia 's last unreformed institutions and there are those who want to keep it that way .
I am glad that Caroline Petrie is going back to work because , as far as I can tell , she is a dedicated and effective nurse .
But I was disturbed by North Somerset Primary Care Trust 's judgment .
Caroline Petrie was suspended without pay because , after changing a patient 's dressing , she asked the elderly woman whether she would like her to pray for her .
Although " taken aback " , the patient did not complain but mentioned the upsetting event to others who then did so .
The trust ruled that Petrie had been acting in " the best interests of her patients " , and I am sure she thought she was .
I spoke to her a few days ago , for a discussion on the Jeremy Vine show .
She was friendly and pleasant , happy to talk about what had happened , and completely unable to understand why her actions would upset people .
I know I would be upset if it happened to me .
I was reminded of a recent taxi ride to the coach station in Bristol .
My Muslim taxi driver was very friendly and we chatted all the way .
As I got out he politely handed me my suitcase and said " May God go with you " .
" No , no " I replied " I do n't think he exists . " and walked off feeling horribly confused at what I 'd blurted out .
After all , if there 's no God how could the man 's wishes do me any harm , and if they could n't why should I want to upset him – was n't I just as bad proselytising for atheism as he was for God .
I got on my bus feeling a little churned up .
Now imagine ( as the National Secular Society does ) that instead of getting on a bus , I were ill , and completely at the mercy of a God - fearing nurse .
I would experience a horrible conflict between speaking out for what I believe , not upsetting a kind nurse , being angry that she had upset me , and so on .
This is not what you need when you are ill .
This is why North Somerset Primary Care Trust were right to take action in the first place and then to have a proper tribunal .
What bothers me is the way they worded their judgment .
First , they said that nurses did not have " to set aside their faith " while at work .
I agree – but only because that 's impossible ; if you have true faith you can't suspend it 9 to 5 .
The problem occurs when someone pushes their faith onto someone else , and that is what Nurse Petrie seemed to be doing .
Happily the NHS guidelines are quite clear .
They state that " such behaviour , notwithstanding religious beliefs , could be construed as harassment under the disciplinary and grievance procedures . "
Second , they acknowledged that " some people saw prayer as an integral part of healthcare " , and that really bothered me .
Perhaps they meant merely to state a fact , rather than condone it .
Even so , I think they should have said that this is wrong .
Prayer absolutely should not be an integral part of healthcare .
Why not ?
Because healthcare needs to be effective , and that means basing it on evidence .
We now have all the evidence we need to show that prayer is not effective , and even that telling someone you are going to pray for them can be harmful .
I say this on the basis of the largest and best controlled study of the effects of prayer .
In the Harvard prayer experiment , 1802 cardiac bypass patients were divided into three groups .
Two were told that they might be prayed for ; half were and half were n't .
The third group were told they would be prayed for and they were .
The first two groups recovered equally well , but the group that knew they were being prayed for actually did worse .
Perhaps their hopes were falsely raised , or perhaps they were upset to know that someone was praying for them .
We do n't know , but we can safely conclude that knowing you are being prayed for is not helpful .
Christian groups have complained that the ruling will " inhibit freedom of conscience " .
This is ridiculous .
If a nurse 's conscience tells her to pray for someone , then as long as the patient does n't know about it , it can't do any harm .
But if her conscience tells her to go out and spread the word of Jesus , or encourage others to join her in prayer , then she should read those guidelines : " you must not use your professional status to promote causes that are not related to health . "
Some people may think that prayer should be an integral part of healthcare , but they are wrong .
The guidelines are absolutely right .
Newt Gingrich woos religious right for his anti-tax cause Muriel Kane
Published : Friday March 20 , 2009
Print This Email This When Newt Gingrich served as Speaker of the House in the 1990's , he never appeared to be particularly close to the religious right .
His Contract with America was all about deregulation , balanced budgets , tort reform , and getting tough on crime and welfare .
Even when Gingrich re-emerged last summer as a would - be Republican leader , it was with a " drill here , drill " now campaign aligned with the oil industry .
However , in the wake of the Republicans ' crushing defeat in last fall 's election , he has apparantly decided that the only hope for the GOP lies in an alliance between his own anti-tax adherents and religious conservatives .
A story which appeared Friday in US News and World Report explores Gingrich 's growing alliance with the religious right .
" In the last few years I 've decided that we 're in a crisis in which the secular state , if allowed , will fundamentally and radically change America against the wishes of most Americans , " Gingrich told US News .
" You 've had such rising hostility to religious belief that I wanted to reach broadly into the country and dramatically raise public awareness of threats to religious liberty . "
According to Gingrich , it was a 2002 court decision finding the phrase " in God we trust " to be unconstitutional that caused him to say , " It 's time to challenge head - on secular domination in the West . "
In 2006 , Gingrich published Rediscovering God in America : Reflections on the Role of Faith in Our Nation 's History and began making appearances before groups of pastors .
That led to his creation of an organization called Renewing American Leadership , headed by his former communications director .
Renewing American Leadership has now developed a PowerPoint presentation with which it will attempt to convince pro-business groups like the US Chamber of Commerce and Grover Norquist 's Americans for Tax Reform -- as well as major Republican donors -- that the most reliably anti-tax members of Congress are also the strongest social conservatives .
As evidence of this claim , the American Family Association has already agreed to participate in Gingrich 's anti-tax rallies .
Gingrich himself will be speaking this spring to several large gatherings of politically conservative clergy , organized by evangelical activist and former RNC political consultant David Barton , who also sits on the board of Renewing American Leadership .
Barton is best known for his attempts to prove that the founding fathers were dedicated Christians and never intended for the Constitution to mandate separation of church and state .
Those same ideas form the central argument of Gingrich 's Rediscovering God in America .
However , Barton has darker associations as well , which makes it particularly disturbing that Gingrich now seems to be relying on him as a mentor .
According to an article originally published in 1993 by Americans United for Separation of Church and State :
" Barton also has ties to extremist elements .
In his literature , Christian Reconstructionist authors and organizations are sometimes recommended .
Reconstructionist activist Gary DeMar 's book God And Government is suggested reading , and Reconstructionist - oriented groups such as the Plymouth Rock Foundation and the Providence Foundation are touted as resources .
" Perhaps most alarming , Barton also has had a relationship with the racist and anti-Semitic fringes of the far right .
According to Skipp Porteous of the Massachusetts - based Institute for First Amendment Studies , Barton was listed in promotional literature as a ' new and special speaker ' at a 1991 summer retreat in Colorado sponsored by Scriptures for America , a far - right ministry headed by Pastor Pete Peters .
Peters ' organization , which is virulently anti-Semitic and racist , spreads hysteria about Jews and homosexuals and has been linked to neo -Nazi groups .
( The organization distributes a booklet called Death Penalty For Homosexuals . ) "

( Washington , DC ) - Legislation signed into law on March 11 , 2009 by President Obama will make permanent a ban on nearly all cluster bomb exports by the United States , Human Rights Watch said today .
The United States should review its stance on joining the international treaty prohibiting cluster munitions in light of this action , Human Rights Watch said .
" This permanent export ban is a major turnaround in US policy , " said Steve Goose , arms division director at Human Rights Watch .
" It brings Washington into closer alignment with international opinion on this terrible weapon . "
Congress included the export ban in an omnibus budget bill ( HR 1105 ) that passed the Senate on Tuesday .
The legislation states that cluster munitions can only be exported if they leave behind less than 1 percent of their submunitions as duds .
Cluster submunitions often fail to explode on initial impact , leaving duds that act like landmines and pose danger to civilians .
The legislation also requires the receiving country to agree that cluster munitions " will not be used where civilians are known to be present . "
Only a very tiny fraction of the cluster munitions in the US arsenal meet the 1 - percent standard .
This export ban was first enacted in a similar budget bill in December 2007 , but that law mandated it for only one year .
" The passage of this measure is yet another indication that the president should initiate a thorough review of US policy with respect to cluster munitions , " said Goose .
" If it is unacceptable for foreign militaries to use these weapons , why would it be acceptable for the US military to use them ? "
US policy on cluster munitions was last articulated in a three - page policy directive issued by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in July 2008 .
The directive described cluster munitions as " legitimate weapons with clear military utility . "
Under the policy , the US will continue to use cluster munitions and , after 2018 , will use only munitions with a tested failure rate of less than 1 percent .
In December 2008 , a spokeswoman for the Obama transition team said that the next president would " carefully review " the new treaty banning cluster munitions and " work closely [ with ] our friends and allies to ensure that the United States is doing everything feasible to promote protection of civilians . "
On February 10 , Human Rights Watch joined leaders from 66 other national nongovernmental organizations in signing a joint letter calling on President Obama to join the Convention on Cluster Munitions .
Human Rights
Watch co-chairs the Cluster Munition Coalition , which it helped found in November 2003 .
It is also a founding member of the United States Campaign to Ban Landmines and Cluster Bombs .
" The export ban moves the US one step closer to the position taken by nearly 100 nations - including its closest NATO allies - that have signed the treaty banning cluster munitions , " said Goose .
" A US decision to sign would certainly signal President Obama 's commitment to multilateral diplomacy . "
The 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions was opened for signature in December .
It prohibits the use , production , stockpiling , and transfer of cluster munitions , and provides strict deadlines for clearance of affected areas and destruction of stockpiled cluster munitions .
A total of 95 states have signed the convention , including most NATO members and other close US allies .
The Bush administration chose not to participate in the development or negotiation of the convention , which was modeled on the 1997 treaty banning landmines .
While the historical record is incomplete , the United States has transferred hundreds of thousands of cluster munitions containing tens of millions of unreliable and inaccurate submunitions to at least 28 countries : Argentina , Australia , Bahrain , Belgium , Canada , Egypt , Denmark , France , Greece , Honduras , Indonesia , Israel , Italy , Japan , Jordan , South Korea , Morocco , the Netherlands , Norway , Oman , Pakistan , Poland , Saudi Arabia , Spain , Thailand , Turkey , the United Arab Emirates , and the United Kingdom .
Several of these states have joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions and are in the process of destroying their stockpiled cluster munitions .
Cluster munitions exported by the US have been used by other states in Lebanon , Iraq , the former Yugoslavia , and Western Sahara .
Cluster munitions can be fired by artillery and rocket systems or dropped by aircraft and typically explode in the air and send dozens , even hundreds , of tiny bomblets over an area the size of a football field .
Admittedly , television and movies are littered with numerous examples of fake Presidents .
How does anyone narrow it down to just a few names ?
One will inevitably overlook some great portrayals .
And the options are numerous , ranging from great to terrible , humorous to boring , and from the completely bizarre to the inspired .
To keep the candidates manageable , we ’ll limit eligibility to fake Presidents , and not portrayals of real Presidents .
We ’ll also limit it to Presidents of the United States , and not Presidents of other entities .
After sifting through the candidates , we at Gunaxin have chosen our favorites , the Presidents we feel anyone in real life could live up to and do a fine job .
These President are simply put , the best of the best .
But there were so many to choose from , that even we feel we had to leave some good ones out .
If your favorite is missing , we apologize .
But we also feel these twelve are an especially strong group of leaders .
Here they are :
BONUS ) President Camacho
As portrayed in : Idiocracy
His full name is President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho , but that was too long to fit in our heading above .
Here ’s a guy who enters the House of Representin ’ and can command a group of idiots to follow his lead .
The five time Ultimate Smackdown Wrestling Champion and leader of the free world is the perfect man to rescue the United States out of its stupidity induced down spiral .
His solution ?
Just find the smarter man and let him do his thing .
12 ) President Merkin Muffley
As portrayed in : Dr. Strangelove
Supposedly inspired by Adlai Stevenson , his meek appearance and bald pate gives off the vibes of an egghead liberal unprepared for the problems of nuclear war .
Maybe he ’s not the greatest leader in the free world , but buoyed by Sellers ’ brilliant performance he gets great bonus points for his line , ” Gentlemen !
You ca n’t fight in here !
This is the War Room . ”
11 ) The President
As portrayed in : Escape from New York
When you crash land onto Manhattan Island , but its been turned into a maximum security prison , that ’s not a good thing .
The President survives the crash but is soon held hostage by the inmates , who even chop off one of the poor man ’s fingers .
But he gets revenged , as he guns down the gang leader , The Duke near the film ’s end while shouting , “ Ayy !! Number Onnee !
You ’re the Duke !
You ’re the Duke ! ”
10 ) President James Dale
As portrayed in : Mars Attacks !
In Tim Burton ’s campy B - movie homage , Nicholson ’s aloof President may not be the most effective commander - in - chief , but he proves to be one of the funniest .
In his defense , its a no -win situation for him when Martians attack .
Plus he gets bonus points for his great lines .
For example , after the Martians destroy Congress , he proclaims , ” I want the people to know that they still have two out of three branches of the government working for them … and that ai n’t bad . ”
9 ) President Tom Beck
As portrayed in : Deep Impact
Here ’s a President that had to deal with a meteor crashing into the Earth and causing an ‘ Extinction Level Event ’ .
Despite the massive damage and incredible loss of life , he manages to deliver a great speech and his actions in constructing underground shelters helped save millions .
8 ) President Fitzgerald Grant
As portrayed in : Scandal
President Fitzgerald Grant was a central character on the Shonda Rhimes drama , Scandal .
However he always played second to Olivia Pope , and at times seemed incapable of leading the free world without the encouragement and advice from Olivia .
The Presidency of Fitzgerald Grant III began on January 20th 2011 , when he became the 44th President of the United States after election fraud committed on his behalf .
7 ) President Thomas J. Whitmore
As portrayed in : Independence Day
A President who can lead his troops into battle .
Literally .
Even after his Vice - President and wife are taken out , he assembles a rag tag fleet of former airmen and crop-dusters at an Air Force base in a final battle against super powerful aliens .
6 ) President Jackson Evans
As portrayed in : The Contender
He comes across as likable and friendly , but beneath the surface he is a shrewd , manipulative politician who can crush his opponents .
And yet while enagages in some of these bulldog tactics , we still like him .
It helps that his agendas are usually on the noble side .
5 ) President Bill Mitchell ( Dave Kovic )
As portrayed in : Dave
Okay , you can argue this one a little bit since Kline is himself being the fake President for a fake President .
But he pulls it off , and because people believed he was the President , he can count in my mind .
Testing the theory that anybody can be president , Kline ’s doppelgänger run at the Presidency was a complete 180 from the man he replaced .
4 ) President Josiah Bartlet
As portrayed in : The West Wing
An encyclopedia of knowledge and a Nobel Laureate , Bartlet represents an idealized president , endowed with a fierce intellect , great ( though not infallible ) personal integrity , toughness tempered with essential compassion for the less fortunate , and a sense of humor .
Although he suffers from relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis , he managed to control his illness and be a great President who was popular and always the smartest guy in the room .
3 ) President Andrew Shepherd
As portrayed in : The American President
Aaron Sorkin can really write Presidents and for Michael Douglas he created one with smarts , charisma , charm , and an overall strength .
That is a definite winner in my book .
Although the movie plays as a romantic comedy , you got to love a guy who can interrupt a date in order to bomb Libya .
2 ) President James Marshall
As portrayed in : Air Force One
Take many of the above qualities of Presidents on this list and in a President who can kick ass .
Part action hero , he can take care of terrorists himself .
Even while quipping , stuff like “ Get off my plane ! ”
Who would n’t want to vote for a man like that ?
1 ) President David Palmer
As portrayed in : 24
This was a tough race between the top two , but has there ever been such a universally beloved President ?
I ’m giving the edge to Palmer in this one , as he is a man who inspires loyalty wherever he goes .
24 has gone through a lot of Presidents , but the best of bunch is easily David Palmer , who served as President in Seasons 2 and 3 .
A popular and charismatic leader , not only was he brave and principled , he taught me about the swoop and squat .

Fully - funded doctoral studentships in dependently type programming at Oxford and Strathclyde
FULLY - FUNDED DOCTORAL STUDENTSHIPS
IN DEPENDENTLY -TYPED
PROGRAMMING AT OXFORD AND STRATHCLYDE
A new EPSRC - funded project on Reusability and Dependent Types has just started , as a collaboration between the Functional Programming Laboratory at the University of Nottingham ( Thorsten Altenkirch ) , the Algebra of Programming group at the University of Oxford ( Jeremy Gibbons ) , and the Mathematically Structured Programming group at the University of Strathclyde ( Neil Ghani and Conor McBride ) .
We are all familiar with Milner 's slogan that " well - typed programs cannot go wrong " .
Types express properties of programs ; more expressive type systems - such as dependent typing - can state properties more precisely , providing stronger guarantees of behaviour and additional guidance in development .
However , this expressivity comes at a price : more specific typing can reduce opportunities for code reuse .
The goal of this project is to investigate techniques for promoting reuse without sacrificing precision ; in particular , how can we layer dependently typed programs , imposing stronger invariants onto more general library code ?
Two fully - funded doctoral studentships are available to work in this area : one at Oxford ( with JG ) and one at Strathclyde ( with CTM ) .
Each covers stipend , fees ( at the home / EU rate ) , equipment , and travel , and is for three and a half years from October 2009 .
The closing date for applications is 15th April 2009 .

This is the second of a series of blog posts introducing the new C++0 x thread library .
If you missed the first part , it covered Starting Threads in C++0 x with simple functions .
If you read part 1 of this series , then you 've seen how easy it is to start a thread in C++0x : just construct an instance of std :: thread , passing in the function you wish to run on the new thread .
Though this is good , it would be quite limiting if new threads were constrained to run plain functions without any arguments — all the information needed would have to be passed via global variables , which would be incredibly messy .
Thankfully , this is not the case .
Not only can you run function objects on your new thread , as well as plain functions , but you can pass arguments in too .
Running a function object on another thread
In keeping with the rest of the C++ standard library , you 're not limited to plain functions when starting threads — the std :: thread constructor can also be called with instances of classes that implement the function - call operator .
Let 's say " hello " from our new thread using a function object :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > class SayHello { public : void operator ( ) ( ) const { std :: cout < <" hello " < < std : : endl ; } } ; int main ( ) { std:: thread t(( SayHello( ) ) ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
If you 're wondering about the extra parentheses around the SayHello constructor call , this is to avoid what 's known as C ++'s most vexing parse : without the parentheses , the declaration is taken to be a declaration of a function called t which takes a pointer - to - a- function - with - no - parameters - returning - an - instance - of - SayHello , and which returns a std :: thread object , rather than an object called t of type std :: thread .
There are a few other ways to avoid the problem .
Firstly , you could create a named variable of type SayHello and pass that to the std :: thread constructor :
int main ( ) { SayHello hello ; std :: thread t( hello ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
Alternatively , you could use copy initialization :
int main ( ) { std::thread t=std::thread( SayHello( ) ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
And finally , if you 're using a full C++0 x compiler then you can use the new initialization syntax with braces instead of parentheses :
int main ( ) { std:: thread t{ SayHello( ) } ; t.join ( ) ; }
In this case , this is exactly equivalent to our first example with the double parentheses .
Anyway , enough about initialization .
Whichever option you use , the idea is the same : your function object is copied into internal storage accessible to the new thread , and the new thread invokes your operator ( ) .
Your class can of course have data members and other member functions too , and this is one way of passing data to the thread function : pass it in as a constructor argument and store it as a data member :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > # include < string > class Greeting { std:: string message ; public : explicit Greeting ( std : : string const& message_ ) : message ( message_ ) {} void operator ( ) ( ) const { std :: cout << message << std::endl ; } } ; int main ( ) { std :: thread t( Greeting ( " goodbye " ) ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
In this example , our message is stored as a data member in the class , so when the Greeting instance is copied into the thread the message is copied too , and this example will print " goodbye " rather than " hello " .
This example also demonstrates one way of passing information in to the new thread aside from the function to call — include it as data members of the function object .
If this makes sense in terms of the function object then it 's ideal , otherwise we need an alternate technique .
Passing Arguments to a Thread Function
As we 've just seen , one way to pass arguments in to the thread function is to package them in a class with a function call operator .
Well , there 's no need to write a special class every time ; the standard library provides an easy way to do this in the form of std: : bind .
The std :: bind function template takes a variable number of parameters .
The first is always the function or callable object which needs the parameters , and the remainder are the parameters to pass when calling the function .
The result is a function object that stores copies of the supplied arguments , with a function call operator that invokes the bound function .
We could therefore use this to pass the message to write to our new thread :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > # include < string > # include < functional > void greeting ( std : : string const& message ) { std :: cout << message << std::endl ; } int main ( ) { std :: thread t( std : : bind ( greeting , " hi ! " ) ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
This works well , but we can actually do better than that — we can pass the arguments directly to the std :: thread constructor and they will be copied into the internal storage for the new thread and supplied to the thread function .
We can thus write the preceding example more simply as :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > # include < string > void greeting ( std : : string const& message ) { std :: cout << message << std::endl ; } int main ( ) { std :: thread t( greeting , " hi ! " ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
Not only is this code simpler , it 's also likely to be more efficient as the supplied arguments can be copied directly into the internal storage for the thread rather than first into the object generated by std:: bind , which is then in turn copied into the internal storage for the thread .
Multiple arguments can be supplied just by passing further arguments to the std :: thread constructor :
#include < thread > # include < iostream > void write_sum ( int x , int y ) { std::cout <<x < < " + " < <y < < " = " < <( x+y ) < < std : :endl ; } int main ( ) { std:: thread t( write_sum,123,456 ) ; t.join ( ) ; }
The std :: thread constructor is a variadic template , so it can take any number of arguments up to the compiler 's internal limit , but if you need to pass more than a couple of parameters to your thread function then you might like to rethink your design .
Next time
We 're not done with starting threads just yet — there 's a few more nuances to passing arguments which we have n't covered .
In the third part of this series we 'll look at passing references , and using class member functions as the thread function .

The Financial Services Authority was today considering whether to launch a full - blown investigation into the way Royal Bank of Scotland was run before the taxpayer took control last October , amid allegations of boardroom bullying and a " culture of greed " at the bank .
The fresh controversy , raised by the Labour peer Lord Foulkes and Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable , prompted the loss - making bank 's new management team to plea for a chance to start turning it around rather than focusing on the troubled past .
Both politicians wrote to Lord Turner , the chairman of the FSA , to raise their concerns , which are now being reviewed by the regulator .
Foulkes , whose concerns were first reported in the Observer , has been told that non-executive directors were intimidated to keep quiet about the way RBS was run by Sir Fred Goodwin , who left at the end of January with a £ 703,000 - a- year pension .
Cable published information from a whistleblower about " lifestyle rather than business issues " , which he described as a " culture of greed " .
He called on the chancellor , Alistair Darling , to stop the pension payments to Goodwin .
Cable 's unidentified whistleblower described how :
• The lobby outside Goodwin 's office was decorated with wallpaper costing £ 1,000 a roll .
• £ 5.3 m was spent refurbishing a grade I listed building for his hospitality use .
• £ 100,000 a month was spent on part - time chauffeurs .
• Fruit was flown in from Paris .
Turner made it clear that it was not his job to stop Goodwin 's pension .
He told the BBC : " A misjudgment – whether it be a business misjudgment or whether it be what I think most people think Sir Fred Goodwin has committed , which is a misjudgment in not being willing to give back some of his pension – is not something for the FSA . "
He admitted the FSA would be concerned if non-executives had not been given enough information .
There were suggestions this weekend that the bank was involved in sub - prime lending despite its denials .
Turner said : " There is a duty on the executives to ensure that there are flows of information to non-executives so they are being given the data to perform their function .
If there are issues there , we will look into them . "
Foulkes has written to the FSA to ask it to consider " whether there was any intimidation of non-executive directors who had been asking probing questions which led them to believe they would not be reappointed if they continued to pursue such searching questions " .
RBS insisted it was not aware of any evidence to support Foulkes 's claims :
" It is not an issue that has been raised by any non-executive director past or present with the company or indeed with the FSA . "
The bank added : " If Lord Foulkes has any evidence to support the assertion , it would be in the interests of all parties if he shared it .
The first the company heard of this letter was not from Lord Foulkes but from the Observer newspaper .
" It is critical that the new management of the company is allowed to get on with the job of fixing its problems and returning it to standalone strength .
Only then will we be in a position to repay the support of the taxpayer . "
