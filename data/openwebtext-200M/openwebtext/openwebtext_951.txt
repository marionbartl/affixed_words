Restaurant Anecdotes :
I am English and drink hot tea as opposed to coffee .
My husband and I visited a fast food restaurant in America , and I asked a waitress if they had any hot tea .
Me : " Do you have hot tea ? "
: " Do you have hot tea ? "
Her : " Well , it is not very warm ... but .... "
: " Well , it is not very warm ... but .... "
Me : " No I mean do you have hot water and a tea bag ? "
: " No I mean do you have hot water and a tea bag ? "
Her : " Yes . "
: " Yes . "
Me : " So you can make me hot tea . "
: " So you can make me hot tea . "
Her : " Well I can put a cup of iced tea in the microwave for you . "
: " Well I can put a cup of iced tea in the microwave for you . "
Me : " No , just give me a cup of hot water and a tea bag , and I will make my own . "
: " No , just give me a cup of hot water and a tea bag , and I will make my own . "
Her : " Do you want ice in the cup ? "
Once when I went to McDonald's , I saw on the menu that you could have an order of 6 , 9 or 12 Chicken McNuggets .
I asked for a half dozen nuggets .
" We do n't have half dozen nuggets , " said the teenager at the counter .
" You do n't ? " I replied .
" We only have six , nine , or twelve , " was the reply .
" So I ca n't order a half dozen nuggets , but I can order six ? "
" That 's right . "
So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets .
While ordering Chinese food to be delivered , I asked , as a joke , if the deep fried gizzards were beef or pork .
The lady on the other end had me wait while she looked it up , but could n't find it .
She then asked several other employees , none of whom knew .
I overheard the following conversation at a Friendly 's restaurant :
Girl : " Boy , I 'm really parched . "
: " Boy , I 'm really parched . "
Boy : " Yeah , I 'm full too ! "
A pizza - and - sub takeout recently opened near me .
When I got the menu , I decided that I would try the hamburger sub that was listed , so I called .
Me : " I 'd like to place an order for pickup . "
: " I 'd like to place an order for pickup . "
Him : " Certainly , sir .
What would you like to have ? "
: " Certainly , sir .
What would you like to have ? "
Me : " I 'd like the hamburger sub , please . "
: " I 'd like the hamburger sub , please . "
Him : " Excuse me , the HAMburger sub ? "
: " Excuse me , the HAMburger sub ? "
Me : " Yes . "
: " Yes . "
Him : " I 'm sorry , but we do n't have HAMburger . "
: " I 'm sorry , but we do n't have HAMburger . "
Me : " It 's right here on the menu . "
: " It 's right here on the menu . "
Him : " We do n't have HAMburger . "
This went on a few times , until finally I asked for a cheeseburger sub without the cheese .
He was happy to sell me that .
I used to work at an Arby's .
In the two years I worked there , the dumbest customer by far has been one that apparently never succeeded at first grade math .
Me : " That will be $ 12.69 , please . "
: " That will be $ 12.69 , please . "
Him : " Ok . Here you go . "
He handed me a $ 10 bill .
Thinking that this was just a mistake , that maybe he meant to give me a $ 20 , I said :
Me : " This is a $ 10 bill . "
: " This is a $ 10 bill . "
Him : " Yeah , I know . "
: " Yeah , I know . "
Me : " The total is $ 12.69 . "
: " The total is $ 12.69 . " Him : " I gave you a 10 .
That 's enough . "
: " I gave you a 10 .
That 's enough . "
Me : " I need $ 2.69 more .
The total is $ 12.69 . "
: " I need $ 2.69 more .
The total is $ 12.69 . "
Him : ( annoyed )
" It 's all there !
I gave you a 10 ! "
: ( annoyed )
" It 's all there !
I gave you a 10 ! "
Me : " No . I need $ 2.69 more . "
: " No . I need $ 2.69 more . "
Him : " I gave you a 10 ! "
: " I gave you a 10 ! " Me : " I know .
The total is $ 12.69 !
I need another $ 2.69 ! "
This situation kept on going for a good four or five minutes , when something really wrong happened .
I just had him on the verge of giving me a $ 50 bill , when a manager changed the price to make it less than $ 10 .
After I told the customer that , he said :
Him : " Darn kids do n't know how to do math these days . "
I suppose the moral of the story is act dumb , even if you are n't , and rewards will follow .
One day , this lady brought in an Arby - Q sandwich because she did n't like it and she wanted her money back .
That would be fine if it were n't for the fact that my Arby 's stopped selling those a month ago , and that the sandwich was black and moldy .
It was one of the grossest things I have ever seen in my life .
Me : " I 'd like a small coffee shake and nothing else . "
: " I 'd like a small coffee shake and nothing else . "
Clerk : " Anything else ? "
: " Anything else ? " Me : " Uh ...a cup ? "
This happened at a local fried chicken shack .
Customer : " I 'll have a half dozen chicken nuggets . "
: " I 'll have a half dozen chicken nuggets . "
Waitress : " I 'm sorry , we do n't have a half dozen .
You can only order six , nine , or twelve . "
: " I 'm sorry , we do n't have a half dozen .
You can only order six , nine , or twelve . "
Customer : " Well , ok , I 'll have six then . "
This has happened to me with two different people now .
I had a craving for french fries one day , so I pulled up to the drive - thru of McDonald's .
Me : " I 'd like a large french fries please . "
: " I 'd like a large french fries please . "
Clerk : " Would you like fries with that ? "
I got sort of confused at this one and told him no .
He told me to pull ahead , so I did , and then he asked me why I was sitting there .
Clerk : " I thought you did n't want fries . "
: " I thought you did n't want fries . "
Me : " No , I ordered a large french fries . "
: " No , I ordered a large french fries . "
Clerk : " Ok .
Do you want fries with that ? "
Since saying no the last time had gotten me nothing , I figured I 'd better say yes this time .
He gave me two large fries .
I went to a McDonald 's in New York .
My girlfriend and I did n't know what we wanted ahead of time , but when we got there we saw a sign for a special : " 2 Big Macs , 2 large fries , and 2 drinks for $ 7.99 . "
Me : " Can I have the 2 Big Macs , 2 large fries special ? "
: " Can I have the 2 Big Macs , 2 large fries special ? " Clerk : " Excuse me ? "
: " Excuse me ? " Me : " Can I have the special on the sign up there ? " ( pointing to the sign )
: " Can I have the special on the sign up there ? " ( pointing to the sign ) Clerk : " What special ? "
: " What special ? " Me : " The 2 Big Macs special . "
: " The 2 Big Macs special . "
Clerk : " That 's not a special .
You just order 2 Big Macs and 2 fries and 2 drinks . "
: " That 's not a special .
You just order 2 Big Macs and 2 fries and 2 drinks . "
Me : " Will it cost $ 7.99 ? "
: " Will it cost $ 7.99 ? " Clerk : " I do n't know .
Let me see . "
She rung up the order , and it came to around $ 12 .
Clerk : " That is how much it costs . "
: " That is how much it costs . "
Me : " Then why does the sign say $ 7.99 ? "
: " Then why does the sign say $ 7.99 ? " Clerk : " I do n't know what you are talking about . "
: " I do n't know what you are talking about . "
Me : " The sign up there . " ( pointing to the sign again )
: " The sign up there . " ( pointing to the sign again ) Clerk : " Let me get the manager . "
The manager came over , and I was convinced I would be eating shortly .
Manager : " Can I help you ? "
: " Can I help you ? "
Me : " I just want to order the special that it see on the sign up there . "
: " I just want to order the special that it see on the sign up there . "
Manager : " There is no special at this time . "
: " There is no special at this time . "
Me : " Then why does the sign say there is ? "
: " Then why does the sign say there is ? "
Manager : " I do n't know about that , but you can order two value meals and get the same thing . "
: " I do n't know about that , but you can order two value meals and get the same thing . "
Me : " But that will cost more than $ 7.99 . "
: " But that will cost more than $ 7.99 . "
Manager : " That 's right . "
: " That 's right . "
Me : " But what I want is what is on the sign up there . " ( pointing to the sign again )
The manager read the sign out loud , very slowly .
Manager : " The sign is wrong . "
: " The sign is wrong . "
Me : " Well , if you are the manager , why do n't you take it down ? "
: " Well , if you are the manager , why do n't you take it down ? "
Manager : ( angrily ) " Excuse me ? "
: ( angrily ) " Excuse me ? "
Me : " You are the manager , and you have signs in here that are wrong .
You should take them down . "
: " You are the manager , and you have signs in here that are wrong .
You should take them down . "
Manager : " Sir , why do n't you leave my store . "
: " Sir , why do n't you leave my store . "
Me : " What ? "
: " What ? " Manager : " Leave my store before something happens . "
: " Leave my store before something happens . "
Me : " What is going to happen ? "
: " What is going to happen ? " Manager : " Just get out of here . "
We left , walked about five blocks to the next McDonald's .
I ordered the same special without a problem .
When I was in college , a couple of my friends and I went to a small town restaurant for a bite to eat one evening .
I was in the mood for a ham and cheese omelette .
Looking at the menu , there was a ham omelette listed and a cheese omelette listed , but no combination .
So when the waitress came for the order , I asked about the combination .
Me : " I 'd like a ham AND cheese omelette , please . "
: " I 'd like a ham AND cheese omelette , please . "
Her : " I ... do n't know .
I 'll have to ask the chef . "
: " I ... do n't know .
I 'll have to ask the chef . "
Me : " Uh...ok . "
She left and returned a minute later .
Her : " The chef says he 'll have to put eggs in it to hold it together ! "
: " The chef says he 'll have to put eggs in it to hold it together ! "
Me : ( blank stare ) " ... Well , if he HAS to put eggs in it , that 'll be ok ! "
I used to work at a Subway restaurant , and I found this happening quite often :
Me : " How can I help you ? "
: " How can I help you ? "
Customer : " I 'd like a Club with everything . "
So I start putting cheese on the bread .
Customer : " No cheese . "
: " No cheese . "
Me : " Ok . "
So I start putting vegetables on the bread .
Customer : " No lettuce or pickles . "
: " No lettuce or pickles . "
Me : " Ok . "
: " Ok . " Customer : " No olives . "
: " No olives . "
Me : " Everything , right ? "
: " Everything , right ? " Customer : " Yes . "
: " Yes . " Me : " Everything ? "
: " Everything ? " Customer : " Everything . "
: " Everything . "
Me : " Ok . "
Whenever I go to my local Subway , I find I constantly get either ingredients on my sub I did n't ask for , or a sub missing some ingredients I did ask for .
I 'm not that picky , so one day when I was in a rush I asked for a 6 - inch meat - lovers with everything .
Clerk : " Do you want lettuce ? "
: " Do you want lettuce ? " Me : " Yeah , everything please . "
: " Yeah , everything please . "
Clerk : " Cheese ? "
: " Cheese ? " Me : " Yes , just put everything on it please . "
: " Yes , just put everything on it please . "
Clerk : " Pickles ? "
: " Pickles ? " Me : " Yes , everything , the works , please . "
This went on for every ingredient , getting more annoying with each step , until we reached the salt and pepper .
Clerk : " Salt ? "
: " Salt ? " Me : ( wanting to get going ) " No , that 's ok . "
Salt goes on anyway .
Clerk : " Pepper ? "
: " Pepper ? " Me : " Yeah . "
No pepper .
Finally the sub's rung up , and I rush out of the store .
Half an hour later , start eating the sub and notice there 's no meat on my meat - lover sub .
The scene is a mostly takeout sandwich shop kind of like Subway .
Your order is taken at the counter , and the sandwich is made while you watch .
It is difficult for an order to get messed up unless neither party is paying attention .
While I admit that from time to time I mumble , and , having been raised in the South , my drawl is not understandable by some , I generally have no trouble communicating with the vast majority of people that I speak with .
So you can imagine my surprise and consternation when , one afternoon :
Me : " I 'd like a plain number three , white , end piece preferred , no cheese .
And BBQ chips .
To go . "
: " I 'd like a plain number three , white , end piece preferred , no cheese .

Clerk : ( cutting off a small piece from the roll which is just barely long enough to qualify for a large sandwich , resulting in two pieces of the roll : a small - sized piece and a piece that is only about half as long as the small size although it is the end piece of the original whole roll ) " Hmm . "

Clerk : " What do you mean , plain ?
We do n't have plains . "
Note that , at this point , the other customers at the counter are visibly amused , one even chuckling out loud .
I look at them , and get " What a moron ! " looks from them , so I know it 's not just me .
The other clerks appear curious about why a customer is raising his voice , but they still appear unaware that anything odd is going on .
Me : " I want a LARGE number THREE , absolutely PLAIN .
Can you make one of those for me ? "
: " I want a LARGE number THREE , absolutely PLAIN .

When I get out to the car , my wife and daughter are curious why it took so long .
They are the first to hear the story but not the last .
Jim Carrey has memories of a painful relationship wiped from his brain in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
We may think we are asleep – but deep in the recesses of our mind a “ memory editor ” is working overtime , replaying the experiences of the day and storing the highlights on our brain ’s version of a video recorder , claim scientists .
Researchers have discovered that the mind keeps most memories for just a day but then at night acts like a film editor sifting through the “ video clips ” before transferring the best bits to long term storage in our own movie archive .
The research has “ profound implications ” for the importance of sleep and its link with long term memory , they said .
It could also one day lead to ways of influencing the brain in deciding what are healthy and unhealthy memories to keep , such as in the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .
“ Ours is the first study to demonstrate this link between memory replay and memory consolidation , ” claims Professor Susuma Tonegawa at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , an offshoot of the American university MIT .
“ The sleeping brain must replay experiences like video clips before they are transformed from short - term into long - term memories . ”
Scientists have long suspected that there is a link between sleep and memory and have suggested that it acts like a sort of filing system , enabling the brain to distinguish between important and useless information .
Dreams – which usually occur in light sleep known as Rapid Eye Movement – are thought to be part of the process .
But in memory tests Prof Tonegawa discovered that it was more likely that deep sleep – technically known as slow wave sleep – which played a role .
Prof Tonegawa and his team used experiments in humans and mice to show that memories are first stored in the hippocampus , a sea horse shaped part of the central brain , before being “ replayed ” and then being filed in the outer neocortex , otherwise known as grey matter .
He discovered the link in experiments where volunteers were asked to memorise sets of words and then half of them were allowed to go to sleep immediately afterwards and half were kept awake .
He discovered that those who slept greatly increased their ability to recall the words up to six weeks later .
Then with experiments in mice he was able to establish which parts of the brain were involved in the process .
Using censors in the brain he discovered that the hippocampus and the neocortex remained very active at night and that it appeared that the information was transferred between the two along a circuit known as the “ trisynaptic pathway ” .
Creating a strain of genetically engineered mice in which a change of diet shuts down trisynaptic pathway , scientist followed their brain activity as they found their way around a maze .
While they were still awake and running , neurons in the mice fired in a certain sequence which was then repeated during slow wave sleep suggesting it was “ replaying ” the memory .
By blocking the trisynaptic pathway , scientists found they were also able to block the formation of long term memories .
The animals were able to form long - term memories of the maze only when their trisynaptic pathways were functioning after the formation of the short - term memory .
They concluded that the pathway played a “ crucial role ” in transferring from short to long term memory storage .
In the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , a couple undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories when their relationship turns sour .

TIKRIT , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Iraqi forces backed by U.S. troops have arrested a U.S. - allied Sunni Arab militia leader , Iraqi and U.S. officials said on Sunday .
The U.S. military said Nadhim al - Jubouri , leader of a government - backed local militia and a religious leader in the town of Dhuluiya , 70 km ( 45 miles ) north of Baghdad , and his two brothers were seized from their home on Saturday .
Derrick Cheng , a U.S. military spokesman in northern Iraq , said “ members of the Iraq National Police with coalition advisors arrested three individuals .
Included in the arrest was ... Mullah Nadhim Mahmud Khalil and two brothers .
The National Police presented warrants ... under the charge of terrorism . ”
The mostly Sunni Arab Awakening Councils , local guard units including many former insurgents who switched sides to fight al Qaeda in late 2006 , have been key to cutting violence in Iraq .
As an Awakening leader , Jubouri was a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda in largely Sunni Salahuddin province , where Saddam Hussein ’s hometown is located .
Ahmed Karim , the deputy governor of Salahuddin province , said Jubouri was accused in killings that took place in the largely Shi’ite town of Dujail during the height of Iraq ’s sectarian conflict in 2006 - 2007 .
“ People from Dujail brought charges against Mullah Nadhim for the murder of their relatives , ” Karim said .
He said that at the time the alleged crimes took place , Jubouri was an al Qaeda operative .
Karim ’s account of the charges facing Jubouri could not be immediately confirmed .
Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said Jubouri should be released if he had been detained on an old warrant .
“ This man was with al Qaeda and he entered the political process .
It seems that there was an old warrant that was acted on now , ” he said .
He said the situation was under review .
The Awakening militias were backed and paid by U.S. forces until the Iraqi government took control of them in recent months .
Since then , payment of their salaries has fallen far behind schedule .
Many regard the Shi’ite - led government with suspicion and have been dismayed by salary delays , attacks on guard units , and a spate arrests of guards in recent months .
In late March , Iraqi forces seized Adil al - Mashhadani , head of a patrol unit in central Baghdad ’s Fadhil neighborhood , sparking clashes with his supporters that killed three people .
Several others have been detained .
U.S. and Iraqi officials deny the government is targeting the guards because of their sect or insurgent past , but say those who have committed grave crimes must face justice .
Guards have come under attack , and at least 125 have been killed since October , U.S. officials say .
On Saturday , gunmen opened fire at a guard unit south of Baghdad , wounding one .
To change the bulbs in the 60 - foot - high ceiling lights of Buckingham Palace ’s grand stairwell , workers had to erect scaffolding and cover precious portraits of royal forebears .
So when a lighting designer two years ago proposed installing light emitting diodes or LEDs , an emerging lighting technology , the royal family readily assented .
The new lights , the designer said , would last more than 22 years and enormously reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions  a big plus for Prince Charles , an ardent environmentalist .
Since then , the palace has installed the lighting in chandeliers and on the exterior , where illuminating the entire facade uses less electricity than running an electric teakettle .
In shifting to LED lighting , the palace is part of a small but fast - growing trend that is redefining the century - old conception of lighting , replacing energy - wasting disposable bulbs with efficient fixtures that are often semi-permanent , like those used in plumbing .
Studies suggest that a complete conversion to the lights could decrease carbon dioxide emissions from electric power use for lighting by up to 50 percent in just over 20 years ; in the United States , lighting accounts for about 6 percent of all energy use .
A recent report by McKinsey & Company cited conversion to LED lighting as potentially the most cost effective of a number of simple approaches to tackling global warming using existing technology .
As of today for all US craigslist sites , postings to the “ erotic services ” category will no longer be accepted , and in 7 days the category will be removed .
Also effective today for all US sites , a new category entitled “ adult services ” will be opened for postings by legal adult service providers .
Each posting to this new category will be manually reviewed before appearing on the site , to ensure compliance with craigslist posting guidelines and terms of use .
New postings will cost $ 10 , but once approved , will be eligible for reposting at $ 5 .
Unsurprisingly , but completely contrary to some of the sensationalistic journalism we ’ve seen these past few weeks , the record is clear that use of craigslist classifieds is associated with far lower rates of violent crime than print classifieds , let alone rates of violent crime pertaining to American society as a whole .
The relative safety of craigslist compared to print classifieds is likely due to some combination of :
Measures such as blocking , screening , and telephone verification
Community moderation via our flagging system
Electronic trail ensures violent criminals are quickly caught
Personal safety tips prominently posted
Unusually high level of cooperation with law enforcement
Community moderation as exemplified by our flagging system is arguably the most successful system ever conceived for eliminating inappropriate activity from a massive internet community .
Working in tandem with various other protective technologies , it is an inescapable force to be reckoned with for anyone set on abusing free internet communications across a broad array of posting types .
However , with respect to this new paid category for advertising by legal businesses , we will experiment with some of the methods traditionally employed in paid print classifieds .
We ’d like to thank everyone who has provided helpful input over the past few weeks , all of which was closely considered :
Our users , whose suggestions shape every aspect of craigslist
Attorneys General , who provided valuable constructive criticism
Law Enforcement officers nationwide , hugely supportive as always
Legally compliant businesses wishing to advertise their services
EFF and other experts defending free speech and Internet law
We are optimistic that the new balance struck today will be an acceptable compromise from the perspective of these constituencies , and for the diverse US communities that value and rely upon craigslist .
Note : Our announced intention to contribute 100 % of net revenues for the “ erotic services ” category to charity has been fulfilled , and will continue to be fulfilled , notwithstanding criticism questioning our good faith in this regard .
However , in light of today ’s changes , and to avoid any future misunderstanding , we are making no representation regarding how revenue from the “ adult services ” category will be used .
Our commitment to philanthropy remains , and craigslist will continue to develop its charitable initiatives .

Do-it - yourself reconstruction
MUHAMMAD KHADER places some rugs and blankets amid the ruins of his house .
Sometimes he goes there to rest when the tent he shares with his wife and six of their daughters gets too crowded .
They ran away from their home earlier this year when it was hit by a missile during Israel 's war in the Gaza Strip , and fled to their only married daughter 's house in Jabaliya , a Palestinian refugee camp originally built for villagers fleeing in 1948 from what is now Israel .
The daughter did not have enough blankets or mattresses for everyone but the neighbours helped out .
As soon as the Israeli troops pulled out of Gaza in mid-to - late January the Khader family went home — to find a pile of rubble .
Even their chicken pen had been bulldozed .
It had been their sole source of income since Mr Khader , along with thousands of other Gazan men , lost his permit to work in Israel after the second Palestinian intifada ( uprising ) started in 2000 .
Now he sits amid the debris and gazes at the green tents with Rotary International logos which an Arab charity has pitched on a muddy , desolate field on Jabaliya 's eastern edge .
Before the war , olive and citrus trees grew there .
“ We used to work in Israel , ” he says , lighting another cigarette .
“ We worked for them , built their houses .
And now look what they 've done to us . ”
Mr Khader is one of tens of thousands of Palestinians who became homeless in the recent Gaza war .
UN agencies estimate that 4,100 houses were destroyed and 15,000 - plus damaged ; 50,000 - odd people sought refuge in UN schools during the fighting .
Most went home after the truce or found other places to live .
But thousands are still huddling in tents in makeshift refugee camps .
A mining bulldozer noisily clears away the ruins on the fringe of Jabaliya but there is virtually no reconstruction anywhere in Gaza .
At an international donors ' conference in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el - Sheikh in March , $ 4.5 billion was pledged for reconstruction .
But three months after the ceasefire , repair work has yet to begin .
Israel is still enforcing the sanctions it imposed on Gaza after the Palestinian Islamist movement , Hamas , took over the strip in June 2007 , violently ousting its secular rival , Fatah .
The Israelis still refuse to let in most imports except food and vital medicine .
They still bar building material such as concrete , steel and pipes , as well as industrial equipment .
They say they fear that Hamas and other militant groups would use them to build bunkers or weapons , such as the home - made rockets they still sometimes fire at nearby Israeli towns .
Supplies for repairing the water and sewage system and the electricity networks damaged during the war are also stuck at the border terminals .
A good 90 % of the people suffer from power cuts ; the rest have no electricity at all .
While 32,000 people in a population of 1.5 m have no running water , 100,000 or so get water once in every two or three days .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , which looks after Palestinian refugees across the Middle East , says that the rate of infectious diseases , including diarrhoea and viral hepatitis , which result from bad water and sanitation , has risen .
Commercial petrol and diesel fuel have not been let into Gaza since November , but the tunnels under the Egyptian border , which were a main target of Israel 's bombs , were rapidly repaired ; smuggling is flourishing again .
The Palestinian association for petrol - station owners says that 100,000 litres of diesel and 70,000 of petrol enter Gaza every day via the tunnels .
The canned broad beans which Mr Khader 's wife heats on a kerosene stove come from Egypt too .
“ Beans , beans , ” sighs her husband .
“ How many beans can you eat ? ”
It has been months since the family ate meat .
The pitta bread they are given by an Islamic charity is their staple .
Several of their girls are anaemic .
“ The doctor told me to give them better food , ” says Mrs Khader , wiping tears off her face .
“ But what can I do ?
I cry every day . ”
In the next - door tent , bitterness against Hamas is brewing .
Many Gazans do not accept the party 's official view that the war was a great victory .
Instead , many now blame Hamas for recklessly dragging them into a futile war that devastated their already beleaguered territory .
“ Where is Ismail Haniyeh ? ” cries a Gazan , referring to Hamas 's prime minister .
“ Why has n't he come here to see how we live ?
I lost my home .
Why ?
For Hamas to succeed !
It has destroyed Gaza .
That 's a fact . ”
Now Jabaliya 's homeless people seem to pin their hopes on a Palestinian unity government .
If it were formed , they say Israel would be forced to lift its siege .
But the rival parties have yet to make a reconciliation agreement stick , after nearly two years of fierce division .
Israel 's new government continues to link the ending of the blockade not only to the removal of Hamas as Gaza 's government but also to the release of Gilad Shalit , an abducted Israeli soldier who has spent nearly three years in captivity in Gaza .
The new government sounds even less likely than the previous one to make the concessions , including the freeing of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners , that might clinch a deal .
A Palestinian painter in Jabaliya has painted a mural of Corporal Shalit as a young man next to images of how he would look , grey and grizzled , after another 30 years in captivity .
“ If I saw Shalit , ” says a Jabaliya resident , “ I would just tell him to go back home to his country ! ”
Until the border is open to trade and materials , it will be impossible to rebuild Gaza — or give its people a life approaching normality .
“ It makes you wonder what those donors ' pledges were worth ” , says an UNRWA man in Gaza City .

If you want pictures of the Dickinson snow , here are a couple of pictures sent from a viewer of mine .
They reported 1.5 ″ as these pictures were being taken .
The one with the lilac blooming ( at right in photo above ) is interesting because most years the lilac have finished blooming three weeks ago , but the spring has been so cold in this area that most phenological events are running about 2 - 3 weeks behind schedule .

Jun 6 2009 2:49 PM KXNewsTeam
BISMARCK , N.D. ( AP ) Snow has fallen in Dickinson in June , the first time in nearly 60 years the city has seen snow past May .
National Weather Service meteorologist Janine Vining in Bismarck says there were unofficial reports of a couple of inches of snow in Dickinson on Saturday .
Vining says snow in North Dakota in June is uncommon , though it ’s not unheard of .
She says other parts of the state have seen June snow within the past 10 years .
Williston and Bismarck had received only rain as of mid-Saturday , but Vining said snow was possible in those cities later in the day .
But wait there ’s more snowy June weather worldwide :

John Authers ' recent interview with University of Chicago professor Richard Thaler is a fine example of what I hope are broader trends in economic thought .
To some , it might seem like just another interview .
But Authers undoubtedly recognizes its significance .
Thaler is a professor at the University of Chicago , which is the birth place of the Efficient Market Hypothesis , and Authers is a well - respected columnist for the Financial Times , which is arguably the voice of the free market in the press .
And yet , there they are , casting doubt upon the very theories underpinning a generation of thought that have made the University of Chicago the epicenter of free market ideology .
In the language of soda - pop - economics , this interview is a " black swan . "
It seems Authers is leaning ever closer towards a world view informed by behavioral economics .
While I have n't done any empirical research into Authers ' work , I do read his column , The Short View , religiously ( personally , I recommend you do the same ) .
And as the recent downturn developed , I noticed several articles that suggest he 's come to question at least some of the assumptions underlying the old free market dogmas , particularly the Efficient Market Hypothesis .
In my opinion , this is a welcomed development .
And I sincerely hope it is part of a broader trend away from grandiose theories about how humans make decisions and towards precise theories which are supported by real - world observations .
Those that have toiled through my writing in the past know that I am a big fan of free markets .
Yet , I am not a big fan of the EMH .
And in general , I find a lot of economic theory , particularly macroeconomic theory , to be little more than hand - waving .
There 's an almost priestly air about it that makes me deeply suspicious of its validity .
In gentler terms , Economics lacks a rigorous epistemological theory .
That is , economists have no robust system of determining which statements about economics are true , and which are not .
This is in stark contrast to say , mathematics .
A statement about an alleged mathematical truth is verifiable ( putting Gödel and Turing aside for the moment ) .
If you tell me that you have discovered a new mathematical truth , you can sit down and in a finite number of words , provide a logical path from assumptions we both agree are true to your new found conclusions that I must accept as true , else I reject either the assumptions or logic itself .
Now , I understand that economics can never be a purely deductive sport , since it is complicated by the nuance and uncertainty of , well , reality .
But that does n't mean we can't do better than simply assuming away all of human ridiculousness .
The economics that assumes rational behavior on the part of humanity is , in my opinion , dead .
It is simply at odds with everyday experience .
It 's arguable that the desire for wealth is itself an inherently irrational impulse for most of the developed world , given that our needs would likely be satisfied on public assistance .
That said , those who are able to control their behavior and act rationally do a much better job at generating and accumulating wealth .
But once they get the money , they go and do something absurd with it , like buy a fleet of planes .
So while reason and deferred consumption might be the means by which we accumulate wealth , the end goal of accumulating wealth seems to be driven by a need to express dominance , or at least an antisocial impulse to be free of society 's constraints .
This view finds support in popular culture , which often equates wealth with conspicuous consumption sexuality , and control .
All of this suggests that somewhere buried under all of those pinstripes is a real brute .
If I am correct , and there is a sea change taking place in how economists view human behavior and the markets humans create , then there may be a lot of quackery in the short term .
That is , during the intellectual power vacuum that will follow the demise of the old Chicago School , a few crackpots might temporarily seize power as we trace our way from the four humors to phlogiston .
But when we finally get our Lavoisier , this time let 's remember to keep his head on , despite our penchant for the irrational .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

PESHAWAR , Pakistan  Militants opened fire on security guards and rushed a small truck packed with explosives through the gates of a five - star hotel in this northwestern city on Tuesday , detonating the payload in the parking lot and killing at least 11 people and wounding 55 , Pakistani officials said .
The blast , powerful enough to leave a crater 6 feet deep and 15 feet wide , collapsed the western wing of the hotel , the Pearl Continental , one of the few in the city that cater to Western visitors .
Pakistani television broadcast images of wounded people , panicked and dazed with blood - soaked clothes , being helped out of the smoke - filled lobby .
The hotel ’s registry was swollen at the time of the attack , which occurred about 10 p.m. local time , with officials working for United Nations agencies and other aid groups tending to the large refugee population that has been displaced by the recent fighting in Pakistan between the Pakistani Army and Taliban insurgents .
One of the dead was a Russian employee of an international aid organization according to a police official at the scene .
Although the tremendous size and rate of growth of the human population now influences virtually every aspect of society , rarely does the public debate , or even consider , the question of what would be an optimum number of human beings to live on Earth at any given time .
While there are many possible optima depending on criteria and conditions , there is a solid scientific basis for determining the bounds of possibilities .
All optima must lie between the minimum viable population size , MVP ( Gilpin and Soule , 1986 ; Soule , 1987 ) and the biophysical carrying capacity of the planet ( Daily and Ehrlich , 1992 ) .
At the lower end , 50 to 100 people in each of several groups , for a total of about 500 , would constitute an MVP .
At the upper end , the present population of 5.5 billion , with its resource consumption patterns and technologies , has clearly exceeded the capacity of Earth to sustain it .
This is evident in the continuous depletion and dispersion of a one - time inheritance of essential , non-substitutable resources that now maintains the human enterprise ( e.g. Ehrlich and Ehrlich , 1991 ; Daily and Ehrlich , 1992 ) .
Numerous claims have been made that Earth 's carrying capacity is much higher than today 's population size .
A few years ago , for example , a group of Catholic bishops , misinterpreting a thought exercise by Roger Revelle ( 1976 ) , asserted that Earth could feed 40 billion people ( Ehrlich and Ehrlich , 1990 ) ; various social scientists have made estimates running as high as 150 billion ( Livi - Bacci , 1989 ) .
These assertions are based on preposterous assumptions , and we do not deal further with them here .
Nonetheless , we are left with the problem of determining an optimum within wide bounds .
Above the minimum viable level and within biophysical constraints , the problem becomes a matter of social preference .
Community level , national , and international discussions of such social preferences are critical because achieving any target size requires establishing social policies to influence fertility rates .
Human population sizes have never , and will never , automatically equilibrate at some level .
There is no feedback mechanism that will lead to perfectly maintained , identical crude birth and death rates .
Since prehistoric times , societies have controlled fertility and mortality rates to a substantial degree , through various cultural practices ( Harris and Ross , 1987 ) .
In the future , societies will need to continue manipulating vital rates to reach desired demographic targets .
Most important , societies must reach a rough consensus on what those targets should be as soon as possible because the momentum behind the growth of the present population ensures at least a doubling before any decline is possible ( UNFPA 1992 ) .
This paper is a contribution to that necessary dialogue .
What follows is a brief statement of our joint personal views of the criteria by which an optimum should be determined ( in no particular order ) .
1 . An optimum population size is not the same as the maximum number of people that could be packed onto Earth at one time , nurtured , as they would have to be , by methods analogous to those used to raise battery chickens .
Rather , almost everyone who puts value on human life appreciates the importance of quality of life .
Obviously , many more human beings could exist if a sustainable population were maintained for thousands to millions of years than if the present population overshoot were to destroy much of Earth 's capacity to support future generations .
2 . An optimum population size should be small enough to make it possible to provide the minimal physical ingredients of a decent life to everyone ( e.g. , Ehrlich et al. , 1993 ) , given both the inequitable distribution of wealth and resources and uncertainty regarding rates of long - term , sustainable resource extraction and environmental impacts .
We agree with Nathan Keyfitz ( 1991 ) : " If we have one point of empirically backed knowledge , it is that bad policies are widespread and persistent .
Social science has to take account of them . "
The grossly inequitable distribution of wealth and basic resources prevailing today is highly destabilizing and disruptive .
While it is in nearly everyone 's selfish best interest to narrow the rich - poor gap , we are skeptical that the incentives driving social and economic inequalities can ever be fully overcome .
We therefore think a global optimum should be determined with humanity 's characteristic myopia and selfishness in mind .
A further downward adjustment in the optimum should be made to insure against both natural and human - induced declines in the sustainable flow of resources from the environment into the economy and increases in anthropogenic flows of wastes , broadly defined , in the opposite direction .
3. Basic human rights in the social sphere ( such as freedom from racism , sexism , religious persecution , and gross economic inequity ) should be secure from problems generated by the existence of too many people .
Everyone should have access to education , health care , sanitary living conditions , and economic opportunities ; but these fundamental rights are difficult to assure in large populations , especially rapidly growing ones .
Political rights are also related to population size , although this is seldom recognized ( Parsons , 1977 ) .
Democracy seems to work best when populations are small relative to resource bases ; personal freedom tends to be restricted in situations of high population density and / or scarce resources .
4 . We think an optimum population size should be large enough to sustain viable populations in geographically dispersed parts of the world to preserve and foster cultural diversity .
It is by no means obvious that the dominant and spreading " Western " culture has all the secrets of long - term survival ( Ehrlich , 1980 ) – to say nothing of cornering the market on other values .
We believe that cultural diversity is an important feature of our species in and of itself .
Unfortunately , many cultures borne by small groups of people are in danger of being swamped by the dominant culture with its advanced technologies and seductive media , or worse , of being destroyed deliberately because of social intolerance or conflicts over resources .
5 . An optimum population size would be sufficiently large to support a " critical mass " in each of a variety of densely populated areas where intellectual , artistic , and technological creativity would be stimulated .
While creativity can also be sparked in sparsely populated areas , many cultural endeavors require a level of specialization , communication , and financial support that is facilitated by the social infrastructure characteristic of cities .
6 . An optimum population size would also be small enough to ensure the viability of biodiversity .
This criterion is motivated by both selfish and ethical considerations .
Humanity derives many important direct benefits from other species , including aesthetic and recreational pleasure , many pharmaceuticals , and the basis and health of agriculture .
Furthermore , the human enterprise is supported in myriad ways by the free services provided by healthy natural ecosystems , each of which has elements of biodiversity as key working parts ( Ehrlich and Ehrlich , 1992 ) .
Morally , as the dominant species on the planet , we feel Homo sapiens should foster the continued existence of its only known living companions in the universe .
In general , we would choose a population size that maximizes very broad environmental and social options for individuals .
For example , the population of the United States should be small enough to permit the availability of large tracts of wilderness for hikers and hermits , yet large enough to create vibrant cities that can support complex artistic , educational , and other cultural endeavors that lift the human spirit .
Innumerable complexities are buried in this short list of personal preferences , of course .
But with the world 's population size now above any conceivable optimum and ( barring catastrophe ) destined to get much larger still ( UNFPA 1992 ) , it appears that many decades are available in which to debate alternative optima before even stopping growth of the population , much less approaching an optimum .
During that time , human technologies and goals will both change , and those changes could shift the optimum considerably .
It is nonetheless instructive to make a tentative , back - of - the - envelope calculation of an optimum on the basis of present and foreseeable consumption patterns and technologies .
Since the human population is in no imminent danger of extinction due to underpopulation , we focus here on the upper bound of an optimum .
We begin by using humanity 's energy consumption as a rough , indirect measure of the total impact civilization inflicts on Earth 's life - support systems ( Ehrlich and Ehrlich , 1991 ) .
Energy , especially that provided by fossil fuel and biomass combustion , directly causes or underpins most of the global environmentally damaging activities that are recognized today : air and water pollution , acid precipitation , land degradation , emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , and production of hazardous materials and wastes .
At present , world energy use amounts to about 13 terawatts ( TW ; 1012 watts ) , about 70 percent of which is being used to support somewhat over a billion people in rich countries and 30 percent to support more than four billion people in developing countries .
This pattern is clearly unsustainable , not only because of the gross disparity between rich and poor societies , but because of the environmental damage that results .
The consumption of 13 TW of energy with current technologies is leading not only to the serious environmental impacts indicated above but also to several forms of destabilizing global change , including a continuous deterioration of ecosystems and the essential services they render to civilization ( Ehrlich and Ehrlich , 1991 ; Ehrlich et al. , 1993 ) .
An examination of probable future trends leads to dismal conclusions .
The world population is projected to increase from 5.5 billion in 1993 to somewhere between 10 and 14 billion within the next century .
Suppose population growth halted at 14 billion and everyone were satisfied with a per-capita energy use of 7.5 kilowatts ( kW ) , the average in rich nations and about two thirds of that in the United States in the early 1990s .
A human enterprise that large would create a total impact of 105 TW , eight times that of today and a clear recipe for ecological collapse .
A scheme for avoiding such an ecocatastrophe over the next century was proposed by John Holdren of the Energy and Resources Group at the University of California , Berkeley .
The Holdren scenario ( Holdren , 1991 ) postulates expansion of the human population to only 10 billion and a reduction of average per-capita energy use by people in industrialized nations from 7.5 to 3 kilowatts ( kW ) , while increasing that of the developing nations from 1 to 3 kW .
The scenario would require , among other things , that citizens of the United States cut their average use of energy from almost 12 kW to 3 kW .
That reduction could be achieved with energy efficiency technologies now in hand and with an improvement ( by most people 's standards ) in the standard of living .
While convergence on an average consumption of 3 kW of energy by 10 billion people would close the rich - poor gap , it would still result in a total energy consumption of 30 TW , more than twice that of today .
Whether the human enterprise can be sustained even temporarily on such a scale without devastating ecological consequences is unclear , as Holdren recognizes .
But the Holdren scenario says very little about the technologies involved , which will inevitably change in the future as reserves of fossil fuels , especially petroleum , are depleted .
Perhaps through careful application of more benign technologies ( such as various forms of solar power and biomass - derived energy ) , the rate of environmental deterioration could be held to that of today .
We must hope so , for the Holdren scenario is perhaps the most optimistic one yet put forth by a careful , competent analyst .
Against that background , what might be said about the upper limits on an optimum population size , considering present attitudes and technologies ?
In view of the environmental impacts of a civilization using 13 TW today , to say nothing of the threats to the future prospects of humanity , it is difficult to visualize a sustainable population that used more than 9 TW .
One might postulate that , with careful choices of energy sources and technologies , and with a stationary population , 9 TW might be used without degrading environmental systems and dispersing non-renewable resources any more rapidly than they could be substituted for .
Under similar assumptions , a 6 - TW world would provide a 50 percent margin for error , something we deem essential considering the unexpected consequences that often attend even very benign - appearing technological developments ( the invention and use of chlorofluorocarbons being the most instructive case to date ) .
A more conservative optimum would be based on a 4.5 - TW world , giving a 100 percent margin for error .
Which upper limit one wished to choose would depend in part on some sort of average social risk aversion combined with a scientific assessment of the soundness of the 9 TW maximum impact .
In the real world , the maximum sustainable population might well be determined in the course of impact reduction – by discovering the scale of the human enterprise at which ecosystems and resources seemed to be holding their own .
For our thought experiment , let us consider a 6 - TW world .
If we assume a convergence of all societies on 3 kW per capita consumption , that would imply an optimum population size of 2 billion people , roughly the number of human beings alive in 1930 .
Such a number seems at first glance to be reasonable and well above the minimum number required to take advantage of both social and technical economies of scale .
In the first half of the twentieth century , there were many great cities , giant industrial operations , and thriving arts and letters .
A great diversity of cultures existed , and members of many of them were not in contact with industrializing cultures .
Large tracts of wilderness remained in many parts of the world .
A world with 1.5 billion people using 4.5 TW of energy seems equally plausible and would carry a larger margin of safety .
This is about the same number of people as existed at the turn of the century .
To summarize this brief essay , determination of an " optimum " world population size involves social decisions about the lifestyles to be lived and the distribution of those lifestyles among individuals in the population .
To us it seems reasonable to assume that , until cultures and technologies change radically , the optimum size of the human population lies in the vicinity of 1.5 to 2 billion people .
That number also is our approximate best guess of the continuous standing crop of people , if achieved reasonably soon , that would permit the maximum number of Homo sapiens to live in the long run .
But suppose we have underestimated the optimum and it actually is 4 billion ?
Since the present population is over 5.5 billion and growing rapidly , the initial policy implications of our conclusions are still clear .

The warp drive , one of Star Trek 's hallmarkinventions , could someday become science instead of science fiction .
Some physicists say the faster - than - lighttravel technology may one day enable humans to jet between stars forweekend getaways .
Clearly it wo n't be an easy task .
The science is complex , butnot strictly impossible , according to someresearchers studying how to make it happen .
The trick seems to be to find someother means of propulsion besides rockets , which would never be able to acceleratea ship to velocities faster than that of light , the fundamental speed limit setby Einstein 's General Relativity .
Luckily for us , this speed limit only applieswithin space - time ( the continuum of three dimensions of space plus one of timethat we live in ) .
While any given object can't travel faster than light speedwithin space - time , theory holds , perhaps space - time itself could travel .
" The idea is that you take a chunkof space - time and move it , " said Marc Millis , former head of NASA 'sBreakthrough Propulsion Physics Project .
" The vehicle inside that bubblethinks that it 's not moving at all .
It 's the space - time that 's moving . "
Already happened ?
One reason this idea seems credible is thatscientists think it may already have happened .
Some models suggest thatspace - time expanded at a rate faster than light speed during a period of rapidinflation shortly after the Big Bang .
" Ifit could do it for the Big Bang , why not for our space drives ? " Millissaid .
To make the technique feasible , scientistswill have to think of some creative new means of propulsion to move space - timerather than a spaceship .
According to General Relativity , anyconcentration of mass or energy warps space - time around it ( by this reasoning , gravity is simply the curvature of space - time that causes smaller masses tofall inward toward larger masses ) .
So perhaps some unique geometry of mass orexotic form of energy can manipulate a bubble of space - time so that it movesfaster than light - speed , and carries any objects within it along for the ride .
" If we find some way to alter theproperties of space - time in an imbalanced fashion , so behind the spacecraftit 's doing one thing and in front of it it 's doing something else , will thenspace - time push on the craft and move it ? "
Millis said .
This idea wasfirst proposed in 1994 by physicist Miguel Alcubierre .
In the lab
Already some studies have claimed to findpossible signatures of moving space - time .
For example , scientists rotatedsuper - cold rings in a lab .
They found that still gyroscopes placed above therings seem to think they themselves are rotating simply because of the presenceof the spinning rings beneath .
The researchers postulated that the ultra - coldrings were somehow dragging space - time , and the gyroscope was detecting theeffect .
Other studies found that the region betweentwo parallel uncharged metal plates seems to have less energy than thesurrounding space .
Scientists have termed this a kind of " negativeenergy , " which might be just the thing needed to move space - time .
The catch is that massive amounts of thisnegative energy would probably be required to warp space - time enough totransport a bubble faster than light speed .
Huge breakthroughs will be needednot just in propulsion but in energy .
Some experts think harnessing themysterious force called dark energy — thought to power the acceleration ofthe universe 's expansion — could provide the key .
Even though it's a far cry between thesepreliminary lab results and actual warp drives , some physicists are optimistic .
" We still do n't even know if thosethings are possible or impossible , but at least we 've progressed far enough towhere there are things that we can actually research to chip away at theunknowns , " Millis told SPACE.com .
" Even if they turn out to beimpossible , by asking these questions , we 're likely to discover things that otherwise we might overlook . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After touring the wreckage Tuesday of two Metro transit trains that crashed the day before , killing nine , Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said it was a sight that " no one should have to see . "
Investigators work Tuesday at the site of a Metro train crash in Washington .

Officials said that all the wreckage has been cleared and that no other bodies have been found in what was the worst subway train accident in the history of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority .
Three bodies discovered Tuesday were lodged behind the driver 's compartment of the rear train , an official said at the scene .
The driver of that train , who was among the dead , was Jeanice McMillan , 42 , of Springfield , Virginia , Metro spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said .
McMillan had worked at Metro since January 2007 .
McMillan 's aunt , Venice Foster , said her niece loved her job and " was just a joy to be around . "
Retired Maj. Gen. David F. Wherley Jr. , former commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard , and his wife , Ann , also were killed in the collision .
Both were 62 .
Names of the other casualties were released by authorities Tuesday afternoon : Mary Doolittle , 59 ; Lavanda King , 23 ; Veronica Dubose , 26 ; Cameron Williams , 36 ; and Dennis Hawkins , 64 , all of Washington ; and Ana Fernandez , 40 , of Hyattsville , Maryland .
Watch what officials know about the crash »
The Metro's board approved a $ 250,000 hardship fund to assist the victims ' families with funerals and other immediate expenses .
According to Fenty , at least three bodies were trapped in a " very compressed area . "
It was n't clear whether those were the bodies found behind the operator 's station .
" It just brings home what an awful tragedy this was , " the mayor said .
The crash occurred along the Red Line just before 5 p.m. Monday on an above - ground track in the District of Columbia near Takoma Park , Maryland .
See location of crash »
Both cars were on the same track , traveling in the same direction : southward from the Fort Totten Metrorail station to the Shady Grove station .
The train in front had stopped behind another train undergoing service and awaited directions to move ahead .
" We do n't know at this point whether the operator could see the train in front of her in time to stop , " said Deborah Hersman , who is leading the investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board .
The weather at the time of the crash was good , she said .
See pictures of crash site »
" I did have the opportunity to walk the track with our investigators .
I can tell you it is a scene of real devastation , " Hersman said .
Jamie Jiao was sitting in the front car of the second train .
He said he suffered injuries to his feet and back .
" I see the train in front a split second before we crashed .
That 's all .
You do n't have time to react or do anything , " he told CNN 's Jeanne Meserve .
He said that after impact , " You just hear really loud noises , as if there was an explosion .
I could see things falling apart , tearing apart . "
A pole fell on top of him , but he was able to throw it off .
The car broke open , and he crawled outside , where he waited for firefighters .
He said he did n't notice whether the driver tried to brake before hitting the other train .
Many of the passengers in his car were injured , he said .
" I'm lucky to be alive , " Jiao said .
" My injuries are n't too bad . "

Hersman said there was a telescoping effect when the second car slammed into the first and landed atop it .
" The first car [ of the second train ] overrode the rear car [ of the front train ] , and much of the survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised , " she said .
One of the factors the NTSB will examine is the crash - worthiness of the cars .
" The safety board has long been on record making recommendations about survivability when accidents do happen to make sure that operators and passengers are protected as much as possible , " Hersman said , but those have n't been implemented .
She did n't elaborate .
The safety board has called since 2006 for the transit authority to modernize its fleet of transit cars .
The agency has sought more safety features and higher technology , such as data boxes on each car that can provide valuable information in case of a crash , Hersman said .
Citing the most recent federal data , she said the average age of the cars in the fleet was 19.3 years old .
The lead train in the crash contained 5000 - Series and 3000 - Series cars , which are newer and have better technology than the cars in the rear train , with 1000 - Series cars .
Watch woman say she , fellow passengers " went flying " »
The Metro board is " aggressively seeking " to replace 300 1000 - Series cars purchased between 1974 and 1978 , said Jim Graham , chairman of Metro 's board of directors .
There should be nine data recorders aboard the first train , which will aid the investigation a great deal if they are n't damaged , Hersman said .
The recorders provide data on such things as speed , braking and emergency applications .
She said there were no recorders on the rear train .
" We 've recommended for years that WMATA either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet .
They have not been able to do that .
And our recommendation was not addressed , so it has been closed in an unacceptable status , " she said .
" If there are changes we can make to those cars , we will do so , " said John Catoe Jr. , general manager of the transit authority .
Fenty said 76 people were injured , and two remained in critical condition Tuesday .
The condition of another critical patient was upgraded .
Two of the injured were emergency responders , Washington Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said .

All trains were to operate in manual , instead of automatic , mode Tuesday , Catoe said at the briefing .
He called the move " an extra safety precaution " until there is more information on the crash .
The rear train was operating on " automatic " mode , which is routine during rush hour , and preliminary evidence shows that the driver may have employed the brakes , Hersman said .
Hersman addressed reports that the trains may have been two months past due on brake inspections , saying , " We are very interested in looking at those records , and we 're interested in looking at all of the records . "
She said cell phone and texting records would also be reviewed , which is standard .
" We 've investigated a number of accidents where there were distractions , " she said , adding that it 's unknown whether cell phone use was a factor in this crash .
Nine safety board teams will examine aspects such as train operations and communications , signals , tracks , crash - worthiness of equipment , maintenance and survivability -- ease of fleeing the trains after the crash and other survivability factors , Hersman said .
The transit authority gave Red Line riders several options for commuting Tuesday morning and was providing free shuttle buses to drive people around the accident scene .
The only other time in Metrorail 's 33 - year history that there were customer fatalities was in January 1982 , when three people died as a result of a derailment between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian Metrorail stations .
In 2004 , two trains collided at the Woodley Park / Zoo-Adams Morgan Metrorail station .
There were minor injuries .

The following article appeared in " Scripta Mathematica " September , 1932 .
( Disclaimer )
The text was scanned , OCRed , checked and presented here .
HOWEVER , the process is imperfect , and for serious work , the original should be used .
ON the 19th of October a little group of mathematicians gathered in the Burt Laboratories in Pasadena , California , around a mysterious machine to watch it attack a problem in mathematics .
It was a simple enough problem to state .
It had only to find two numbers which when multiplied together would give 5,283,065,753,709,209 .
Any person with a few hundred years of leisure time on his hands could work it out .
" Here we step out into the unknown ! " said the young inventor as he threw the switch and set whirling a complicated mass of gears .
It was of no use for the human eye to try to make anything out of the rapidly rotating wheels .
One might as well try to identify the teeth on a buzz - saw .
Besides it was quite unnecessary , for a fixed , unwinking eye was turned on the machine waiting for a ray of light to slip through certain holes in the wheels , which should be the signal for it to stop the motion and to gather in the solution of the baffling problem in the theory of numbers .
" Rapid calculation , all right , " went on the inventor .
" It has to try out in a certain formula about ten million numbers .
Each number would take a man at least six minutes to examine , which comes to sixty million minutes , or about a million hours .
A man could not work at this sort of thing more than ten hours a day , so that gives a hundred thousand days .
One could do it in three hundred years if he did not get stale . "
" How fast is the machine working on this list of ten million numbers ? " some one asked .
" About a hundred thousand a minute , " replied the young man .
" It may take an hour and a half to clean up the problem .
With a larger driving motor we could make it in twenty minutes .
The electric eye would catch it if it were going five times as fast . "
Suddenly , click !
The power was shut off .
" It must have seen something . "
The machine was turned slowly back till a tell - tale beam of light appeared through the little hole before which the electric eye had been watching .
Then some reading of dials and a little grinding of a computing machine and two numbers were found such that the square of one of them plus seven times the square of the other were equal to the number under examination .
" Once more to the window , fair Rebecca ! " and the eye was once more fixed on the tiny hole through which the ray of light must come , and the wheels were again set in motion .
This time twenty - five minutes passed before anything was reported by the faithful watcher at the window .
Had the fair Rebecca grown weary and fallen asleep ?
One of the mathematicians at least , the father of the young inventor , was in something of a state of nerves .
But Rebecca was on the job .
She had seen a light and had stopped the whirling wheels .
Again the tell - tale ray of light was located and again the number 5,283,065,753,709,209 was given as a square plus seven times another square .
The machine had done its duty .
These two results were all that was necessary .
A few minutes computation still remained , and thus it was , while coffee was being served on one of the working tables in the laboratory the big number was broken up into the factors 59,957 and 88,114,244,437 .
These are the two hidden numbers which when multiplied together will give the sixteen digit number under examination .
It may seem to the man in the street an odd thing to get excited about , but on this occasion All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry ,
And even the ranks of Tuscany
Could scarce forbear to cheer .
And after all we had taken only an important outwork in the assault upon a real fortress .
This victory had merely cleared the decks for action against another and much larger number which was under grave suspicion of being a prime ; that is , not the product of any two smaller numbers .
This number is the great unconquered factor of 295 +
1 . It is the nineteen digit number 3,011,347,479,614,249,131 .
A very powerful test invented some three hundred years ago by a French jurist , Fermat , had failed to show the character of this number ; whether it was prime or composite .
A - more delicate test discovered some five years ago by the inventor of this machine must be applied to it ; but this test demanded the knowledge of the factors of the sixteen digit number which the machine had just been ?
examining .
Now that this job was finished the advance on the main citadel was easy - and in a few more minutes of work the big nineteen digit number was branded for all time as a prime ; one of the vast undivided and indivisible sums of the first magnitude .
We are apt to stand aghast at the numbers which appear in the study of astronomy .
The use of the " light - year " as a yardstick strikes one with a certain awe .
This amounts to taking a distance of nearly 6,000,000,000,000 miles as the unit for the measurement of astronomical distances ; and in some of his calculations which have to do with extra-galactic systems the astronomer has to apply this little measuring rod thousands of times .
These vast distances and these vast numbers stagger the imagination , and yet the mathematician reaches out with his high - powered machines and his high - powered theorems and investigates the internal structure of his distant bodies much as the astronomer inquires into the structure of some distant star .
If we con- sider his numbers as expressed in terms of the astronomer 's light - year ; and use his six trillions as our unit we shall find the vast numbers which are the playthings of the astronomer are only as inches to light - years .
What measuring rod shall we use to describe the largest known prime
170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303,715,884,105,727 ?
A light - year of light - years would have to be applied a light - year of times to reach this remote star .
For over fifty years this number has stood on the outposts of the number system , a challenge to explorers in this field of thought .
By a theorem proved as long ago as Euclid 's day , we know that there are infinitely many primes beyond this monster .
Who shall be the first to discover them and identify them ?
The machine in Pasadena is the first attempt to apply the magic of the photo - electric cell to this problem of the study of remote numbers .
Some five years ago a crude machine was constructed of bicycle sprocket - wheels with chains of different lengths running over them .
The sprocket - wheels were mounted solidly on a rotating shaft , and on certain of the links of the chains pins were fastened , which when they ran over the highest point would lift a spring and break for an instant an electrical contact .
When all of the pins were in a line at the top all the contacts would be broken and the machine would stop .
This machine , crude as it was , and capable of only a few hundred revolutions a minute gave , after running two hours , the decom - position of the curious number 9,999,000,099,990,001 into the two factors 1,676,321 and 5,964,848,081 .
The method was seen to be a powerful one and a more delicate machine was planned which should be more dependable in its action and capable of higher speeds .
With the generous cooperation of the Carnegie Institution of Washington the device was carried to perfection in spite of many difficulties .
The sprocket - wheels and chains have been replaced by steel gears of different radii meshing into cogs of other gears solidly mounted on a heavy steel shaft .
The pins with their uncertain contacts have been replaced by a ray of light which slips through holes in the gears .
For a given problem some of these holes will be opened and some closed .
When there is an alignment of open holes ( which event signalizes a solution ) a ray of light slips through them and falls for the ten - thousandth part of a second on the sensitive eye of a photo - electric cell .
This infinitesimal impulse is sent by the cell to an amplifier which magnifies it 729,000,000 times .
This magnified impulse is strong enough to throw off the current which drives the machine and the whirling wheels come to a standstill .
The number of revolutions is then read off on a counting device and the solution is in hand .
Simple as the scheme is there were many unforeseen difficulties that threatened to wreck it altogether .
The ray of light was so feeble an impulse to start with , and the length of time it had to speak to the photo - cell in passing was so short that every detail of the construction had to be very delicately adjusted .
Moreover the amplifier is so sensitive to outside disturbances that a slight jar , an infinitesimal variation in the electric current , the turning off of an electric appliance or even a hasty word from an attendant would send it off into a temperamental fit .
The amplifier was placed in another room separated from the whirling gears by a heavy brick wall , and was enclosed in a coffin of celotex .
This made things go a little better , but it was still subject to what seemed a perfectly unpredictable series of " jitters " .
It would run happily and sweetly for a few minutes and then suddenly become incoherent .
Then it would as suddenly pull itself together again and behave in an entirely rational manner for another quarter of an hour before having another tantrum .
And all without any appreciable change in the environment !
Doctors were called in , but nothing could be inferred from the symptoms .
To be sure it was asking a good deal of a machine to work steadily with a magnification of over seven hundred million to one 1
It was like trying to write a smooth flowing hand with a pen ten thousand miles long , while all the time some mischievous imp was jogging at your elbow .
And what was the imp , and how to lay hands on him ?
Days of futile adjustments and readjustments went by .
There seemed to be nothing organically wrong ; just a case of nerves .
Nevertheless it was an interesting and important case and the young doctor in charge was unwilling to give the patient up .
At last it occurred to him to use a stethoscope .
He installed a loud speaker and " listened in " .
Instantly the hiding place of the " imp " was discovered .
There was a short - wave radio fan operating in a station in the immediate neighborhood .
So long as he was quiet all went well .
When he came on the air the amplifier went into a spasm ; the electric eye saw red .
There was no accounting for tastes and if the machine wanted to be temperamental on the subject of radio there was nothing to be done about it except to screen the amplifier from this interesting but undesirable disturbance , or to find a time when the radio operator was not playing with his machine .
One could hope , of course , that the congruence machine had been giving him as much trouble as he had been sending out .
At any rate , till the rival machine could be located , and some sort of truce patched up there was nothing to be done but to wait till the ether was quiet before asking the machine any important arithmetical questions .
On the 9th of October , just after the discovery of the " imp " the machine was set to do some real work in the theory of numbers .
There was a large factor of 293 + 1 , namely the number 1,537,228,672,093;301,419 which was known by a very powerful test to be composite , but the test would not furnish the factors .
The smallest factor was known also to be larger than 300,000 , and might be large enough to occupy the time of a skilled computer for over twenty - five years to find it .
The machine was " set " to grope for the factors of this number .
The amplifier woke up and threw off the power after only a few seconds of work , and it was thought , of course , that the " imp " was on the air again .
On examination , however , it was found that the electric eye had been on the alert , and had really seen something .
The immense " binary " was decomposed into the product of the two prime factors 529,510,939 and 2,903,110,321 .
The work of a quarter of a century had been done in less than a quarter of a minute .
It was as if some watcher of the heavens had turned his instrument upon some star two million light - years distant , and had determined not only that it was a binary , but should give the exact weight of each of the component stars .
But the astronomer is handicapped by the Einstein assumption that there is no higher velocity than the velocity of light .
He would have to content himself with the fact that he is in this case some two million years behind the times .
He is investigating what the star was like two million years ago .
What it is like now , who can say ?
A million years is a long time and the sun might have smashed into some other sun in the meantime and spread itself out into a spiral nebula .
Fortunately the mathematician deals with velocities greater than the speed of light .
His news from his remote suns is up to the minute .
" Simultaneity " is for him a real thing and not a matter for definition in terms of the velocity of light .
Down the infinite vistas of his number system he goes with the speed of thought .
His star - catalogue is complete as far as the first ten million numbers .
Beyond this " solar system " his instruments can readily examine individual stars up to two billion .
Beyond that , in certain particular regions of the heavens , he can reach out and lay his investigating hand on certain clusters .
It is fitting that at last the slow moving ray of light should come to his aid .
Other galaxies may now come under his scrutiny .
It may come as a surprise to many that the most compelling urge to the study of mathematics is not its practical application to the study of every day , bread - and - butter life , but lies in the romance and glamor surrounding its mysterious secrets .
Romance and glamor in connection with mathematics seems absurd on the face of it .
One recalls Macaulay 's letter as a student to his mother .
" I can scarcely bear to write on mathematics or mathematicians .
Oh , for words to express my abomination of that science , if a name sacred to the useful and embellishing arts may be applied to the perception and recollection of certain properties in numbers and figures !
Oh , that I had to learn astrology , or demonology , or school divinity ; oh , that I were to pore over Thomas Aquinas , and adjust the relation of Entity and the Two Predicaments , so that I were exempted from this miserable study ! "
Such are the outbursts of a youthful mind impatient at being made to walk carefully along the slippery path that leads to the mountain peak whence may be had some vision of this universe of wonder and mystery and beauty .
To young Macaulay mathematics was only a cross - word puzzle constructed for his mystification by his ingenious but misguided tutor .
But what shall we say of the problems which this arithmetical machine is constructed to cope with ?
Who set these problems ?
Who hid the factors of these vast numbers so cunningly ?
Behold , here is a number which has been waiting for me ( since when ? ) to discover its secret composition !
For me it has been reserved to find the answer to this riddle which has baffled the minds of men for centuries .
What is a North Pole or a South Pole , or a darkest Africa compared with this unexplored country ?
And think what it has all come from !
Here is a pure creation of the mind ; this system of numbers ; invented for the mere merchant , the trader , the man of business .
It lends its aid willingly and effectively to the solution of the practical problems of every day life .
It is merely a creation of the mind of man ; surely he can bend it to his creative will .
But it has sprung full armed from his forehead , and boast as he may that .
he is the measure of all things he finds himself in the presence of a Sphinx whose secrets he is helpless to discover .
Of some of the problems he can say , " I have found the answer to them ; " of others he must say , " I have not solved them yet ; " of still others he must say ; " They can not be solved . "
Cross - word puzzles ?

He gives nothing up without a struggle ; " but He is never dishonest . "
It will come as a shock also to some to be told that there is , so far as can be seen now , absolutely no " practical application " expected to develop out of this astonishing machine upon which so much thought and care has been expended .
There is a cowardly and slinking sort of a scientist , no doubt , who is ashamed or afraid to take a walk in the country with the avowed purpose of enjoying the landscape .
He must provide himself with a fishing rod or a collecting basket of some sort , so that if any one asks him why he is abroad he will be able to point to some " practical application " for his stroll in the hills .
He is , no doubt , merely trying to avoid the odium that seems to have attached itself to the poet or to the musician who is hard put to it to produce a healthy , bread - and - butter reason for making a sonnet or a symphony .
To listen to the apologists for the study of pure mathematics one would get the impression that this study is sustained , not by the Wonder and Beauty of the subject , but by its external utilities .
But how little of the vast field of mathematics has to do with the study of the outside world !
The theory of differential equations stretches far beyond its application to bridges and universes .
Modern mathematics is of more importance in its philosophical than .
in its physical implications .
The same thing may be said even for the modern study of physics .
The subtle and expensive determinations of the bending of a ray of light by a gravitational field , or the careful listing of the binary stars in the heavens , can have little application to the making of two squashes grow where only one grew before .
Faraday , playing with wires in his laboratory , wrests from the hands of nature a torch that Edison uses to light the world , and Einstein to light the universe .
Who can tell ?
Perhaps in some far distant century they may say , " Strange that those ingenious investigators into the secrets of the number system had so little conception of the fundamental discoveries that would later develop from them ! "

When the Smiths of Missouri – an all - American family with the regulation two blond children – posed for their Christmas photo , little did they know they would end up on a billboard thousands of miles away in the Czech Republic .
Just under a fortnight ago , a family friend of Jeff and Danielle Smith was travelling in Prague when he spotted some familiar faces beaming out of a poster advertising a grocery store 's home delivery service .
He took a photograph and emailed it to his friends in St Louis – kindly translating the caption that promises " we will prepare and deliver your requests in two business days " .
The picture was indeed of the admirably white - toothed Smiths and their two smiling children .
Danielle had been so proud of the image taken by a photographer friend , Gina Kelly , that she had not only sent it out as a Christmas card to family and friends , but also posted it on her blog and other social networking sites , including Momlogic where she identifies her children as " sweet and sassy Delaney " and " loveable and crazy Cooper " .
Danielle has expressed her surprise at the news of their international fame : " Interesting .
Bizarre .
Flattering , I suppose .
But quite creepy . "
The shop owner was equally shocked .
Mario Bertuccio , who runs the Grazie store in Prague , said he found the image on the internet and thought it was computer - generated .
He has promised to remove it and email an apology to the Smiths – and said if they lived nearer he would send them " a bottle of good wine " .
In her blog on the Extraordinary Mommy site , Smith reflects : " So this is the price we pay for indulging in social media , I guess . "
She had no idea the image could be used , she said , and would not have given her permission , but admits she was naive in putting up a high - resolution version on the website .
She wo n't be doing that again – but said she would continue to post images of her family .
The smiley Smiths have now gone global .
The site has registered 180,000 hits but Danielle writes that she is blocking the small percentage " who are commenting only to say that a member of my family ( or all of us ) are ugly " .
Google said the outage lasted for about an hour Google apologised for what it called a " traffic jam " that resulted in slow service or even interruption on the internet search giant 's main page .
Gmail and Google 's news site were also reported as " sluggish " or unavailable to millions of users for about an hour .
This is not the first time the company has faced such problems .
" An error in one of our systems caused us to direct some of our traffic through Asia , " said Urs Hoelzle , a spokesman for the company .
" As a result , about 14 % of our users experienced slow services or even interruptions , " he said .
" We 've been working hard to make our services ultrafast and ' always on ' , so it 's especially embarrassing when a glitch like this one happens .
" We 're very sorry that it happened , and you can be sure that we 'll be working even harder to make sure that a similar problem wo n't happen again , " said Mr Hoelzle , Google 's senior vice president of operations .
Sympathy
The outage has called into question the reliability of web - based services .
Google 's " efforts to have some of their services , in particular their apps , and to a less extent Gmail , treated as serious business services that one can use instead of locally installed and maintained apps could be seriously undermined by a major outage like that , " said Ezra Gottheil , an analyst with Technology Business Research .
Early reports claimed a denial of service attack was to blame " This is bad news for Google 's efforts to build up Apps , and to a less extent , Gmail , as critical business tools .
If the mighty Google can stumble , then who can be trusted ? "
Mr Gottheil told Computerworld.com
Other industry watchers say the interruption might cause businesses to reconsider using these services .
" Maybe companies that are thinking about a cloud strategy - such as Google Apps - need to look into backup clouds " said Sam Diaz , a senior editor at technology news site ZDNet .
On the microblogging service Twitter the service failure became a major topic of discussion .
" Funny how something we lived without for the longest time is suddenly something we can't live without , " tweeted simonnet .
While k_sasha tweeted " Sympathies to the Google servers .
Happens to everyone .
But this is why the world needs more than one search engine . "
Napolebsis posted " The Google outage endorses my recent decision to move some services back to offline apps . "
This is not the first time that Google has had technical problems .
In February 2009 , Google 's Gmail service experienced a breakdown leaving millions of people worldwide without access to the free web - based e-mail service for a few hours .
In January , the internet company was hit by technical problems resulting in users being unable to access search results .

LOS ANGELES / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - California ’s controller said on Wednesday that he would have to issue IOUs in a week if lawmakers can’t quickly solve a $ 24 billion budget deficit , and the state ’s treasurer plans to tap a reserve fund to meet debt service costs .
The skyline of downtown Los Angeles is pictured at sunset in this March 3 , 2009 file photo .

The measures came as a budget crisis deepened in the most populous U.S. state and the gridlocked legislature failed to pass a proposed $ 11 billion in cuts .
“ Next Wednesday we start a fiscal year with a massively unbalanced spending plan and a cash shortfall not seen since the Great Depression , ” Controller John Chiang said in a statement announcing that he would be forced to use IOUs to pay the state ’s bills beginning on July 2 .
“ The state ’s $ 2.8 billion cash shortage in July grows to $ 6.5 billion in September and after that we see a double digit freefall , ” Chiang said .
“ Unfortunately , the state ’s inability to balance its checkbook will now mean short - changing taxpayers , local governments and small businesses . ”
State Treasurer Bill Lockyer , meanwhile , is planning to draw on reserves for economic recovery sales tax bonds , according to a spokesman .
Rating agency Standard & Poor ’s warned it may downgrade the bonds , given the problems California is likely to face in replenishing its emergency funds .
The state is expecting to file a material event notice on Thursday to alert bondholders to the move that comes in response to plunging sales tax receipts , said spokesman Tom Dresslar .
“ The senior coverage account will be drawn on and debt service on all economic recovery bonds will be paid in full on July 1 , ” Dresslar said .
California has been in crisis since the housing slump and credit crunch caused a severe decline in revenues .
The state has seen its unemployment rate climb steadily to 11.5 percent in May from 6.8 percent a year earlier , according to labor department data .
LAWMAKERS REJECT CUTS
The government dipped into the same reserve fund in December to make a principal payment on economic recovery bonds , but was able to top the reserve back up within days .
The California Legislature on Wednesday voted down $ 11 billion in proposed cuts to state services , sending members seeking a budget deal back to the drawing board .
The vote failed largely along party lines in both houses , with the Republicans saying it falls short of the savings needed and amounted to posturing by Democrats .
Standard & Poor ’s said it will review its economic recovery bond , or ERB ratings “ after further evaluation of state projections as to the size and timing of potential draws on the ERBs ’ reserves . ”
The bonds , which were approved by voters in 2004 to help the state through another fiscal crisis , are secured by a sales tax and a general obligation pledge of the state .
California has about $ 8.6 billion of the bonds outstanding , although some have credit support and will not be affected by any rating change , S&P analyst David Hitchcock said .
S&P rates the bonds at A - plus , or fifth - highest investment grade and six notches above speculative , or “ junk ” status .
That ’s one notch above the A rating assigned to California ’s $ 57 billion of general obligation debt , the lowest rating of any U.S. state .
S&P has the GO debt on alert for a downgrade .
Moody ’s also has the state on review and has warned of a potential multi- notch downgrade .
Draws on debt service reserve funds are rare and will likely make waves in the bond market , said Dick Larkin , director of credit analysis at the Iselin , New Jersey , office of broker Herbert J. Sims & Co .
“ I am not aware of a situation where an issuer has drawn on a debt reserve for sales tax bonds , ” he said in emailed comments .
“ I am also not aware of a situation where a unit needed to draw on a formal debt reserve fund to pay normal debt service on general obligation bonds , ” he said .
Larkin said the latest developments reflect the strain on California ’s cash flow and may signal a situation that leads to a temporary disruption of normal debt service payments .
“ In the end , though , I still believe that California debt holders would be paid in full , even if there is a temporary disruption because of this financial crisis , ” he said .

Since the dawn of civilization ( and probably even before that ) men have been hitting on women , which means the oldest form of communication is the pickup line .
“ In fact , some men are still using those lines from 10,000 B.C. , ” says sex and relationship educator Reid Mihalko , creator of the popular Cuddle Parties and an expert on intimacy .
( Cuddle parties originated in New York city and quickly spread nationally .
Couples attend in pajamas and learn to cuddle – without sex .
It is designed for women to show their men how to be intimate .
For real ! )
Over the years , women have told Reid the worst , most painful and ineffective pick - up lines men have tried .
He shared 12 of the absolute worst with RadarOnline.com , and issued this warning : “ Buckle up .
Some of these are pretty bad . ”
Counting down to the worst :
12 . “ You must be Jamaican , because Jamaican me crazy . ”
( Listen up guys , aside from being politically incorrect , women tend not to like puns .
Especially really , really bad ones like this .
But if we even have to explain that … )
11 . “ Can I take your picture ?
Because I want Santa to know exactly what I want for Christmas . ”
( We really should n’t have to explain what ’s wrong , but here we go anyway : not only does this destroy the wholesome concept of Santa Claus — which will automatically put most women off — it turns the potential date into a potential possession .
That ’s a no - no . )
10 . “ Can I borrow your cell ?
I promised to text my mother when I fell in love . ”
( Hey a pickup line with technology !
Oops , you used the L word and seem like a momma ’s boy . )
9 . “ Is your daddy a thief ?
Because he stole some diamonds and put them in your sparkling eyes . ”
( As charming as the second half of this pickup line tries to be , you do n’t insult a girl ’s daddy .
Ever . )
8 . “ If I said you had a beautiful body , would you hold it against me ? ”
( This is a classic of the bad - joke kind .
If a woman has n’t heard it , it may take a few seconds to register .
That will give you time to duck the drink she ’ll be throwing . )
7 . “ I ’m new in town .
Can I have directions to your house ? ”
( Red flag , red flag !
Girls do n’t respond well to stalkers . )
6 . “ I may not be the best looking guy here , but I ’m the only one talking to you . ”
( In theory , self - deprecation is disarming .
But suggesting to a girl that no one else is interested in her is obviously not a smart move . )
And now , we hit a new level of tackiness for the Final Five :
5 . “ My name is ( fill in the blank ) .
Remember it : you ’ll be screaming it later . ”
( Suggesting that you ’re macho is bad , but implying that you and the girl will be hooking up is beyond bad . )
4 . “ I ’m a bird watcher , and I ’m looking for a Big Breasted Bed Thrasher .
Have you seen one ? ”
( No , seriously .
Some guys have used this !
Sexism is the worst of this line ’s sins , but even changing the name of the bird to something less offensive wo n’t help .
No one is going to believe you ’re a bird watcher , and a lie is a terrible way to make a connection . )
3 . “ You might as well go home with me because I ’m going to tell everybody you did anyway . ”
( Blackmail ?
Not a good approach in the adult world .
In fact , if the girl has any moxie , gal - pals , or male wingmen with her , you might not have a functioning mouth in the morning . )
2 . “ Say , is your dress felt ?
Would you like it to be ? ”
( Stalking and blackmail are bad , but suggesting that you get in a lady ’s space right then and there is arguably worse . )
And speaking of worse :
1 . “ That dress looks good on you but it would look better on my bedroom floor tomorrow morning . ”
( This one pretty much speaks for itself ! )

The G20 summit has ended in a global deal to boost world growth .
Is it the beginning of a new world economic order ?
At first glance , there is less than meets the eye in the G20 communiqué .
There was no co-ordinated economic stimulus plan , and the extra $ 500 bn pledged to the IMF will come with too many strings attached to boost the world economy .
And regulation , although global in principle , will still be applied by national regulators who may take different approaches .
Any help to poor countries was limited in scope , and there seems little prospect of a global trade deal that could lift their prospects in the long term .
New consensus
But there are hints , in the rhetoric and in substantive measures , that a new way of running the world economy may be emerging from the G20 process .
President Barack Obama said as much when he acknowledged that the ' Washington consensus ' of unfettered globalisation and deregulation was now outmoded , and called for a more balanced approach to regulating markets rather than letting them run free .
NEW FUNDING PLEDGES $ 500bn for the IMF to lend to struggling economies $ 250 bn to boost world trade $ 250bn for a new IMF " overdraft facility " countries can draw on $ 100bn that international development banks can lend to poorest countries IMF will raise $ 6bn from selling gold reserves to increase lending for the poorest countries Source : BBC
G20 leaders ' statement Global markets rise on G20 deal Historic IMF changes Q&A : The G20's $ 1tn deal First Lady moved by school visit Mixed reactions to G20 outcome
And it is the shift in the US position , which was previously the strongest opponent of international regulation , that has opened the way for a much broader attempt to regulate the financial sector .
These go far beyond banks ' capital requirements to include the global regulation of hedge funds , tax havens and executive pay - something that would have been unthinkable before the crisis broke .
And in the new Financial Stability Board , which will now incorporate all G20 members , there is the potential for a powerful new global financial regulator .
Even more significant is the increased power given to the international financial institutions , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , who have been subcontracted by the G20 to monitor and run many of their policies .
IMF managing director Dominique Strauss Kahn was jubilant after the meeting , saying that the IMF " is now truly back . "
The IMF 's image had been tarnished during the Asian financial crisis and , until the current crisis came to a head , there had been fears that the organisation was losing its relevance .
Mr Strauss - Kahn was particularly enthusiastic about the plan for the IMF to issue $ 250 bn worth of its own currency , the SDR , saying this was the first step on the IMF issuing its own liquity as well as being a lender of last resort - the two key functions of a world central bank .
The IMF will also be made more representative , with China and India getting a bigger say , and its top job opened to all comers , not just Europeans , in the future .
Further meetings
But perhaps most significantly , the G20 decided to continue to meet regularly to monitor progress on dealing with the global economic crisis - with the next meeting scheduled for later this year .
Mr Strauss
Kahn said that he believed that the G20 was shaping up as the board of governors for the world economy , and said he favoured an even bigger grouping to give more representation to poor countries .
It may be that after the crisis is over , the G20 disbands as a group .
But given the belief by governments on both sides of the Atlantic that global cooperation is now essential for economic growth , the likelihood is that it will carry on and attempt to strengthen its role .
With fits and starts , the world may be moving to a recognition that as the economy has become global , the power of governments can only be effective if they too become more international in scope .

The New York Times has an article up , “ A Prom Divided ” about the continuing tradition of racially segregated proms .
Here ’s a snippet :
Racially segregated proms have been held in Montgomery County — where about two - thirds of the population is white — almost every year since its schools were integrated in 1971 .
Such proms are , by many accounts , longstanding traditions in towns across the rural South , though in recent years a number of communities have successfully pushed for change .
When the actor Morgan Freeman offered to pay for last year ’s first - of - its - kind integrated prom at Charleston High School in Mississippi , his home state , the idea was quickly embraced by students — and rejected by a group of white parents , who held a competing “ private ” prom .
( The effort is the subject of a documentary , “ Prom Night in Mississippi , ” which will be shown on HBO in July . )
Stem cell researchers in New York can now use public money to pay women who give their eggs for research , a decision that has opened new possibilities for science but raised concern among some bioethicists and opponents of such research .
The decision by the Empire State Stem Cell Board , announced two weeks ago , is believed by the board to be the first in the country allowing state research money to be used for this purpose .
The board agreed that women can receive up to $ 10,000 for donating eggs , a painful and sometimes risky process .
Until now , researchers have relied on unused embryos from in vitro fertilization , as well as reprogrammed skin cells , for their work .
Eggs , which offer other avenues for research , have proved more difficult to obtain .
Proponents say compensating women for their eggs is necessary for research , and point out that women who give their eggs for fertility purposes are already paid .
Others worry that the practice will commodify the human body and lead to the exploitation of women in financial need .

This is something I wrote for Memorial Day 2005 and I run it every year :
Soldiers are not chunks of identical clay ; each of them has a story , their own reasons for being caught in a war .
Brave ?
Maybe - sometimes , under some conditions .
Scared , mostly .
The younger they are , the more likely their presence had to do with restlessness , cockiness .
The need to be part of a winning team , the desire to even a score .
Kick ass , take names .
Kill them all , let God sort them out .
The older they are , the more realistic they are .
This was a steady paycheck , or a way to supplement the one they already had .
When they join , it 's with their eyes on the future benefit .
When they 're in the middle of a war , they think only of surviving the next five minutes .
Please , God , please .
Let me see my family again .
And when they die in the war , each death leaves a hole in the world .
It 's important to remember that , to not see them as a monolithic casualty list or as an acceptable loss .
No loss is acceptable .
Ask the parents , the spouses , the children .
They try .
They tell themselves stories of nobility , sacrifice , a greater cause .
They cover it up with the ritual rhetoric .
But deep down , they must wonder .
Here is how to count the cost :
In high school graduation pictures that will never be replaced with wedding pictures .
In wedding rings that will never be worn smooth by years .
By the daughters who will walk down the aisle with an uncle or brother instead of Dad .
By the sons who will find themselves angry and lost , not understanding why .
The children who will hear about their mother 's eyes , their father 's chin but wo n't ever see themselves reflected in that face .
By the parents who now understand the quiet obscenity of outliving their own children .
Each and every one of these deaths left a hole in the world .
That is why we count them .
They mattered .
Scientifically , this tiny arachnid goes by the name of Theridion grallator – but it takes little imagination to see how it got its more popular name : the happy - face spider .
Found only in rainforests in the Hawaiian islands , the spiders have a vast range of patterns and colours on their abdomens – yet all come from the same species .
The amazing diversity is due to genetic variations , although the patterns may also change depending on diet .
Spider View : Scientists think the happy - face spider has evolved its patterns to confuse predators
The patterns may have developed as a way of confusing predators .
The moment it takes an aggressor to work out whether the spider is prey or not provides a vital chance of escape .
However , the species , which was discovered in 1973 , is now under threat from the introduction of non-native animals to the islands .
The most common form – or ‘ morph ’ – is plain yellow and has no smile .
But other variations are plentiful – the ‘ red front ’ morph pictured here with a cluster of her eggs is the second - most common .
Happy Arachnids : Some of the patterns found in the species
The spiders are 5 mm ( less than a quarter of an inch ) long and live alone on the underside of leaves – except during their mating season and for the first 40 to 100 days of spiderlings ’ lives , when they are still too young to fend for themselves .
The group created an elaborate network to launder the money
Two former Bank of China managers and their wives have been given lengthy jail sentences in the United States for stealing $ 485 m ( £ 320 m ) .
Xu Choafan , Xu Guojun , Kuang Wan Fang and Yu Ying
Yi had also been convicted of passport fraud and of laundering the money through banks and casinos .
The Las Vegas court also ordered the four to pay back $ 482 m .
Prosecutors said the convictions showed foreign nationals could not " live off their ill - gotten gains in the US " .
Xu Chaofan and Xu Guojun were sentenced to 25 and 22 years respectively while their wives Kuang Wan Fang and Yu Ying Yi to eight years each .
The charges against the four included monetary transactions with stolen money , transportation of stolen money , passport fraud and visa fraud .
The court heard how , beginning in 1991 , the men had masterminded an elaborate scheme to embezzle hundreds of thousands of dollars over a 13 - year period .
They laundered the money through false corporations and personal accounts in Hong Kong , Canada and the US , where they intended to emigrate .
Prosecutors said the group had carried out " a significant number of transactions " at Las Vegas casinos , including placing bets of up to $ 80,000 .
They had also obtained false identities and entered into sham marriages with US citizens to enable them to settle in the country , said federal officials .
They were eventually arrested in 2004 and were found guilty in August 2008 .
Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer thanked federal agents and prosecutors for their " tireless effort " in uncovering the conspiracy .
" We will hold fully accountable those foreign nationals who abuse the financial systems of their home countries and who then , by fraudulent means , seek to live richly off their ill - gotten gains in the United States , " he said .
A third manager , Yu Zhengdong , had pleaded guilty and cooperated with investigators .
He was later jailed in China .
Amanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls and solo fame is definitely a self - promoter .
But what sets her apart and makes her efforts effective is that she seemingly does it effortlessly .
By letting the world into her life via blog posts , Twitter , web casts , etc and doing it with playful and rebellious tone , she has made herself worth paying attention to and supporting .
The music 's not half bad either .
Palmer has been very vocal about wanting out of her label deal with Warner Music Group 's Roadrunner , and why should n't she since she 's her own marketing juggernaut and has even figured out how to make money doing it .
Here , from her blog , is how she made $ 19,000 in 10 hours by connecting with her fans on Twitter .
UPDATE : Video of Amanda on the Friday Freaks phenomenon .
i twitter whenever i’m online , i love the way it gives me a direct line of communication with my fans and friends .
i had already seen the power of twitter while touring …
1. FRIDAY NIGHT LOSERS T - SHIRT , $ 11,000 about a month ago , i was at home on a friday night ( loser that i often am when i’m not touring , i almost never go out ) and was , of course , on my mac , shifting between emails , links and occasionally doing some dishes and packing for a trip the next day .
just a usual friday - night - rock - star - multi - tasking extravaganza .
this story has just been blowing people ’s minds so i figures i should write it down .
using twitter i’d gathered crowds of sometimes 200 fans with a DAY ’S notice to come out and meet me in public spaces ( parks , mostly ) where i would play ukulele , sign , hug , take pictures , eat cake , and generally hang out and connect .
this was especially helpful in the cities where we ’d been unable to book all - ages gigs and there were crushed teenagers who were really grateful to have a shot at connecting with me & the community of amanda / dolls fans .
i ’d also been using twitter to organize ACTUAL last - minute gigs … i twittered a secret gig in LA one morning and about 350 folks showed up 5 hours later at a warehouse space …. i played piano , filmed by current.tv , and then ( different camera crew ) did an interview with afterellen.com .
the important thing to understand here is that the fans were never part of the plan .. , i basically just INVITED my fans to a press day , the press didnt ’ plan it …i did .
i was going to be playing in an empty room and doing q&a with afterellen on a coach with only the camera watching .
it was like …. why not tell people and do this in a warehouse instead of a hotel lobby or a blank studio ?
so i did .
it cost me almost nothing .
the fans were psyched .
but back to the bigger , cooler story … .
so there i am , alone on friday night and i make a joke on twitter ( which goes out to whichever of my 30,000 followers are online ) :
“ i hereby call THE LOSERS OF FRIDAY NIGHT ON THEIR COMPUTERS to ORDER , motherfucker . ”
9:15 PM May 15th from web
one thing led to another , and the next thing you know there were thousands of us and we ’d become the # 1 topic trend on twitter .
zoe keating described it as a “ virtual flash mob ” .
the way twitter works ( if you do n’t have it ) is that certain topics can include a hashtag ( # ) and if a gazillion people start making posts that include that hashtag , the topic will zoom up the charts of what people are currently discussing .
it ’s a cool feature .
so anyway , there we were , virtually hanging out on twitter on a friday night .
very pleased with ourselves for being such a large group , and cracking jokes .
how do you “ hang out ” on the internet ?
well , we collectively came up with a list of things that the government should do for us ( free government - issued sweatpants , pizza and ponies , no tax on coffee ) , AND created a t- shirt .
thank god my web guy sean was awake and being a loser with me on friday night because he throw up the webpage WHILE we were having our twitter party and people started ordering the shirts – that i designed in SHARPIE in realtime ) and a slogan that someone suggested : “ DON ’T STAND UP FOR WHAT’S RIGHT , STAY IN FOR WHAT’S WRONG ” .
neil gaiman and wil wheaton joined our party .
the fdnas felt super - special .
by the end of the night , we ’d sold 200 shirts off the quickie site ( paypal only ) that sean had set up .
i blogged the whole story the next day and in total , in the matter of a few days , we sold over 400 shirts , for $ 25/ea .
we ended up grossing OVER $ 11,000 on the shirts .
my assistant beth had the shirts printed up ASAP and mailed them from her apartment .
total made on twitter in two hours = $ 11,000 .
total made from my huge - ass ben-folds produced - major - label solo album this year = $ 0
2. WEBCAST AUCTION , $ 6000
a few nights after that , i blogged and twittered , announcing a “ webcast auction ” from my apartment .
it went from 6 pm – 9 pm , my assitant beth sat at my side and kept her eyes on incoming bids and twitter feed .
while we hocked weird goods , i sang songs and answered questions from fans .
we wore kimonos and drank wine .
it was a blast .
people on twitter who were tuned in re-tweeted to other fans .
the word spread that it was a fun place to be and watch .
we had , at peak , about 2000 people watching the webcast .
at the suggestion of a fan early in the webcastm anyone could , on demand , send us $ 20 via paypal and we would chew ,
sign and mail them a postcard .
we sold about 70 , and we read all those names at the end of the webcast and thanked those
people for supporting us .

3. TWITTER DONATION - ONLY GIG , $ 1800
a few days later , i twittered a guest - list only event in a recording studio in boston , to take place a week later .
the gig lasted about 5 hours , all told , with soundcheck and signing .
i took mostly requests and we had a grand old time .
first come , first served .

i asked for donations and made about $ 2200 in cash .
i gave $ 400 back to the studio for the space and the help .

total made at last - minute secret twitter gig , in about 5 hours = $ 2000
major - label record blah blah blah = $ 0
….. and for fun , and to thank my fans for being awesome , i’ve been doing some twitter perfomance art , including answering their questions by magic - markering my body until it ’s covered , and displaying time - lapse make - up application advice ….
but that ’s another story .
TOTAL MADE THIS MONTH USING TWITTER = $ 19,000
TOTAL MADE FROM 30,000 RECORD SALES = ABSOLUTELY NOTHING .
turn on , tune in , get dropped !!!!!

Financial troubles are an ever more common reality as the economic climate continues to venture through the monsoon season , and not - for - profit organizations are no exception .
Such appears to be the case for the GNOME Foundation , the forces behind the venerable GNOME desktop , as the organization 's 2009 budget is finalized and thoughts — and worries — turn to 2010 .
Corporate sponsorship — an increasingly difficult creature to find — appears to have been the traditional financial staple for GNOME , paying for the foundation 's projects and programs as well as providing salaries for its small number of staffers .
According to John Palmieri , Board Treasurer , the foundation is fine for 2009 , but is " projecting that without a significant influx of steady contributions " it will face a significant shortfall in 2010 .
From Palmieri's comments , the culprit appears to be the above - mentioned vanishing corporate contributions , though Foundation Executive Director Stormy Peters has reportedly been able to secure new sponsors , at least for 2009 .
Ms. Peters , though a long - time GNOME fixture , is a relative newcomer as Executive Director , having been appointed to the position less than a year ago .
It would appear to be her position — likely the greatest personnel - related expense for the foundation — that is most in jeopardy , as a shortfall in the 2010 budget would present a choice between retaining Ms. Peters and cutting project funding , a regrettable position for any group to find themselves in .
Palmieri describes the prospect of losing the so recently gained Executive Director as a " real tragedy , " saying that Ms. Peter 's efforts at " kicking our butts " to obtain financing , finish existing projects , and begin new ones are " remarkable in themselves , and even more so in the current climate . "
On the prospect of losing her , he says quite succinctly : " [ W ] ithout her the Foundation will be less effective in its mission . "
Efforts are underway to prevent such a shortfall , and there is ample time to turn the projections around , if supporters turn out in force .
In January , the foundation launched a new Friends of GNOME program allowing individuals to make recurring donations at a $ 10 per month " Adopt A Hacker " level , as well as the option to give on a non-recurring basis beginning with a $ 25 " Associate " contribution and progressing to a $ 1200 + " Philanthropist " level .
Palmieri , on behalf of the GNOME Board , asks those who have and those who have n't given to GNOME before to consider it now :
While we can look at this downturn as a time to tighten our belts , I would much rather look at this as an opportunity for the community to take a stake in the future of the Foundation and show that we are not exclusively reliant on corporate coffers to grow GNOME .
If you have n’t donated in the past , now is the time to start by becoming a Friend of GNOME or donating at any of the contribution levels .
If you do currently donate to GNOME , look to see if you can contribute a tiny bit more on a monthly basis .
Every little bit helps .
Remember these funds go to programs like hackfests and putting on local conferences .
It also goes to paying for our staff of two who along with the part time and overworked board construct the strategies for facilitating the growth of GNOME .
More information about giving to the GNOME Foundation can be found on its Friends of GNOME site .
The 2009 GNOME Foundation budget is available from the foundation 's mailing list .
Quoting Sen. Lindsey Graham ’s statement at a May 13 Senate hearing that “ one of the reasons these techniques have been used for about 500 years is that they work , ” Robert Parry ( Consortium News , 5/16/09 ) explains that this is “ implicitly endorsing the Spanish Inquisition ’s brutal treatment of Jews , Muslims , Protestants and other alleged heretics from the 15th to 17th centuries , ” and posits that “ in a normal world , one might have expected national outrage over a prominent U.S. senator speaking favorably of the Spanish Inquisition , which pioneered innovations in torture … including the water torture now known as waterboarding “ :
Beyond the inhumanity of the Inquisition , there is the troubling fact that the torture tactics did “ work ” only in the sense that they extracted many false confessions and got victims to implicate other individuals who were , in turn , persecuted , tortured and put to death for their religious beliefs .
But Graham ’s praise for the efficacy of the Inquisition ’s torture tactics passed largely unnoticed–and without any perceptible criticism –in the American news media .
The Washington Post article on the Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing did n’t even mention Graham ’s extraordinary remark ; a brief New York Times article about the hearing mentioned it only in passing .
Remarking on how “ Graham is still considered a Republican ‘ moderate ’ regarding BushÃ ƒ Æ ’Â¢ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¡Â ¬ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¾ Â¢s ‘ war on terror ’ policies , ” Parry notes a stark “ contrast to the quiet acceptance of GrahamÃ ƒ Æ ’Â¢ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¡Â¬ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¾Â¢s views on the InquisitionÃ ƒ Æ ’Â¢ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¡Â ¬ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¾ Â¢s torture tactics ” and how “ Washington news media flew into near hysteria over House Speaker Nancy PelosiÃ ƒÆ ’Â¢ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¡Â¬ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¾Â¢s tortured explanations of what she knew about Bush ’s torture policies . ”
After a short hiatus , the dreaded Ammar 404 has once again attacked the Tunisian blogosphere .
Ammar is the nickname given by Tunisian bloggers to the censorship machine plaguing their access to the Internet and his victim this time is Zig Zag blog by 3 amrouch .
It seem that the blog has been censored for republishing screen shots of a Canadian newspaper which unveils a real estate transaction in which the Tunisian President 's son - in - law Mohamed Sakhr El Matri bought a villa in Canada for a huge amount of money – information which the Tunisian Government wants to hide from its people .
Many bloggers wrote about this censorship and condemned it .
Samsoum wrote :
Le blog de 3 amrouch a été censure car il a repris une information publique sur un journal canadien qui est accessible a tout le monde .
Par solidarité je publie aussi le lien vers ce journal qui cite dans sa page 10 la transaction immobilière qu'on veut cacher a tout prix .
Et qu'on censure ce blog aussi !!!
3 amrouch ’s blog has been censored for reprinting public information from a Canadian newspaper that is accessible to everyone .
In solidarity , I am also publishing the link to this newspaper which shows on page 10 the real estate transaction they want to hide at all costs .
Let them censor this blog too !!!

As long as he did not call for hatred , violence , or terrorism , no to censorship without a clear , open and reasonable judicial decision .
No to censorship for criticizing aspects of corruption .
The stupid person who took the censorship decision to please Sidi Bouhjar ( the name given to Sakhr El Materi ) , served 3 amrouch at the detriment of his little master .
Ordinary stories blogged saying :
المدونة متاع عمروش تم حجبها لأنها تناولت موضوع ما عجبش المسؤولين على أمننا وسلامتن ا

3 amrouch 's blog has been censored because it tackled a subject that did not please those responsible of our security and safety .
Despite the fact that we condemned these practices , Ammar did not understand .
He is not understanding and he is not going to understand .
This is why I am republishing the same subject which is probably the reason for the censorship .
There are a few things you should know about me .
I ’ll knock you over for a cupcake in a jar , I still cry every time I watch that Susan Boyle video , and I really hate it when people force me into uncomfortable situations .
I mean , I know none of us like it , but I think I hate it more than most .
My life is already plenty uncomfortable .
I do n’t need others making it any worse .
Especially when I know you ’re just using me .
Earlier this week there was a lot of buzz about the new Google Profiles .
I tried to ignore it because I find the idea of gift wrapping your online thumbprint and then hand delivering it to Google completely absurd .
I mean , why would I want to do that ?
But people were tripping over themselves to get in and “ optimize ” their information .
I did n’t want to get in the way .
But then Google came after me .
I ’m all for Google launching these profiles under the guise that they ’re “ giving you control ” over your name .
It ’s cute .
It ’s a very creative little scheme they ’ve started so they can easily connect all your info and then do God knows what with it .
Well done .
However , you ca n’t bully and threaten me into playing your game .
Google , The Bully
I did a live vanity search this morning to see if my Outspoken bio was making any progress rising up the search results ( it is ) and got this .
I know the promo box has been there for a few days , but I was kind of hoping it ’d go away .
You know why ?
Because it ’s hella creepy the way they ’re doing this .
They ’re connecting MY NAME with MY SEARCH and using it against ME .
Do I get that box if I do a search for someone else ’s name – my brother ’s , Rhea ’s , various boys that I religiously stalk – no , I do n’t .
I only get Google whispering in my ear to try their devil cookie if I do search for me .
This is n’t Say Anything and you ’re not John Cusack .
You ca n’t play your music and expect me to fall in love with you .
Back off , Google .
Google , The Intimidator
It ’s one thing to repeatedly ask me to try your cookie ; it ’s another to be holding a gun while you do it .
In case you did n’t notice , you ’re being FORCED into creating these profiles .
Because if you do n’t do it , then you do n’t get to show up in their search results and you voluntarily hand over that space to someone else .
Do a search for Danny Sullivan and you already get an assortment of Dannys to choose from .
Do a search for Susan Esparza , and look , there she is .
That means I either act like a good little girl or I risk creating a reputation management issue for myself down the road .
I ’ve worked hard to build up content that ranks for my name , why do I lose that ranking just because someone else decided to hand over more information than I did ?
What you ’re telling me is that I either give you everything you want or I do n’t get to play .
That ’s not right .
That ’s using your power to intimidate me into doing what YOU want me to do for YOUR selfish reasons .
Calm down , Lisa , you say .
You do n’t have to fill out all the information .
You can pick what you tell them .
Well , according to Danny ’s review on Search Engine Land , I really do have to fill out all the information .
Because it ’s “ the most comprehensive ” profiles that are going to appear in the results cause they ’re more “ trusted ” .
Forgive me , but I ’m not looking to give Google an easily accessible thumbprint that consists of :
Where you live
Where you used to live
Where you went to school
Where you work now
Where you used to work
What you do for a living
Interests
Any fun nicknames , or you know , usernames you may be using on the Web
I have best friends that do n’t know that much information about me .
Facebook does n’t have all that information about me and they ’re NOT Google .
Just because you throw in the occasional “ what ’s your super power ” question , does n’t mean you ’re whimsical and my friend .
You ’re not .
I see what you ’re doing .
I do n’t like it .
I do n’t like being forced into doing things I do n’t want to do .
We have no idea how Google is going to use this information .
We have no idea when the profiles are going to be moved from the bottom of the SERPs to the top , making it damn certain that you need to have one or you lose your brand real estate .
It ’s not okay for Google to force your hand .
Bad on Google for putting people in the position to either hand over their privacy or search engine prominence .
It ’s funny ; people joked that one day we ’d all get Google barcodes .
Well , there are n’t any barcodes here .
Just a complete thumbprint that we ’re being lined up and forced to hand over .
And if you do n’t hand it over willingly , watch out cause they ’ll just cut off your thumb .
UPDATE : The Gypsy was kind enough to share this link with me about Google ’s social user ranking system for ad targeting , which frankly , raises my concerns to all holy hell .
Do not like .
As the debate over ethanol heats up with creation of a federal biofuels working group and a new Renewable Fuel Standard , a Texas company has made it easier for businesses , farms and municipalities to produce their own .
The systems could benefit companies who want to use alternative fuels in their fleets , potentially save money and simplify their supply chains , but face challenges with the limited availability .
Dallas - based Allard Research and Development LLC unveiled the mini refineries capable of producing 100 , 200 , 500 or 1,000 gallons of ethanol per day , depending on the model .
The systems are available in either automated or manual versions .
The fully automated versions include 15 - inch touch - screen LCD monitors and iPhone remote control monitoring capability .
The systems include stainless steel fermentation , output collection and cooling water tanks , as well as a feature that captures and stores carbon dioxide produced from the fermentation process .
Advanced sensors track temperature , pressure , and liquid levels ; the systems also have integrated fire suppression technology .
The company said its philosophy is rooted in self - sufficiency , which fuels its drive to create closed - loop systems for growing food and producing fuel .
Allard is working on a book that describes how a 300 - square foot swath of land can sustain one person utilizing in - ground fish tanks , hydroponically grown vegetables , a greenhouse , and other technologies .
Dear Person of Faith
Basically , I write as fundraiser for the wonderful new Tony Blair Foundation , whose aim is “ to promote respect and understanding about the world ’s major religions and show how faith is a powerful force for good in the modern world ” .
I would like to touch base with you on six key points from the recent New Statesman piece by Tony ( as he likes to be called by everybody , of all faiths – or indeed of none , for that ’s how tuned in he is ! ) .
“ My faith has always been an important part of my politics ”
Yes indeed , although Tony modestly kept shtum about it when he was PM .
As he said , to shout his faith from the rooftops might have been interpreted as claiming moral superiority over those with no faith ( and therefore no morals , of course ) .
Also , some might have objected to their PM taking advice from voices only he could hear ; but hey , reality is so last year compared with private revelation , is n’t it ?
What else , other than shared faith , could have brought Tony together with his friend and comrade - in - arms , George “ Mission Accomplished ” Bush , in their life - saving and humanitarian intervention in Iraq ?
Admittedly , there are one or two problems remaining to be ironed out there , but all the more reason for people of different faiths – Christian and Muslim , Sunni and Shia – to join together in meaningful dialogue to seek common ground , just as Catholics and Protestants have done , so heart - warmingly , throughout European history .
It is these great benefits of faith that the Tony Blair Foundation seeks to promote .
“ We are focusing on five main projects initially , working with partners in the six main faiths ”
Yes I know , I know , it ’s a pity we had to limit ourselves to six .
But we do have boundless respect for other faiths , all of which , in their colourful variety , enrich human lives .
In a very real sense , we have much to learn from Zoroastrianism and Jainism .
And from Mormonism , though Cherie says we need to go easy on the polygamy and the sacred underpants !!
Then again , we must n’t forget the ancient and rich Olympian and Norse traditions – although our modern blue - skies thinking out of the box has pushed the envelope on shock - and - awe tactics , and put Zeus ’s thunderbolts and Thor ’s hammer in the shade !!!
We hope , in Phase 2 of our Five - Year Plan , to embrace Scientology and Druidic Mistletoe Worship , which , in a very real sense , have something to teach us all .
In Phase 3 , our firm commitment to Diversity will lead us to source new networking partnership opportunities with the many hundreds of African tribal religions .
Sacrificing goats may present problems with the RSPCA , but we hope to persuade them to adjust their priorities to take proper account of religious sensibilities .
“ We are working across religious divides towards a common goal – ending the scandal of deaths from malaria ”
Plus , of course , we must n’t forget the countless deaths from Aids .
This is where we can learn from the Pope ’s inspiring vision , expounded recently on his visit to Africa .
Drawing on his reserves of scientific and medical knowledge – informed and deepened by the Values that only faith can bring – His Holiness explained that the scourge of Aids is made worse , not better , by condoms .
His advocacy of abstinence may have dismayed some medical experts ( and the same goes for his deeply and sincerely held opposition to stem - cell research ) .
But surely to goodness we must find room for a diverse range of opinions .
All opinions , after all , are equally valid , and there are many ways of knowing , spiritual as well as factual .
That , at the end of the day , is what the Foundation is all about .
“ We have established Face to Faith , an interfaith schools programme to counter intolerance and extremism ”
The great thing is to foster diversity , as Tony himself said in 2002 , when challenged by a ( rather intolerant !!!!)
MP about a school in Gateshead teaching children that the world is only 6,000 years old .
Of course you may think , as Tony himself happens to , that the true age of the world is 4.6 billion years .
But – excuse me – in this multicultural world , we must find room to tolerate – and indeed actively foster – all opinions : the more diverse , the better .
We are looking to set up video - conferencing dialogues to brainstorm our differences .
By the way , that Gateshead school ticked lots of boxes when it came to GCSE results , which just goes to show .
“ Children of one faith and culture will have the chance to interact with children of another , getting a real sense of each other ’s lived experience ”
Cool !
And , thanks to Tony ’s policy of putting as many children as possible in faith schools where they can’t befriend kids from other backgrounds , the need for this interaction and mutual understanding has never been so strong .
You see how it all hangs together ?
Sheer genius !
So strongly do we support the principle that children should be sent to schools which will identify them with their parents ’ beliefs , that we think there is a real opportunity here to broaden it out .
In Phase 2 , we look to facilitate separate schools for Postmodernist children , Leavisite children and Saussurian Structuralist children .
And in Phase 3 we shall roll out yet more separate schools , for Keynesian children , Monetarist children and even neo-Marxist children .
“ We are working with the Coexist Foundation and Cambridge University to develop the concept of Abraham House ”
I always think it ’s so important to coexist , do n’t you agree , with our brothers and sisters of the other Abrahamic faiths .
Of course we have our differences – I mean , who does n’t , basically ?
But we must all learn mutual respect .
For example , we need to understand and sympathise with the deep hurt and offence that a man can feel if we insult his traditional beliefs by trying to stop him beating his wife , or setting fire to his daughter or cutting off her clitoris ( and please do n’t let ’s hear any racist or Islamophobic objections to these important expressions of faith ) .
We shall support the introduction of sharia courts , but on a strictly voluntary basis – only for those whose husbands and fathers freely choose it .
“ The Blair Foundation will work to leverage mutual respect and understanding between seemingly incompatible faith traditions ”
After all , despite our differences , we do have one important thing in common : all of us in the faith communities hold firm beliefs in the total absence of evidence , which leaves us free to believe anything we like .
So , at the very least , we can be united in claiming a privileged role for all these private beliefs in the formulation of public policy .
I hope this letter will have shown you some of the reasons why you might consider supporting Tony ’s Foundation .
Because hey , let ’s face it , a world without religion does n’t have a prayer .
With so many of the world ’s problems caused by religion , what better solution could there possibly be than to promote yet more of it ?
Richard Dawkins is the author of “ The God Delusion ” ( Black Swan , £ 8.99 )
Hollywood 's famous studio Twentieth Century Fox has moved the Bombay High Court against B R Chopra Films seeking Rs 7 - crore damages and an injunction against the release of the Hindi film ' Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai ' alleging it was a remake of Oscar - winning ' My Cousin Vinny ' .
The suit will come up for hearing on May 7 before the High Court which will decide on granting interim relief prayed for by the plaintiffs .
This is for the first time that a Hollywood studio has sued an Indian production house for alleged plagiarism and copyrights violation .
In the suit , the American studio contended that B R Films had sought permission to make a film on the story idea of ' My Cousin Vinny ' .
Although the studio had given a nod , rights for making a Hindi remake of the film were not given .
Twentieth Century
Fox further contended that after looking at the script of the Hindi film they found it was substantial reproduction of ' My Cousin Vinny ' .
Also the story line was identical , it submitted .
The plaintiffs argued B R Chopra Films was wrongly projecting ' Banda Yeh Bindaas Hai ' as the authorised remake of the 1992 English film .
Using Firewall Object In Firewall Builder
Firewall Builder supports variety of object types , both simple such as address , network , host , or IP , TCP , UDP and ICMP services , as well as more sophisticated such as Firewall , Host , Address table , DNS name , User service .
Firewall object is central to the program and is in the focus of this article .
General Description
A firewall object is designed to represent a real firewall device in your network .
This firewall object will have interface and IP address objects that mirror the real interfaces and IP addresses of the actual device .
In addition , the firewall object is where you create the access policy rule sets , NAT rule sets , and routing rule sets that you assign to your firewall device .
By default , a firewall has one Policy rule set , one NAT rule set , and one routing rule set .
However , you can create more than one rule set using branching rules ( for firewalls that support them ) .
On the other hand , you do n’t have to populate all the rule sets .
You can , for example , create a Policy ruleset and leave the NAT and Routing rule sets empty .
We explains more about policies and rule sets below .
To speed up the creation of a firewall object , Firewall Builder has a wizard that walks you through creating the object .
The wizard has three options for creating a firewall object :
From a template : Firewall Builder comes with several pre-defined templates .
You can use these to create a firewall that is close to your configuration , the modify it to fit your needs .
This method was demonstrated in the " Getting Started with Firewall Builder " here or here .
Manually :
You can provide interface IP address , subnet mask , gateway , and other parameters manually .
You can add this information when you create the firewall , or you can add it later .
Via SNMP : Firewall Builder uses SNMP queries to learn about the network .
Creating Firewall Object Manually
To start the firewall object creation wizard , right - click the Firewalls folder in the User tree and select New Firewall .
The first page of this wizard is displayed .
Give the firewall object a name .
Usually , this name will be the same name as the device , but it does n’t have to be if you ’re assigning interfaces manually .
( If you will use SNMP or DNS to populate the interfaces , then the name must be the same as the device name . )
Then specify the firewall software and OS .
Leave the Use pre-configured template firewall objects checkbox unchecked .
Click Next .
Select Configure interfaces manually and click Next .
Use this screen to add firewall interfaces .
Populate the following fields for an interface , then click Add to add the interface .
Then , populate the fields again for the next interface .
If you make a mistake , click on the interface in the list , make your changes , then click Update .
Interface type : Indicate the type of interface .
We explain interface types in more detail below .
Briefly , though , a Regular interface has a static IP addresses , a Dynamic address interface has a dynamic address provided by something like DHCP , an Unnumbered interface never has an IP address ( PPPoE connection , for example ) , and a Bridge por t is an interface that is bridged in the firewall .
Name :
The name of the interface object in Firewall Builder must match exactly the name of the interface of the firewall machine it represents .
This will be something like " eth0 " , " eth1 " , " en0 " , " br0 " , and so on .
Label :
On most OS ’s this field is not used and serves the purpose of a descriptive label .
The label is mandatory for Cisco PIX though , where it must reflect the network topology .
Firewall Builder GUI uses the label , if it is not blank , to label interfaces in the tree .
One of the suggested uses for this field is to mark interfaces to reflect the network topology ( ’ outside ’ , ’ inside ’ ) or interface purpose ( ’ web frontend ’ or ’ backup subnet ’ ) .
Address :
If the interface has a static IP address , specify it here .
( In Firewall Builder version 3 , this must be an IP v4 address .
If you need it to be an IP v6 address , create the interface without an IP address , then add the IP v6 address after you have created the firewall object . )
Netmask : Use either a traditional netmask ( 255.255.255.0 ) or slash notation ( 24 , without the actual slash ) to specify the interface netmask .
MAC : If you like , you can also specify the interface physical address .
The MAC address is not necessary , but it can be used to combat spoofing .
If the feature is turned on and available , and interface object with MAC address is used in a policy rule , then the firewall will only accept packets from the given IP address if the MAC address also matches the one specified .
Once all the interfaces are configured , click Finish to create the new firewall object .
Note :
You can always add , modify and delete interfaces later using controls provided in the main window .
Although it 's been quiet in recent weeks , the dreaded Conficker worm is far from done its reign of terror .
In fact , never before has this virus caused so much havoc than when the news mediums stopped printing urgent warnings about its dangers .
Now , as the reports of countless victims come pouring in , security officials are getting a clear sense of just how many computers are infected on a daily basis .
According to one security expert , Conficker infiltrates as many as 50,000 new PCs every day .
International Incident
What makes matters worse is that the virus has no specific target area , as all of the victims are dispersed throughout the world .
Among the countries hit hardest by Conficker are the United States , Brazil and India .
A total of 350,000 incident reports have been filed in these 3 countries alone .
( Source : yahoo.com )
The next three countries on the Conficker " hit list " are Mexico , Italy and China .
These 3 countries comprise a total of 89,000 Conficker complaints to date .
April 1st Worm : Late Bloom
The virus itself was trouble right from the start back in November 2008 .
At this time , Conficker was expected to be launched on April 1 , 2009 as a sick " April Fools " joke that proved to be more twisted than humorous .
A number of security officials attempted to calm the masses by informing them that Conficker was more likely to attack government , corporate , and educational targets than the average user .
( Source : extremetech.com )
When the dreaded day arrived and passed without the sky falling , many fell into a false " comfort zone " .
Now that the worm has begun to spread in secrecy , expect the number of new PC user attacks to grow .
Variants Impede Protection
It is increasingly difficult to protect against Conficker .
One reason for this is that there is more than one variant ( or version ) of the virus .
Variant C , for instance , resets the System Restore points and disables a number of system services such as Windows Automatic Update , Windows Security Center , and Windows Error Reporting .
Of course , to give yourself ( and your computer ) the best chance to counter a Conficker attack , officials are asking all PC owners to check for suspicious content and software on a routine basis .
Remember : just because the virus is taking a backseat to the other tech stories of the day , does n't mean that the news is any less dire .
With 50,000 new infections each day , the situation is expected to get a whole lot worse before any steps are taken to make it better .
I 'd like to thank Steven Frank for posting the link to ClickToFlash ClickToFlash , a Safari plugin that prevents the loading of Flash content until you click it .
I shared this plugin's location with John Gruber and he noted that he was seeing low single - percentage CPU usage with 30 Safari tabs open .
In my own tests , Safari took up 4 % CPU when looking at a YouTube page prior to loading the Flash video .
After loading it ( by clicking the grey gradient that replaces the video ) , CPU usage rose to 40 to 50 % .
It works , and it 's pretty great .
Update ( 2009-01 - 28 ) : Updated link to the current fork .
Sometimes , we get excited about the little things .
For example , when we first saw the Sony Ericsson W995a at GSMA 2009 we got excited not because it has an 8.1 - megapixel camera and a Walkman player -- we've seen those before -- but because it had a 3.5 - millimeter headset jack and kickstand .
Yes , we know that those features may seem insignificant when compared with a flashy media player , but as usability goes , you can't top them .
The kickstand lets you prop the phone on a table and the standard jack lets you use your own headset .
Did we mention that the W995 is the first Sony Ericsson phone to give you such freedom ?
Besides those high points , the W995a has other attractions , even if it 's not the sexiest phone around .
The display is brilliant , the media player performs well , and the feature set includes Wi -Fi , stereo Bluetooth , and GPS .
It also is a full quad - band world phone that supports AT&T 's 3G network .
There were some things that we did n't love : the volume is low , some aspects of the design felt flimsy , and the unlocked W995a will put a serious crimp in your wallet .
Without any carrier subsides , it cost about $ 600 .
You can get it in Sony Style stores and at SonyStyle.com .
And as a bonus , Sony will help you hook up the phone for use with your carrier 's multimedia services .
Design
" Boxy " is the main word that comes to mind when you see the W995a .
Though it 's not unattractive by any means , the straight lines and sharp corners do n't scale the heights of striking design .
Despite its many features , the W995a manages to be rather compact ( 3.8 inches tall by 1.9 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick ) and lightweight ( 4.0 ounces ) .
The phone travels well and it has a solid feel , but we noticed that the slider mechanism wobbled just a bit .
The W995a comes in progressive black , cosmic silver , and energetic red , though the features are the same on all models .
The W995a 's real estate is dominated by a gorgeous 2.6 - inch display .
Supporting 16.7 million colors ( 320x240 pixels ) , it lends itself well to still graphics , photos , and simple animations .
The menu interface is standard Sony Ericsson ; you can choose from four styles , but we consider the list and grid options to be the most intuitive .
You can adjust the brightness to your liking .
Sony Ericsson can stumble when designing navigation controls , but the W995 's come off pretty well .
The circular toggle and central OK button are large and pleasantly tactile .
The surrounding navigation controls , which are shaped like half circles , are a bit small , but they 're also raised above the surface of the phone .
You 'll find two soft keys , a clear button , and a control that activates a user - customizable shortcut menu .
Spacious Talk and End / power keys sit on either side of its navigation array .
The keypad does n't fare quite as well , unfortunately .
The buttons are rather small and they have a slippery feel .
Compared with other slider phones we could dial without looking , but it was n't the most comfortable experience for rapid dialing or texting .
Also , we 're worried about long - term durability since the area that surrounds the keys " gives " just a bit when we pressed down .
It 's worth noting that a similar phone -- the Sony Ericsson W580i -- developed cracks over time .
On the left spine you 'll find a Walkman player shortcut and the proprietary Sony Ericsson headset jack .
We 're hoping that before too long Sony Ericsson joins other manufacturers in moving to a standard Micro - USB charger connection .
On the right spine are a camera shortcut , music player controls , and a volume rocker .
The latter doubles as a zoom control for the camera , though it 's a little too small for our tastes .
We liked the W995a 's headset jack and kickstand .
The 3.5 - millimeter headset jack rests conveniently on the top of the phone between stereo speakers .
You 'll be able to use your own headset while carrying the phone in a pocket .
On the rear side are the camera lens , flash , and kickstand .
The former two are in the top - right corner so that the W995a resembles a standalone camera from behind .
The camera controls are easily accessible when the phone is the horizontal position -- just be sure to keep your fingers out of the way .
As we mentioned , you can use the kickstand to prop the W995 on a table without resting it against your hand or a book .
It certainly makes for convenient media viewing , though the kickstand 's hinge is rather loose .
We 'd prefer that it click into place in the open position .
And for what it 's worth , we 'd like it even better if the display offered better video quality .
Features
The W995 's phone book accommodates a generous 1,000 contacts .
Each entry stores seven phone numbers , an e-mail address , a company name and job title , two street addresses , a URL , a birthday , and notes ( the SIM card holds an additional 250 names ) .
You can save callers to groups and you can pair them with one of 30 MP4 ringtones .
If you 're not happy with the selection that came on the W995a , you can use your music tracks to identify callers .
Essential features include text and multimedia messaging , a speakerphone , a vibrate mode , a task list , a notepad , a stopwatch , a notepad , a calendar , a calculator , and an alarm clock .
More advanced options include Wi -Fi , USB mass storage , PC syncing , a voice recorder , instant messaging , a file manager , and a code memo for storing sensitive information .
The Bluetooth feature includes stereo and object exchange profiles .
What 's more , you can use it to send a personal business card or as a remote control for other Bluetooth - enabled devices .
The W995 offers assisted GPS with support for Google Maps and a Web - based Wayfinder application for turn - by - turn directions .
Overall , that 's a decent selection of features , but on the downside , POP3 e-mail access requires a clunky Web interface .
As a Walkman phone , the W995a has a full service digital music player .
It 's not unlike other Walkman phones that came before it , but that 's a good thing considering Sony Ericsson 's respectable track record with music handsets .
Settings include an airplane mode , an equalizer , playlists , stereo widening , and shuffle and loop modes .
The interface is minimalist , but functional .
You can set visualizations and the player supports album art , as well .
Just keep in mind that it wo n't recognize every song it plays .
The dedicated controls make for an ergonomic experience and we again thank Sony Ericsson for including the 3.5 - millimeter headset jack .
As with a few of its Sony Ericsson siblings , the W995 is integrated with the " shake control " application .
By holding down the Walkman button when music is playing , you can advance to the next track by flicking your wrist .
It works quite well , though we did n't use it much .
You also get the standard FM radio , though you will need a wired antenna to act as an antenna .
There is always a starting point for every major web site .
No one reached where they are right now in one night .
In this post , we will analyze what makes a good web design site and the role of the design community in this process .
If you are a web designer or web developer , who recently discovered the passion for blogging and want to share the techniques and wisdom through your blog , this is your ultimate guideline .
You Do not exist
This is first thing you should keep in mind when you are starting your web design blog .
This statement might be harsh , but it is the truth .
The blogsphere is big galaxy where so many sites and blog with quality have already claimed their places .
If you are thinking your blog will just come out of no where and start making buzz , then forget it .
If you already have an built up reputation among the design community that ’s a different story .
For example .
Line25 is a newly launched web design Blog that was started by Chris Spooner , who is very well known web designer among the design community .
Therefore , the readers already know what kind of quality to expect .
If you are someone who is starting a design web blog without any communication with your design community , what you should do is :
Communicate : Ways to gain exposure
The four best way to make yourself known among the design community are :
1 . Well designed portfolio
2. Twitter
3. Guest Blog
4. Social Media
1. Create a Well Designed Portfolio
If you are a web designer , graphic designer or a web developer , having a well designed portfolio is a must .
Also , you should consider submitting your portfolio ( which should be well designed , flickr or deviantART does not count ) to CSS showcase sites .
If you have a good designed portfolio , most likely you will get featured in a web deign site and that way people will get to know your work .
So when you are launching your new site , people will consider visiting your site .
If you have no idea what a good designed portfolio are , here are some for your inspiration .
Useful resources for an effective portfolio
Twitter is the New Marketing tool
This Twitter thing has been coming on like gangbusters .
The messaging site has been around for a couple of years , but its popularity seems to have exploded just recently .
At first , when Twitter started it came across a false hope and joke , but it turned out to be one of the best marketing tools .
It is simple , short and useful .
One twitter ( secret ) tip for web designers is that they should go to Wefollow ’s Web design directory and start following the relevant web designers .
You will come across so many post talking about guaranteed method to get you more followers , but honestly these method will work for certain number of people and they are mostly not going to get you 20000 followers overnight .
It will take some time .
When you follow more web designers you will get more useful information and can connect to more people .
Here are some Twitter ethics you might need to follow :
If you want to get more followers quickly , notice the difference between the number of followers and following people .
If certain individuals has a big difference between those two numbers most probably they will not follow you .
people .
If certain individuals has a big difference between those two numbers most probably they will not follow you .
Retweet useful links and Give thanks if someone retweets your links .
useful links and Give thanks if someone retweets your links .
If you share useful links you will see that Twitterer will recommend you to other Twitterer .
Anyone can get a good amount of followers if you play by the rules .
Make friends and join in conversations .
However , do n’t except someone like Problogger , Smashing Magazine , or Copyblogger to retweet .
Sometimes they retweet but we are following them for the resources they share .
You get the point right ?
You may ask how is this going to help when I launch my site ?
Well if you publish a post you will get more retweets and as a result more viewers .
Guest Blog will Help … Up to Certain Measure
If you google right now “ Increase Blog Traffic “ , almost all the articles you find suggests to guest blog .
Guest writing on blogs can help you reach a new audience and build a better network .
While it is a great opportunity you have to do it right .
When you guest blog people get more exposure , you make money , get more followers and people get to know you .
For example : look at screenshot of Matt Cornin ’s from Spoonfied designs about the author section from a Six Revisions Post :
If you write a guest post for a bigger blog , with a link back to your blog , it will almost certainly increase traffic to your blog , at least for a couple of days .
Most of time if you guest post you get “ about the author ’s ” block where the author ’s information is shown .
This gives yourself and your blog more exposure .
However , guest blogging will help you up to certain measure .
It will not give you a million page views .
Well why not ?
When you guest blog for other websites many times the readers will not even notice about the author ’s section .
There are some many incidents where the readers thanks the blog owner for the great , not the author .
That ’s does not mean you should not guest blog .
Aside from the direct benefit of increased traffic , you are also exposing your blog ( and your name ) to a new audience — and helping to brand your blog and yourself in the process .
How Does Guest Blogging Work ?
Use the Power of Social Media Sites
Social Media is redefining the way people around the world communicate with one another .
You can connect to people on personal level .
Sites such as Facbook , Delicious , Stumbleupon , Reddit , Design Float can make you heard on the Web .
Create a legitimate profile about yourself and your profession .
Have a consistency on your pictures and information .
Do not put out 10 different information in differnt profiles .
Consisteny on your profile will allow people to recoganize you more .
That way you will meet people with same interest and again when you launch your site , you are covering more area on the web for promotion .
Notice that , digg is left out intentionally , because there is truly no strategy how you can make digg work for you after they pulled diggbar , users are really not in favor of digg .
Nevertheless ,
It it also a social media platform , so use it anyway .
Be Brave and Take Risk
If there is a new project or new blog you want to create , do it !
There will be lots of obstacles , sleepless nights .
You have to be committed to it .
If you want to start the site for the sake of blogging , your site will never make it .
People always look for new and innovative ideas .
If web designing , coding is your passion and you want to share with rest of the community you will succeed .
No matter what anyone says , the major keys for making web design blog successful is their readers , viewers and subscribers .
There are some trend and factors the reader leans toward .
In the second part we will discuss those factors and steps you should follow after you have launched your site .

Cook County Judge To Weis : You Can't Fire Cozzi
By Marcus Gilmer in News on Jul 14 , 2008 8:10 PM
Embattled Police Superintendent Jody
Weis just can't catch a break .
On Friday , Cook County Circuit Judge William Maki upheld the Chicago Police Board 's decision to suspend Officer William Cozzi instead of firing him for the 2005 beating of a wheelchaired man was the correct one .
The incident took place in August of 2005 at at Norwegian American Hospital in Humboldt Park .
Video of the beating shows then - 60 - year - old Randle Miles handcuffed and shackled to a wheelchair while Cozzi hit him ten times .
Miles had been stabbed by a woman earlier in the day and rather than seeking treatment had " downed a bottle of gin " instead .
At the insistence of friends , he finally sought treatment at the hospital where he became " agitated " and " abusive , " causing hospital staff to summon Cozzi .
Miles was charged with resisting arrest , despite video evidence to the contrary , and the charges were later dropped .
Cozzi was issued a two - year , unpaid suspension for the attack and in November , the Chicago Police Department appealed the suspension and asked to have Cozzi fired .
Meanwhile , when the case was brought to the attention of Supt .
Weis , he sent the case to the FBI ( Weis 's old stomping ground ) for possible federal prosecution which the Federal Order of Police is contesting on grounds of double jeopardy ; Cozzi previously plead guilty in Cook County criminal court to charges of misdemeanor battery and was sentenced to 18 months probation .
His return to the force , which was to happen in the spring , has been on hold due to the federal case against him . [ S - T ]

The final interview for my 5 quick questions at Wizard World series is none other than Admiral Adama Himself , Edward James Olmos .
Olmos was already a legend in sci - fi due his role as Gaff in Blade Runner and because of this and his award winning performance on Miami Vice , he was offered the role of the captain in Star Trek the Next Generation during pre-production and turned down the role .
He then went on to act in the film Stand and Deliver for which he was nominated for an Oscar for best actor .
After his nomination he tried his hand at directing with American
Me which has come to be a classic in the gangster film genre .
Olmos then returned to television first with a reoccurring role on The West Wing then to American Family : Journey of Dreams which he was on from 2002 - 2004 .
I also found it interesting that he was noted as making an appearance in in Snoop Dogg ’s music video Vato , featuring B - Real from Cypress Hill .
I would have to say the experience of interviewing Edward James Olmos was surreal to say the least and I was a bit nervous as well .
Upon sitting down to start the interview and looking across the table I suddenly forgot how to work my H2 recorder , and after a bit of fumbling with it and getting that same look I have seen given to Starbuck on numerous occasions on Battlestar Galactica I quickly regrouped and figured out “ the red blinky thing , yeah that ’s record ” .
After passing this obstacle he relaxed and I got to ask “ Eddie ” a few questions .
Check out the interview after the jump .
1 . When you accepted the role of Admiral Adama on Battlestar Galactica did you think the show would become the phenomena that it has ?
The answer is no one really knew that the show was going to get to this level , so we all just kinda like held on and we just got more and more understanding of the show and how it was growing , I really appreciate that .
2 . How much of yourself do you think is in the character of Admiral Adama ?
Basically I think that I embody every character that I do .
You know it ’s more of a situation of allowing these situations to be understood .
I love the character , it ’s one of the strongest characters I ’ve been able to play , but I also like Gaff a lot .
I love Miami Vice ’s Lieutenant Martin Castillo , and love El Pachuco .
The characters I ’ve been able to develop have been a lot of fun .
3 . I remember an interview early on in the show , where you mentioned that the show was too dark has your opinion of the show changed over time ?
No , I think it got darker as it went along .
It ’s funny , as it continued , it got harder and harder and harder to watch , because of the psychological and emotional stress they put on the viewer .
4 . I know you recently wrapped filming on the Battlestar Galactica film The Plan how did that go ?
That went really well .
We had a good time doing it and we had a lot of fun editing it , and right now we are doing the special effects which are just stunning .
5 . And my final question who would win in a fight between Admiral Adama and Saul Tigh ?
I think probably Adama .
But Saul would give him a run for his money .
He ’s a little taller , but he ’s not as well endowed as I am .
At this point I made Admiral Adama laugh and I just might get my flight privileges back someday .
So say we all .

Advertisement A doctor in Australia used a household drill to bore into a boy 's skull and drain it of blood clots as his local hospital lacked the required tools .
Dr Rob Carson performed the procedure on Nicholas Rossi , 13 , after the boy fell off his bike and hit his head .
The doctor had never attempted the surgery before , and had to be talked through the operation by a Melbourne neurosurgeon .
The boy 's father said the doctor 's improvisation had saved his son's life .
But Dr Carson told reporters : " It 's not a personal achievement , it is just a part of the job . "
One chance Immediately after his fall , Nicholas Rossi appeared stable .
But his mother , a nurse , noticed a bump on his head and decided to take him to the local hospital .
When some blood came out after we'd gone through the skull , we realised we 'd made the right decision
Dr David Tynan
By the time he got there , he was slipping in and out of consciousness .
" Dr Carson came over to us and said , ' I am going to have to drill into [ Nicholas ] to relieve the pressure on the brain - we 've got one shot at this and one shot only , " ' the boy 's father , Michael Rossi told journalists .
The small hospital had no special tools , so the team had to use a household drill .
Dr Carson called the neurosurgeon who talked him through the procedure by telling him where to aim the drill and how deep to go .
" All of a sudden the emergency ward was turned into an operating theatre , " Michael Rossi told Fairfax Radio .
" We did n't see anything , but we heard the noises , heard the drill .
It was just one of those surreal experiences . "
Dr David Tynan , an anaesthetist who helped Dr Carson , said the procedure took about a minute .
" It was pretty scary , " he told ABC .
" You obviously worry , [ are ] you pushing hard enough or pushing too hard , but then when some blood came out after we'd gone through the skull , we realised we 'd made the right decision . "
A tube was used to drain the blood while Nicholas Rossi was given fresh blood through his arm , the Australian reported .
After the surgery , the boy was airlifted to a larger hospital in Melbourne and released on Tuesday - his 13th birthday .

Grieving relatives react to news that some bodies have been found
By Gary Duffy
BBC News , Sao Paulo , Brazil
The recovery of the first bodies and debris following the disappearance of the Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris has undoubtedly evoked varying reactions .
For the investigators , it is the first step in a complex task of trying to establish what exactly caused such a sophisticated plane to fall from the sky .
For some of the relatives it is confirmation of their worst fears , while others have refused to give up hope .
" I received the news in the best way possible , because we were all very distressed " says lawyer Marco Tulio Moreno , whose parents were on the plane .
" Now we have evidence of what happened on the plane .
This diminishes the anguish of all of us .
" Some people hugged each other , some people cried , but the feeling of everyone is of relief after those days without answers , " he told Brazil 's TV Globo .
A Brazilian frigate is part of the search operation for victims and debris Specialist police officers have gone to the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha where the bodies will arrive on Sunday to start the process of identification .
Families have been asked to provide DNA and personal details , such as what their relatives were wearing on the day of departure .
Among the material recovered from the Atlantic were a case with an Air France ticket , a rucksack and a laptop .
The authorities say further details will only be provided to relatives .
Tragedy repeating Brazil has been here before .
It is only two years ago that another major air crash brought grief .
In July 2007 a plane from the country 's largest airline , Tam , sped off a runway at Congonhas airport in Sao Paulo , crashing into a nearby building .
In all , 199 people died , including everyone on the flight and some on the ground .
Now , following the disappearance of Air France AF 447 , the country is again in a sombre mood .
At least 58 Brazilians are among the missing , ranging from a member of the country 's former royal family to the chief of staff of the mayor of Rio , business executives , students and holidaymakers .
The deaths were mourned in France and other countries
It was an international tragedy , with people from many countries on board the flight , the largest number coming from France itself .
Analysis has focused on the question of turbulence and the possibility that the flight was struck by lightning , or technical concerns with the plane , but there are as many doubts as certainties .
It is , as one French minister acknowledged , a race against time to recover the flight data recorders - the so - called black boxes .
They emit signals for up to 30 days .
There was a stark moment at a press conference in Paris when an official held up the small cylindrical object which emits the signal .
As he clutched it in one hand , it seemed easy to believe that recovering this from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean will be enormously difficult - even with the help of a French nuclear submarine , or another deep - sea submarine that was once used to explore the decks of the Titanic .
Black day
For the last week , the tragedy has dominated the daily papers and weekly news magazines in Brazil .
Pictures of grief - stricken relatives have featured prominently in the coverage , and there are many sad individual stories .
There was the university professor going to the congress in Paris ; the oil engineer travelling to Germany on business ; the couple heading off on their honeymoon after getting married on Saturday , when they celebrated with families and friends until 3 am .
The mayor of Rio , Eduardo Paes , was mourning the almost certain loss of Marcelo Parente Gomes de Oliveira , not only a top aide , but a man who had been his friend from childhood .
A largely unaware public has been introduced to the " inter - tropical convergence zone " through which the plane passed , a belt of low pressure in the region of the Equator associated with heavy turbulence .
Pilots are used to dealing with this area of instability , often flying over the thick clouds , it was reported .
Other specialists said there seemed to be nothing from satellite images to suggest there was anything exceptional at the time the flight disappeared .
The primary focus , however , remains on those most directly affected and the continuing search .
Brazil is still dealing with the aftermath of the Tam plane crash two years ago Brazil is still dealing with the fallout from the Tam tragedy in 2007 , and the earlier loss of a passenger plane over the Amazon in September 2006 .
For many of the relatives who lost loved ones in those tragedies , there are still issues to be resolved and considerable bitterness remains .
Conflict and criticism
In the first days of uncertainty following the disappearance of the Air France flight there appeared not to be the same level of anger .
Now some criticism is emerging .
The handling of the initial release of information appears to have won few admirers for Brazil 's Defence Minister Nelson Jobim .
There was clear irritation in France at claims that debris had been recovered , which then had to be withdrawn , and over the minister 's assumption that there probably had not been an explosion on board the plane .
Now concerns are emerging about speed monitors on board the Air France aircraft , and the revelation that this was a general issue of concern since May last year .
It may or may not be of wider significance , given that at least 24 automatic messages indicated a series of systems on board the plane were failing in the last few minutes as it passed through turbulent weather .
French investigators have cautioned against making a premature judgement .
With so few facts established , the cause is still unclear , and the grieving continues .

RAMALLAH , ( PIC ) –
The Palestinian prisoner club accused the Israeli occupation authority ( IOA ) of committing new crimes of corporal torture against children through giving them electric shocks and beating them severely .
The club said that Palestinian child Hamza Al - Za’aol , who was kidnapped on the fourth of May on a charge of throwing stones , told club lawyers that Israeli occupation forces ( IOF ) used electric shocks against him in Etzion prison while another child detained on the same day called Ismail Al - Za’aol said he was severely beaten especially in his broken leg .
The club revealed that the number of children kidnapped during the first quarter of 2009 rose to 443 prisoners after kidnapping 14 minors this year .
In another related context , the popular committee against torture said in a report issued Wednesday that the IOF troops and the Shin Bet security service deliberately tortured Palestinian detainees through handcuffing them in a painful manner contrary to international law .
The committee said that its report depended on 574 cases of arrest and interrogation during the last year and on testimonies collected from Israeli soldiers by the organization of breaking the silence that is concerned about reporting on IOF troops ’ violations .

As the US and Russia negotiate over nuclear weapons , what does the nuclear world look like ?
These figures are from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and show the best estimates for the big five nuclear powers : the US , Russia , China , France and the UK .
We 've also included estimates for other nuclear powers like India , Pakistan and Israel - and for the so - called rogue states like North Korea and Iran .
These are just the active warheads - both Russia and the US have thousands more in storage and pending dismantling .
Hit the link on the spreadsheet for how the figures changed between 1945 and 2006 .
In the mid-1980s , there were over 70,000 warheads out there - each with the power of eight times that which destroyed Hiroshima at the end of the second world war .
There are many less now - but do you feel any safer ?

LECCE , Italy
–
The world 's rich nations will ask the International Monetary Fund to study ways of unwinding the drastic steps taken to rescue the global economy , a source with knowledge of the plan said today .
The source , who declined to be named , said finance ministers of the Group of Eight nations would request the study in a communiqué to be released on Saturday , after two days of talks in the southern Italian town of Lecce .
The move would not mean countries will quickly roll back the drastic easing of budget and monetary policies that they have put in place during the global economic crisis .
But it does suggest they feel an economic recovery is in sight , and that they want to reassure financial markets they can manage the recovery without unleashing a wave of inflation .
A leap in long - term government bond yields over the past several weeks shows markets fear the huge sums of public money pumped into economies will eventually fuel inflation and damage governments ' finances for years to come .
Pressure has therefore been building in the G8 for talks on ways to wind down stimulus programmes as soon as they are no longer needed – " exit strategies " that would prevent market interest rates from rising high enough to threaten economic recovery .
" The IMF report will be probably presented at the ( IMF's ) October annual meeting in Istanbul , " the source told Reuters .
The IMF study could provide governments with some political cover when they eventually start making painful cuts in state spending to bring budget deficits under control , and when central banks begin to raise interest rates back up from near - zero levels .
The German and Canadian finance ministers on Friday urged the G8 to hold its first talks on exit strategies .
" It 's time to have a discussion on how to disengage from the fiscal stimulus .
It 's realistic to start talking about the exit strategy , " said Canada 's Jim Flaherty .
" I do n't expect an agreement , " he added .
" These are early discussions . "
Because of its historical experience with hyperinflation , Germany is one of Europe 's most fiscally conservative countries .
Berlin 's upper house of parliament passed new measures on Friday to prop up confidence in government finances , restricting new debt issuance by German states from 2020 .
But other countries are less enthusiastic about talking about exit strategies and less convinced that the worst of the economic slump is over .
Euro zone industrial production shrank by more than a fifth in April , new data showed on Friday , raising risks that the second quarter will be weaker than expected .
" There are risks to doing it ( withdrawing stimulus ) too late and also to doing it too quickly , " another official source from a major European economy told Reuters .
" Now is not the time because you will only worsen things if you begin while the economy is still falling . "
Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke has said the United States must start planning to restore fiscal balance .
But U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said that although he wants to " take stock " of recovery efforts , stimulus work is not yet finished .
" The dominant focus of policy everywhere – everywhere – still is on trying to make sure we have a strong foundation for recovery , " Geithner told a news briefing earlier this week .
The G8 groups the United States , Germany , Japan , Britain , France , Italy , Canada and Russia .

SAN FRANCISCO / Walker becomes chief district judge
U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker , an independent - minded conservative who has presided over high - profile cases on prisoners , banks and newspapers during 15 years on the bench , becomes chief judge of the Northern District of California today .
Walker , 60 , appointed by former President George H.W. Bush , succeeds Marilyn Hall Patel , who has completed her seven - year term and returns to full - time judging .
The chief judge carries a reduced caseload while handling administrative duties and managing the budget for a district that has trial courts in San Francisco , Oakland and San Jose and extends from Monterey County to the Oregon border .
Walker , a longtime business lawyer in San Francisco , was first nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan but encountered opposition over his membership in the all - male Olympic Club and his representation of the U.S. Olympic Committee in a suit that prevented a Bay Area group from calling its athletic competition the Gay Olympics .
He has been unorthodox as a judge , requiring law firms to bid for the status of lead counsel in securities class - action suits and publicly calling for legalization of drugs .
His rulings have overturned San Francisco 's voter - approved limits on bank ATM fees , dismissed a slave - labor suit against Japanese companies by former World War II prisoners of war and allowed reporters to watch all stages of lethal injection executions .
He dismissed a suit by anti-logging protesters whose eyes were swabbed with liquid pepper spray , a decision later overturned by an appeals court ; and approved Hearst Corp .'s purchase of The Chronicle , despite Walker 's reservations about the Justice Department 's antitrust review .

Today , the American Academy of Environmental Medicine ( AAEM ) called on " Physicians to educate their patients , the medical community , and the public to avoid GM ( genetically modified ) foods when possible and provide educational materials concerning GM foods and health risks . " [ i ]
They called for a moratorium on GM foods , long - term independent studies , and labeling .
AAEM 's position paper stated , " Several animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with GM food , " including infertility , immune problems , accelerated aging , insulin regulation , and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system .
They conclude , " There is more than a casual association between GM foods and adverse health effects .
There is causation , " as defined by recognized scientific criteria .
" The strength of association and consistency between GM foods and disease is confirmed in several animal studies . "
More and more doctors are already prescribing GM - free diets .
Dr. Amy Dean , a Michigan internal medicine specialist , and board member of AAEM says , " I strongly recommend patients eat strictly non-genetically modified foods . "
Ohio allergist Dr. John Boyles says " I used to test for soy allergies all the time , but now that soy is genetically engineered , it is so dangerous that I tell people never to eat it . "
Dr. Jennifer Armstrong , President of AAEM , says , " Physicians are probably seeing the effects in their patients , but need to know how to ask the right questions . "
World renowned biologist Pushpa M. Bhargava goes one step further .
After reviewing more than 600 scientific journals , he concludes that genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) are a major contributor to the sharply deteriorating health of Americans .
Pregnant women and babies at great risk
Among the population , biologist David Schubert of the Salk Institute warns that " children are the most likely to be adversely effected by toxins and other dietary problems " related to GM foods .
He says without adequate studies , the children become " the experimental animals . " [ ii ]
The experience of actual GM - fed experimental animals is scary .
When GM soy was fed to female rats , most of their babies died within three weeks - compared to a 10 % death rate among the control group fed natural soy . [ iii ]
The GM - fed babies were also smaller , and later had problems getting pregnant . [ iv ]
When male rats were fed GM soy , their testicles actually changed color - from the normal pink to dark blue . [ v ]
Mice fed GM soy had altered young sperm . [ vi ]
Even the embryos of GM fed parent mice had significant changes in their DNA .
[ vii ]
Mice fed GM corn in an Austrian government study had fewer babies , which were also smaller than normal .
[ viii ]
Reproductive problems also plague livestock .
Investigations in the state of Haryana , India revealed that most buffalo that ate GM cottonseed had complications such as premature deliveries , abortions , infertility , and prolapsed uteruses .
Many calves died .
In the US , about two dozen farmers reported thousands of pigs became sterile after consuming certain GM corn varieties .
Some had false pregnancies ; others gave birth to bags of water .
Cows and bulls also became infertile when fed the same corn . [ ix ]
In the US population , the incidence of low birth weight babies , infertility , and infant mortality are all escalating .
Food designed to produce toxin
GM corn and cotton are engineered to produce their own built - in pesticide in every cell .
When bugs bite the plant , the poison splits open their stomach and kills them .
Biotech companies claim that the pesticide , called Bt - produced from soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis - has a history of safe use , since organic farmers and others use
Bt bacteria spray for natural insect control .
Genetic engineers insert
Bt genes into corn and cotton , so the plants do the killing .

The entire presumption of the Obama - proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency is that banks and mortgage companies are under - regulated by the state .
This is why the financial meltdown took place — never mind that the federal regulatory Gosplan includes tens of thousands of pages purporting to regulate the mortgage industry alone .
Let ’s leave aside the unknown costs that will be associated with new regulations — ever more hoops to jump through , more paperwork , more confusing terms for lenders and borrowers alike , more government controls that harm consumers as much as or more than producers .
The core problem here is that none of this rigmarole has anything to do with the real reason for the meltdown .
The role that legislation plays in sending signals to real - world market participants is tiny by comparison to the role of market prices , among which are the interest rate .
Here is the signal that is organic to the market economy , generated by the choices and values of all the people in society .
Prices are the market ’s intrinsic method for allocating resources according to the priorities of individuals .
These prices include the exchange ratios for final products and prices all up and down the structure of production .
They also include wages , the market signal that regulates relations between workers and employers .
But for the investment sector , the critical price signal is the interest rate .
It is this which rewards and punishes investment decisions .
It conveys information about the capacity of consumers to purchase in the future .
A high interest rate indicates a lack of saving and a shift toward more present - oriented economic decisions .
Conversely , a low interest rate tells lenders and borrowers that there is plenty of spare saving to go around .
In the early 2000s , the Federal Reserve manipulated the interest rate in a downward direction , one which was not justified by market realities .
This action misled consumers and producers to undertake investments that were unsustainable .
In particular , financial energy poured into the housing market , a sector which had been a political priority for successive presidential administrations .
To understand the implications , imagine if a fine restaurant advertised a five - course meal and French wine for all comers , at $ 1 each .
Would the customers be exuberant ?
You bet .
They would be wild with anticipation , choosing to stand in a line and hang out at the restaurant rather than do other things with their time .
The restaurant would be packed and happy , though of course it could n’t sustain this in the long run , but the fun is great while it lasts .
At some point , reality kicks in .
The manager notes that there are no more tables and maybe no more food .
The employees are exhausted .
Moreover , the balance sheets do n’t line up : they are losing money on every meal they serve .
At some point , the manager is going to have to announce the bad news and everyone is going to have to go home .
This is roughly what happened with the current boom and bust .
Policy makers , however , seem to be under the assumption that they can keep the boom going on forever simply by dropping the interest rate ever lower .
This is something like a restaurant owner thinking that he can continue to have people wait in line even though he has no tables or food or servers remaining .
It is a physical and economic impossibility for him to make good on his promises .
$ 29 $ 25
At some point in this process , people begin to drift away and go on to other things .
The manager can continue to advertise $ 1 meals in the hope of stimulating his business but this is simply illusion .
No one is buying it ; even if they did , the restaurant ca n’t make the balance sheets work out .
We can venture a prediction here that this restaurant will not be stimulated .
It will enter into a prolonged period of inactivity until nothing is left .
This is precisely what the Obama administration is attempting to do .
So you can see that regulations in this climate mean absolutely nothing .
You can pass a regulation that says : “ All customers must continue to wait in line ” or that “ all meals that have been promised must be delivered ” or that “ restaurants must keep stores of food and wine on hand for high - traffic days ” but none of them really apply because the core problem has deeper roots .
The regulations are even destructive , because they end up applying to everyone alike , the good restaurants that are telling the truth and the bad ones that continue to mislead people .
Even the establishment of a Restaurant Customer Protection Agency is not going to fix up this situation , which is already hopeless .
Creating an agency like this only ends up mucking up a system that is otherwise self - correcting .
The Bush administration began the ridiculous economic boom as a way of preventing a recession that was underway already at the time of the 2001 terrorist attacks .
Creating funny money via low interest rates was the Bush way of fighting back against the terrorists .
Very stupid , because look where it got us .
We have experienced the worst financial panic on record , which has devastated us economically far more than the terror attacks .
This is why Obama ’s fix - it plans are based on a denial of reality .
The downturn might eventually end , but with ever more regulations imposed on the system , we might find ourselves never again living in a vibrant and prosperous society .

If real life were a movie , instead of a cruel and horrifying string of random unfolding events , the mortifying slow - motion car crash that is Gordon Brown 's premiership would inspire pity in all but the most stone - hearted audience member .
Assailed from all directions , stumbling , bumbling , droning , punch - drunk , hapless , hopeless , and aching with palpable misery , he increasingly resembles a depressed elephant , slowly being felled by a thousand pin-sized arrows fired into his hide by a million tiny natives , still somehow moving forward , trudging wearily toward its allotted graveyard - slot with morose resignation .
Here is a man apparently allergic to luck .
Nothing goes right for the Brown minister .
He can't even pop on to YouTube and attempt a smile without everyone laughing and calling him creepy .
And they 're right .
The smiles were creepy : they made him look like the long - dead corpse of a gameshow host resurrected by a crazed scientist in some satirical horror movie .
It 's Saturday night , live from Television Centre !
The theme tune plays on a church organ .
Your children shriek when he bounds on to the screen .
As he descends the glittering staircase , one decomposing arm drops off at the shoulder socket , hitting the studio floor with a damp thud .
Oblivious , he steps over it to approach camera one , gazing down the lens with frozen eyes , intermittently twitching that smile .
Your screen cracks .
Hot plasma leaks out .
This broadcast is over .
In fact Brown 's extended drubbing has gone far beyond mere eeriness , and now teeters on the verge of harrowing spectacle - a protracted humiliation so total , so crushing , that merely witnessing it feels almost as terrible as being the man on its receiving end .
It 's like someone 's dropped an indignity bomb directly on his head , and we 're all caught up in the blast .
Normally , to experience this sort of shared mutual shame , you would have to stumble unannounced into a room and unexpectedly catch someone doing something acutely embarrassing , such as masturbating or miming to Kaiser Chiefs in front of a mirror .
Following 10 crushed eons of infinite silence , both parties would stare at the ground for a few moments , you 'd mutter a dented apology about knocking first next time , inch your way backwards through the door as though quietly observing a religious ceremony , and spend the next half hour standing in the corridor cringing your skin inside out .
From then on you 'd share your painful - yet - private little circle of grief in silence , the pair of you implicitly understanding that The Incident Must Never Be Referred To Again .
That 's what would happen on a personal level .
This is different .
This is national .
We 're all witnesses to The Incident .
And I do n't know about you , but I 'm finding the tension unbearable .
I can't wait for the general election - not because I want to see Prime Minister Wormface Cameron smugging his way into Downing Street , because I do n't - but just because I do n't think I can bear this mishap - strewn landscape a moment longer .
It 's like being trapped in a hot room filled with an overpowering fart smell , waiting for someone outside to come along and open the window .
In the meantime , is there anything Brown can do ?
On Friday , Simon Jenkins suggested in this paper that a hastily orchestrated overseas war might save the prime minister 's bacon , although , given his track record for bumbling calamity , picking a fight with an entire country seems ridiculously ambitious .
Maybe he could declare war on a small town - something the size of Newbury or Ashby de la Zouch .
Do n't worry about the motive - just make something up .
Claim the inhabitants were illegally stockpiling Tamiflu or something , then pound them for a fortnight using all the murderous technology the Ministry of Defence can muster .
Use something exotic .
Something you have to drop from a Super Huey .
Something that whooshes and goes bang and looks cool in widescreen .
Dish out a medal each time one of the residents gets a leg shot off .
And when everyone 's dead , or at least they 've stopped twitching , plant a flag in the council offices , pop up some " Mission Accomplished " bunting and plough through the market square in a whopping great tank for a photo opportunity and press conference .
Failing that , simply bursting into tears on live TV might be a good move .
Pay a visit to This Morning for an ostensibly upbeat chat about how this whole government thing 's been working out for you , then suddenly go quiet and well up .
Wait till Phillip Schofield puts a hand on your shoulder before letting rip - but when you let rip , really LET RIP .
Wail .
Howl .
Punch the cushions .
Quake with sobs .
Say you 're sorry for all the mistakes and beg for a chance to put it all right .
Make stuff up if necessary .
Pretend you 've been a heroin addict or something like that .
Weep 16 litres right there on the sofa if you have to .
Or tell a joke !
A bad one !
Anything !
Do any - thing !
Please - just do something to clear the air .
Because the public still has a few pity cells left .
Many will forgive you .
I 'm not sure everyone believes the current mess is entirely your fault .
It 's just the tragic - comic misery and embarrassment of it all .
It 's too much for our embattled nation to bear .
It 's awful .
Truly awful .

KIDNAPPED : Gangs are suspected of killing the elderly and selling their bodies
The bereaved in southern China are buying substitute bodies for the cremation and secretly burying their dead relatives , according to press reports .
Cremation is promoted as hygienic and space - saving , and in some regions it is obligatory .
However , many believe if a body is burnt the spirit will be angry and misfortune will befall descendants .
If it has the proper rites the spirit is content in the next world and protects relatives .
Although nationwide only one per cent of the population is cremated , in the county of Jieyang in Canton , where it is mandatory , the figure is 100 per cent .
The sinister theory is emerging that many of the bodies are elderly people living alone who have been snatched and murdered .
Several gangs are reported to be involved in the trade of substitute corpses , charging 10,000 yuan ( almost £ 1,000 ) .

Debris spotted by planes 650 km ( 400 miles ) off Brazil 's coast belongs to a missing French airliner , Brazilian and French officials have confirmed .
A search plane saw a band of wreckage in a 5 km ( 3 mile ) strip , Brazil 's Defence Minister Nelson Jobim said .
A Brazilian navy ship is expected to arrive in the area shortly to begin the task of recovering wreckage .
Flight AF 447 was heading from Rio to Paris with 228 people on board when it was lost early on Monday .
France is to hold religious ceremonies to remember the missing , while three days of national mourning have been declared in Brazil .
Late on Tuesday , Mr Jobim told reporters in Rio de Janeiro he had no doubt the debris was from the Air France jet .
He gave few details of the wreckage , saying only that it included metallic and non-metallic pieces .
On Wednesday , senior French military official Capt Christophe Prazuck confirmed the discovery .
TIMELINE
Flight AF 447 left Rio at 1900 local time ( 2200 GMT ) on Sunday Airbus A330 - 200 carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew Contact lost 0130 GMT Missed scheduled landing at 1110 local time ( 0910 GMT ) in Paris
Timeline of Flight AF 447
Air disasters timeline Mystery of Air France flight
" While formal confirmation must still be obtained by recovering debris and carrying out technical analysis , there is no longer any room for doubt , " Capt Prazuck told Agence France - Presse news agency .
An aeroplane seat , an orange buoy and signs of fuel have been spotted in the ocean .
Recording devices
If it is confirmed that all 228 people on Flight AF 447 are dead , it will be the worst loss of life in Air France 's history .
" The last bit of hope that we had no longer exists , " said Aldair Gomes , whose son was a passenger on the plane .
" Before , a lot of us were hoping that the plane could have landed on an island or something like that , but no more . "
The first Brazilian naval vessel is due to arrive in the zone where the debris was found on Wednesday morning .
The navy says the weather in the area is poor .
It is hoped that the ship will be able to recover wreckage that will give some clue as to why the plane fell from the sky .
Three merchant vessels are already in the area after being diverted to help with the operation .
Search teams are hoping to locate the plane 's cockpit voice and data recorders , which will give the clearest information about what happened .
But Mr Jobim warned that recovering the devices could be difficult .
" It could be at a depth of 2,000 m or 3,000 m [ 6,500 ft - 9,800 ft ] in that area of the ocean , " he said .
The recorders send signals for about 30 days .
The US has despatched specialist radar equipment to the area to hunt for the recorder , and France is also sending a research ship equipped with two mini-submarines .
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said the teams were " in a race against the clock " .
He told parliament that the cause of the plane 's loss had still to be established .
" Our only certainty is that the plane did not send out any distress call but regular automatic alerts for three minutes indicating the failure of all systems , " he said .
Experts remain puzzled that there were no radio reports from the Airbus and they say that such a modern aircraft would have had to suffer multiple traumas to plunge into the sea , the BBC's Adam Mynott reports from Paris .
Most of the missing people are Brazilian or French but they include a total of 32 nationalities .
Five Britons and three Irish citizens are among them .
David Cameron 's swift response yesterday to the damning revelations of abuses of the expenses system by a number of his MPs was a demonstration of the Tory leader 's political surefootedness .
By announcing that members of the Shadow Cabinet will pay back claims which look excessive ( and that if Tory backbenchers fail to do the same they will be expelled from the party )
Mr Cameron showed that his concern is for action , rather than words .
The Conservative leader also spoke passionately of why it is vital for the Tories , as a party that has been so critical of Labour 's wasteful public spending , to set a moral lead on this matter .
Mr Cameron knows that , for the country at large , the abuse of expenses is not only about the sums involved , but feeds into broader concerns over the trustworthiness of the entire political class .
But impressive though Mr Cameron 's performance was , shoring up public confidence in the probity of the Conservative Party will be a tough and incremental job .
None of the mainstream parties has emerged well from the expenses scandal .
But the revelations pose a special problem for the Conservatives because of the party 's recent image problems .
The news that Tory MPs have claimed taxpayers ' money to pay for the upkeep of moats , tennis courts and chandeliers is a serious public relations upset for Mr Cameron , threatening to undermine all his work in brand decontamination .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Such details serve to reinforce an old stereotype of the plutocratic Conservative grandee , hopelessly out of touch with the majority of British people , while in possession of a grotesque sense of self - entitlement .
They could also undermine the central Conservative argument that , if elected , the party will restore rectitude to the public finances .
What chance of that , people might ask , when some Tory MPs regard £ 1,000 gardening bills for their private estates as an appropriate use of taxpayers ' cash ?
Of course , for the public to blame Mr Cameron personally for the hypocrisy and greed of some of his backbench MPs would be grossly unfair .
Mr Cameron did not choose the Conservative parliamentary party ; he inherited it when he won the leadership .
And those MPs who have abused the system most egregiously are not part – and were never likely to be part – of his frontbench team .
Additionally , Mr Cameron has made commendable efforts to modernise the Conservative Party in recent years , ditching the old vote - losing Tory obsessions over Europe , tax cuts and immigration .
And his frontbench 's focus on improving Britain 's public services , rather than devising ways for the wealthy to bypass them , is welcome too .
In recent years , Mr Cameron has dragged his party back from the unelectable fringes to the centre ground of politics .
It would be a travesty if the " lord of the manor " lifestyle of some of his more irrelevant backbench MPs were to distract public attention from that achievement .
The Conservative leader made a fine start yesterday in repairing the damage , underlining his political astuteness .
But sceptics will inevitably wonder whether he would have announced quite such resolute reforms of the system if these damning details had not come to light in the way they did .
Mr Cameron would probably accept that , for all the progress made in recent years , the job of decontaminating the Conservative brand is still not quite complete .

Advertisement Pope Benedict XVI has warned against the misuse of religion for political ends , in a speech to Muslim leaders on the second day of his visit to Jordan .
Speaking in the King Hussein Mosque in Amman , he argued that religion was a force for good , but its " manipulation " caused divisions and even violence .
The pontiff is also due to visit Israel and the West Bank on an eight - day tour .
Analysts say he is keen to improve ties with the Islamic world .
A speech he made in 2006 offended many Muslims .
Some groups in Jordan had called for him to apologise for the speech , in which he quoted a medieval scholar who criticised the Prophet Muhammad .
POPE'S MIDDLE - EAST SCHEDULE
On Sunday Pope gives an open - air Mass and will pray at Wadi Kharrar on the east bank of the River Jordan , where Christians believe Jesus was baptised .
On Monday Pope travels to Tel Aviv for four days in Israel and the Palestinian territories .
While there he will visit a Palestinian refugee camp and is also due to visit Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank .

The pontiff expressed regret at the time for the way his speech was interpreted , and did not refer to it during his address at the Amman mosque .
Nonetheless , on Saturday the top religious adviser to Jordan 's king mentioned the controversy .
" I would like to thank you for expressing regret over the lecture in 2006 , which hurt the feelings of Muslims , " Prince Ghazi bin Mohammed told the Pope .
" We realise that the visit [ to Jordan ] comes as a goodwill gesture and a sign of mutual respect between Muslims and Christians . "
The BBC's David Willey , travelling with the Pope , says the pontiff is trying hard to show that the Catholic Church is anxious to foster greater respect , both for the beliefs the two faiths hold in common and for the areas where they differ .
But the Pope 's efforts come amid misunderstandings and a lack of mutual comprehension , our correspondent says .
' Catalyst for tension '
During his address in Amman , the pontiff called on Jordan 's Muslims and Christians to work together to improve their society .

BBC News , Amman
Pope Benedict has been treading an exceedingly careful path since his arrival here in order not to do or say anything in public likely to offend either his Muslim hosts or the Jewish authorities who will be his hosts in Jerusalem next week .
But even so , there has been some carping .
Earlier in the day , the Pope talked of inseparable bonds between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people .
Some clerics in Jordan reacted angrily .
Others remarked that the Pope had failed to remove his shoes when he visited the mosque in accordance with Muslim custom .
All I can say is that I too was allowed to enter the mosque before the Pope 's arrival without removing my shoes .
" Some assert that religion is necessarily a cause of division in our world and so they argue that the lesser attention given to religion in the public sphere the better , " he said .
" Certainly , the contradiction of tensions and divisions between the followers of different religious traditions , sadly , can not be denied .
" However , is it not also the case that often it is the ideological manipulation of religion , sometimes for political ends , that is the real catalyst for tension and division , and at times even violence in society ? "
As he arrived in Amman on Friday he described himself as a " pilgrim of peace " .
Jordan 's King Abdullah welcomed the Pope to " the heartland of faiths for Christians and Muslims alike " .
The 82 - year - old Pope praised Jordan 's " respect for religion " .
The Pope 's visit is aimed at encouraging the minority Christian community in the Middle East , and creating a better dialogue with Muslims and Jews .
As well as his 2006 speech to which some Muslims took offence , the Pope has also upset some Jews recently by rescinding the ex-communication of a Holocaust - denying bishop .

Last month , the Mondrian Hotel in South Beach unveiled the Semi Automatic vending machine , which dispenses 24 kt gold handcuffs , Gaultier dresses , and the keys to a 1965 Corvette convertible .
You may think it 's truly unique , but in a world of bizarre vending machines , the Semi Automatic does not stand alone .
Here are ten other examples .
1. Poetry
According to their website , Gumball Poetry is a non-profit literary magazine that publishes the best poetry it can get a hold of .
But they publish it differently " “ into gumball machines , with a suggested price of fifty cents .
If you 'd like your very own , they go for $ 300 , and your first 200 poetry capsules are free .
Could be the perfect thing to go next to the lamp .
2. Medical Marijuana
For over a year , Glaucoma patients in California have had a 24/7 option to cure what ails them .
Marijuana AVM machines are protected by round - the - clock security guards , and offer a choice of five varieties , including OG Cush and Granddaddy Purple .
Future plans include adding Vicodin , Viagra , and Propecia .
I 'd also work on the cabinet design ( maybe one of those old blacklight posters ) .
3. Church Candles
I do n't have much on this one , but it looks like there are cathedrals in Barcelona and the Canary Islands where you can light a candle dispensed from a special candle vending machine .

4. iPods
This little beauty was first spotted at Hartsfield - Atlanta International Airport in 2006 .
It stocks batteries , digital cameras and iPod minis .
The machines spread to several other airports , and last year Apple placed them in Macy 's , because you never want to be too far from your favorite tunes .
5. Beer Atop Mount Fuji
Mount Fuji is located in Fuji - Hakone - Izu national park in Japan .
But if you plan to scale the country 's highest peak , you do n't need to bring a six - pack to celebrate once you 've made it to the top .
There 's a vending machine already there to quench any and all thirsts .
But please do n't get too buzzed , as you 've still got a long climb down .

6. Tiny Works of Art
Here 's the one entry on the list I 've actually seen in person .
They 've had one of these Art - o - Mat vending machines at the Whitney Museum for quite a few years .
Made from recycled cigarette machines , they dispense tiny works of original art for five dollars a pop .
There are 82 active machines across the US , and they dispense work from 400 artists .
Perfect for the aspiring collector on a budget .
7. Live Lobsters ( of course )
You 've probably seen articles on strange vending machines before .
And hopefully I 've included a few new ones .
But I was n't about to leave out one of the classics " “ the live lobster vending machine .
I 've never seen one in person , but the idea of a claw game to pick up a live animal is strangely appealing to me .
Ca n't say it does much for the lobsters , though .
8. Rhinoceros Beetles
Speaking of live animals , Rhinoceros beetles are very popular pets in Japan .
Young Japanese boys will collect them , trade them and have beetle fights .
Vending machines offer male beetles for 300 yen , and females for 100 .
Apparently , news of the US Fair Pay Act has n't made its way into the Japanese Rhino Beetle population .
9. Used Panties
I wo n't spend too much time on this one .
Let 's just say there were once vending machines in Japan that offered used women 's undergarments .
And you thought the beetles were wacky .
10 . Fine China
I 've saved my absolute favorite for last .
The Passive Aggressive Anger Release is an interactive sculpture that lets you experience the satisfying feeling of breaking a piece of China into a million tiny pieces , leaving you content and stress - free .
I 'm not sure where these things are , but I 've worked in a few office environments that could use half a dozen on each floor .
Could be a new business opportunity .

How long would the legendary Japanese Warship Yamato be , built out of LEGO bricks ?
That ’s the question Jumpei Mitsui asked himself since he was a young boy .
Now a third year student , Jumpei has answered his own question by building a LEGO model of the Yamato .
It took the young Japanese 6 years and 4 months to finish his masterpiece , using 200,000 LEGO bricks .
The LEGO warship is built at a scale of 1/40 , weighs over 150 kilograms , measures 6.6 meters from bow to stern and is 1 meter wide at the widest point of the ship .
Jumpei Mitsui finished the LEGO Yamato on April 9 , 2009 and he deserves our congratulations .
Well done my friend .

A blow to consumers .
Today the United States Senate sided with the banks and credit card industry and refused to put a cap on interest rates to consumers .
I do n't know anyone who does not have a credit card , who have not had their limit decreased or their interest rates increased , despite being a timely consumer that pays the bills when due .
This is a devastating blow and just shows you that change do n't mean a damn thing in the senate .
It is business as usual , it is filling their campaign coffers as usual by the usual suspects , the lobbyists representing these corrupt industries .
Despite complaints that banks and credit card companies are gouging customers by charging outrageous interest rates , the Senate on Wednesday easily turned back an effort to cap interest rates at 15 percent .
The effort by Senator Bernie Sanders , the Vermont independent , drew only 33 votes and needed 60 , with a bipartisan group of 60 senators opposing it as the Senate pushed its credit card overhaul toward the finish line .
Some Democrats and consumer groups have said that an interest cap is needed to put real teeth into an otherwise solid bill .
Other backers of the measure calculated that an interest rate ceiling would doom the popular legislation .
The banking industry , which had some heavy - weight representatives monitoring the vote off of the Senate floor , warned that an interest rate limit could cause a sour reaction in the financial markets .
Democrats
When Dick Durbin said the banks owned the Senate , he was quite right .
I do n't get it .
Again , the Senate is in the hands of special interests , not the American people .
Lobbyists on the floor of the senate performing strong arm tactics to these senators .

Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hopes US leader 's winning words will work for him too as he seeks second term
This article is more than 11 years old

Barack Obama 's offer of a hand of friendship to Iran after 30 years of hostility may have met with a sceptical public response from Tehran .
But now a rapprochement of sorts may be under way amid evidence that the US president 's can - do electioneering tactics have struck a chord with his Iranian counterpart , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Obama 's signature campaign slogan , Yes We Can , has been replicated by the Iranian president in a promotional video issued for Iran 's presidential poll on 12 June , when Ahmadinejad is seeking re-election .
The video features a cover picture of Ahmadinejad wearing his trademark white jacket and pointing to the Farsi phrase Ma Mitavanim ( We Can ) on a blackboard .
The film is aimed at students and capitalises on his former status as a university lecturer .
Its release coincides with that of another campaign video apparently attempting to trump Obama by recounting Ahmadinejad 's visit to Turkey .
Obama won international acclaim during a visit to Turkey this month for declaring that the US was " not at war " with Islam and stressing that there were Muslims in his family .
Ahmadinejad 's visit last August was arguably less successful .
The Islamist president was deprived of full state honours after declining to pay homage to the tomb of Turkey 's secular founder , Ataturk , in Ankara .
He also endured the indignity of Turkey withdrawing from an anticipated lucrative natural gas contract , partly because of American pressure .
There was further discord when Istanbul residents complained of huge traffic jams caused by security measures for the visit .
The films have been distributed during Ahmadinejad 's recent public appearances in and around Tehran .
Another video focuses on his provincial trips across Iran , a hallmark of his presidency .
Ahmadinejad 's surprise election win four years ago was partly attributed to a promotional film that depicted him as a humble man who empathised with the poor .

" With more changes being requested by the business and less time allowed to turn around those changes , we 've fallen a bit behind on our deadlines , " writes Zarar S , " so I requested that we bring on a contractor to help fill in .
It was a long shot , but hey , anything not to come in to the office weekend after weekend . "
" Amazingly , " Zarar continues , " the Powers That Be granted my request and added a ' twenty - year veteran ' with ' great Java experience ' to my team .
One of the first things I asked him to do was write a compareTo ( ) method on our Activity classes and integrate them into our reporting subsystem .
After a day or so of hard work , this is what the expert came up with . "
public int compareTo ( Object obj ) { return ( int ) (( getVarianceAmount ( ) - ( ( OfferedActivity ) obj).getVarianceAmount ( ) ) ) ; }
" Since getVarianceAmount ( ) returned a float , I pointed him to the error of his ways .
Surely , as an expert , he 'd realize that compareTo ( ) would return 0 ( i.e. equal ) for something like 3.2 and 3.1 , and must have made a simple mistake .
A couple hours later , he applied the following fix . "
public int compareTo ( Object obj ) { return ( int ) ( 100.0 * ( getVarianceAmount ( ) - ( ( OfferedActivity ) obj).getVarianceAmount ( ) ) ) ; }
" It mostly went downhill from there .
And yes , I 'm still coming in the office , weekend after weekend . "

The Two Main Trends in Anarchism international | anarchist movement | feature Thursday June 25 , 2009 20:16 Thursday June 25 , 2009 20:16 by Wayne Price - Personal opinion by Wayne Price - Personal opinion drwdprice at aol dot com Alternate Tendencies of Anarchism
There are two main trends in anarchism , which agree on antistatism and anticapitalism and opposition to all oppression , but disagree on revolution , democracy , prefigurative politics , and class struggle .
It has been stated by various theorists that there are two main trends in modern anarchism .
How they are conceptualized varies with the writer .
I will state how I see the two broad tendencies in the anarchist movement , using the books Anarchy Alive !
( Uri Gordon ) and Black Flame ( Micahel Schmidt & Lucien Van der Walt ) to illustrate the two trends .
I will describe them as differing on the issues of revolution or reformism , of democracy , of what prefigurative politics  mean , and of attitudes toward the working class .

The Two Main Trends in Anarchism Alternate Tendencies of Anarchism by Wayne Price
Uri Gordon ( 2008 ) .
Anarchy Alive !
Michael Schmidt & Lucien van der Walt ( 2009 ) .
Black Flame .
It has been stated by various theorists that there are two main trends in modern anarchism .
How they are conceptualized varies with the writer .
I will state how I see the two broad tendencies in the anarchist movement , using the above two books to illustrate the two trends ( this is particularly not a review of Black Flame ) .
I will describe them as differing on the issues of revolution or reformism , of democracy , of what prefigurative politics  mean , and of attitudes toward the working class .
Near the beginning of a recent book on anarchism by Uri Gordon ( 2008 ) , an Israeli anarchist , the author discusses the most prominent division among anarchists .
He starts with the way this was framed by David Graeber ( 2002 ) of the U.S. as between a minority tendency of sectarian or capital - A anarchist groups ,  which have developed , dogmatic , political programs , and a majority tendency of small - a anarchists  who are the real locus of historical dynamism right now  and who are much looser programmatically ( Gordon 2008 ; p.23 - 24 ; for my views on Graebers anarchism , see Price 2007 ) .
The only group Graeber referred to as sectarian , dogmatic , big - A , anarchist , was the Northeastern Federation of Anarchist - Communists ( I am a member of NEFAC , but not an official spokesperson ) .
Gordon thinks there is something to Graebers distinction , but that it should be more subtly  interpreted .
First of all , capital - A groups are hardly a minority tendency [ having ] many thousands of members  ( p. 24 ) .
This is especially true if we include the memberships of the anarchist - syndicalist unions in Europe and elsewhere .
Contrary to charges of  sectarianism  and dogmatism ,  Gordon notes that most platformists  do not regard Makhnos Organizational Platform of 1926 as a sacred text but treat it as a beginning for discussion .
( Often , calling someone dogmatic is a writers way of saying that someone disagrees with the writer and is stubbornly refusing to accept the writers opinion . )
Instead , Gordon sees the distinction between the two tendencies as over political culture ( this is a non-ideological way of discussing differences ) .
One trend ( the capital - A anarchists ) identifies with  the traditional political culture of the anarchist movement established before the Second World War ( p.25 ) .
He says that they have formal structures with elected officials , and that decisions are often made through votes .
They emphasize workplace organizing , anti-war actions , and publishing their ideas .
The other ( small - a ) trend does not care much about anarchist traditions , has only informal groups , makes decisions by consensus , and , he writes , focuses on ecology , identity politics , experimental community , and Eastern spirituality .
 The difference between the two anarchisms is generational an  Old School and a  New School ( same ) .
Without wanting to denounce the Old School anarchists , Gordon ( like Graeber ) is plainly on the side of the New School of anarchism .
( He is not always so nonsectarian ; later in his book , he angrily denounces my views on Israel / Palestine which is not directly related to my topic here ; see pp. 149151 ; responded to in Price 2009 ) .
While I think that Gordon has accurately distinguished the two main trends in current anarchism , I do not think that Old versus New is a useful way to understand the division .
Many of the so - called New School views he cites can be found way back in anarchist history , starting with Proudhon and Stirner and others .
Gordon specifically cites Gustav Landauers concepts from 1911 , to illustrate his own views .
Many of these ideas were raised by Paul Goodman and Colin Ward , among other anarchists , in the 60s and 70s .
Few of the New Schools ideas are all that new .
The Broad Anarchist Tradition
However the distinction as such is valid .
What Gordon calls the Old School and Graeber calls capital - A anarchism is called  the broad anarchist tradition by Schmidt & van der Walt ( 2009 ) of the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front in South Africa .
This is the tradition of anarchism from Michael Bakunin to Peter Kropotkin to Emma Goldman to Nestor Makhno , including those who called themselves anarchist - communists and anarchist - syndicalists .
Most people who called themselves anarchists historically were in this tradition .
Almost the only thing in Black Flame with which I disagree is that it regards anyone outside the broad anarchist tradition as not being anarchist ,  although they may be libertarian . 
Class struggle anarchism , sometimes called revolutionary or communist anarchism , is not a TYPE of anarchism ; in our view , it is the ONLY anarchism 
( Schmidt & van der Walt 2009 ; p. 19 ) .
Since Proudhon was neither for class struggle , nor revolution , nor communism , even he does not make the cut ; he only influenced  anarchism , similar to Marx .
This approach is pointless .
There are , and have been , a great many people who call themselves anarchists  who do not fit in the mainstream of anarchism .
However they are anti-statist and anticapitalist , while often regarding themselves as revolutionaries .
It is indeed worth pointing out that they are not part of the main tradition , but is it useful to argue about whether or not they are really anarchists ?
That does make us look like sectarians and dogmatists .
We should argue about the content of their beliefs ( that they are mistaken in their politics ) rather than their label .
As noted , Gordon does not deny that his so - called New School does not follow  the traditional political culture of the anarchist movement .
He just does not care , and may even find this a virtue .
Political Differences between the Two Trends : On Revolution
To get to the real differences between the two trends of anarchism , it is necessary to look at the serious political differences between them not at an nonideological culture ,  but at actual politics .
The broad anarchist tradition ( class struggle anarchist - communism or Old School anarchism or whatever ) has always been revolutionary .
That is , its members have believed that the ruling class is extremely unlikely to give up power without resistance , a resistance which will center on its state .
A vast movement of the oppressed and exploited must rise up and smash the state and dismantle the capitalist economy and all other forms of oppression .
These must be replaced by new forms of popular self - organization and self - management .
This does not contradict the struggle for present - day reforms and improvements , but sets a strategic end - goal .
Gordon is typical of the New School anarchists ( or whatever ) in that he rejects such a revolutionary approach .
Traditional anarchists , he writes , used to argue about a how to organize society after a revolution .
 Today , in contrast , anarchist discourse lacks both the expectation of eventual revolutionary closure  or interest in visions of a post - revolutionary society ( Gordon 2008 ; p. 40 ) .
Further , anarchists today do not tend to think of revolution if they even use the termas a future event but rather as a present - day process  ( p. 41 ) .
Instead of changing all society , which may or may not be possible , he writes , anarchists should promote anarchy as culture  which may include large events but also fleeting moments of nonconformism and carefree egalitarianism ( same ) .
Hakim Beys Temporary Autonomous Zones are cited , which , he says , might include a quilting bee or dinner party  .
Not that nonconformism and dinner parties are bad ; quite the contrary .
But they are not a strategy for popularly overturning the capitalist state .
Nor does Gordon worry about this .
 The development of non-heirarchical structures is , for most anarchists , an end in itself ( p. 35 ) .
Gordon never says right out loud that his tendency has given up on revolution , but I cannot read this any other way .
To sound radical , Gordon and other anarchists insist that it is un-anarchist to make demands on the state , to try to win benefits by threatening the state or the capitalist class .

A politics of demand extends undue recognition and legitimation to state power a strategy far removed from anarchism ( p. 151 ) .
Instead , anarchists are supposed to create a better world by directly acting differently toward each other .
But anarchists have always made demands on the state , such as to stop waging specific wars or to release prisoners or to provide social benefits .
It is one way to demonstrate to nonanarchists that the state cannot be relied on but must be threatened to win gains .
And we have made demands on capitalists , as in fighting for union recognition or better working conditions .
Refusing to make demands on the state or on the capitalists may sound very radical ( as if they care whether anarchists give them recognition and legitimation ! ) but it is a reformist cop -out , an abdication of the struggle .
Gordon emphasizes  prefigurative politics .
Both schools  of anarchism would agree on the importance of building non-heirarchical institutions in the here - and - now .
But to Gordon and his tendency what matters is the interpersonal dynamics of informal networks of anarchists , whether or not they are effective for further purposes .
For the broad anarchist tradition , what matters is building a democratic , popular , counterculture of resistance .
Referring to rent strikes and community organizing ,  Schmidt & van der Walt ( 2009 ) say , as part of the project of building counterpower , mass anarchists built dense and overlapping networks of popular , associational life .
These included threater troupes , neighborhood committees , workers  night - schools , and even popular  ( p. 181 ) .
Gordon does not accept this conception , partly because he does not believe in democracy , even the most radical , participatory , version of direct democracy .
Few anarchists of his trend are as outspoken in rejecting democracy .
( Graeber [ 2002 ] , for example , is for democracy , which he identifies with consensus . )
 Anarchism represents not the most radical form of democracy  but something else ( p. 70 ) .
By this Gordon first seems to mean consensus , but soon explains that he means leadership by a hidden elite when organizing the movement .
 Anarchists are bound to acknowledge that this invisible , subterranean , indeed unaccountable use of power is not only inevitable but also needs to be embraced , since it coheres with their worldview in important respects  ( p.75 ) .
This is consistent with the worst , most undemocratic aspects of Proudhonss and Bakunins thought , which most of anarchism had long abandoned .
In contrast , the view of revolutionary class struggle anarchists is , anarchism would be nothing less than the most complete realization of democracy democracy in the fields , factories , and neighborhoods , coordinated through federal structures and councils from below upward  ( Schmidt & van der Walt 2009 ; p. 70 ) .
It tends to regard use of consensus or voting as a practical issue , not a matter of principle .
Political Differences : On Class
To the broad anarchist tradition , the center of its politics is class based : supporting and rooting itself in the working class and also in the peasantry .
This has also included support for nonclass based struggles around gender , race , nationality , sexual orientation , war , and ecology all issues which overlap with and interact with class .
But it has seen the working class as having a particular power , at least potentially , for stopping the machinery of the system and for starting it up differently .
( An excellent defense of a working class perspective may be found in Meiksins Wood 1998 . )
For this reason , the broad anarchist tradition of class struggle anarchism overlaps with libertarian interpretations of Marx .
At no point does Gordon make a class analysis of the anarchist trend he is describing , nor of any other topic .
As he described the movement , animal liberation ,  among other issues , is as prominent as workers  struggles .
In the latter area , the industrial sector and traditional syndicalism are being replaced by McJobs and self - organized unions of precarious workers  ( p. 5 ) .
This bit of ignorance is almost all his version of anarchism has to offer millions of working people around the globe .
Bookchin and Other Differences
Some readers may wonder how my conception of the two trends of anarchism relates to the distinction made by Murray Bookchin ( 1995 ) between  social anarchism  and lifestyle anarchism . 
Leaving aside Bookchins vitriolic style of argument , there are some similarities .
Bookchins social anarchism is also rooted in anarchist communism and is also for radical democracy .
Many of his criticisms of what he calls lifestyle anarchism are appropriate for what Gordon calls New School anarchism .
But there are problems .
It would be unfair to summarize Gordons views as merely lifestylism .
He , like others , believes in being part of popular movements against capital and the state .
He begins his book begins with his participation in the 2005 anti-G5 demonstrations .
Bookchin , on the other hand , shared all too many of the views of the reformist anarchists .
 Bookchin sought to erect a new anarchist strategy freed of class struggle and hostile to the organized working class  ( Schmidt & van der Walt 2009 ; p. 79 ) .
He his strategy ( libertarian municipalism ) was based on getting elected to local governments .
This is even more reformist than that of the little a -anarchists . 
Eventually , Bookchin stopped calling himself an anarchist .
There is , then , one trend , of revolutionary anarchism , which builds on the broad historical anarchist movement , which is revolutionary in its methods and its goals , which is radically democratic in its means and its prefigured ends , which is centered in the working class but which also supports every other struggle against oppression , and which aims for a libertarian socialist ( communist ) society .
By contrast , Gordon supports a large trend in modern anarchism which I would call reformist anarchism ,  since it is nonrevolutionary in its methods and strategy ( however much it might like to eventually , somehow , see a new society ) .
It does not build on the major insights of traditional anarchism .
It is often undemocratic , in theory at least .
It downplays class issues or ignores them in practice .
It is overtly anticapitalist and presumably socialist or communist , but , without a strategy for revolution to create such a society , this does not mean much in practice .
There are other issues between the two trends as well as within each trend , which I have not covered .
Gordon , for example , is sympathetic to anarchist - primitivism and to anarchist - pacifism , but does not fully agree with either one .
And , as Schmidt & van der Walt point out , the broad anarchist tradition includes a split between insurrectional anarchists and mass struggle anarchists ( see chapter 3 ) , as well as among people with all sorts of views on whether anarchists should organize separately ( chapter 8 on  platformism ) , whether to join unions ( chapters 6 and 7 ) , whether to defend oppressed nations  self - determination ( chapter 10 ) , etc .
This is why it is called the BROAD anarchist tradition !
But the basic ideas are clear .

The other ( small - a ) trend does not care much about anarchist traditions , has only informal groups , makes decisions by consensus , and , he writes , focuses on ecology , identity politics , experimental community , and Eastern spirituality . ( same ) .
Without wanting to denounce the Old School anarchists , Gordon ( like Graeber ) is plainly on the side of the New School of anarchism .
( He is not always so nonsectarian ; later in his book , he angrily denounces my views on Israel / Palestine which is not directly related to my topic here ; see pp. 149151 ; responded to in Price 2009 ) .
While I think that Gordon has accurately distinguished the two main trends in current anarchism , I do not think that Old versus New is a useful way to understand the division .
Many of the so - called New School views he cites can be found way back in anarchist history , starting with Proudhon and Stirner and others .
Gordon specifically cites Gustav Landauers concepts from 1911 , to illustrate his own views .
Many of these ideas were raised by Paul Goodman and Colin Ward , among other anarchists , in the 60s and 70s .
Few of the New Schools ideas are all that new .
However the distinction as such is valid .
What Gordon calls the Old School and Graeber calls capital - A anarchism is called  the broad anarchist tradition by Schmidt & van der Walt ( 2009 ) of the Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front in South Africa .
This is the tradition of anarchism from Michael Bakunin to Peter Kropotkin to Emma Goldman to Nestor Makhno , including those who called themselves anarchist - communists and anarchist - syndicalists .
Most people who called themselves anarchists historically were in this tradition .
Almost the only thing in Black Flame with which I disagree is that it regards anyone outside the broad anarchist tradition as not being anarchist ,  although they may be libertarian .
( Schmidt & van der Walt 2009 ; p. 19 ) .
Since Proudhon was neither for class struggle , nor revolution , nor communism , even he does not make the cut ; he only influenced  anarchism , similar to Marx .
This approach is pointless .
There are , and have been , a great many people who call themselves anarchists  who do not fit in the mainstream of anarchism .
However they are anti-statist and anticapitalist , while often regarding themselves as revolutionaries .
It is indeed worth pointing out that they are not part of the main tradition , but is it useful to argue about whether or not they are really anarchists ?
That does make us look like sectarians and dogmatists .
We should argue about the content of their beliefs ( that they are mistaken in their politics ) rather than their label .
As noted , Gordon does not deny that his so - called New School does not followHe just does not care , and may even find this a virtue .
To get to the real differences between the two trends of anarchism , it is necessary to look at the serious political differences between them not at an nonideological culture ,  but at actual politics .
The broad anarchist tradition ( class struggle anarchist - communism or Old School anarchism or whatever ) has always been revolutionary .
That is , its members have believed that the ruling class is extremely unlikely to give up power without resistance , a resistance which will center on its state .
A vast movement of the oppressed and exploited must rise up and smash the state and dismantle the capitalist economy and all other forms of oppression .
These must be replaced by new forms of popular self - organization and self - management .
This does not contradict the struggle for present - day reforms and improvements , but sets a strategic end - goal .
Gordon is typical of the New School anarchists ( or whatever ) in that he rejects such a revolutionary approach .
Traditional anarchists , he writes , used to argue about a how to organize society after a revolution .
or interest in visions of a post - revolutionary society ( Gordon 2008 ; p. 40 ) .
Further , ( p. 41 ) .
Instead of changing all society , which may or may not be possible , he writes , anarchists should promote anarchy as culture  which may include large events but also ( same ) .
Hakim Beys Temporary Autonomous Zones are cited , which , he says , might include a quilting bee or dinner party  .
Not that nonconformism and dinner parties are bad ; quite the contrary .
But they are not a strategy for popularly overturning the capitalist state .
Nor does Gordon worry about this .( p. 35 ) .
Gordon never says right out loud that his tendency has given up on revolution , but I cannot read this any other way .
To sound radical , Gordon and other anarchists insist that it is un-anarchist to make demands on the state , to try to win benefits by threatening the state or the capitalist class . ( p. 151 ) .
Instead , anarchists are supposed to create a better world by directly acting differently toward each other .
But anarchists have always made demands on the state , such as to stop waging specific wars or to release prisoners or to provide social benefits .
It is one way to demonstrate to nonanarchists that the state cannot be relied on but must be threatened to win gains .
And we have made demands on capitalists , as in fighting for union recognition or better working conditions .
Refusing to make demands on the state or on the capitalists may sound very radical ( as if they care whether anarchists give them recognition and legitimation ! ) but it is a reformist cop -out , an abdication of the struggle .
Gordon emphasizes  prefigurative politics .
Both schools  of anarchism would agree on the importance of building non-heirarchical institutions in the here - and - now .
But to Gordon and his tendency what matters is the interpersonal dynamics of informal networks of anarchists , whether or not they are effective for further purposes .
For the broad anarchist tradition , what matters is building a democratic , popular , counterculture of resistance .
Referring toSchmidt & van der Walt ( 2009 ) say , ( p. 181 ) .
Gordon does not accept this conception , partly because he does not believe in democracy , even the most radical , participatory , version of direct democracy .
Few anarchists of his trend are as outspoken in rejecting democracy .
( Graeber [ 2002 ] , for example , is for democracy , which he identifies with consensus . ) but something else ( p. 70 ) .
By this Gordon first seems to mean consensus , but soon explains that he means leadership by a hidden elite when organizing the movement . ( p.75 ) .
This is consistent with the worst , most undemocratic aspects of Proudhonss and Bakunins thought , which most of anarchism had long abandoned .
In contrast , the view of revolutionary class struggle anarchists is , ( Schmidt & van der Walt 2009 ; p. 70 ) .
It tends to regard use of consensus or voting as a practical issue , not a matter of principle .
To the broad anarchist tradition , the center of its politics is class based : supporting and rooting itself in the working class and also in the peasantry .
This has also included support for nonclass based struggles around gender , race , nationality , sexual orientation , war , and ecology all issues which overlap with and interact with class .
But it has seen the working class as having a particular power , at least potentially , for stopping the machinery of the system and for starting it up differently .
( An excellent defense of a working class perspective may be found in Meiksins Wood 1998 . )
For this reason , the broad anarchist tradition of class struggle anarchism overlaps with libertarian interpretations of Marx .
At no point does Gordon make a class analysis of the anarchist trend he is describing , nor of any other topic .
As he described the movement , animal liberation ,  among other issues , is ( p. 5 ) .
This bit of ignorance is almost all his version of anarchism has to offer millions of working people around the globe .
Some readers may wonder how my conception of the two trends of anarchism relates to the distinction made by Murray Bookchin ( 1995 ) between  social anarchism  and lifestyle anarchism . 
Leaving aside Bookchins vitriolic style of argument , there are some similarities .
Bookchins social anarchism is also rooted in anarchist communism and is also for radical democracy .
Many of his criticisms of what he calls lifestyle anarchism are appropriate for what Gordon calls New School anarchism .
But there are problems .
It would be unfair to summarize Gordons views as merely lifestylism .
He , like others , believes in being part of popular movements against capital and the state .
He begins his book begins with his participation in the 2005 anti-G5 demonstrations .
Bookchin , on the other hand , shared all too many of the views of the reformist anarchists .
( Schmidt & van der Walt 2009 ; p. 79 ) .
He his strategy ( libertarian municipalism ) was based on getting elected to local governments .
This is even more reformist than that of the little a -anarchists . 
Eventually , Bookchin stopped calling himself an anarchist .
There is , then , one trend , of revolutionary anarchism , which builds on the broad historical anarchist movement , which is revolutionary in its methods and its goals , which is radically democratic in its means and its prefigured ends , which is centered in the working class but which also supports every other struggle against oppression , and which aims for a libertarian socialist ( communist ) society .
By contrast , Gordon supports a large trend in modern anarchism which I would call reformist anarchism ,  since it is nonrevolutionary in its methods and strategy ( however much it might like to eventually , somehow , see a new society ) .
It does not build on the major insights of traditional anarchism .
It is often undemocratic , in theory at least .
It downplays class issues or ignores them in practice .
It is overtly anticapitalist and presumably socialist or communist , but , without a strategy for revolution to create such a society , this does not mean much in practice .
There are other issues between the two trends as well as within each trend , which I have not covered .
Gordon , for example , is sympathetic to anarchist - primitivism and to anarchist - pacifism , but does not fully agree with either one .
And , as Schmidt & van der Walt point out , the broad anarchist tradition includes a split between insurrectional anarchists and mass struggle anarchists ( see chapter 3 ) , as well as among people with all sorts of views on whether anarchists should organize separately ( chapter 8 on  platformism ) , whether to join unions ( chapters 6 and 7 ) , whether to defend oppressed nations  self - determination ( chapter 10 ) , etc .
This is why it is called the BROAD anarchist tradition !
But the basic ideas are clear .

WASHINGTON 
The Army has promised to lighten the soldier ’s load , and nowhere more urgently than in eastern Afghanistan , where the unforgiving terrain tests the stamina of troops whose weapons , body armor , rucksacks and survival gear can weigh 130 pounds .
But an experiment to shave up to 20 pounds off a soldier ’s burden  much of it by reducing the bulletproof plates that protect the chest and back  has stalled , leaving $ 3 million in new , lightweight equipment sitting in a warehouse in the United States instead of being sent to the war zone where it was to have been tried out by a battalion - size group of 500 soldiers .
The delay offers a new window into how Army rules have slowed the deployment of specialized gear that small units are seeking for harsh combat environments .
The new lightweight bulletproof plates , part of what is known as a Modular Body Armor Vest , are already in use by the military ’s Special Operations Command , which includes the Army ’s elite light - infantry troops , the Rangers .
A team of Army experts went to eastern Afghanistan in early March expecting to begin trial runs of the gear for regular Army soldiers , including a company assigned to the remote Korangal Valley , a harsh and primitive area of eastern Afghanistan where the insurgency has proved especially resilient , and where soldiers regularly set off on multiple - day patrols that require them to hike up and down steep hills and valleys .
It 's time to reclaim conservatism from Coulter and O'Reilly and Limbaugh and Hannity .
Reihan :
Conservatives do n't need higher volume .
Conservatism at its best is a tough and demanding creed .
To sell it , you can't call people who 've lost their jobs and their homes " losers . "
You need to sell the virtues of a growing and flourishing economy and the free - market policies that will make it happen .
Because conservatives are n't a majority , hard - edged accusations of socialism wind up alienating millions of potential allies -- voters who are a little uncomfortable with Obama 's spending , particularly if it threatens to saddle their children with debt , but who recognize that the government needs to act to stave off an economic collapse .
Take yours truly .
I 'm not a Democrat and if pushed , I 'd have to say right now I 'm a libertarian independent .
I 'm uneasy about Obama 's long - term debt , to say the least , but I 'm intelligent enough to know it 's not Obama 's as such , but mainly Bush's , and I 'm also cognizant that the time to cut back may not be in the middle ( or beginning ) of a brutal depression .
On most issues , I side with what used to be the center - right , but the GOP is poison to me and many others .
Why ?
Their abandonment of limited government , their absurd spending under Bush , their contempt for civil liberties , their rigid mindset , their hostility to others , their worship of the executive branch , their contempt for judicial checks , their cluelessness with racial minorities and immigrants , their endorsement of torture as an American value , their homophobia , their know - nothing Christianism , and the sheer vileness of their leaders - from the dumb - as - a - post Steele to the brittle , money - grubbing cynic , Coulter and hollow , partisan neo-fascist Hannity .
The U.S. job market is n't deteriorating as much as earlier this year , but companies continue to cut workers at a rapid clip .
Private employers cut 532,000 jobs in May , according to a report Wednesday from payroll company Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers , compared with a cut of 545,000 jobs in April .

With the proliferation of social media services the use if URL shorteners has escalated to a point that you ca n’t turn around without another one popping up .
Everyone and their brother it seems whants to be a copycat Web 2.0 service and what easier one to pick that some silly assed URL shortener .
One would hope that at some point the thought would sink in that maybe – just maybe – we have enough ways to shorten and track a URL .
It would appear now that the newest riff on this disease on social media is for us to create our own in the hope that this will cancel out the fear that if some URL shortening service goes down it wo n’t leave dead links that should be pointing to your site ending up instead looking like littered used water bottles across the web .
Hell even my good buddy Mark has rolled his own URL shortener and while I ’m sure he has his reasons I can’t figure out why we need even the number of shorteners we already ( sorry Mark : ) ) .
A lot of fuss was raised recently over a new breed of URL shorteners hitting the web when Digg released its Diggbar that wraps your site within their frames code and provides a URL shortener as part of the deal .
This is similar to what Facebook has done with their web based toolbar and follows along with what Hootsuite , a toolbox of goodies for Twitter users , does with the integration of the ow.ly URL shortener .
Now we find out today that even The New York Times has gotten into the act with their own shortening service .
As I thought about writing this post I wondered just how many URL shortening services there were out there so I did a couple of quick searches and this is what I came up with
91 different URL shortening services and that was only after looking for about half an hour , most of which was spent copying them to the list .
It ’s like URL shorteners has become the new “ Hello World ” for wannabe web developers .
The problem is all they are really doing is creating a potential black hole of broken links at some point in the future .
While some like bit ’.ly have been able to con convince some VCs that there ’s money to be made in all those shortened URL the vast majority of them will assuredly disappear .
As they do they will be leaving a mess behind them but unfortunately like herpes there will always be some new shortening service popping up .
All this does n’t even take into account the obvious abuse by spammers , phishers and virus writers that things like URL shorteners will allow .
As we become blindingly use to clicking on all these shortened URL because of things like Twitter and other social media services it is only a matter of time before shortened URLs blow up in our face .
Update : at the time of posting the URL shortening service from The New York Times has been taken down due to abuse .
Like we did n’t know that was n’t coming .

Unmanned aircraft maker AeroVironment got an additional $ 5.4 million to further develop the diminutive aircraft that can fly into tight spaces undetected , perch and send live surveillance information to its handlers .
Last Fall , AeroVironment , got $ 4.6 million initial funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to develop the Stealthy , Persistent , Perch and Stare Air Vehicle System ( SP2S ) , which is being built on the company 's one - pound , 29 - inch wingspan battery - powered Wasp unmanned system .
According to DARPA , the key technical challenges of the new aircraft include : multifunctional materials that integrate the SP2S airframe structure with the power supply and transmit / receive antennas ; advanced aerodynamics and control systems , including the ability to land and return home automatically ; perch - and - grip technology ; micro miniature pan / tilt / zoom EO cameras ; ( 5 ) autonomous image capture ; and data link communications relay capability with multiple digital channels that enables beyond - line - of - sight communications , with data / video encryption .
Experts say the ability to actually fly in and perch like a bird will be one the more technically challenging aspects of the system .
DARPA said the purpose of SP2S is to verify the utility of such a small perch and Stare system ( currently no such system exists ) .
DARPA said additional work was required to take the military users feedback and refine / upgrade the system to meet diverse requirements of a wide group of users .
This task would then result in the delivery of ten upgraded systems for further testing .
The US Air Force last year gave the go - ahead for full production of the ASP III unmanned aircraft designed to be used for special battlefield operations such as targeting and tracking .
The AeroVironment Wasp III carries interchangeable targeting payload modules , including an infrared camera , along with two integrated color cameras that transmit streaming video directly to the hand - held ground controller for display on an integrated monitor .
It has been procured under the Air Force 's Battlefield Air Targeting Micro Air Vehicle ( BATMAV ) program .
BATMAV systems are expected to let military personnel see over hills and beyond their line of sight in real time and in low light .
The unmanned aircraft are highly portable , durable and can be launched by one person .
The BATMAV aircraft are expected to fly at an altitude of 500 feet , at about 40MPH and staying aloft for up to 90 minutes at a time .
Dick Cheney ( pictured ) says George W. Bush did n't want to be the one to ' pull the plug ' on GM .
Cheney : Bush passed buck on GM
Former Vice President Dick Cheney says that former President George W. Bush did not want to be the one who “ pulled the plug ” on General Motors and instead decided to pass on the issue to President Barack Obama .
“ I thought that , eventually , the right outcome was going to be bankruptcy , ” Cheney said of the company during the second part of interview with Fox News ’ Greta Van Susteren that aired Tuesday night .

“ [GM ] had to go through such a dramatic restructuring to have any chance of survival that they had to be able to renegotiate labor contracts and so forth , ” he said .
“ And the president decided that he did not want to be the one who pulled the plug just before he left office . ”
Cheney said that rather than acting on GM , the Bush administration “ put together a package that tided GM over until the new administration had a chance to look at it . ”

The former vice president stated that the choice was made in order to aid the Obama administration , thinking that forcing GM to restructure late in the Bush term would have dumped on Obama the “ first crises the new administration would have to deal with . ”
“ These are big issues and [ Bush ] would n't be there through the process of managing it , but in effect , would have sort of pulled the plug on GM , ” Cheney said , adding that he and Bush wanted to allow Obama ’s team to “ decide what they wanted to do . ”

On his show tonight Bill O’Reilly said that he thinks that the key to the Republican Party taking back America is to attack Bruce Springsteen .
O’Reilly labeled Springsteen as a far lefty who hates America because he complimented Pete Seeger at his 90th birthday concert .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
O’Reilly went on the attack against Bruce Springsteen because he said , “ At 90 he ( Pete Seeger ) remains a stealth dagger to our countries illusions about itself .
He sings all the verses all the time , especially the ones that we ’d like to leave out about our history as a people . ”
This sent O’Reilly on the war path as he claimed that Springsteen is an example of how the far left hates America .
Remember , Springsteen was talking about Pete Seeger not his own political views .
Advertisements
O’Reilly said of Springsteen , “ Why do n’t you take a look at your mansion , nice car , expensive comforts and get a little perspective .
You ’re a working class guy , right Bruce ?
Capitalism combined with your talent has made you a wealthy guy .
It would not have happened in Venezuela .
Now Bruce Springsteen is not exactly a PhD .
In political science , obviously , but his snide reference to America defines how the far left sees the country , and you know what , most liberal and conservative Americans disagree with him . ”
Speaking of people who obviously are n’t PhDs in political science , O’Reilly ’s big strategy for the Republicans is that they should say that they like America more than the Democrats .
This is Bill ’s big strategy .
The path back to victory for the GOP is to say that Democrats hate America .
It must be pointed out Republicans tried this in the last two elections , and lost each one .
Bruce Springsteen is a Democrat , but since he mentioned that there are some darker sides to American history , according to O’Reilly , this means that he hates America .
There have been many dark moments in American history .
Talking about them does n’t make a person unpatriotic .
O’Reilly has to be really hurting for material if he had to warp some comments by Bruce Springsteen .
At least Bill - O did n’t launch his GE - NBC - Olbermann - Springsteen conspiracy theory yet .
He is probably saving that for tomorrow night .

Bank of America Corp. shareholders flexed enough muscle Wednesday to strip the chairman ’s job from beleaguered Chief Executive Kenneth D. Lewis , in a vote that reflected the bank ’s recent stumbles and the growing clout of union - led activists .
The action , which came during a fractious annual meeting in the company ’s hometown of Charlotte , N.C. , capped a high - stakes showdown between the banking giant and dissident shareholders , who are angry over the bank ’s stock performance and what they saw as an overly cozy relationship between Lewis and the company ’s board .
“ This is a watershed moment , ” said Daniel Pedrotty , the AFL - CIO ’s investments director .
“ You have pension funds and other shareholders finally standing up and giving a large vote of no confidence to the chairman and CEO of the nation ’s largest bank , signaling that they are going to hold accountable those who have brought this economy to the brink of collapse . ”
Major investors have seen their BofA shares plunge in value .
The stock rose 53 cents to $ 8.68 on Wednesday ; it had traded at about $ 40 a year ago .
Shares have fallen 38 % this year , compared with a 3 % decline for the broad Standard & Poor ’s 500 index .

In a sign of the significance that professional investors placed on the Bank of America vote , three major proxy advisory firms had come out in favor of taking the chairman ’s title from Lewis .
The recommendations of those firms are followed closely by institutional investors such as mutual funds .
Major investors “ are angry and ready to rumble , ” said Amy Borrus , deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington .
“ This is a huge rebuke . ”
In a separate vote , Lewis retained his seat on the board of directors by a two - thirds vote .
The board selected director Walter E. Massey as the new chairman .
Lewis was deposed as chairman after shareholders approved -- with just 50.3 % of the vote -- a measure to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive .
His performance aside , many corporate governance experts and shareholder advisory firms have favored the separation of those jobs .

“ The sheer complexity of running a company as large as Bank of America in today ’s environment makes the bifurcation almost necessary , ” said Rafael Pastor , who heads San Diego consulting firm Vistage International .
In most cases , however , the changes are voluntary .
Efforts by adversarial shareholders to remove chairmen have routinely failed at dozens of companies over the years , so the Bank of America vote marked a key point in attempts to create a more democratic process for holding underperforming executives accountable .
The two - thirds vote to keep Lewis on the board was less convincing than it appeared , critics said , because the support for him included controversial ballots from brokers , who usually side with management .
Such action , in effect , stuffs the ballot box with millions of votes from clients who failed to vote their own shares , Pedrotty said .
Securities regulators have indicated that they will eliminate this practice next year .
Pedrotty estimated that 20 % to 25 % of the vote to retain Lewis on the board came from those so - called uninstructed broker votes .

Lewis has come under blistering criticism for apparent missteps that have yanked Bank of America from its perch as one of the country ’s most successful banking institutions to a laggard -- one that received $ 45 billion in federal aid and may be required by regulators to raise more capital .
Its financial performance and reputation suffered from last fall ’s hastily arranged purchase of faltering Wall Street investment bank Merrill Lynch & Co. , part of a whirlwind weekend that also saw the collapse of investment banking titan Lehman Bros .
Holdings Inc .
The deal has been plagued by embarrassing revelations almost from the moment it was struck .
Merrill had an unexpected $ 15 - billion fourth - quarter loss , and outgoing executives sped up the payment of $ 3.6 billion in bonuses just weeks before the deal was completed Jan .

More recently , Lewis has been dogged by a controversy over his failure to notify shareholders about Merrill ’s pending quarterly loss and the government ’s role in the Merrill takeover .
Lewis said in a sworn statement to the New York attorney general ’s office that federal regulators pressured him to keep quiet about the gaping loss and to complete the Merrill purchase for fear that aborting the merger would deal another blow to the reeling financial system .
At the annual meeting , several shareholders lashed out at Lewis and the board .
“ You knew what was going on , ” said Judy Koenick , a shareholder from Chevy Chase , Md. , who wore a T - shirt that read “ Fire Ken Lewis . ”
“ You kept it from us .
You ’re still keeping it from us . ”

Kent Moore , a Charlotte real estate executive , said : “ Leadership must accept responsibility .
Your decisions are responsible for our insolvency . ”
The California Public Employees ’ Retirement System , the country ’s biggest public pension fund , said it voted all of its 22.7 million shares against all 18 directors , citing the “ poor condition of the company , ” along with the company ’s failure to disclose the Merrill losses and bonuses and the board ’s failure to “ act in the best interests of shareholders ” in overseeing management .
Lewis defended the purchases of Merrill Lynch and of money - losing home mortgage giant Countrywide Financial Corp. in Calabasas , saying they contributed heavily to Bank of America ’s improved first - quarter earnings .
“ These acquisitions are not mistakes to be regretted , ” Lewis said .
“ Both are looking more and more like successes to be celebrated . ”

Lewis also defended his compensation , which critics have derided as out of whack with a financial services company that has required billions of dollars in government assistance .
The CEO took home nearly $ 25 million in 2007 and $ 10 million last year but said his sole compensation this year was his $ 1.5 - million salary .
“ Because of my pledges [ to charity ] , I actually do give away more than I make , ” Lewis told shareholders .

The select few who were lucky enough to secure tickets to the swearing - in ceremony viewed the event from the Capitol 's lawn , while over a million ticket - less onlookers watched the ceremony on giant projector screens at the National Mall .
But the event was not just a real - life lesson in Civics 101 .
It was an invaluable lesson in economics and a reminder of the problems that arise when government controls the distribution of resources .
Given the current economic crisis and the power wielded by the executive , it is a lesson to which President Obama should listen carefully .
Tickets to Obama 's inauguration were in extremely high demand .
Unfortunately , markets did not allocate access to this scarce good ; the government did .
Members of Congress were each allotted a couple hundred tickets to distribute freely to their constituents with only one rule : they were to be given out for free .
But days after Obama was elected president , congressional offices were flooded with thousands of requests for tickets to the historic event .
With no pricing mechanism for allocating the tickets , which were going for as high as $ 40,000 on websites claiming to sell tickets , the government resorted to its favorite form of distribution : the political process .
Given discretionary power to distribute tickets however they pleased , Congress provided first dibs to lobbyists , high - dollar political donors , and whomever else they owed favors .
Predictably , many elected officials were vague in describing how their tickets were distributed .
Some claimed to have used lotteries to give out tickets by " random selection . "
Most refused to disclose where the tickets went , while others acknowledged that some went to " friends and family . "
Although the inauguration was publicized as the most accessible in history , multiple reports indicated that , despite Obama 's pledge of transparency and responsibility , special interests played a highly influential role in the inaugural affairs .
In the week prior to the inauguration , The Wall Street Journal reported that lobbyists and corporations found loopholes in the latest congressional - ethics law that " allow[ed ] them to pay for special access to lawmakers and members of the incoming Obama administration " during the inaugural festivities .
By skirting ethics legislation , lobbyists attended lavish VIP inaugural events by paying big money — up to $ 55,000 .
These events allowed special - interest groups to brush shoulders with some of the most influential members of Obama 's administration .
The government also attempted to ensure that it had exclusive power to distribute inaugural tickets by prohibiting average citizens from selling them .
Senator Dianne Feinstein passed legislation through the Senate that criminalized the sale of inaugural tickets .
In addition , Feinstein secured voluntary agreements from online auction websites such as eBay to ban ticket resale .
" These tickets are supposed to be free for the people , " said Feinstein .
" Nobody should have to pay for their tickets . "
However , many did pay for a ticket , but the payment was to the government .
The Presidential Inaugural Committee ( PIC ) , of which Feinstein is a member , distributed tickets in exchange for up to $ 50,000 in inaugural contributions .
Senator Feinstein 's double standard is clever if you 're a politician .
If free people were able to sell their inaugural tickets , then they might not go to the politically appropriate authority , as deemed by Feinstein and her political cohorts .
Indeed , most of the tickets distributed by the PIC went to the well - connected elite : campaign donors , lobbyists , and party loyalists .
According to the watchdog group Public Citizen , more than half of the inaugural financers who donated $ 300,000 to the committee were also lucrative donors for the Obama campaign .
Among the 211 fundraisers that helped fund over $ 27.6 million for the inauguration were executives of firms receiving financial bailout money from the federal government such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs .
The inauguration episode is replete with valuable economic lessons that many in Washington , the media , and voting booths across the country should understand about the government 's precarious relationship with economics .
For one , the government cannot suspend the laws of supply and demand , regardless of whether they subsidize , regulate , or criminalize the market .
The " free " tickets to the inauguration were far from free , as supply was dwarfed by an enormous demand , and obtaining a ticket required either lots of money or cozy political connections .
Second , when governments , instead of markets , ration scarce resources , their performance is dismal .
Shortages and incompetence are commonplace in government - run economies , because no amount of design by government planners can anticipate the myriad demands of the people .
Government planners do not face the incentives provided by competition in private enterprise .
The inevitable result is poor management .
The thousands of ticket holders who were kept out of Obama 's swearing - in ceremony know this well .
Inaugural planners mismanaged some of the entrances , leaving them stranded in an overcrowded traffic tunnel and left out of the historic event .
Lastly , when the government is given the power to control such scarce and valuable resources , political favors and special interests hover like vultures over carrion .
Lobbyists line up at the trough of government largesse , while politicians , eager to gain reelection , engage in political quid pro quo .
The politically charged allocation of inauguration tickets and other favors to those who are well connected is a sad reality of politics .
It is a reality that our new president needs to realize in the midst of our economic troubles .
Despite platitudes of responsibility and change , the administration 's near - trillion - dollar economic stimulus package is laden with political favors and other vote - buying schemes .
The lessons learned from the unseemly distribution of Obama 's inaugural tickets should give him pause regarding his first acts as president .
His record - sized stimulus bill ignores the corrupting propensity Congress has to distribute favors to constituents out of the taxpayer 's purse .
In addition , it rests on the dubious assumption that government can better decide where resources should be devoted .
Regardless of mantras of change , politics is unlikely to change unless President Obama heeds the lessons learned from the inaugural ceremony .
His first move should be a drastic reduction in the government 's size and scope .
Sadly , I think I am more likely to get a ticket to the next inauguration than to see that happen .

Awaiting North Korean justice
Two US journalists are reported to have gone on trial in North Korea , on charges of committing " hostile acts " .
Euna Lee , a Korean - American , and Laura Ling , a Chinese - American , were arrested on 17 March after allegedly crossing into North Korea from China .
The US has dismissed the charges as " baseless " and said the two women should be released immediately .
The trial comes amid growing tensions in the region following North Korea 's recent nuclear and missile tests .
In a new sign of friction , a North Korean patrol boat is reported to have briefly entered South Korean waters .
The South 's Yonhap news agency said the vessel crossed the disputed maritime border on Thursday , but retreated when issued with a verbal warning .
James Steinberg ( left ) said the China - N Korea relationship had cooled Meanwhile US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg has said China 's relationship with North Korea seems to have cooled recently , since Pyongyang 's latest nuclear test .
During a meeting with the South Korean president in Seoul , Mr Steinberg said Pyongyang was failing to read changes in Beijing 's position .
" It would be a mistake for the North to believe that it can obtain what it wants through negotiations after staging provocative acts , " he said .
Appeal for clemency Euna Lee and Laura Ling were arrested by North Korean guards while working on the China - North Korea border on a story about refugees for California - based internet broadcaster Current TV .
Some reports have suggested that the women were arrested while on Chinese soil , but Pyongyang 's state media says they had illegally entered North Korea .

If the women are found guilty , analysts say they face at least five years detention with hard labour in a North Korean prison camp .
The women 's families have appealed for clemency and asked North Korea and the United States not to link the case to the current diplomatic standoff between them .
But some analysts have suggested that a guilty verdict is almost certain .
Amnesty International has said it is highly unlikely the two women will face a fair trial because of the judicial system 's lack of independence or transparency .

Or so warns this December , 1953 Mechanix Illustrated article ” How Nuclear Radiation Can Change Our Race ” with nice opening spread illustrated by the late comic artist Kurt Schaffenberger .
An atomic war could produce an entirely new species of man .
Would he be friend – or foe ?
“ Now hear this Earth !
I am Mutant Man , Homo Superior !
I have been created by radiation forces out of the loins of you , the human race , after your great terrible Atom War .
Yes , I am a step up and beyond you , and I am now your master for better or worse .
You created me in your blind , savage , senseless war of atomic radiation .
You have only yourselves to blame if I turn out to be your — Frankenstein Monster ! ”
Will this voice someday thunder ominously over the World from a Mutant Man , not a human being , but as far beyond us as we are beyond the ape man ?
Will a new race , spawned out of the hellish radiation of a World - Wide Atomic War , go on to challenge Man ’s supremacy on Earth ?
Schaffenberger was an artist for Marvel and DC comics , most notably doing Lois Lane , Superman ’s Girlfriend .
The lower left inset panel shows how the Mutant “ Friend ” scenario might play out , with the Mutants helping to better humanity by teaching chemistry .
Is that Lois and Clark in the audience ?
The majority of the drawing however is given over to the more dramatic and likely to unfold “ Mutant Foe ” situation .
This guy bears a bit of a resemblance to Dick Cheney getting ready for a quail hunt .

Development Lessons From Killzone 2 : An Interview
By Christian Nutt
In February , Sony - owned Dutch developer Guerrilla Games ' long - awaited Killzone 2 shipped for the PlayStation 3 .
Sony has claimed that the game was one of its fastest sellers ever .
But the game , as with any long - awaited title , has not been without its controversies .
Of course , it was announced with a trailer that proved to be a target render -- something that you 'll see , from the interview , still stings the developers four years later .
Still , that 's mostly washed away by the title 's success , with an impressive 91 Metascore and positive fan response .
But even in that success , the learning process has not finished , reveals development director Arjan Brussee .
In the following interview he , along with the studio's managing director Hermen Hulst , discuss the company 's evolving understanding of its space in the marketplace and how development continues on the game .
In the following interview , conducted at the recent Game Developers Conference , Hulst and Brussee discuss the size and structure of the game 's team -- which topped out at 190 people .
Multiplayer and single - player development and testing are contrasted , the process of patching the game is discussed , and even the rendering engine is stripped back for the world to see :
You guys finally shipped .
I should n't say " finally " .
Every game is " finally " , right ?
No matter how long or how short development is .
Hermen Hulst :
It 's fine .
We 've given birth , so we know what it feels like now .
How do you feel to have gotten through it , gotten it out ?
HH : I think we 're pretty ecstatic .
It 's great being out here at GDC .
We 've spoken to a lot of peers .
One of them actually , earlier this morning over breakfast , said , " Well , it must feel for you guys like you 've climbed a mountain and planted like a big fucking flag on top of the hill . "
And that 's what it feels like after all those years .
It 's been four solid years , quite intense .
About how many people did you have on the team working behind the production ?
HH : We peaked I believe for a very brief period at about 190 , but much more sort of steady , we were at about 140 .
Wow .
That 's still a huge number .
HH : It is a big team , yeah .
It 's a big single - player campaign and it's a big multiplayer online experience .
And that was at the end .
Of course , we started with about 55 people .
We scaled it up over the years .
How did you structure the development of multiplayer and single - player ?
With Resistance , some of the content was related or repurposed , but ultimately , it was more like silos , I think .
Did you take a similar approach ?
HH : I think ...
And Arjan can tag onto that later , but I think looking back , it would n't have been quite healthy from a production management perspective had it been more integrated than it actually turned out to be , to be completely frank with you .
We just have one game director that was technically overseeing both creations .
However , the use of the word " silos " may be a bit extreme .
But they were actually two different tracks , particularly on the design side .
Obviously , from a technology and an art perspective , there 's a lot more integration there .
That is definitely I think something that we are looking at going forward .
Arjan Brussee : I think the main difference is that with online , we started having playable in a good fashion so much earlier .
I think we started three years ago with a thing that we called Friday Fragfest where we just had the whole team play through the game .
At first , it was super laggy , no animations , mo-cap , etcetera , just trying out things .
That iterative approach has really , really worked well .
That was in good shape real early on .
I think that 's required for online , so you can't really take the same approach as you do for single - player , because only at a very late moment of time , you start reaching the kind of quality that 's required .
Obviously there are balance issues with multiplayer that are really important , which that really benefits .
But also , is it because of content creation in a sense that single - player is waiting for assets and all kinds of things to come online ?
AB : Well , they share a lot of assets , right ?
But I think online is getting fun real quick , even if you 're in a mo-cap environment and you have a couple guys running around .
It becomes really fun already , so you can test the [ ideas ] in a very base fashion really quickly , and really quickly iterate .
So you can see , you know -- the medic .
Is it being played really well ?
We know -- that 's a thing that we found out two years ago .
We have three weeks , and every week , a different kind of medic implementation .
The test is like that , to figure out what is the best way to get people involved in being a medic .
And that kind of approach really worked well .
You can do it really early .
On that side .
HH : A single - player campaign is only fun once there are enemy types that each have their own sort of behavior , reasoning with the world .
That 's one of the lessons we learned from Killzone 1 -- AI needs to be a lot better .
And we 've spent very considerable time with a considerable amount of people on that , and I think that 's what Arjan refers to do .
You do n't require it in multiplayer .
A lot of things are required for single - player campaigns .
Design is obviously really important in single - player and multiplayer .
Before things were nailed down , you could immediately start testing .
Did you resist design documents for the multiplayer because you were being iterative ?
AB : [ laughs ]
I think I 've made a couple of games in my life now , and I think the online component is one of the only games that I 've ever worked on where the initial design is actually more than 90 % translated into the final product .
That really worked well .
Our vision , we really kept true to that .
But we did actually still iterate .
We still throw away things , try things , etcetera .
We do n't value design documents that much , but you have to have that vision .
You have to have those poles in the ground .
What is it going to be about ?
What are we going to do with squads and badges ?
And those kinds of notions were available really early .
You can iterate as you like .
You do n't need 300 - page design bibles .
But you know , that 30 - page initial vision , and you have people that are really hands - on and driven towards chasing their ideas throughout the company .
That 's more valuable than any piece of paper .
How did you communicate ?
You say that 90 % of the original design came through in the end , and there was a really long process and also a very large team .
So how did you communicate that and keep it consistent over that ?
That sounds like a pretty impressive accomplishment to me .
HH : I think what Arjan just mentioned just now is a very , very critical part of our process .
Every Friday , everybody in the company drops what they 're doing and plays the game , so people at all times are aware of the state of the game .
There 's no better way than sharing where you 're at and what you want to achieve than forcing people to play the bloody game .
So that 's probably the single most important thing , forcing that .
Yeah , so it has the benefit of everyone being on the same page essentially .
HH : It 's got that , plus you get feedback from a hundred guys .
A hundred guys that play a lot of games , and getting that feedback and doing something with it , never dismissing that , responding to it , week - by - week .
That 's very early user - testing .
AB : And for online , that works really well .
Single - player , it 's a bit less so .
The pipelines are a bit deeper , so it takes a long time for people to see their stuff in the game , finally playing .
But in online , because of the quick iteration and the kind of way that you structure it from mo-cap to final , the game was fun and completed before there was any art .
So , that 's a really interesting approach .
It worked wonders for that .
And that meant we could also have other teams , even within Sony , work on the online levels to help us out , so we did n't have to touch it up ourselves anymore because we knew it played well .
" Okay , sure .
Now make it look nice , " you know .
Totally changing track , relatively soon after the game shipped , you came out with a control patch .
I just want to talk about that process .
What spurred it ?
And what was that like ?
Because prior to this you guys have had PC development experience , but this is the first console game where you 've been able to ship a patch .
AB : Well , we 've done patches also for Killzone 1 , right ?
Though the systems then were less meant to do these patches , but still , we were able to do that .
I was talking to some other guys out of Bungie at GDC on the idea that games do n't ever finish anymore , right ?
So , you go into this kind of service model , and you keep on improving your game .
We kind of found this issue , we investigated some things , and if we find issues that we think , " Yeah , that 's a bug , we have not seen this " or " we 've forgotten about this , " then we can patch it , and we have that system .
We 're thinking about continuous improvements to our game .
If we find issues , we now have a million - plus people playing the game actively -- if you look at the Killzone.com site , [ that 's ] how many people are playing it .
So they 're bound to find issues or cheat .
You know , we had an issue with auto - aim being a kind of cheaty solution sometimes , so we fixed that , just to make the experience nice for everybody .
I think that will continue for the next half year .
You know , the Halo guys are working on Halo 3 still two years down the line .
I think that 's the kind of model that you 're looking at .
The Left 4 Dead guys , I think they did 70 patches or so ?
And they slip it under the curtain .
You do n't see it anymore , with Steam .
That 's the kind of way that you need to think about these kinds of things .
So , I think it 's a strong thing .
It 's a strong thing that we listen to our customers and we fix these things when we find them , and just help improve the game continuously .
First of all , you must get a huge volume of data with a huge audience like that .
But also is it things that people say ?
Do you also mine data based on server logs and stuff like that ?
AB : So , data mining is a big thing for games , right ?
I 've been attending all these lectures at GDC , and everybody is doing that .
You look at Valve , the Steam stats , that Bungie thing , and we 're doing a lot of stuff on Killzone that 's going with the Battle Replay .
It 's really awesome , I think that 's the next step in how you see that kind of stuff evolving .
And trying to get that data back in and anonymize it -- within the legal bounds of not dealing with personal information -- there 's a lot of value to be had there .
I think that you can also use it to keep on improving your game .
And even the single - player aspects .
You know , if you find levels that have too many deaths in certain sections , you can kind of fix those during development but maybe also after development .
We can also patch such things if we need to .
And just analyzing all that data , you know .
700,000 or more people , how long are they playing ?
Why are they leaving ?
What patch do they reach ?
Is it our ramp up of reaching patches ?
Is that good enough ?
Does that need to be steeper or not ?
Those kinds of patterns , we 're all analyzing and thinking about , " Do we want to fix this for Killzone 2 or for our next game ? "
Such things , you know , it 's really important .
You are also getting data about the single - player game .
Is that something you prioritize when releasing patches , or is it mainly multiplayer ?
AB : So , the longevity of the game is certainly in multiplayer .
People are spending way more hours in multiplayer .
That 's dynamic , you know .
It 's where people are talking about the cool games they 're having and inviting friends over .
It 's the key to success , to selling really , really many millions of copies .
HH : Plus single - player , you can user - test it a lot better before release .
So , you know , there 's only so much you can do in terms of duration and in terms of amount of players in a beta .
We try to do as much as we can .
There 's always stuff you 're going to oversee , that slips internal QA as well as external user - testing , particularly on the multiplayer side .
It 's also a complex game , right ?
HH : It 's rather complex .
I mean , it 's very feature - rich , and it 's got a lot of stuff in it .
A lot of stuff can be changed .
To change tracks ,
Alex pointed out that you had a real - time demo of the 4D bullet stuff , so I 'm actually really curious ... [ note : the demo was released onto PSN April 2 . ]
HH : Couple opening comments on that .
You 've seen the trailer probably on the TV here , but we wanted to create an interactive version of it , kind of as a testament of our technology and kind of a statement that we as Guerilla Games no longer have to rely on pre-rendered stuff to communicate our vision .
I think this is a great way of doing that .
Arjan is just demonstrating it now .
He tracked the bullet across the battlefield , just like you are in the trailer , however ...
Obviously , this is scripted and for show , but when you do something more experimental like this and more visual , does this give you a jumping off point where you can do something ?
Like give you ideas to experiment for gameplay .
AB : Yes , I think it also has that , but more importantly for us ...
So Martin came up with the idea of having another kind of trailer and let 's render it in - engine .
You know , " Let 's do it in real time !
Let 's get away from that whole fricking trailer thing , ever . "
[ laughs ]
AB : That was kind of scary , but we managed to do that .
But also , what you see is that you put in Hollywood quality , 100,000 polygon models into an engine , and to see how that pipeline works is really interesting .
Sometimes in development , we think , " Well , this is so difficult .
Nobody understands how we do this kind of content . "
And we 've got people from the special effects industry , that helped us with throwing some high - end models in .
And that actually worked fine , so our engine can even handle that kind of stuff .
And we had to fix a couple things , so we found a couple of things that actually we can improve .
So with future games , we can do even more high - poly models , etcetera .
So it 's a really good learning experience for us .
That 's actually really interesting .
Because to a certain extent , you have expectations when you create technology , both based on the hardware and based on the application of the technology .
But to find that when you 're asked to exceed some of your expectations , that 's what it creates .
AB : Yeah .
HH : We definitely added stuff to our technology base on the back of this project .
AB : So , for instance , I think that you can see here in this scene , featuring now , [ indicates screen ] is a system ...
This is actually a real - time reflection .
So , that was n't in Killzone 2 .
We developed this for this demo as a kind of test .
So , you know , we 'll use that in future games .
We can now do good reflections , so it 's really interesting .
But this is the Killzone engine .
Is that was the engine is called ?
Or do you have an internal name for it ?
AB : Oh , it 's the Killzone engine , yeah .
It 's something you would potentially use .
It 's your studio's tech .
HH : Yes .
It 's fully proprietary .
You will definitely leverage it for any project that your studio does .
I 'm assuming that 's your goal .
HH : Yeah , a lot of it has come from previous projects .
It 's evolved , going back a long way .
AB : Another thing that this features that 's kind of cool , is you can actually see these different buffers .
Let me slow it down a bit -- because you can actually see it run in real time .
The things that I explained before in GameTrailers , the different depth buffers or lighting buffers and etcetera .
So , it is kind of this tech demo in a sense that people can have a view about the underlying technologies that we used to make that .
HH : Are you somewhat familiar with what we 're doing ?
We created this deferred rendering engine that allows us to composite this image by layering various special effects , lighting , various material buffers on top of it ?
Maybe take a step back , Arjan .
AB : Yeah , sorry .
[ laughs ]
HH : You 're assuming too much knowledge already .
[ laughs ]
Actually , that sort of leads into my question , right .
So , this is going to be on PSN , right ?
HH : Yeah , that 's right .
So , what do you think about pulling back the curtain for your audience , you know what I mean ?
Letting them see how these things are .
I mean obviously , you know in film , a lot of making of features hit DVDs and whatever , but this is sort of on a different kind of level because , well , A , it 's interactive , and B , it 's so technical .
What do you think about that ?
HH : I think it 's fantastic that end users get to understands how complex it actually is .
It 's just one of those quirky terms .
It 's a " deferred rendering engine " .
What the hell does it mean ?
What the hell does it allow you to create ?
I think for us to visually present that , and that people toy around it any play with it and sort of experiment with it in their own time at their own pace is very helpful to making them aware of how complex it is .
You started with the question , " You spent quite a number of years , " and this is a way I think to express the complexities that went into this project .
AB : And we had talks on videos on GameTrailers , etcetera , and they were super highly ranked .
And you look at the comments , people were like , " Whoa , we need more of this information ! "
So , you know , let 's give this kind of stuff to them .
And to actually once more show this is real time .
This is not fake , this is not a movie that we 're playing in slow - mo or whatever , but you can actually see all that kind of stuff in the background .
And it 's a unique thing that we developed for the Killzone engine .
It 's a completely different way how to render your screen , and we kind of explain how we did that .
So , I think that 's interesting for many people .
And another feature that it has , is there are director commentaries .
So , we had our art director , lead technical artist , senior tech coder , and the director from Zoic who helped with this , took over what you 're seeing on the screen , etcetera , so .
I think that people will find that pretty fascinating .
It 's interesting because among most people , even developers , very few proportionally are working on games of this stature .
You know what I mean , triple - A , first party , single platform , 190 people at a top of the line team .
HH : It 's kind of a developer 's dream to get that kind of opportunity to not only make a game of that magnitude but also do it specifically for one platform and not have to sort of find the lowest common denominator .
It really is great .
That 's also very much the reason why Arjan and myself decided to sell the company to Sony , because we got that opportunity three years ago .

SAN FRANCISCO / BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison , whose company sells software to big corporations , is looking to extend his footprint to inexpensive laptops and other electronics gadgets .

Ellison said on Tuesday that he wants to boost use of Java software on so - called netbook computers and other devices after his company completes its planned $ 7 billion purchase of computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc , which controls Java .
“ You ’ll see us get very aggressive with Java , and developing Java apps for things like telephones and netbooks , ” he told programmers attending a Java users conference in San Francisco .
“ There will be computers that are fundamentally based on Java . ”
He called on the group of programmers to develop applications for netbooks and mobile phones using JavaFX , a new version of the widely used programing language designed to deliver applications over the Internet .
Java ’s claim to fame is that it allows developers to write one set of code that will run on multiple operating systems -- including Microsoft Corp ’s Windows , Apple Inc ’s Macintosh OS and Linux .
The netbook phenomenon took off in 2008 with the sale of 11.7 million units , led by companies such as Acer and Asustek Computer Inc that were quick into the market .
Nearly every PC maker offers the laptops , which are small enough to fit into a purse and cost as little as $ 200 .
Analysts forecast 20 million to 30 million netbooks will be sold this year , making up an ever larger part of overall laptop sales and marking one of few tech sectors still experiencing robust revenue growth .
Although netbooks are relatively new , it is an area in which Ellison has shown past interest .
More then a decade ago he introduced a lightweight alternative to the PC known as the Network Computer , which was built primarily to connect to the Internet .
The machines , which competed with ones running on Windows operating system , failed to take off after their launch in 1996 .
Shares in Redwood City , California - based Oracle rose 2 percent to $ 20.35 .
Bad :
The program has two segments dealing with what they call ``identical backgrounds ' ' .
In one , they show the lunar lander with a mountain in the background .
They then show another picture of the same mountain , but no lander in the foreground at all .
The astronauts could not have taken either picture before landing , of course , and after it lifts off the lander leaves the bottom section behind .
Therefore , there would have been something in the second image no matter what , and the foreground could not be empty .
Obviously , the mountain background is a fake set , and was reused by NASA for another shot .
Good :
Actually , the pictures are real , of course .
As always , repeat after me : the Moon is not the Earth .
On the Earth , distant objects are obscured a bit by haze in the air , and we use that to mentally gauge distances .
However , with no air , an object can be very far away on the Moon and still be crisp and sharp to the eye .
You can't tell if a boulder is a meter across and 100 meters away , or 100 meters across and 10 kilometers away !
That 's what 's going on here .
The lander is close to the astronaut in the first picture , perhaps a 20 or 30 meters away .
The mountain is kilometers away .
For the second picture , the astronaut merely moved a few hundred meters to the side .
The lander was then out of the picture , but the mountain hardly moved at all !
If you look at the scene carefully , you 'll see that all the rocks and craters in the foreground changes between the two pictures , just as you 'd expect if the astronaut had moved to the side a ways between the two shots .
It 's not fraud , it 's parallax !
Another example of the difficulty in estimating distance is due to the shapes of the rocks on the Moon .
A rock small enough to sit down on does n't look fundamentally different from one bigger than your house .
Humans also judge distance by using the relative sizes of objects .
We know how big a person is , or a tree , so the apparent size of the object can be used to estimate the distance .
If we do n't know how big the object is , we can be fooled about its distance .
For an outstanding example of this , take a look at video taken during Apollo 16 .
There is a boulder in the background that looks to be about 3 or 4 meters ( 10 - 13 feet ) high .
About 3 / 4 of the way through the segment the astronauts walk over to it .
Amazingly , that boulder is the size of a large house !
Without knowing how big the rock was when we first see it , we have no way to judge distances .
That huge rock looks like a medium sized one until we have some way to directly judge its size ; in this case , by looking at the tiny astronauts next to it .
[ My thanks to Bad Reader Martin Michalak for bringing this video to my attention .
My very special thanks goes to Charlie Duke ( yes , the Charlie Duke , Apollo astronaut and lunar lander pilot ) who emailed me (! ) about the difficulty in judging distances due to not knowing the sizes of rocks . ]
I will admit the Fox program had me for a while on this one ; I could n't figure it out .
But then I got a note from Bad Reader David Bailey , who set me straight .
However , the producers of the show should have talked to some real experts before saying such a silly thing as this .
If they had checked with the folks who run the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal , for example , they would have been set straight too .
Tekkenbob , the official Twitter account for Tekken 6 , posted up an interesting new photo of an unannounced , yet very familiar character to those who follow the Penny Arcade comic series .
Though it could simply be a custom costume for Tekken series veteran Yoshimitsu , it certainly looks a lot like Cardboard Tube Samurai .

- article by " QUANTUM SHOT " # 573 Link - article by Akka Ballenger Constantin
We welcome our guest travel writer Akka Ballenger Constantin ( also a photographer with a gallery on National Geographic ) .
She spent seven years sailing around the world , gathering weird and wonderful material , part of which she shares with us today :
The Unknown Brazil : Boca de Valeria , Manaus , Santarem & Parintinis .
When in Rome , do like the Romans - they say … but what about Brazil ?
Here are some notes that may help you find places not ( too often ) mentioned in the travel guides :
A couple of dancers in Santarem , Boi Bumba Festival
Surely enough , your typical tourist will linger on the Ipanema Beach , or take active part in the Rio de Janeiro ’s Carnaval … that is if you can do the Samba like the locals , or if you really want to embarrass yourself publicly , by exposing your elephantine grace .
A conscientious tourist will have at least a shot of himself underneath O Cristo Redentor , the famous statue of Christ the Redeemer located on the top of the Corcovado Mountain .
A shot together with the gorgeous dancers , on the Sambodromo .
One on the beautiful beaches of Santa Catarina … Or perhaps a shot of the lively , rocky nights in Armação dos Búzios , catching up with the richest of the riches …
I , on the other hand have none of the above .
I am a fortuitous tourist and a natural born traveler .
While sailing , my itinerary is always imposed on me , but sometimes it ’s for the best .
So , what can I tell you about Brazil ?
Something you have n’t already seen ; something you do n’t already know ?
Encontro das Águas - the improbable junction of the waters
Sailing the Amazon River into Manaus , we were mesmerised by what the locals call " Encontro das Águas " ( the meeting of waters ) .
The junction of Rio Negro and Rio Solimões is a very unique sight .
For 6 km , the 2 rivers are running along , without mixing .
In more profane but visual terms , think coffee flowing alongside cappuccino , without being able to mix it .
There is a simple explanation for what we took for a small miracle : Rio Negro flows at 2 km per hour at a temperature of 22°C , while the Rio Solimões flows between 4 to 6 km per hour at temperature of 28°C .
These differences between speed , temperature and density of the two waters are the main cause of this phenomenon .
Evening time : view from the Command Bridge , before entering Manaus .
Boca de Valeria
Leaving Manaus , we keep sailing on the Amazon River .
Our next stop : Boca de Valeria : a very small , colourful village , populated by some 60 - 70 ribeirrinhos .
Several cruiseship companies have placed this little village on their itinerary .
Located at the " mouth " of the Valeria River , the village offers an encounter of two different cultures .
A cruise ship arrival is a great event for the small village located on the mouth of Valeria River .
The friendly villagers are always happy to welcome all visitors , eager to make contact and get news from foreign lands .
Because of the small space , the visitors are literally poking into the river people ’s lives .
But they look happy enough to share with us their ways of life : we are being shown their schools , the local market and even the way their houses are made .
Typical houses
They seem to understand that visits like these sustain the little trade they are able to make by selling souvenirs and exquisite crafts .
There are very few inhabitants and they are all very proud of their amazonian heritage .
Although modern living is slowly making its way through , they dress up with traditional costumes .
Amazonian Family
The children however are not yet versed in the art of compromise .
Although they have obediently donned up their outfits , their eyes say more than words .
They are not used being on display for the large audience and they all look like they would be happier playing , rather than demonstrating their skills .
One particular girl attracted the crowds with her beautiful , magnetic eyes .
She was demonstrating archery , but her eyes were throwing the real darts .
Little Amazonian Warrior :
In Boca de Valeria , boats are the equivalent of cars in a busy city : the only way of getting around :
Spectacular Boi-Bumbá Festival
Parintins is located on Tupinambarana island in the Amazon River .
Its name will probably tell you nothing , but Parintins is very famous for a popular folklore festival .
Called Boi-Bumbá , the Parintins festival is held each year on the month of June .
It is an incredible experience for the audience : the artistic duel of the 2 teams , Boi Caprichoso and Boi Garantido .
Boi is the Portuguese word for ox and it is the main character of the story .
Each of the teams is presenting the same story in their own fashion : the story of Pai Francisco , who killed one of his Master ’s ox , because Mae Catirina ( his pregnant wife ) was longing to eat beef tongue .
Unfortunately , the ox he has killed was the master ’s favourite and Pai Francisco is sent to jail , after a priest and a doctor failed to revive the ox .
However , the story has a happy ending and thanks to the ritual performed by a pajé ( pa- zhe , shaman ) , the ox is brought back to life .
Pai Francisco is forgiven and everything ends in a party that celebrates the Boi 's life .
Both teams , Caprichoso and Garantido use amazing resources in unfolding the story : apart the musical and theatrical experience , the viewer will be amazed by the grand scale of this artistic confrontation : parade floats , giant puppets , allegoric dances & stories .
The " Bumbódramo " is always at its full capacity during this 3 - nights event .
35,000 people are following the competition , encouraging & cheering for their favourite team .
During each night , the 2 teams are attempting in outdoing each other through their performance incorporating Amazonian folklore , with its exquisite costumes and flamboyant dances .

Here is another shot of the bridge , but this time I was looking west into the sunset from Milton Kentucky towards Madison .
The sky had been pretty dull all evening but about the time the sun dropped below the western horizon , the sky took on these beautiful colors , there were n’t many clouds in the sky to hold the color so I had to shoot pretty quickly to get these before darkness set in .
And now for the real story !!
And as you can also tell I actually enhanced the saturation in this a bit to get the desired effect , how much wiggle room and leeway do you give yourself artistictly to get the desired effect of the image you are after ?
Do you feel it is a betrayal to photography to manipulate the color to create an image ?
I actually added about 25 % saturation boost and a surface blur to get the water to smooth out like this , other than that I do n’t add much to an image , I know the effect really added a different look to the scene as I viewed it .
I guess to photographers this can be viewed as overkill , but to the average buyer , sometimes with me it seems they like it a little more on the saturated side .
If you sell many prints do you find this to be the case with your clients ?
I am starting to find that the things I like are definitely not what the general public like , so hopefully I will be able to adapt to their taste and fill the niche , that at least around here needs to be filled .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
There 's a name for what ails you , and it 's called " luxury guilt . "
Even if you can afford to travel , you reason , is n't it wrong to indulge when times are so tough ?
Well , if you have n't been swayed by the open - your - wallet , shorten - the - recession argument , how about this one :
You may be missing a rare chance to visit some of the finest hotels on the planet at prices you are n't likely to see over the next decade .
The deals now are better than in the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis , 9/11 , or SARS , says Jan Freitag , vice president of Smith Travel Research , making travel to just about any place in the world from 30 % to 50 % more affordable than last year .
One note :
If you do n't find these rates on the hotel website , call to book .
Beaching it
The general rule here is , go as far as your frequent - flier miles will take you .
For example : The Four Seasons Resort Hualalai on the Big Island of Hawaii , where Julia Roberts vacations with her family , is giving $ 1,000 resort credits good for anything on the property ( including room rates ) for those staying at least four nights .
At the Four Seasons Maui , rooms are starting at a ( relatively ) affordable $ 395 per night and include extras like outrigger - canoe excursions and introductory scuba clinics .
In Bora Bora , at the St. Regis , an entry - level room used to be $ 1,300 per night , but now every second night is half price .
Bonus :
You 're near the lagoon James Michener once called the " most beautiful in the world . "
For groups , check out the " second bungalow for half price " package .
One other romantic spot worth considering : Sandy Lane in Barbados , where Aristotle Onassis once rowed in from his yacht to frolic alongside Princess Margaret and Frank Sinatra .
The resort was completely renovated in 2008 and has numerous packages , with rates ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars off typical prices .
City escapes
Ritz spokeswoman Vivian Deuschl says the Ritz has never before offered savings like the ones this summer .
Particularly appealing : the Ritz - Carlton Peace of Mind package available at all the Ritz U.S. and Caribbean hotels as well as those in Dublin , Lisbon , Marbella , and Egypt .
You get one free night for a three - night stay , two for five nights , and three for seven .
Also included : breakfast , kids ' programs , valet parking , and waived resort fees .
The savings can be anywhere from the low hundreds to the low thousands .
For something more exotic , the Peninsula chain will give you a complimentary second night in a suite at all its hotels around the world ( except Beverly Hills ) .
And plain old rate cuts mean that at the newly refurbished Peninsula in Beijing , just steps from Tiananmen Square , a room costs just $ 431 for two nights .
Deals abound in other European cities :
In Venice , for example , at the spectacular Hotel Gritti Palace built for the Doge in 1525 , or at the Hotel Bristol in Vienna , you 'll get a free fourth night , resulting in a minimum $ 400 savings ( other members of Starwood 's Luxury collection have similarly dramatic deals ) .
In London , Claridge's is debuting a Timeless Weekend summer package ; rooms that are regularly $ 738 drop to $ 375 Friday through Sunday , including breakfast .
Another excellent deal on the higher end is the luxe Mandarin Oriental properties :
When you book a suite at any Mandarin in the world for three nights , you get one night free , a free breakfast , and a spa credit that varies by hotel .
Family affairs
Finally , if you 're traveling with kids , you 'll need plenty of space -- and plenty to do .
At the famed Connaught in London , a family package includes two double rooms for the price of one ( savings of at least $ 866 per night ) .
Check out the mahogany staircase : Ralph Lauren reportedly loved it so much he built an exact replica in his New York City flagship .
For those interested in some history closer to home , at the St. Regis in Washington , D.C. , where President Calvin Coolidge cut the ribbon for the hotel 's 1926 opening , rooms typically run $ 845 per night .
This summer they are $ 495 , including continental breakfast , a $ 50 food credit , and kids ' DVDs .
Perhaps the most intriguing deal of all is in the Cayman Islands , where one child per paying adult flies free from any Cayman Airways gateway city -- Miami , New York , or Tampa .
Nearly every resort , including the Ritz - Carlton and the Grand Cayman Marriott Beach Resort , has a five - nights - for - four option , where kids stay free in rooms with adults .
A final option : heading for spots that are out of season .
At Little Nell , the ideally situated resort at the base of Aspen , summer rates typically begin at $ 530 ; this summer you can choose from an adjoining room for 50 % off or a fourth night for the price of three .
In India , the Taj Hotels company has priced four nights at one of three spectacular Taj Palace properties and two nights at a Taj hotel in either Mumbai or Delhi -- with breakfast , dinner , and discounts on spa -- for $ 2,190 per person based on double occupancy .
Given that a single night at a Taj Palace typically runs around $ 800 , if you can brave the high temperatures , those may be the lowest prices you 'll see for some time .
BEIJING , June 12 ( Reuters ) - Credit default swaps are “ instruments of destruction ” that should be outlawed , billionaire investor George Soros said on Friday .
Soros , speaking at a financial conference in Beijing , explained that such swaps grossly distort the balance between risk and reward , creating the potential to bring companies and financial institutions to their knees .
“ CDS are instruments of destruction which ought to be outlawed , ” he said .

A Texas registrar of voters has been working a second job selling voter data and campaign services to Republican campaigns , according to local news reports .
Ed Johnson , the associate registrar of voters in Harris County , is the paid director of a small political consulting firm called Computer Data Systems , which he launched in 2003 with a Republican state representative .
The company sold $ 140,000 worth of voter data and election services to Republican politicians and campaigns in 2008 , which included conducting targeted mailings on behalf of clients .
The information was uncovered by the Lone Star Project , a Texas - based political activist group .
CDS 's clients included U.S. Representative Michael McCaul and Harris County District Attorney Pat Lykos .
The district attorney 's campaign paid Johnson 's company more than $ 7,000 last year for targeted mailing .
The district attorney told a local paper that she did n't know Johnson was also the county 's assistant registrar of voters .
Critics say Johnson 's job as a political consultant is a conflict of interest with his registrar job , which puts him in a position of overseeing the approval and rejection of new voter registration applications .
Since some of his Republican clients appear on ballots in elections he helps oversee , it raises questions about his impartiality in registering voters and handling elections .
Last year the Texas Democratic Party sued the registrar 's office , charging that it rejected more voter applications than any other county in Texas .
Harris County rejected 70,000 applications between January 2006 and October 2008 as opposed to only 1,800 rejected in Dallas County during the same period .
The suit alleges that valid registration applications were not properly processed , preventing eligible voters from having their votes counted .
An employee in the registrar 's office also said that Johnson is in charge of purging voters from the registration database .
Federal law allows election officials to purge voters from a list if they 've died , notified officials that they 've moved from the county or if they 've failed to vote in two consecutive federal elections and have not responded to a mailing from the county election office .
States that prohibit convicted felons from voting can also purge these voters from the list .
But there have been a number of controversies around negligent purging of voter lists in several states .
Part of Johnson 's job also involves handling provisional ballots that voters cast on election day .
Provisional ballots are cast by voters who arrive at the polls to find their name is n't on the registration list .
If they insist they did register , federal law allows such voters to cast a provisional ballot , which is counted only if election officials can determine that the voter was indeed registered and eligible to vote .
Provisional ballots can can account for crucial votes in a close race .

Ex communities secretary Hazel Blears says she regrets " enormously " the timing of her shock resignation - just before local and European elections .
The Salford MP said she thought as two other ministers had announced they would stand down , she could do so without sparking a " huge firestorm " .
" In the end , that judgement was wrong , " she told the Manchester Evening News .
Labour activists in Salford have put forward a vote of no confidence in her , expected to be discussed next Thursday .
But constituency sources have told the BBC it is likely to be defeated .
In her interview with the Manchester Evening News , Ms Blears also said she regretted mocking the PM's YouTube video and wearing a badge saying " rocking the boat " as she quit .
Ms Blears 's resignation as communities secretary was seen as a deliberate attempt to destabilise Gordon Brown on the eve of key elections .
' Stupid '
She told the Manchester Evening News the " effect on the party " , which crashed to an all - time low in share of the vote at the European polls and lost control of key local authorities , is " something I will regret forever " .
She said the decision to wear the " rocking the boat " brooch as she headed back to her constituency after her resignation came after four weeks of intense media pressure over her expenses claims , which she said had affected her and her family .
It was thoughtless and it was hurtful and I apologised straightaway
Hazel Blears on YouTube quip
Brown pressure after Blears quits Profile : Hazel Blears
" At that point I just had enough , it was a stupid thing to do in retrospect but it was just putting a brave face on , not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims which genuinely are not true , " she told the newspaper 's website .
The day before it had emerged Jacqui Smith had resigned as home secretary over pressure about her expenses claims - but Ms Smith declared her full support for Mr Brown as prime minister as she stood down .
Ms Blears ' resignation letter made no mention of Mr Brown 's leadership .
YouTube joke
She was said to be angry about being singled out for criticism by Mr Brown - who had described her failure to pay capital gains tax on the sale of a home as " totally unacceptable " - when other cabinet ministers were accused of similar actions .
In May , she launched what was seen as a thinly - veiled attack on Mr Brown 's leadership in an article for the Observer , after his much criticised appearance on YouTube .
I 'm not sure the members are ready to forgive and forget
Lindsay Hoyle
Chorley MP
She had written : " Promote your message via YouTube if you want to .
But it is no substitute for knocking on doors or setting up a stall in the town centre . "
Ms Blears told the newspaper she now regretted the comments , saying : " It was thoughtless and it was hurtful and I apologised straightaway . "
But her fellow north - west Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle , who represents Chorley , said Labour activists were angry at Ms Blears and blamed her for a drop in the Labour vote and subsequent BNP victories in the region .
' Window dressing '
He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One : " I think it is always good to apologise and it's good to repent but the trouble is I 'm not sure the members are ready to forgive and forget . "
He said what voters wanted to hear about was how the government was tackling the recession : " They do n't want to hear about self indulgent MPs and that 's what we have got to learn from this . "
But Labour 's deputy leader Harriet Harman welcomed Ms Blears ' comments , telling the BBC : " I think it 's good that she said that .
I know there 's been a lot of frustration and there 's been turbulence but what I think we really need to do is get back onto the main agenda , which is what are people 's concerns for their families , for themselves ? "
Ms Blears told the newspaper she had not been part of a plot to destabilise Mr Brown as Labour leader .
Her resignation was followed by the dramatic exit of James Purnell , who quit as work and pensions secretary telling Mr Brown to " stand aside " for the sake of the party .
The following day Caroline Flint , a close friend of Ms Blears , resigned as Europe minister complaining Mr Brown had treated women ministers as " female window dressing " .

If you 're not familiar with the controversy over the unique partnership between Morning Joe and Starbucks , Jon Stewart covered it last week :
VIDEO : Daily Show - Corporate SynerJoe
I wonder how much research the execs at Starbucks did before signing on to the Morning Joe ship of fools .
Do they have any idea the kinds of things Joe says on the air ?
Do they really want Joe and Pat Buchanan proudly sipping mocha lattes while they recite yet another contrived defense for the crimes against humanity committed by Dick Cheney and his merry band of torture architects ?
Here 's some classic Scarborough , completely flipping out when challenged on his belief that torture is effective and morally fine .
Brewed by Starbucks :
( Check out Jane Hamsher 's skewering of Joe 's talking points . )
And then there was the time that Scarborough said this :
SCARBOROUGH :
The second Dana Priest wrote her article and we had this debate on waterboarding , we were moving towards not using waterboarding again .
We do n't - these techniques are worthless now anyways , so if planes go into buildings , well do n't blame Barack Obama , blame Dana Priest and the chaos that occurred after that cause that was - when her article came out , from that point forward , this secret CIA program was dead on arrival .
Brewed by Starbucks !
Joe did apologize for that one ... sort of .
So , rest assured , Starbucks , if Joe says anything too awful while sipping his wonderful Starbucks coffee , he might apologize later .
Oh yeah , Joe also does n't hold back when it comes to personal attacks on MSNBC guests ... or when letting viewers know just how much other MSNBC shows suck :
I do n't usually watch some of the cable shows at night ... because you get such bad information .
You really do .
People come on and they vomit out bad information and they get cheered .
They might as well have a , like , applause track .
So , a guy went on last night and we 're gonna play the clip later .
And he actually said a couple of things that were so outrageously wrong , and he a former CIA agent , but he makes money obviously trashing the CIA .
What was Joe so upset about ?
Robert Baer , a former a CIA agent , went on Hardball and discussed how torture is ineffective and illegal .
Very upsetting to Joe. Brewed by Starbucks !
This is what it 's like almost every day on Morning Joe , Brewed by Starbucks .
Just search " Joe Scarborough + torture " and set aside about 72 hours .
Funny thing .
Turns out this actually is n't even the first instance of torture - related product placement for Starbucks .
The Bush administration announced yesterday that it intends to bring capital murder charges against half a dozen men allegedly linked to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , based partly on information the men disclosed to FBI and military questioners without the use of coercive interrogation tactics .
The admissions made by the men -- who were given food whenever they were hungry as well as Starbucks coffee at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba -- played a key role in the government 's decision to proceed with the prosecutions , military and law enforcement officials said .
After realizing that they could n't use tortured confessions as part of a legal process , the Bush administration offered detainees a cup of Starbucks coffee in hopes they 'd confess a second time .
What a deal for Starbucks .
Great product placement and they probably did n't even have to pay for it .
Hmm .
Maybe these are the same detainees that the Obama administration wants to execute without trial .
Synergy !
Coverage of the executions could open up all kinds of partnership opportunities for Starbucks and MSNBC .

( I would recommend choosing the " Corporate Social Responsibility " option . )
UPDATE :
A few things I wanted to add :
The New York Times describes this as " the closest integration between an advertiser and a national news program in recent memory , " and provides some details about the sponsorship :
Along with several Starbucks graphics and mentions during each hour of the 6 to 9 a.m. program , Mr. Griffin indicated other possible pairings in the future .
The anchors and the coffee company may team up on charitable initiatives .
And the program may be broadcast from Starbucks locations when it travels , as it did last year for the political conventions and this year for the inauguration .
The deal also includes promotions at MSNBC.com .
Howard Schultz , the chief executive of Starbucks , said in an interview that the deal indicated that " the rules of engagement in marketing and advertising have changed quite significantly . "
He called it an opportunity to " align ourselves with , in my view , one of the smartest morning shows that air on TV . "
Mr. Schultz cited connections between the Starbucks brand and the " Morning Joe " viewers , an audience that he called " sophisticated and upscale . "
Advertising Age injects some irony into Starbucks ' new partnership with a torture advocate :
The partnership , a one - year deal at the outset , will give Starbucks very brief promotional opportunities , during which [ Starbucks Chief Marketing Officer Terry ]
Davenport said the chain will promote its ethical commitments .
" I think one of the things you 'll see us do with this relationship is our ' Shared Planet ' strategy and messaging , " he said .
" We do n't see this as a forum for Pumpkin Spiced Latte , but a forum for talking about ethical sourcing , responsible growing of coffee and volunteerism in local communities .
I think it 's a very appropriate forum for us to get those types of messages out . "
Finally , here 's a bonus torture rant from Joe Scarborough , veering between rage about the release of the torture memos to mocking laughter about the inhuman techniques that were used .

Canadian Magazine Industry News
Cannabis Culture print edition burns out
Marc Emery
Due to unsustainable costs , publisher and well - known marijuana activist Marc Emery has decided to stop printing Cannabis Culture Magazine .
However , in a message published on CannabisCulture.com dated March 25 , Emery said that he and his staff will " continue to devote our time to changing the world and ending the war on drugs through the Cannabis Culture and Pot - TV websites , the CCHQ retail store , the BC Marijuana Party , and CC ’s online mail order .
Of the 62,000 printed for issue # 73 , only 35,000 sold , meaning 27,000 got destroyed ( which is typical with magazines , but very environmentally unfriendly ) .
Now , with chaos in our distribution system , our potential sales would drop to under 30,000 .
The circulation revenue for that is a disappointing $ 44,000 per issue ; advertising revenue is only providing $ 30,000 per issue , but it costs $ 64,000 to print 62,000 copies .
It ’s another $ 10,000 to ship to distributors , stores and subscribers .
Those costs are covered by revenue from all sources , but the cost of producing the magazine is approximately $ 16,000 for material ( writers and photographers ) , $ 32,000 for the staff of six people who work in 8 - week cycles to produce the magazine , $ 4,000 an issue in promotion , posters , subscription cards , and much more that were not covered by revenue the magazine generated .
Subscriptions never made money , and we never had more than 1,400 subscribers at any one time .
Each magazine cost about $ 2 each to produce , plus 60 cents to ship in Canada , $ 1.50 to ship to USA , $ 3.00 abroad .
Envelopes and packing took another 25 cents per issue .
Emery founded the Marijuana & Hemp Newsletter , which evolved into Cannabis Culture magazine , in 1994 .
In his closure letter , Emery offered readers a close - up look at the magazine 's troublesome financials :
Because revenues were not meeting costs , Emery has had to pour $ 20,000 from his retail and mail order businesses into the magazine each month for the last three and a half years .
Emery also noted that the bimonthly magazine medium — because of " the modern - day demand for immediate news and material " — was no longer meeting the needs of his audience .
"
It ’s clear that printed media is no longer sustainable or effective , " Emery wrote .
" If we focus on our online presence , we can raise revenue and be more efficient and competitive with information .
We will continue our pioneering ways by taking advantage of our Pot - TV video capabilities and our extensive contacts and reputation around the world . "
Microsoft Corp. is looking for an answer to Apple Inc. 's genius .
The Redmond , Wash. , software giant plans to open a series of retail stores to show off its goods .
It ’s taking a page from the playbook of its scrappy computer - industry rival , which has boosted sales by opening Apple stores across the globe and stocking its Genius Bar with tech experts .
Details about Microsoft ’s plans for the stores were still scarce Friday .
But the idea is to make it easier for customers to buy and check out Microsoft products , such as the XBox game console , Zune digital media player and Surface tabletop computer -- as well as computer gear made by partners that run its software .
Microsoft named David Porter as corporate vice president of retail stores late Thursday .
He spent 25 years at Wal - Mart Stores Inc. before joining DreamWorks Animation SKG in 2007 , where he was head of worldwide product distribution .

“ I am excited about helping consumers make more informed decisions about their PC and software purchases , ” Porter said in a news release , which added that his first task would be to decide when , where and how to open the Microsoft - branded stores .
Skeptics questioned whether Microsoft ’s strategy would work in a dismal retail climate .
They also wondered whether its stores could compete with Apple ’s , which seem to draw in passersby with the strength of the Death Star tractor beam in “ Star Wars . ”
“ Microsoft is putting the cart before the horse , ” analyst Allan B. Krans with Technology Business Research wrote in a research note .
“ Stores do not draw consumers to products ; innovative products bring consumers into stores . ”
The beginning of Apple ’s store strategy coincided with the launch of the iPod , which attracted shoppers to the retail locations .
Microsoft ’s problem , Krans said , is that it does n’t have anything particularly exciting to show off .
Not many dedicated PC users are willing to sleep outside a Microsoft store for the newest Windows operating system , as Apple fans did for the iPhone .

Worse , Microsoft might alienate its distributors by trying to compete with them , and retail stores do n’t need any more competition in this economy .
Other computer companies , such as Gateway Inc. , that have ventured into retail have failed , and even Microsoft ’s halfhearted attempt at opening a San Francisco store in 1999 was short - lived .
It did n’t take long for ribbing to begin .
A tongue - in - cheek list by PC World of ways in which the Microsoft stores would differ from Apple ’s included an Excuse Bar rather than Genius Bar and a theme park ride called Blue Screen of Death , after the image that appears when a Windows PC crashes .
And on Twitter , a Houston marketer named Brian Rooney wrote : “ What would you do to make going into a Microsoft store a magical experience ?
I would sell Macs . ”

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Two thirds of businesses are unaware they will be able to use their own name in place of domain extensions such as .com , .org , or . net when Internet domains are liberalized next year , according to a survey .
Products are seen on display inside the temporary Nike store in Shoreditch , East London April 30 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Stephen Hird
The change would let the likes of Nike or Microsoft control their own domain and better exploit their brands , and also counter cyber - squatters who use variations of brands on the 280 or so existing domain extensions .
“ If you have ‘. nike ’ , for example , you can create real and specific branded Websites , like ‘ running.nike ’ or ‘ runlondon.nike ’ , ” Joe White , chief operating officer of domain registrar Gandi.net , told Reuters in an interview .
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , which oversees domain names , is expected to start taking applications for new top - level domains early next year , said Future Laboratory , which conducted the research .
But the move is not on the radar of a majority of companies , the survey for Gandi . net found .
“ ( Companies ) are generally completely unaware of this change coming down the line , ” said White .
“ This change has not yet permeated into the mainstream for businesses or consumers . ”
“ However , those businesses which are aware actually see the prospect as being quite exciting , ” he said .
The price of $ 185,000 will initially limit applications to the largest corporations and organizations , said Tom Savigar , Strategy and Insight Director at The Future Laboratory .
ICANN is expecting 300 - 500 applications when it opens its doors in the first quarter of next year , he said .
“ You ’ll see the big global corporations getting there early to own more of their online space , ” he said .
“ ( Owning their domain ) could secure a higher level of credibility and recognition . ”
Smaller businesses will be able to use more specific extensions to match their business sector or geography such as “ .london ” or “ . paris , ” he said .
The Future Laboratory surveyed 100 e-commerce managers ; 50 from high - street companies and 50 from small and medium businesses online .
* Method could move quickly to human trials , company says
* Bypasses cancer - causing methods to make human stem cells
WASHINGTON , May 28 ( Reuters ) - U.S. researchers said on Thursday they had come up with the safest way yet to make stem - like cells using a patient 's ordinary skin cells , this time by using pure human proteins .
The team at Harvard University and Massachusetts - based Advanced Cell Technology Inc
ACTC.PK
said their technique involves soaking cells in human proteins that turn back the clock biologically , making the cells behave like powerful embryonic stem cells .
Dr. Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell sees almost immediate commercial applications .
" After a few more flight tests -- in order to assure everything is working properly -- it should be ready for commercial use , " Lanza said by e-mail .
He said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration permission to test the cells in people by next year -- a process unlikely to be quick , especially with a brand - new technology such as this one .
Stem cells are the body 's master cells , giving rise to all the tissues , organs and blood .
Embryonic stem cells are considered the most powerful kind , as each one is pluripotent , with the potential to morph into any type of tissue .
Doctors hope to someday use them to transform medicine , for instance , by regenerating the cells destroyed in type 1 diabetes or regrowing eye cells to reverse blindness .
But embryonic cells require the use of an embryo or cloning technology , and several countries , including the United States , limit funding for such experiments .
Several teams of scientists have homed in on four genes that can turn back the clock in ordinary cells , making them look and act like embryonic stem cells .
These so - called induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells , could in theory be made using a patient 's own skin , allowing grow - your - own transplants with no risk of rejection .
DIFFICULT WORK
Getting these genes into the cells is not easy , however .
The first attempts used retroviruses , which integrate their own genetic material into the cells they infect .
Others used loops of genetic material called plasmids or other genetically engineered molecules to reformat the cells .
And another team used the proteins made by the four genes and valproic acid to reprogram cells , but Lanza said these methods all have drawbacks .
His team , working with Kwang - Soo Kim of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and a team at CHA Stem Cell Institute in South Korea used a peptide , a protein fragment , to drag the human proteins into the cells .
" These have been around for a long time , " Lanza said .
" The AIDS virus uses the peptide to get into the cells it infects , " he said .
Using cells from the foreskins of newborn boys -- a common laboratory technique -- they showed they could transform the cells into iPS cells .
They regrew them into a variety of mature new cell types , they reported in the journal Cell Stem Cell .
" This method eliminates the risks associated with genetic and chemical manipulation , and provides for the first time a potentially safe source of iPS cells for translation into the clinic , " Lanza said .
" This is the ultimate stem cell solution -- you just add some proteins to a few skin cells and voila !
Patient - specific stem cells ! "
One question that is not clear is who owns the technology .
Lanza said many groups have tried to patent the various steps in the process and it is not yet clear whose patents will prevail .

The initial blueprint , which would have seen analog television switched off last year , looked unlikely as early as 2004 .
Since then , inertia has given way to a modest acceleration and , according to the latest research , 43.4 per cent of Australia 's 21.74 million people have switched to digital either by connecting a set - top box to their existing television or buying a new one .
To meet the revised deadline of 2013 , some 7300 people will need to switch from analog to digital every day for the next 3 ? years .
And Sydney , remarkably , has the most work to do .
Its digital footprint is the lowest of any mainland capital , at just 40 per cent .
Perth , in contrast , has the highest with 47.2 per cent .
The advantages of free - to - air digital TV include sharper picture ( significantly so with high definition ) , better sound and , most importantly , additional channels .
The failure of these channels to materialise , however , has been the greatest hurdle to the roll - out of free - to - air digital .
The reason for this was intense lobbying by the cartel of " old " television networks , who saw change as a greater threat than old age .
That costly mistake dampened enthusiasm for evolution in traditional television and allowed pay TV in particular , the digital - savvy Foxtel to gain a significant foothold and go into profit after only a decade , rare for a subscription television business .
The problem is compounded by confusion about what channels are available and what technology is needed to receive them .
The free - to - air platform Freeview , invented to sell digital free - to - air TV in a single word , launched a campaign selling 15 channels .
But five of those are the existing free - to - air networks and another five are their HD simulcasts , shaving 10 off the total before you 've even picked up the remote .
In fact , at the moment , there are only two new channels on air : the sports channel One and the general entertainment channel ABC2 .
To their credit , both are excellent , particularly for start - up channels .
SBS launches SBS2 in a week , general entertainment channels from Nine and Seven will launch around October ( neither has been officially announced but there are rumours Nine 's will be called GO99 ) and the ABC will launch ABC3 , a children 's channel , by December .
That 's six new channels by the end of the year .
Contrary to prevailing myth , any television can receive digital signals as long as it is connected to a set - top box that decodes the signal .
One of the most powerful illustrations used by Foxtel to sell its digital service was a Foxtel box hooked up to a 1970s - era Rank Arena analog TV .
The picture was not so crisp but the point was clearly made .
So , to dispel any confusion , here 's the capsule tutorial .
No , you do n't need a new digital TV ; a digital set - top box will do .
No , that set - top box does n't have to be a Freeview box ; any box will receive the new channels .
Freeview - badged boxes come with a navigable electronic program guide ( EPG ) but sacrifice some functionality ( ad - skipping and some off - box copying features ) to appease the innovation - fearing broadcasters .
Yes , you might need a new antenna , so check the one you have is up to puff .
That point is generally played down by the industry but , anecdotally at least , the Guide hears many stories about new digital TVs hitting an antenna - related iceberg on their maiden voyage .
Now , to crunch the numbers .
Standard definition pictures are composed of 576 vertical lines of 720 horizontal dots each , interlacing two halves of the same image alternately .
The technical name is 576i ( that 's i for interlaced ) .
High definition ( HD ) is , in theory , anything better than that , so most broadcasters cheat by replacing the interlaced picture with a progressively displayed one .
With a flick of letter legerdemain , 576i becomes 576 p and HD .
A true HD image is closer to 1080 vertical lines of 1920 horizontal dots each ( 1080i or 1080 p ) .
All you need to remember is this : a higher number is a more detail - rich image and where two numbers are identical , p is better than i .
Hopefully that sorts out the confusion but do n't count your digital TV 's chickens ' til they 've hatched .
We 've been sold hollow promises already , so the onus is on the industry to deliver on the audience 's expectation .
Digital radio is grappling with the kind of inertia digital TV faced when it was launched in 2001 .
That should n't last too long , though .
Britain 's Freeview , for example , has 30 radio stations in addition to its 50 television channels and when Australian broadcasters realise the market 's hunger for new content , they will likely follow suit .
One of the remaining hurdles is the corporate fragmentation of the Australian broadcast market and the gulf between city and regional broadcasters .
Regional Australia lags in the roll - out of digital infrastructure and a digital channel such as One can only be seen in the mainland capitals .
The other challenge is the current global financial situation .
The clock is ticking and the networks must launch new services but the economic climate has rarely been so unforgiving .
The networks should have made digital hay while the economic sun was shining .
Before we begin , let ’s be clear about one thing : sometimes a massage , even one where the masseuse uses her teeth , really is just a massage .
As Clifford Levy writes today in The Times , the opposition on Georgia is hoping to use mockery as one part of their arsenal to force the country ’s president , Mikheil Saakashvili , from office .
Unfortunately for Mr. Saakashvili , the opposition recently happened upon a virtual gold mine of material for their campaign on the racy personal blog of a female American massage therapist , who flew to Georgia to treat him in February .
The masseuse is named Dorothy Stein , but she goes by the nickname one of her many famous clients , Frank Zappa , gave her years ago : Dr. Dot .
As she explained in a VH1 profile some years ago , her massage career began at the age of 14 when she offered to give members of the rock band Def Leppard back rubs as a way of getting to hang around with her idols backstage .
With that early start , she set about compiling the impressive list of “ satisfied customers ” on her professional Web site , which now includes hundreds of famous rock stars and celebrities — like the Rolling Stones , Sting , Mariah Carey , Russel Crowe , Jay - Z , Juliette Lewis ( who could play her in a biopic ) , Lauryn Hill , Ice - T , Eros Ramazotti and Bruce Willis , for starters .
It is not clear exactly when Dr. Dot added her most unusual massage technique — biting her clients backs — to her arsenal , but that certainly attracted the attention of Russia Today , the state - supported satellite channel that deals with Mr. Saakashvili roughly the way Fox News dealt with President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s .
In this recent report , Russia Today sought to portray Dr. Dot ’s visit to Georgia as a sign that Mr. Saakashvili is using his office to live a life of at least mildly kinky luxury , fit for a rock star :
As Dr. Dot complains on her blog , the footage in this report of her at work was taken from her YouTube channel , but the key image , for the purposes of some part of Georgia ’s opposition movement , is the still of Mr. Saakashvili with his arm around Dr. Dot at the start of the report .
That image , which was taken from the first blog post she wrote about massaging Mr. Saakashvili , mirrors the dozens of similar snapshots she has of herself with famous rock stars on her distinctly R-rated MySpace page , but opponents of Mr. Saakashvili are using it as the basis for a kind of viral poster campaign against him .
Posters featuring the image , and the word “ Why ? ” in Georgian , started appearing on walls around the country ’s capital , Tbilisi , recently — and were waved at a rally against his leadership on Thursday .
The New York Times
As an article on a Georgian news Web site explained last week , the posters are reportedly the work of an opposition youth group :
The group has been hanging posters in the streets of Tbilisi showing a picture of President Saakashvili together with an U.S. masseuse Dr. Dot .
The picture was posted on the latter ’s blog , where she was writing about her “ favourite client ” President Saakashvili .
The story became talk of Tbilisi after the Georgian tabloids reported about it and after it was picked up by two Tbilisi - based small television stations , Maestro and Kavkasia .
You do n’t need to read or speak Georgian to understand that this opposition group is clearly trying to use innuendo to suggest that Dr. Dot ’s apparently legitimate , if unconventional , massage therapy is something Mr. Saakashvili should be ashamed of having taken part in .
You also do n’t have to understand Georgian to see how bad this report on Kavkasia TV , featuring clips of Dr. Dot with her rock star clients , might look to Georgian voters .
In a telephone interview on Wednesday , Dr. Dot told The Lede that the Georgian media and opposition were distorting the contents of her blog by taking things out of context .
For instance , she said , the images of her in sexy clothing used in the Kavkasia report came from photographs of her taken to accompany her column in Penthouse magazine , and were not at all like the kind of clothes she wears during her massage work .
“ I wear a stupid T - shirt and sneakers 99 % of the time , ” she said .
She also added that there was nothing illicit about the massages she had given Mr. Saakashvili : “ I do n’t shag my clients — I did n’t even bite him . ”
Dr . Dot also said that if she thought there was something to hide in her relationship with Mr. Saakashvili , she would not have blogged so extensively about her trip .
She added that she she did not take down her blog posts , photographs or video of the trip after the media coverage in Georgia because she thought that would give ammunition to people who are trying to hurt Mr. Saakashvili .
My colleague , Mr. Levy , is in Tbilisi , and on Tuesday he asked one of Mr. Saakashvili ’s top advisers , Giga Bokeria , to comment .
Mr. Bokeria repeatedly emphasized that the government did not spend any money on Dr. Dot , and said the president ’s opponents were trying to smear his reputation .
“ The story was that the president sent his plane to — I do n’t know , the United States was one version , another was to Germany – to bring her to Georgia .
And , of course , this is serious , I mean , this is like some kind of banana - dictator type of behavior , ” Mr. Bokeria said .
“ And that , of course , was always a lie .
She came to Georgia , and she hung out with some security guys and she gave a massage to the president , and maybe stayed for some hours or a day in the residence . ”
“ If there would be any information out there that there were government resources spent for that kind of private endeavor , that would be damaging , ” he said .
“ But this is not true .
And no one thinks that it ’s true .
Except for someone extremely critical of the government – that ’s one more thing to mention .
But seriously , no , of course , everybody knows that that is not the way that President Saakashvili or anybody else is running this country . ”
Mr. Bokeria has probably been spending less time than the country ’s opposition reading Dr. Dot ’s account of her trip to Georgia on her blog , but his statement about the duration of the trip does seem to be at odds with the first words she wrote there : “ I am here for a week massaging my favorite client on earth ( sorry Simon Cowell , you ’ve been bumped down a notch from my # 1 spot for now ) , President of Georgia , Mikheil Saakaashvili , who invited me to his interesting country . ”
As for Mr. Bokeria ’s assertion that the president did not send his plane to bring Dr. Dot to Georgia , it should be said that while the first shot of the three - part video diary of her trip to Georgia she posted on her YouTube channel , “ DrDotIsLovinLife , ” shows her view of the plane on the runway at the airport in Batumi , Georgia , her narration says : “ You see that plane ?
I flew from Berlin , Germany to Batumi , Georgia with the president of Georgia . ”
So , according to Dr. Dot , the plane was not sent for her , she flew with the president .
[ Note : Dr. Dot ’s videos , like much of her blogging , do contain some strong language . ]
While Dr. Dot ’s lengthy account of the week she says she spent in Georgia massaging Mr. Saakashvili in February is far too full of colorful language for us to link to it , those who are eligible to attend R - rated movies can check it out for themselves .
Here though is a flavor of Dr. Dot ’s chatty blogging style , taken from the first post she wrote about treating Mr. Saakashvii , last year in Berlin , headlined : “ A Different Georgia on My Mind . ”
In this post Dr. Dot explains how the photograph that has caused him so much grief recently came about :
Inside the Cyberspace Policy Review report that President Obama will unveil in moments at a White House press event is a call for an amped - up effort to get more of the USA 's students trained to participate in the digital revolution .
A White House fact sheet released just prior to the president 's remarks , says the report will recommend " increased education efforts " similar to those launced in math and science after the Russians beat the USA into space by launching Sputnik in 1957 .
Acknowledging the serious theats that hackers pose to a nation that 's increasingly dependent on computer technology , Obama will announce plans to name a White House cyberczar to coordinate security efforts .
The report that the president is unveiling now resulted from a 60 - day review of the nation 's cybersecurity by the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council .
( Posted by Kathy Kiely )
The startup where I was working had massive layoffs -- nearly 50 percent of the staff -- and it was my turn to cast my net out to find a new IT position .
A contract - to - hire opportunity came to my attention the old - fashioned way : through family connections .
The cousin of my dad 's wife was a VP in a service provider to the financial industry and agreed to forward my resume to his friend , the CTO .
I heard through the grapevine that my resume was well - received , which was nice to hear since I had more than 15 years experience in the business .
I finally interviewed with a manager in a satellite office .
The job was gathering and documenting business and functional requirements for an ongoing project .
She demoed the current application , which was three years in the making .
I was seriously underwhelmed .
There was a UI shell and really nothing else .
[ Want to cash in on your IT experiences ?
Send your tech tale , lesson learned the hard way , or war story from the trenches to offtherecord@infoworld.com .
If we publish it , we 'll send you a $ 50 American Express gift card . ]
I felt from the beginning that we were n't connecting , but she must have been told by the CTO to try and get me on board because she kept casting about looking for something that resonated with her .
When she learned that I started my database designs in the 3rd normal form , she finally got behind me and gave me the contract .
I told a friend that it was the strangest qualification I ever floated to land a contract , and one of the most meaningless , but it did the trick .
Very quickly , it was clear that things were not going to work .
Within the first week , she curtailed the times I could physically be in the office and laid down the maximum hours per day I could bill ( no making up for lost time ) .
Then she canceled my access to the system with the existing functional requirements .
My requests for things like project charter , statement of work , functional specifications , use cases , and stakeholder interview notes were denied .
They existed , but I could n't see them .
I could n't meet with the executive sponsor nor could I meet with the key stakeholders until she arranged it .
I got into trouble for making an Access database to track user statements , business requirements , and technical requirements because it was " programming " and I was an analyst .
She threatened to have Access uninstalled from my desktop .
When I finally got to work with the key stakeholders , we made good progress .
For a few weeks , great information was coming out and I wrote some solid reports and requirements specifications .
The stakeholders and CTO were all very pleased with the quantity and quality of work I was producing -- but no feedback from the manager .
After that first round of interviews and business requirements , she had me cancel all future meetings until she could review the work done to date .
Naturally , no review was ever done .
No meetings were ever scheduled .
When I asked about the review , she said that I was aggressive and pushy .
So , two weeks went by with nothing really happening .
I could n't interview stakeholders , I could n't use Access , nor could I write VBA to automate Excel spreadsheets with the data I collected .
Finally , she came up with some busy work : clean up a huge database dump .
By hand .
Within one day she had written a dozen e-mails to me complaining that the work was incorrect ( but no corrections were provided ) , incomplete ( but no indication of what should be done ) , and too slow ( although automation tools were prohibited and she was n't available for questions for hours on end ) .
The next morning , my account was disabled and the contract was terminated .
I think that she never wanted me there in the first place , but hired me because her boss told her to .
Plus , from everything that I saw , the project was a serious train wreck and she did n't want anyone else to know about it .
I had only ever read about managers like this , but now I can put a check in the " been there , done that " box labeled " have worked for incompetent manager . "
NUSA DUA , Indonesia ( Reuters ) -
As many as 600 million people will die early from exposure to industrial waste , most of them in the developing world , the head of a non-profit group warned on Tuesday .
Tanneries , mines and car battery recycling sites are often “ toxic hotspots ” in developing countries , causing cancer , retardation in children and early death , Richard Fuller , president of the Blacksmith Institute , said in an interview .
New York - based Blacksmith works with communities around the world to clean up such sites , focusing on those that threaten human health .
The organization aims to raise $ 500 million for its Health and Pollution Fund , which Fuller said could eradicate toxic hotspots in a few decades .
“ This is a finite problem .
There are just thousands , not tens of thousands , of toxic hotspots around the world , ” he said .
“ It ’s something that we can solve in our lifetimes . ”
Fuller spoke to Reuters on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank ’s annual meeting held on the island of Bali in Indonesia .
Blacksmith , which has so far completed more than 50 such clean - up projects since 1999 , has been working with the ADB and the World Bank to establish its fund .
Concern about polluted places is growing as the world ’s population swells and people in developing countries such as China and India buy more goods like cars and electronics .
Most of the companies responsible for the industrial waste are not large multinationals , but often smaller , local firms , Fuller said .
Multinationals are more sensitive to negative publicity associated with industrial waste and usually have ample resources to clean up for themselves , he said .
To publicize the issue , Blacksmith now releases an annual listing of the world ’s worst pollution problems and most polluted places .
Africa tops the list for the most polluted region , followed by China .
Blacksmith has led a $ 200,000 clean - up of a battery site in Haina in the Dominican Republic , in which much of the underlying soil was 35 percent lead , a pollutant that leads to severe learning disabilities in children .
Cleanup costs can range from $ 10 million for sites that involve polluted rivers , to $ 20,000 for cleaning up rusty containers of toxic chemicals that face the risk of exploding .
While the global financial crisis has made it tougher to raise funds , Fuller said he was undeterred in his mission .
“ This is half a billion people who are being poisoned , ” he said .
“ That ’s not a tolerable situation . ”

THE COMMENT was stark in its simplicity .
“ I listened .
I heard .
I believe you , ” a Dubliner wrote in one of the books of solidarity being signed at the Mansion House for victims of abuse yesterday .
Several hundred people filed into the Dublin lord mayor ’s residence to add their signatures and comments to one of seven books in use .
Lengthy queues formed at the weekend as hundreds more waited in line .
More than 3,000 people signed the books at the weekend , according to mayor Eibhlin Byrne .
The public was initially invited to come on Saturday and Sunday , but because of the huge numbers arriving , the books are being left open until Friday .
The Mansion House has also received many requests from abroad for an online book of condolence , particularly from Britain and the US .
A spokeswoman said the mayor would see if this was feasible .
Some callers have said they will travel from abroad specifically to sign the books .
While Dubliners accounted for most of the signatures so far , comments have been left by people from almost every county and by people with addresses in countries such as Britain , Sweden , the US and Australia .
The books are heavy with poignant comments from victims , relatives and shocked members of the public .
One victim from Co Meath wrote : “ I am one of the many of the abused .
Now we will be heeded .
Thank God . ”
A person from East Yorkshire described himself as a fellow survivor and wrote : “ I hope you come to know healing . ”
Another said he was “ an almost escapee of sexual abuse at the hands of three Christian Brothers ” .
One writer told how he was a victim for 17 years and was admitted to an adult mental hospital at the age of 15 .
Relatives and friends of abused children also left their messages .
“ Remembering Paddy ” wrote one Dubliner .
Another wrote simply , “ For my father ” .
And a Dublin 14 resident added : “ Peter , we always believed you .
Ireland will believe you now . ”
One writer remembered “ my sister who hung herself ” and all the victims who had not lived to see the commission report , or had spent their lives in hospitals and homes .
Anger was palpable in many of the comments , with remarks such as “ Lock them up ” , and “ Rome , stand up and name those who hurt our children ” , and “ Shame on you , Government and Church ” .
Feelings of guilt were also evident .
One woman wrote : “ We lived so close to Artane but were not aware of what was going on or how we could have helped .
We were children of the 50s and 60s . ” A person from Crumlin wrote “ my heart is broken ” .
Some people used just one word to convey their reaction .
“ Sorry ” was the most frequent message , often coming from families .
“ Horror ” came from an address in Dublin ’s Mount Merrion .
One visitor pointed to the biblical passage Mark 10:14 which refers to Jesus saying , “ Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these . ”
The writer asked : “ How could such a vision turn so depraved ? ”
Other injustices were also highlighted by visitors .
“ Dozens of child asylum seekers have disappeared while in State care .
Where is the outcry ? ” asked a person from Dún Laoghaire .
Yesterday ’s callers were young and old , arriving alone and in couples .
Joanna Travers , a staff member at the Mansion House , said there had been a constant stream of visitors all day .
“ There have been a lot of people very upset coming in . ”
One woman let a large sigh as she leafed through a book of solidarity .
“ I just do n’t know what to say anymore , ” she said to the man beside her .
He nodded silently .
Strangers Raise Thousands to Help Pizza Guy Replace Stolen Car
Last week , pizza delivery driver Steve Walker 's car was stolen while he was delivering an order , and he could n't afford to replace it .
But one witness to the crime decided to ask the community to help out — and people all over the world have contributed thousands of dollars to his fund .
Last week , as pizza delivery driver Steve Walker was heading to an apartment building in a Chicago neighborhood with an order to deliver , he was robbed and brutally beaten by two men , who dragged him across the asphalt of the road .
Walker was left with severe contusions and road rash , and , even worse , his car was stolen and totaled .
His auto insurance policy did n’t cover theft , and he could n’t afford to buy a new one .
Walker had worked for Papa John ’s pizza for 16 years , and relied on his car to do his job .
Without a working car , he would have no way to support himself .
Luckily , Omar Gutierrez , a Good Samaritan who happened to see the assault and theft , stepped in to help him out .
After Gutierrez went to the police station to give his eyewitness account of the crime , he spent quite a bit of time talking to Walker .
“ I can say I got to know him and he is a good , honest guy , ” he wrote on his blog .
“ I believe people like him deserve to be helped in times of need .
He works in our community and delivers pizza in our block all the time .
Let ’s show him we care ! ”
Gutierrez asked his friends and neighbors to donate money to help Walker pay for a new car , which would cost $ 2,000 .
He did n’t expect that the community would come up with the full amount , but he hoped that they might be able to give Walker a good start .
But to his surprise , the donations started to pour in — first from his friends and neighbors , but soon , from people all around the world who had heard Walker ’s story .
Papa John ’s Pizza decided to chip in as well , with a combined $ 2,500 contribution from the local franchise and the national headquarters .
Altogether , as of yesterday , Gutierrez ’ PayPal account to support Walker had raised a grand total of $ 14,729.90 .
The PayPal account is now closed , but well - wishers are still welcome to contribute to Walker ’s cause by check .
Walker ’s story has also won the support of pizza delivery drivers everywhere .
“ A lot of delivery guys have written me saying , ‘ Thank you for what you are doing for us , ’ ” Gutierrez told the Chicago Tribune , adding that “ I would like to tell people to tip well . ”
Gutierrez and Walker are both thrilled by the outpouring of money , support , and kind words from the global community .
As a small thank you , Gutierrez invited all of the local donors to his house last night for — what else ? — a pizza party .

Way back in June 2008 this blog first suggested a Shuttle mission designated STS - 134 to deliver the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer , A Sacrifice For AMS ?
Today NASA has officially put STS - 134 on the launch manifest with a projected launch date of September 16 , 2010 .
The idea of retiring a Shuttle in Space was seen as so revolting that there is now funding for a full 2 - way mission with a full crew .
The person who suggested STS - 134 now has an office at Johnson Space Center .
Just last Monday I talked with astronaut Dave Wolf , who was heavily in favour of the added mission .
Astronauts have a lot of influence on what flies -- they love the AMS mission because it means new physics and seven more flight slots .
Happy birthday Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln !
Today everyone considers Lincoln a great president , but in his time the country was literally divided over his leadership .
Darwin was also considered crazy in his time .
There are people out there today who still doubt Darwin , but we will never please everyone .
200 years from now some will still think that the speed of light is fixed , like the Earth .

We love making our own flavored spirits at home , but properly capturing bacon is a bit of a challenge .
Now , thanks to Seattle 's Black Rock Spirits , we have Bakon Vodka !
This is an unusual premium spirit with a familiar flavor ; Bakon is the only vodka on the market that captures the meaty , peppery flavor of just - cooked bacon while maintaining a crisp , clean profile .
Perfect for making a rich Bloody Mary , it also begs for experimentation with creative mixology .

Richard Poplawski , a member of a racist group , killed three police officers
America could be facing a surge in right - wing extremism , according to a new US government report .
The Department of Homeland Security study says the election of America 's first black president and the economic slump has helped racist groups recruit .
But the report says no specific attacks are being planned by extremists .
Some moderate conservatives fear the administration could use the report as an excuse to tighten gun laws and restrict freedom of speech .
Pronounced threat
The report says that high unemployment figures and home foreclosures have created a climate similar to the early 1990s when white supremacists saw a growth period .
That resurgence was stifled in 1995 after an FBI crackdown on extreme right groups following the Oklahoma City bombings carried out by Timothy McVeigh .
Some extreme right websites reported a surge in membership immediately after Barack Obama 's election .
The Homeland Security study says the threat posed by what it calls " lone wolves " and " small terrorist cells " is more pronounced that in previous years .
It cites an example two weeks ago when three police officers were shot dead in Pittsburgh by Richard Poplawski , who had been a member of a white supremacist group .
Some more moderate conservatives have criticised the Homeland Security study .
They believe the White House could use it to justify tougher gun laws and restrictions on conservatives ' freedom of speech .
The issue is being keenly debated on right - wing blogs and talk shows .
Radio talk show host Michael Savage , who runs the website Savage Nation , is asking his readers whether Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano should step down for " targeting loyal , patriotic Americans as possible terrorists " .
Eczema causes red itchy patches on the skin Scientists believe they have found what triggers many children with eczema to go on to develop asthma .
The Public Library of Science Biology study points to a way to stop what is known as the " atopic march " .
The US team at the Washington University School of Medicine showed that a substance made by the damaged skin triggered asthma symptoms in mice .
The same substance , thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) , is also produced in the lungs of asthma patients .
Now it will be important to address how to prevent defective skin from producing TSLP
Lead researcher Dr Raphael Kopan Early treatment of the skin rash and blocking TSLP production might stop asthma developing in young patients with eczema , they hope .
Drugs that act on TSLP might also protect against asthma development even in cases that are not linked to eczema .
Atopic march Allergies and asthma often occur together .
Studies show that 50 - 70 % of children with severe allergic skin problems - atopic dermatitis - go on to develop asthma .
The researchers studied mice bred with a genetic defect that made them develop a condition similar to eczema in humans .
The defective skin secreted TSLP , which the researchers believe alerts the body that its protective barrier has failed .
When they tested the lungs of the mice , they found this tissue also responded strongly to the TSLP signal and had the hallmark traits of asthma - mucous secretion , airway muscle contraction and invasion of white blood cells .
These results were obtained from studies with mice , so it is important to establish whether the same causal link exists in humans
Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK
They did more experiments and found that even mice with normal skin but bred to overproduce TSLP also developed asthma - like symptoms , suggesting TSLP is indeed the culprit .
Lead researcher Dr Raphael Kopan said : " We are excited because we 've narrowed down the problem of atopic march to one molecule .
" We 've shown that the skin can act as a signalling organ and drive allergic inflammation in the lung by releasing TSLP .
" Now it will be important to address how to prevent defective skin from producing TSLP .
If that can be done , the link between eczema and asthma could be broken . "
Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK said : " This is the first piece of research to suggest that the natural protein TSLP could play a direct role in causing people with eczema to develop asthma .
" These results were obtained from studies with mice , so it is important to establish whether the same causal link exists in humans .
" Scientists are already exploring the potential of targeting TSLP to create new treatments for eczema , asthma and other allergic conditions .
" Although it is still a long way off , this research raises the exciting possibility that as well as improving symptoms , these treatments might be able to limit , or even prevent , the development of asthma . "

Nous vous proposons donc ce petit guide pour vous aider à mieux y voir .
A votre inscription sur un casino en ligne , vous aurez le choix entre de multiples .
Entre les différentes cartes de crédits existantes , les virements bancaires et les portefeuilles électroniques , vous avez l’embarras du choix .
L’utilisation des crypto-monnaies devient de plus en plus courante .
Les experts voient que la monnaie physique pourrait bien céder sa place à ces devises virtuelles qui commencent à prendre de l’ampleur dans le marché et qui constituent un très bon investissement au long terme .
Avant de vous engager dans le monde du jeu en ligne , vérifiez toutes les conditions relatives au dépôt et au retrait de vos gains au futur .
Faites attention car certains casinos en ligne ne citent pas clairement leurs conditions , il faudra dans ce cas lire les avis et critiques des joueurs avant de jouer .
En effet , certains d’entre eux ne vous permettront pas de retirer vos gains sans miser un montant donné , d’autres imposent des plafonds trop restreints quant aux sommes à retirer de votre compte .
Il faut également s’assurer de choisir un moyen de payement sécurisé .
Le cartes Visa ou Mastercard , par exemple , assurent une grande sécurité dans les transactions monétaires , mais peuvent néanmoins entraîner des charges supplémentaires .
Les devises et moyens de payement disponibles dépendent largement du pays dans lequel le joueur se trouve .
La ffait que pas mal de joueurs se font vite arnaquer si le site n’est pas suffisamment fiable .
Il est important que chaque utilisateur prenne le temps de vérifier si le site visité est sécurisé car cela lui assurera une sûreté relative à ses données bancaires et à ses informations personnelles , mais lui garantira également une expérience de jeu agréable .
La plupart des joueurs inexpérimentés pensent qu’il n’existe aucun casino en ligne entièrement fiable de ce point de vue , mais cette idée est fausse .
Il existe bien évidemment des sites de jeu en ligne tout à fait légitimes et sécurisés , mais il y a en a également un grand nombre qui présentent un grand danger pour les joueurs et qui ne respectent pas les réglementations liées à leur création et à leur fonctionnement .
En effet , plusieurs sites jouissent d’une réputation irréprochable , notamment grâce à une campagne publicitaire réussie , mais qui sont très peu sécurisés .
Il ne faut donc pas se fier à la première impression qui peut se dégager d’un casino en ligne .
Plusieurs méthodes peuvent permettre aux joueurs de distinguer un casino en ligne fiable d’un autre où il pourrait se faire arnaquer très facilement , dont la première est de faire une recherche efficace sur le sujet .
Ceci revient notamment à s’assurer de la situation juridique , vis -à - vis de ces sites , dans le pays où le casino est basé .
En effet , si vous vous trouvez dans un pays où la situation juridique a été établie , il serait meilleur de vous éloigner des casinos en ligne pour votre sûreté .
Généralement , les casinos en ligne doivent d’abord être validés par uneavec une licence , il est donc important de vérifier si le site figure parmi la liste deset sécurisés sur internet .
La plupart du temps , cette autorité est un organisme du gouvernement appartenant au pays en question .
Elle se chargera de la réglementation du marché de jeu et s’assurera que le moins d’infractions possibles , liées à la sécurité financière et privée des joueurs , puisse avoir lieu , et ce en mettant en place des lois strictes à respecter par les deux parties .
Les premières sources d’informations à visiter sont les sections « A propos » , « Politique de confidentialité » , « informations » ou sections similaires .
Un casino en ligne digne de confiance doit afficher les informations relatives à la sécurité et à la confidentialité du joueur , ainsi qu’aux règles de jeux , de dépôt et de retrait , en toute transparence .
Si le site affiche trop peu d’informations , ou démontre une contradiction notable dans les informations données , il serait préférable de s’en éloigner .
L’aspect le plus important à prendre en compte lors du choix de votre casino en ligne concerne les .
En effet , vous devez vous assurer que ces jeux sont assez variés et sont présents en quantité et qualité sur le site .
La plupart des casinos en ligne proposent presque les mêmes types de jeux .
Ceci inclut , entre autres , les jeux de casino classiques tels que le poker , le blackjack , les machines à sous , la roulette et le baccarat .
Certains sites se démarquent néanmoins en offrant des jeux plus diversifiés , c’est donc une bonne idée de chercher un casino proposant une sélection originale de jeux .
Le type de jeux le plus populaire sur les casinos reste les slot machines .
Aujourd ’hui , ces machines virtuelles sont présentes en grand nombre et en grande variété .
Les types les plus connus sont notamment les traditionnelles , les machines à thèmes ( historiques , fantastiques , etc ) et les modernes du type i-Slots ou 3D .
Certains sites vont jusqu’à proposer plus de 200 machines à sous , d’autres s’y consacrent entièrement et assurent pas mal de gains .
Il y a même des sites qui proposent des machines à sous gratuites , offrant de multiples avantages aux joueurs , tels que la possibilité de tester les jeux , de s’y entraîner ou simplement d’apprécier les parties , sans se soucier de perdre sa mise .
Pour garantir lapar ces sites , il est essentiel de voir par qui ils sont développés .
Les éditeurs de jeux les plus connus comme Play’n Go , NetEnt , Betsoft Gaming et Yaggdras , ils fournissent des jeux de très haute qualité .
Un bon casino doit être en mesure de collaborer avec un nombre important de fournisseurs de jeux professionnels spécialisés dans le domaine , car ceci contrôle la performance et le rendu des produits .
Le jeu idéal , quel que soit son type , doit être rapide , dynamique , avoir un design attirant et des graphismes de haute qualité , ainsi que des effets sonores en harmonie avec le contenu .
Dans le but d’attirer plus de joueurs , proposer les bonus les plus attrayants est devenu à la mode dans le monde des casinos en ligne , et c’est l’un des facteurs les plus importants à prendre en considération lors dudans lequel vous voulez miser de l’argent réel .
Prenez le temps de consulter la liste de bonus offerts par le site pour savoir s’il vaut le coup d’être testé .
En général , dès qu’un nouveau joueur s’inscrit sur un casino en ligne , unlui est attribué .
Certains de ces bonus peuvent atteindre les 200 % et sans conditions .

Ces programmes récompensent les membres fidèles du casino en fonction de leur ancienneté , de leur activité et des sommes versées sur leurs comptes .
Ils ont alors accès à des promotions exclusives et parfois des bonus gratuits ainsi qu’à un service exceptionnel .
Soyez cependant vigilant vis -à - vis des sites aux bonus alléchants et qui ne semblent imposer aucune condition , ou des conditions trop louches .
Parce que le jeu sur un casino en ligne implique de l’argent réel , le service clientèle doit toujours être à la disposition des joueurs .
Il y a en effet de grandes chances pour qu’un client contacte l’équipe responsable du site et pose des questions ou expose des problèmes divers .
Par conséquent , il est primordial que tous les moyens soient mis à la portée des membres voulant entrer en contact avec le staff , des moyens tels qu’une ligne téléphonique , un adresse email ou une chambre de chat en direct .

Pour cela , il suffit d’entrer en contact avec le service clientèle et d’attendre la réponse de ce dernier .

Même en ayant pris toutes vos dispositions pour , vous n’en êtes toujours pas à l’abri .
Quand on a peu d’expérience dans le domaine du jeu en ligne , il est sage de se tourner vers des joueurs plus expérimentés pour savoir quels casinos choisir .
En effet , certains casinos ont une si mauvaise réputation que personne sur internet ne vous conseillera d’y jouer et plusieurs raisons font qu’un casino peut être mis en liste noire par une communauté d’internaute : des jeux peu variés ou de mauvaise qualité , l’absence ou l’inactivité du service clientèle ou surtout , les arnaques et pratiques malhonnêtes .
Pas mal de joueurs dénoncent des casinos en ligne qui refusent de leur attribuer des gains bien mérités , qui bloquent leurs comptes sans aucun motif valable , qui annulent tous leurs gains , qui masquent tous leurs commentaires négatifs ou même qui modifient les conditions de dépôt et de retrait à leur guise .
De nombreux sites , connus en France mais également dans le monde entier , proposent des analyses , avis et .
Gardez en tête qu’il ne faut jamais s’aventurer sur un site avec trop d’avis négatifs car vous risquez simplement d’avoir une mauvaise expérience de jeu , voire de perdre des sommes d’argent très importantes .
Vous pouvez toujours porter plainte si vous pensez que vous avez été victime d’une pratique frauduleuse venant d’un site quelconque .

" At this stage there have been no confirmed cases ( of swine flu in Australia ) , '' she said .
Department of Human Services spokesman Bram Alexander said passengers assessed at Melbourne this morning did not require testing because they did not " meet the case definition ' ' .
" It was determined that they 're OK , '' he said .
Mr Alexander said passengers were required to tell airline staff if they felt unwell or were exhibiting flu - like symptoms when they arrived in Australia .
It was then decided whether further testing needed to take place .
" As long as there are ( swine flu ) cases in the Americas , this is a requirement that we have in place , '' he said .
Nick McInerney , who arrived in Melbourne today after a three - week film shoot in Mexico , said mask - wearing quarantine officials had escorted two people from QF94 , his Qantas flight from Los Angeles .
" As far as I know there were two people taken off the plane , '' he said at Melbourne International Airport .
Qantas later confirmed a " routine check " but said no one had been removed from the plane .
Mr McInerney said people in Mexico were becoming more fearful as the outbreak grew worse .
" People in Mexico are scared , '' he said .
" They said if I developed any symptoms that I should go see a doctor , that was it . ''
Businessman Bob Hendricks , from the US state of Virginia , arrived in Melbourne from Los Angeles this morning after a brief delay in Sydney due to quarantine activity .
He said while he had not been affected by swine flu , he would be keeping an eye on the situation in the lead - up to a planned holiday to the Mexican beach resort town of Cancun in June .
" I 'll be looking to see how things go , '' he said .
Channel Nine reporter Christine Ahern , who is holidaying in the Mexican resort town of Cancun , said the anxiety levels of tourists was growing by the day .
" There 's worse places to be stranded than Cancun but ( swine flu ) has a lot of travellers on edge and undecided about what they should do , '' she told Radio 3AW .
Ahern said tourists were staying in their resorts and at least one US couple had cut their holiday short following the flu outbreak .
Tourists were being given " sketchy and conflicting advice ' ' but had been told they would not be allowed to board flights out of Mexico if they displayed flu - like symptoms .
" I 've been talking to a lot of tourists here over the last day or so their anxiety is definitely increasing , '' she said .
Earlier , Victorian Health Minister Daniel Andrews said three Victorian tourists recently returned from north America were tested overnight and cleared of swine flu .
He said the three tourists , who had been travelling in the United States where there have been outbreaks of the killer flu , had flu - like symptoms and took the precautionary step of undergoing tests .
Mr Andrews said none of them had the type - A virus , which meant they did not have swine flu .
" But the message it getting out there , '' Mr Andrews told ABC Radio .
" If you have a travel history and you have flu - like symptoms , go to your GP or emergency department or ring Nurse on Call and get the care that you need and we can take appropriate steps that you need . ''
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon said five people in NSW suspected of having swine flu have come through the first stage of testing and have been found to have contracted an unidentifiable type A virus .
She says the five people , including children , will need further tests to see if they have swine flu , which has killed 149 people in Mexico and spread to other countries around the globe .
" We 'll go through the next range of testing to see if it is this particular disease in Mexico , '' Ms Roxon told Channel Nine .
" There are many types of flu strains , just in the course of the flu season , and we need to go through the process to rule out what it might be . ''
A laboratory in Melbourne also is testing samples of a virus that was picked up by students from a New Zealand college who returned from Mexico last Saturday displaying flu - like symptoms .
Ms Roxon said the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) raised its alert level overnight from level three to level four .
" That means they have made the decision that it is not going to be possible to contain this disease , '' Ms Roxon said .
She said Australia has stockpiled around 8.7 million doses of anti-viral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza to combat swine flu , which is believed to be a mutation of swine , avian and human flu .
" We would take advice on who you would target in the population first if we moved to a pandemic stage but we need to remember that whilst we are preparing for the worst , at this stage there are no confirmed cases in Australia , '' she said .
" We are taking every precaution that we can to make sure that if there are cases in Australia we can act quickly to contain them . ''
Earlier , five passengers who were detained with flu symptoms aboard a Qantas flight from Los Angeles to Brisbane were cleared .
A Qantas spokeswoman said quarantine officials removed the passengers from Qantas flight 16 at 6.10 am today .
" It actually had five passengers who reported ill but they 've all been cleared , so there 's no issues whatsoever there at all , '' she said .
" As I understand it ... they were cleared by AQIS ( Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service ) .
" Any passengers or flight crew that have any symptoms report it to AQIS and then AQIS assess them from there . ''
No aircrew had reported flu symptoms yet nor would they have to wear surgical masks , she said .
Queensland 's chief health officer Jeannette Young said two women , one in her mid-20s and one in her mid-40s , who were taken off the Qantas flight on Tuesday morning had been sent home with Tamiflu medication .
It is believed passengers had touched down in Brisbane on a Qantas flight from Los Angeles when a number declared feeling unwell and were escorted off by Queensland Health inspectors .
" Under the new practice in place now , passengers identified as showing particular symptoms are escorted from the aircraft first , " an airport spokesman said .
" This is what happened this morning .
I believe it was up to half a dozen . "
The news comes as the number of Queenslanders tested for swine flu has risen to 14 , although no cases have yet been confirmed .
New biosecurity procedures for the screening of airline passengers travelling to Australia from the Americas came into effect at midnight .
Authorities have confirmed swine flu cases in the United States , Britain , Canada and Spain as the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) today upgraded its pandemic alert level from three to four .

The decision to upgrade the alert level signalled a " significant increase in risk of a pandemic ' ' , WHO said .

Joel Ftizgibbon takes his seat on the backbench during Question Time today after resigning as Defence Minister .
Credit : Glen McCurtayne Mr Rudd described Mr Fitzgibbon as a " first - class Defence Minister " .
" The Government expects high standards of accountability on the part of ministers , " he said .
Mr Rudd said it was on that basis that the minister had resigned today .
Mr Fitzgibbon is the first Rudd Government minister to lose his job and it comes after months of pressure on Mr Fitzgibbon .
Mr Rudd said a new defence minister would be named shortly .
" I feel very sad about this , " Mr Rudd told a press conference in Canberra , but he insisted high standards of ministerial accountability must be met .
Mr Fitzgibbon said he had quit after it was revealed his ministerial office was used for a meeting between a big US health insurer , Humana , his brother Mark , who heads the health fund NIB , and government and veterans ' affairs officials .
" I have learned that one meeting between the parties was held in my ministerial office .
Further , I understand that members of my staff sat in on a number of meetings , " Mr Fitzgibbon wrote in his resignation letter to Mr Rudd .
I accepted that resignation , it was the right thing to do
Mr Fitzgibbon said he had made it clear to all parties that he not be involved in the talks , but it now emerged there was a link and to protect the integrity of the Government he had decided to resign .
" Despite my decision to avoid being part of any discussions between the parties , I am not absolutely satisfied that the objective was achieved to the extent necessary to ensure full compliance with your ministerial code of conduct , " the letter says .
Mr Rudd said Mr Fitzgibbon offered his resignation at a meeting in his office after he earlier met Mr Rudd 's chief of staff Alister Jordan and the Special Minister of State , John Faulkner .
Mr Rudd praised Mr Fitzgibbon for working hard and with great diligence to produce the Defence White Paper last month and to withdraw Australian troops from Iraq , but he said there had also been mistakes in relation to matters of accountability .
Mr Rudd said Mr Fitzgibbon had made " mistakes in terms of accountability and paid a high price " .
He said Mr Fitzgibbon had accepted responsibility for the mistakes , and " there have been a number of them " .
Mr Rudd said Mr Fitzgibbon 's latest position on the talks was a " significant departure " from undertakings he had given in March .
Mr Rudd emphasised that there was no contractual agreement between NIB , Humana or the Australian Government .
He said Mr Fitzgibbon 's resignation goes to the " probability of the process engaged in " .
Mr Rudd said Mr Fitzgibbon had engaged in important Defence strategic reform , and he " feels sad about this " , but it was important to maintain high standards of accountability .
Mr Rudd confirmed his confidence in the Defence Department and the Defence Force .
This week , Mr Fitzgibbon was put on notice by Mr Rudd after again having to admit that he forgot to disclose a gift on the register of interests .
But the allegations that initially prompted interest in Mr Fitzgibbon 's register were yesterday dismissed by the intelligence watchdog , which found no evidence that Defence officials secretly spied on their minister or investigated his relationship with a Chinese businesswoman , Helen Liu .
The inquiry , by the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security , Ian Carnell , concluded the allegations could have been
leaked by someone outside Defence .
Mr Fitzgibbon would not say yesterday whether he suspected present or former ministerial staff .
After the allegations were reported in the in March , Mr Fitzgibbon said he had failed to declare gifts - two trips to China and a suit - paid for by Ms Liu .
Liberal Party sources claimed yesterday there were more cases of Mr Fitzgibbon failing to disclose gifts and they would continue to pursue him .
Late on Tuesday night Mr Fitzgibbon told Parliament he had failed to disclose a night in a hotel room , worth $ 450 .
It was provided by NIB as part of attending the State of Origin rugby league match in Brisbane on June 11 last year .
Mr Fitzgibbon 's staff found the undeclared hotel room while trawling through records after the Opposition asked a question in Parliament on Monday .
Mr Fitzgibbon returned to Canberra from Singapore on Tuesday and was called straight to the Prime Minister 's office .
It is understood Mr Rudd had given him a dressing down before telling him to admit the failed declaration in Parliament .
Loading
Mr Carnell 's inquiry backed the findings of an internal Defence inquiry , made public last week , and found no evidence that the Defence Signals Directorate - or any Defence official - secretly accessed Mr Fitzgibbon 's office computer to investigate alleged concerns that Ms Liu was a security risk .
" I found no evidence or indication which might raise suspicion that the allegations concerning DSD personnel are correct , " Mr Carnell said .
Bionic Commando has many , many loyal fans , so a remake of the classic arcade and NES title was a good business decision .
The final product that hopes to bring the characters and concepts into the modern day may leave even the faithful out in the cold , however .
The main hook the game offers — swinging across large environments with the character 's bionic , zip - line of an arm — is done well ... mostly .
Everything else drags the game into mediocrity .
Title Bionic Commando Developer Grin Publisher Capcom Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform Xbox 360 ( reviewed ) , PlayStation 3 , PC on July 28
While the graphics may be impressive ( although the framerate could use some work ) , you 'll never be able to explore all those demolished cityscapes or lush forests you see in the distance .
Why ?
The city was destroyed by nuclear bombs , and you were released from prison to investigate .
You were locked up unfairly , which gives your character an excuse to be filled with angst and speak in a grating , always - angry - and - gruff tone .
Since the city was irradiated , if you try to go off the game 's surprisingly limited linear path , you 'll die of radiation poisoning .
All those pretty things in the distance ?
Ignore them , this is a game that forces you to stick to one restrictive path .
Every now and again you 'll be forced into smaller , interior environments where you 'll be using an ever - present handgun that feels underpowered and rather lame .
You sometimes find other weapons as they 're delivered via pods that fall from the sky near your position , but ammo is short .
In almost every situation , you 're better off using the offensive capabilities of your bionic arm , which can be fun , although fighting wave after wave of lifeless enemies gets old very quickly .
There are some larger baddies to contend with , but if you 've played a game or two since the original , you 'll know what to do .
Maybe take a look at that glowing thing on their backs ?
The list of annoyances goes on .
Long loading times are the rule , and since you 'll all too often find yourself running into radiation when you thought you were on the right path , you 'll be loading more than you 'd like .
Water is also a killer , since your heavy arm causes you to drown unless you can grab onto something in a second or two .
Even as you 're moving from area to area , you 'll be running into frequent and long load times .
Playing cautiously is a good idea , as checkpoints are too far apart .
This leads to some soul - sucking instances of having to do the same section over , and over , and over .
Do n't worry about the story : there are no major surprises that are n't predictable , and the voice acting borders on the satirical .
Are we being too hard on Bionic Commando ?
Maybe .
But it always feels like the game just barely misses being something better , and there is more here to be annoyed at than excited by .
When something like inFamous is able to take place in a huge , open city with no load times and a linear , tiny game like Bionic Commando forces you to the sidelines with so much loading , there is something wrong .
It simply kills the pace of the game .
The last straw is how short the game is .
I was shocked when I put in a leisurely stroll through the title 's first few areas , and saw that I was more than 10 percent done with the game .
I actually spoke to another reviewer from another site to verify this , and he said that he believed the counter may be broken .
Nope , after playing more , it 's just that short .
If you take the time to do some collecting , you might get six hours out of this .
The multiplayer may add a few hours of enjoyment , but it does n't add nearly enough to bring up the score or make up for the sins of the single - player campaign .
Once again , the weak weapons hurt the experience .
If you 're a huge fan of the original , you may want to rent this and run through it , but that 's the lightest of recommendations .
For everyone else , this is a solid ...?
Verdict : Skip

Whale watching turns a profit , while hunting may incur a loss
Whale watching generates far more money than whale hunting , according to a report released at the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting here .
Worldwide , the industry now generates about $ 2.1 bn per year , it says .
The group commissioning the report , the International Fund for Animal Welfare ( Ifaw ) , says whaling countries would gain from a switch to whale watching .
However , Iceland 's delegate here said the two industries were compatible and could grow together .
Iceland recently announced a major expansion of its fin whale hunt and plans to take 150 of the animals this year , along with up to 100 minke whales .
" As governments sit here [ at the IWC ] debating what to do about whaling , their people are showing the way , " said Patrick Ramage , director of Ifaw 's whale programme .
" Whale watching is clearly more environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial than hunting , and whales are worth far more alive than dead , " he told BBC News .
The report follows on the heels of an analysis commissioned by another organisation opposed to whaling , WWF , which suggested that the Japanese and Norwegian hunts were a net cost to their governments .
Double digit The Ifaw - commissioned report , compiled by the Australian organisation Economists at Large , found that income from whale watching had doubled over the last decade , with the fastest growth seen in Asia .
Iceland argues commercial whaling can co-exist with whale watching
Guide to great whales
In 2008 , it concluded , 13 million people went to sea to watch cetaceans in 119 countries .
As an anti-whaling organisation , Ifaw has repeatedly campaigned to persuade Iceland to end its hunts - a practice which , Ifaw contends , is hurting its whale - watching industry .
The potential for conflict between the two industries was starkly demonstrated in 2006 , when tourists on a Norwegian boat saw a minke whale harpooned .
But Iceland 's commissioner to the IWC , Tomas Heidar , said that in his country the two industries had co-existed successfully for a number of years .
" Allegations that whaling affects whale watching have proven not to be true , " he said .
" On the contrary , whale watching has been growing steadily in the last few years after our resumption of commercial whaling [ in 2006 ] . "
Economists at Large gathered the data for its report through surveying whale - watching companies , tourist boards , researchers and NGOs .

Apple is privately acknowledging an issue with the enclosure on some of its white 13 - inch MacBooks , which in some cases have seen the formation of hairline cracks during normal usage patterns .
The Cupertino - based Mac maker is said to have issued a bulletin to its authorized service providers in March that essentially reverses its stance on replacing the bottom casing of notebooks that may be experiencing these symptoms .
It was reported in November that Apple was refusing to cover repairs for the bottom casing of the notebooks despite its willingness on occasion to address identical problems with the top portion of the casings containing the keyboard and palmrests .
The bulletin to providers reportedly identified four key areas of the case prone to hairline cracking , including the front portion of the case below the palmrests and trackpad , the areas around the I/O ports , the back rear corners , and the back rear ventilation area .
Apple added , however , that other portions of the case could be affected by the cracking issue .
For all instances , providers were reportedly asked to inspect the MacBook carefully to determine whether the cracks could be the result of the notebook haven been dropped or other accidental damage caused by the owner .
In the event that providers are unable to identify signs that the user is at fault for the cracks , they 're advise to escalate the notebook for coverage by Apple , regardless of whether its 1 - year limited warranty has expired .
A collage of cracked white 13 - inch MacBook enclosures .
The exception also applies to the black plastic 13 - inch MacBook that was discontinued last year , but does not extend to any other member of the MacBook family , according to those familiar with the matter .
The numbers that come in from the government are staggering , with a projected federal budget deficit of nearly two trillion dollars .
As one recent news account put it :
With the economy performing worse than hoped , revised White House figures point to deepening budget deficits , with the government borrowing almost 50 cents for every dollar it spends this year .
The deficit for the current budget year will rise by $ 89 billion to above $ 1.8 trillion — about four times the record set just last year .
The unprecedented red ink flows from the deep recession , the Wall Street bailout , the cost of President Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus bill , as well as a structural imbalance between what the government spends and what it takes in .
This no longer is a “ problem . ”
It has become a calamity , and there are no political forces in Washington willing or able to stop what seems to be a runaway train .
Furthermore , the political arrogance that is the nation ’s capital prevents people from understanding the obvious : we are witnessing an episode of ruinous government spending that is going to have severe ramifications for years to come .
After the latest numbers came out , White House Budget Director Peter Orszag declared that the deficits are being driven by the recession , which this government inherited , so the numbers are not the fault of the current set of policymakers at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
I am no defender of George W. Bush and his spendthrift government , but even a Bush critic like me can see that the incoming Obama government decided the speeding train was not going fast enough , so they opened the throttle wide open and tied it down .
Some perspective is needed here .
In nominal terms , the deficits are far and away greater than anything we have seen .
According to the Statistical Abstracts of the United States , if one adds up all of the budget deficits of the Bush administration , they about equal the deficits for this fiscal year alone .
Now keep in mind that many of us believed that the Bush deficits were ruinous , with its profligate spending and monetary “ creation ” through the Federal Reserve System – and the boom and bust pattern of the economy proved our point .
However , it is as though the Bush policymakers were skinflints compared to what we are seeing now .
Furthermore , there are economists who claim that the present government is not spending enough .
Recent Nobel Prize - winner Paul Krugman claims that the unprecedented surge in federal spending is only a “ half - measure ” that wo n’t revive the economy .
The solution ?
Even more spending !
My first reaction is simple : Spend with what ?
Borrowers need lenders , and that means that someone out there has to believe that a U.S. bond is a good investment .
Much of the U.S. deficit has been funded by Asian governments such as China and Japan which accepted dollars for goods and then rolled those dollars into U.S. government debt .
However , that gravy train is slowing down rapidly , as the seller is running out of suckers .
There is one buyer , however , that seems ready and willing to buy what Uncle Sam throws its way : the Fed .
As the recent statements by the Fed have demonstrated , the central bank is increasing its purchases of both government and private securities at an increasing rate , revving up its printing press in the process .
This cannot lead to recovery ; when the government throws out this much paper , there is no way we will not see a “ crowding out , ” which strips the very funds needed for business investment .
Rather , it will lead to inflation and lots of it .
Never mind that the Obama administration has announced that this economy will enjoy a 3.5 percent increase in output by the year ’s end ; the only things that are going up are the inflation and unemployment rates .
One does not have to wish this administration to fail in its economic policies .
This government is doing that without any help from the opposition .
The fall in housing prices -- like falling prices anywhere , really -- has the effect of perpetuating itself , by scaring would - be buyers .
Nobody wants to catch a falling knife , particularly if they have to borrow a lot of money to do it .
So you 'd think that the correct strategy would be to site on the sidelines , wait , watch for home stabilization , and then buy .
And since nobody thinks the market will just shoot back up in a straight line , there 's really not much reason to worry about waiting .
Patience is advised .
But even stabilization may be misleading .
The Field Check Group has a good post looking at the San Diego housing market and warning about a " false bottom " in prices .
The basic issue is something we discussed yesterday , between the foreclosure moratorium , the ongoing growth in new foreclosures , and all the bank - owned homes that are currently on the market , there 's a fresh supply of homes a - comin ' .
And the indication is that buyers are n't ready for it .
It 's a very long , chart - filled piece , but here 's a taste :
But before you get too excited about the prospects of San Diego real estate and put in an order for a pool of REO ’s to flip or notes to work out , a wave of foreclosures is coming .
In the past three months alone , Notice - of - Trustee Sales are back at near peak levels of 2500 per month .
An NTS is the second stage of foreclosure that comes 14 - 60 days prior to the property being taken to the courthouse and sold .
With most loss mit and mortgage mod plans known to servicers now , there is little reason to file an NTS unless in fact the property has a good change of going to foreclosure .
With San Diego sales at about 3 k per month , 2500 NTS per month could cause a serious supply / demand imbalance that must be absorbed for this market to become and remain healthy .
This will be especially difficult considering that the peak sales season ends in August and Notice - of - Defaults ( two charts down ) that feed NTS , have also surged recently .
Judging by the flow , recent NODs will feed foreclosures perhaps through the end of the year — that is as far out as we can see .
This NTS surge is especially troubling considering that foreclosure related supply only presently makes up approx 15 % to 20 % of total housing supply and Ma and Pay Organic homeowner make up the rest .
With 3000 monthly sales and supply coming at a rate of 75 % of total sales , that does not leave a lot of demand for organic sellers .
First timers and investor can’t carry this entire market on their own .
Organic sellers must be able to sell and re-buy in order to keep demand stable and strong .
Notice - of - Defaults – the first stage of foreclosure that occurs after a borrower misses 3 - 4 payments — have surged in the past five months .
The dip down in 2008 was solely due to a CA moratorium law — SB1137 — that had the effect of kicking the can down the road .
There have been more new Notice - of - Defaults each month for the past five months than properties sold .
NOD ’s turn into foreclosures within 5 - 8 months — this is not a great sign .
The new mortgage mod initiatives had better work well .

( CNN ) -- For Sherrie Muldoon , the credit card debt was $ 46,244 .
But the relief she felt after paying it off was priceless .
So much so that the Colorado resident and her husband threw a party Saturday for friends and family after mailing off the final check .
The event at a community center featured a cake decorated with the debt amount in green icing , CNN television affiliate KUSA reported .
The couple had been paying the debt for three years and seven months , Muldoon told CNN , adding that the last payment they made recently was for $ 1,500 .
" When we mailed that last check ... I sat down in the car , I looked over to my husband and I just burst out into tears , " she said .
iReport.com : Have you paid off a huge debt lately ?
The typical American household with at least one credit card has nearly $ 10,700 in credit card debt , according to CardWeb.com .
The average interest rate runs in the mid- to high teens , according to the Web site .
Muldoon said the soaring costs of their nine credit cards left them with two options :
Either file for bankruptcy or make a drastic lifestyle change .
They opted for the latter , she told KUSA .
" We changed everything ... to bare - bones minimum , " Muldoon told CNN .
" Basically , if it was n't essential to support life , we did n't do it . "
The Muldoons are part of a national trend in easing off credit card use .
Total consumer borrowing fell 3.5 percent in February , from the month before , according to the Federal Reserve .
A government report shows the tumble in consumer credit was caused by a sharp decline in credit card use .
The ailing economy and controlled spending caused by unemployment have contributed .
Muldoon said she found a way to make money by doing extra jobs , including teaching fitness classes at night and cleaning office buildings on the weekends .
Watch Muldoon describe how she whittled away at debt »
" Dan says I 'm obsessed .
I prefer the term ' focus - driven , ' " Muldoon told KUSA .
" There were times last winter when dinner was white rice and gravy .
That was what there was .
We were n't starving to death , but I can't tell you the last time I had a steak . "
Muldoon said the quest to save money extended to the party , which she hosted using items that were either on sale or had been purchased with coupons .
No steak was served there , either :
She used ham from " a couple of pigs " she raised last year .
Despite the merriment , she had one regret :
She had paid full price for the black balloons that adorned the party room .
" I had some anguish over that , " she said .
" But I moved past it fairly quickly . "

Fast builds are critical to the C++ programmer 's productivity and happiness .
One common technique for reducing build times is precompiled headers ( PCH ) .
There 's plenty of literature out there ; I wo n't describe PCH in detail here .
But one thing that 's always bothered me about PCH is that it affects your code .
# pragma hdrstop and #include " StdAfx.h " everywhere .
Gross .
I 'm a strong believer in clean code without boilerplate , so can't we do better ?
Ideally we could make a simple tweak to the build system and see build times magically improve .
Enno enticed me with mentions of his fast builds , so I took a look ...
Using PCH in Visual C++ requires a header ( call it Precompiled.h ) that includes all of the expensive dependencies :
#include < vector > # include < map > # include < iostream > # include < fstream > # include < boost / python.hpp > # include < windows.h> # include < mmsystem .h >
Additionally , we need a source file ( let 's get creative and call it Precompiled.cpp ) , which is empty except for #include " Precompiled.h " .
Compile Precompiled.cpp with / Yc Precompiled.h to generate Precompiled.pch , the actual precompiled header .
Then , use the precompiled header on the rest of your files with / Yu Precompiled.h .
OK , here 's the step that prevented me from using PCH for so long : every single source file in your project must #include " Precompiled.h " on its first line .
That 's ridiculous !
I do n't want to touch every file !
It turns out our savior is the / FI option .
From the documentation :
This option has the same effect as specifying the file with double quotation marks in an #include directive on the first line of every source file specified on the command line [...]
Exactly what we want !
But wait , does n't that mean every .cpp in our project will have access to every symbol included by the PCH ?
Yes . :(
It 's worth the build speedup .
However , explicit physical dependencies are important , and the only way to prevent important things from breaking is by blocking commits if they fail .
Since enabling and disabling PCH does not require any code changes , it 's easy enough to add a " disable PCH " option to your build system and run it on your continuous integration server :
If somebody uses std :: string but forgets to # include < string > , the build will fail and block commits .
In the end , here 's the bit of SCons magic that lets me quickly drop PCH into a project :
def enable_pch ( env , source_file , header ) : if PCH_ENABLED : PCH , PCH_OBJ = env.PCH( source_file ) env [ ' PCH '] = PCH env [ ' PCHSTOP '] = header env.
Append( CPPFLAGS=['/ FI ' + header ] ) return [ PCH_OBJ ] else : return [ source_file ]
Now you can benefit from fast builds with minimal effort and no change to your existing code !
The summer minimum and the winter maximum are the two pivotal milestones in the annual cycle of Arctic sea ice , and are key indicators of Arctic climate .
Over the past two - and - a - half decades , the extent of sea ice at the end of summer ( mid- September ) has declined significantly .
The winter maximum ( end of February or mid-March ) ice covering is much younger and thinner than it was in the past .
This pair of maps shows the median age of February sea ice from 1981 - 2009 ( left ) compared to February 2009 ( right ) .
Ice more than two years old is dark blue , ice that is one to two years old is medium blue , and ice that is less than one year old is light blue .
Compared to the median conditions at the end of winter , the ice pack of February 2009 contains much less old ice ( dark blue )

A federal appeals court last week ruled against Yahoo ( s yhoo ) in a dispute over the level of protection Internet businesses have when dealing with offensive material on web sites they control .
Yahoo said it has immunity from lawsuits over content posted by third - party users .
The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals , however , disagreed ( PDF ) .
The ruling does n’t mean Yahoo is going to lose its entire case .
Nor does it mean there ’s been a change to the Communications Decency
Act , the law that ’s meant to strike a balance between promoting the exchange of ideas and encouraging companies to watch out for offensive material on the web .
But as the case develops , there could be major implications for Yahoo and other businesses that operate on the web , for the ruling suggests that courts can exercise more oversight than ever before in the way Internet businesses monitor their web sites for inappropriate content .
You might think that would bring about more stringent regulations .
Perversely , it could have the opposite effect .
The case started out in Oregon when a woman named Cecilia Barnes found out that her ex-boyfriend posted nude photos on a Yahoo profile , along with her phone number at work , her email address and her mailing address .
The ex-boyfriend also posed as Barnes in Yahoo chat rooms and made it look like she was soliciting sex .
Barnes followed Yahoo ’s policy for getting content taken down from its site , and according to the court ruling , waited several months before finally filing a lawsuit against the company for failing to do so .
The court ruled against Barnes on a claim for negligence , but said Yahoo ’s monitoring policy and a promise made to her by one of the company ’s spokeswomen show its intention to be held to an agreement .
By neglecting to take down the profiles created by Barnes ’ ex-boyfriend , Yahoo might have violated that agreement .
Kim Rubey , a Yahoo spokeswoman , would n’t comment on the facts of the case , but said in a written statement :
“ We are pleased the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court ’s dismissal of the negligent undertaking claim .
We are evaluating the opinion on the remaining claim and look forward to swift resolution in the district court . ”
The court ’s ruling hints that there might be an easy way out of this mess .
If a web - based company disclaims any intention to be bound by a monitoring policy and it never promises to take down offensive material from the web , then it can never be bound by such an agreement .
Jeffrey Neuburger , a lawyer at Proskauer Rose who blogs about new media law , said he had been advising clients to issue disclaimers about monitoring offensive material since before the Yahoo case came along .
That ’s a general rule that could help a lot of companies stay out of trouble in the first place .
But for Yahoo , Neuburger said issuing a disclaimer now might not be enough to prove it did n’t mean to create a legal agreement with Cecilia Barnes .
“ A court is going to have to make that decision , ” he said .
Marc Ona Essangui is a beloved environmental leader in his native Gabon , however by winning the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize he is now being introduced to a larger audience : the world .
Essangui received the prize for exposing unsavory truths about a deal between the Gabon government and a Chinese company , CMEC , to mine for iron ore in the Congo rainforest , the world ’s second largest tropical forest .
The Belinga mine is a $ 3.5 billion project that also includes a hydroelectric dam , which will flood traditional lands and destroy what is considered the most beautiful waterfall in the forests of equatorial Africa .
The Kongou Falls is located in the Ivindo National Park .
In 2002 President of Gabon , Omar Bongo , was widely hailed for establishing National Parks across Gabon that incorporated 10 percent of the nation ’s land .
However , subsequent deals , including the Belinga mine , have troubled many for putting these vast parks and their rich biodiversity in jeopardy .

“ Industrialization of Africa without ecological conscience will bring ruin to the African continent , ” Essangui , who is in a wheelchair due to childhood polio , says in a video produced for the Goldman award .
“ Today Africa is still spared catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina or tsunamis because we still have the vegetation that protects us from these phenomena .
If we accelerate climate change by destroying African forests , which is the second biggest forest in the world , we are headed to catastrophe . ”
For years Essangui , President and founder of the local environmental organization Brainforest , called for a full environmental impact assessment of the dam , while advocating for a different site located outside the Ivindo National Park .
In addition , his organization argued that the Belinga concession was far too large , measuring 7,700 square kilometers .
Essangui and his organization worked tirelessly to inform local communities , who knew little of the project , about their rights .
In 2007 Essangui obtained a leaked copy of the agreement between the Gabon government and the CMEC .
The agreement , which had been kept secret from the Gabonese public , showed that Gabon was getting the short end of the stick , receiving only 10 percent of profits from the mine while CMEC was granted a 25 - year tax break .

Due to public outrage and non-stop work , Essangui and his organization have achieved considerable success related to the mine .
The dam concession has been cut by nearly 90 percent .
A road that the Chinese had already built through Ivindo Park has been relocated .
Gabon , as well , has renegotiated the contract with the Chinese with help from the World Bank for a more equal deal , including getting rid of the tax break for CMEC .
Currently , the status of the project is up in the air
“ Without our intervention the Chinese would be already exploiting the mine and ignoring Gabonese law , ” Essangui says in the Goldman Environmental Prize video .
“ Now they are trying to figure out if there is a real necessity to exploit the iron mine .
I am very hopeful because the retreat of the government in this case shows that when you have the law on your side you are stronger .
This is why we think we are going to win . ”
Essangui has pursued his mission at considerable personal risk .
Just over a year ago in March 2008 , Brainforest was broken into and information related to the Belinga mine project was stolen .
Three times during 2008 , the federal police of Gabon refused to allow Essangui to travel outside the country .
No reasons were given .
Then in December of last year , Essangui along with other civil leaders were arrested and held for five days .
They were not charged initially nor were they allowed access to any legal representation .
After release Essangui was charged with possessing documents that were meant to foment rebellion against the state .
Essangui denies the charge .
Despite his release , the charges have yet to be dropped .
“ No matter how I was treated in prison , my resolve is unweakened , ” Essangui says .
“ I think even if I had spent 10 years in there it is worthwhile to save what has to be saved . ”
Essangui and his kids .
Essangui and his family have recently been evicted from their home , since their landlord felt Essangui ’s activism put the property at risk .

As apart of the prize , Essangui will be awarded $ 150,000 .
Essangui said that the money will go toward helping local forest communities .
“ I was n’t born to be rich .
I could n’t care less about being rich , ” he told Reuters .
“ You ca n’t imagine the reality of people living around Gabon ’s national parks .
We need to put money into helping these communities regain their dignity . ”
Essangui and the other winners will be honored tomorrow , Monday , April 20th , in San Francisco .
Award winners will also be visiting Washington DC for another ceremony in their honor .
During their tour they will meet with policy makers , environmental organizations , and the press .

“ Carrying this fight brings meaning to my life , ” Essangui concludes in the video , “ it is not a personal fight or a Gabonese one , but it is a global battle .
This is about the future of our children … I am ready to do what I have to do . ”
The Goldman Environmental Award is given annually to six recipients from around the world for grassroots environmental activism .
Other award winners this year include Rizwanna Hasan from Bangladesh , an environmental lawyer who has worked to expose the environmental consequences of the ship - breaking industry ; Olga Speranskaya from Russia who has spearheaded efforts to clean - up toxic chemicals from the Soviet era across Eastern Europe ; Yuyun Ismawati from Indonesia who has implemented community - based initiatives across the island - nation for local environmental sustainability ; Maria Gunnoe from the United State who has spent years fighting against mountain - top removal for coal ; and Wanze Edwards and Hugo Jabini of Suriname who have organized local Maroon communities to stand up against logging on their traditional lands .

Iranian Govt Tried to ' Cut the Head Off ' Opposition Iran opposition " disappointed " in the lack of leadership .
DUBAI , United Arab Emirates , June 21 , 2009  --
The crackdown on protestors promised Saturday by the Iranian government appears to have worked , with few people on the streets of Tehran today , though there was violence overnight .
But as rallies failed to materialize , a female protestor reached by ABC News by telephone in Tehran complained about the lack of leadership .
Asked whether she is disappointed that the streets were so quiet , the female protestor , who did not give her name , said " yes . "
" Of course it is !
It 's really sad .
People getting killed , people doing everything in their power to go against the regime after 30 years and we do n't have the support here .
We do n't have proper leadership , " she said .
The government 's official statement is that the protests , sparked by the disputed presidential election of June 12 , are being carried out by terrorists with links to foreign powers .
Speaking today , President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad demanded the United States and Britain stop interfering in Iran , adding that the election proved most Iranians love the regime .
That claim is proving more and more far - fetched on the ground .
Today , the government continued mass arrests , including journalists , expelling BBC correspondent John Leyne from the country .
American Michelle May , who was in Iran on vacation , was unwittingly caught up in the violence .
She said she was abducted by paramilitary basij fighters , the most aggressive in battling the protesters , and said she was accused of being a spy .
" I thought , maybe I 'll make a scene and they 'll go away , " May said .
" But they did n't .
They put me into their car . "
" I could n't believe what was happening to me , " she said .
Before releasing her , police forced her to sign a confession .
Even though the streets were quiet , the political battle persists at the highest levels of the Iranian government .
Today , the daughter of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani , Mousavi 's chief political backer , was arrested .
And Ali Larijani , the powerful parliament speaker , directly challenged the ruling Guardian Council for ignoring the protesters ' complaints .
Faezeh , Rafsanjani 's daughter , had joined protest crowds on Saturday , a day after Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated that such demonstrations would be considered criminal .
" Ayatollah Khamenei is not tolerating anybody who criticizes his policy .
The main thing that is common among those arrested is that they have criticized the Ayatollha Khamenei over the past 20 years -- his foreign policy , his domestic policy , his cultural policy , " said Mehdi Khalaji , a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
" The government wants to cut the head of this movement from its body by cutting off all sources of information , " Khalaji said .
Stateside , Iranian Americans marched today in support of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi 's movement , from Los Angeles and New York to the president 's front door .
In Washington , D.C. , the president was monitoring the situation closely .
An administration source said President Obama has received intelligence updates throughout the day .
Analysts say that the Iranian elections have posed a delicate diplomatic balancing act for this administration .
If the clashes continue between the Iranian regime and the protestors , Obama could be forced to take an even stronger stance , they say .
As part of a broad crackdown on the media and perceived dissidents , the Iranian government has arrested 23 journalists and bloggers since the disputed presidential election on June 12 .
A spokesman for Mousavi said today more than 700 supporters and organizers have also been detained over the past week , among them former Vice President Mohammed Ali Abtahi and Ebrahim Yazdi , a former foreign minister and architect of the Islamic Recpublic .
The official death toll in the often violent clashes between police and demostrators is 17 , but many observers have suggested that the true count is much higher .
Iranian state television today announced the arrest of Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani and four other family members of a powerful former president , Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Also today , Newsweek Magazine announced the arrest of staff reporter Maziar Bahari , a Canadian national who has lived in Iran and reported on the country for the past decade .
Newsweek issued a statement saying Bahari was held without charge .
" Newsweek asks that world governments use whatever influence they have with the governemnt in Tehran to make clear that this detention is unwarranted and unacceptable , and to demand Mr. Bahari 's release , " the statement said .
Ali Mazroui , head of the Association of Iranian Journalists , was also arrested this morning .
Also among the detainees is journalist and women 's rights advocate Jila Baniyaghoob .
According to the non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders , she and her husband , journalist Bahaman Ahamadi Amoee , were arrested by plainclothes intelligence forces at midnight on June 20 .
Baniyaghoob is a winner of the Courage in Journalism award of the International Women 's Media Foundation .
She has spent a large portion of career advocating for women 's rights in Iran and throughout the Middle East .
Before her detention , she was editor - in - chief of the online newspaper Kanoon Zanon Irani , literally " Focus on Iranian Women . "
Throughout the unrest set off by the disputed election , Iran has restricted foreign journalists from covering opposition protests on the ground .
ABC
News cameras were seized last week .
The Tehran offices of Al Arabiya , a Saudi - owned network based in Dubai , were suspended until further notice .
In 2008 , Iran was ranked number 166 out of 173 countries in press freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders .
The organization described journalism in Iran as " a high risk exercise involving endless frustration and constant police and judicial harassment . "
Confrontations were reported in the Iranian cities of Tehran , Shiraz , Esfahan and Rasht , as riot police and members of a religious militia known as the Basij cracked down on protests declared illegal by the state .
They were chronicled by street - level observers and echoed around a world watching online .
Early Sunday , supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , whose alleged presidential election defeat a week ago touched off the protests , told ABC News they were planning new protests and hoping to shut down Tehran 's main market , known as the bazaar .
State television has referred to the protesters as " terrorists , " and allowed little information about the rallies to reach domestic viewers .
" It feels like a bad movie , as though everyone is pretending that yesterday did not happen , " said one person in Tehran in an e-mail to ABC News .
Given foreign media restrictions in Iran , it remained difficult to confirm details of the weekend 's violence .
The BBC estimated tens of thousands of protesters were in the streets on Saturday .
As one crowd made its way toward Tehran 's Revolution Square , reports said , it found the square closed off by security forces , including Revolutionary Guard forces and plainclothes members of the Basij militia .
Those forces , bystanders said , assaulted protesters and chased them through the streets .
" This is a very unfair fight .
They are using chains , hoses , clubs , they are carrying shotguns ... and they are brutal , " one eyewitness in Tehran told ABC News in the midst of the clashes .
An amateur video posted to YouTube apparently showed the shooting death of one protester ; sources said she was shot in Amir Abad , a neighborhood in Tehran .
Witnesses speaking with ABC News by e-mail described the clashes as a " street war . "
" War is going on , " one witness said , another describing " tear gas and burning trash cans everywhere . "
" I feel like I 'm in a police state for the first time .
...
As of late afternoon , Basij are everywhere , " said another protester , as the force was seen violently breaking up protests .
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said forces pursued the wounded and arrested them in Tehran hospitals .
Justin McMahan , an American traveling through Iran with his wife when the protests began last week , was staying at a hotel near Engelab Square and saw the violence .
" We saw people getting indiscriminately clubbed by the Basij , beaten with batons , though they were n't wearing any green , " he told ABC News .
" There was unbelievable tension in the city , it was a place in turmoil .
You could feel the society is deeply divided . "
" There was talk of around 3,000 people were in Engelab Sq. , said McMahan 's wife Andrea .
" We saw hundreds of military and Basijis in plainclothes .
" There were women screaming , gunshots fired , " she added .
" Police were brutally beating people , it was totally chaos .
And it was hard to get any info .
State TV stations were playing sports games . "
By night protests had taken on a different form , channeled into what have become nightly neighborhood chants on city rooftops .
" The shouts of Allaho Akbar in holy city of Mashhad are ' explosive , ' " said one source , " loudest it has ever been . "
Others describe the chanting and shaking as " surreal . "
The rooftop " Allaho Akbars , " meaning " God is great , " were widely as a means of protest during the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
Sources said the practice has again become popular , given its relative safety -- largely out of reach of riot police in the streets .
The protesters directly defied Iran 's highest authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who in a Friday prayer speech called on them to stop demonstrating and accept President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad 's reelection .
One week earlier , Ahmedinejad was declared the winner in a presidential ballot that gave him a commanding , some said implausible landslide win .
Khamenei 's speech warned that opposition leaders would be responsible for the consequences of any demonstrations , which some analysts saw as a veiled threat of violence .
The most prominent figure pushing back on Khamenei has been Mousavi , a pro-reform centrist and former prime minister who ran for president and claimed he beat Ahmedinejad .
Mousavi has become the figurehead of the opposition movement , rallying a broad mass of supporters and showing up at Saturday 's protests despite heavy restrictions on his movement .
Mousavi attended Saturday 's chaotic rally in Tehran , vowing to challenge the official election results , instructing supporters to go on strike if he was arrested and expressing his willingness to die for his cause .
" I am prepared for martyrdom , " Mousavi said on his Twitter and Facebook pages .
President Barack Obama spoke out on the events , telling the Iranian government " the world is watching . "
" We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost , " Obama said in a written statement .
" We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people . "
The election and its aftermath have complicated Obama 's efforts at new diplomacy between the United States and Iran , which would break 30 years of strained ties and antagonism .
Supporters of Mir-Hossein Mousavi have called on the United States and other countries not to recognize Ahmedinejad 's election win .
Obama has said outreach efforts would continue , though it would be difficult to do so without at least tacitly acknowledging Ahmedinejad 's second term .

The bank paid $ 38.3 million to Mr. Palm for about a quarter of his investments .
Soon after the bank aided the two executives , Warren E. Buffett invested $ 5 billion in Goldman , and the bank ’s top four executives agreed not to sell more than 10 percent of their stock for three years .
Mr. Palm was not one of the four barred from selling stock , but Mr. Winkelried was , and that agreement remains in place even though he has retired .
The proxy also says that one bank executive , who is not identified , has pledged 500,000 shares of Goldman stock in exchange for loans from the bank .
The executives are not the only Goldman employees who have faced a liquidity squeeze .
Goldman also offered loans earlier this month to more than 1,000 employees who invested in its internal investment funds .
About 10 percent of those employees have indicated interest in the loans , according to a person briefed on the matter .
The employees will use the loans to meet their contractual obligations to put more money into the bank ’s internal investment funds .
Few banks were as high - flying as Goldman when Wall Street was riding high .
In 2006 , the bank paid more than 50 people more than $ 20 million each .
But longtime partners at the firm , like Mr. Palm and Mr. Winkelried , have been particularly stung by the slide in its stock , and Goldman has been among the banks that have made margin calls on their own workers .

She has no clue , and does n’t even seem to know about the off - balance sheet stuff – and she is the top cop at the Fed !
I ’m leaving this post unprotected so you can send the link above to anyone .
Every American voter should see this .
Many cookbooks suggest the following for boiling eggs : 3 - 6 min for a soft yolk , 6 - 8 min for a medium soft yolk and 8 - 10 min for a hard yolk .
If you are satisfied with this , there is no need for you to continue reading .
But if you ’ve ever wondered whether the size of an egg has any impact on the cooking time you should read on .
And if you search the ultimate soft boiled egg we share a common goal !
From a scientific view point , a cooking time of approximately 3 - 8 minutes to obtain a soft yolk is not very precise .
A number of important parameters remain unanswered :
What size are the eggs ?
Are they taken from the fridge or are they room tempered ?
Are they put into cold or boiling water ?
And if using cold water – when should the timer be started ?
When the heat is turned on or when the water boils ?
And would the size of the pan , the amount of water and the power of the stove top matter ?
A formula for boiling eggs ?
I still remember the very first time I heard about a formula to calculate the cooking time for eggs .
I was in high school and as a recipe for the ultimate nerd the egg formula gave me a good laugh .
Now – many years later – I count myself to this group of nerds 🙂
And thanks to the internet , google and Peter Barham ’s book “ The Science of Cooking ” – I have been able to find out much more .
I have n’t been able to track down the formula I heard mentioned , but the best documented formula nowadays is derived by Dr. Charles D. H. Williams , a lecturer in physics at University of Exeter .
He has set up a nice page on the science of boiling eggs and there ’s even a pdf with the full derivation of the formula .
Given the starting temperature of the egg T egg , the temperature of the water T water and the desired temperature T yolk ( all in °C ) at the yolk - white boundary , the cooking time t ( in minutes ) of an egg with mass M ( in grams ) is given by :
Whenever possible one should use weight measurements in the kitchen , but some times an accurate balance is not available and in those cases we can turn to the Peter Barham ’s formula which is published in “ The science of cooking ” .
The circumference of an egg is easily measured around the thick end using a piece of string and a ruler .
I used to have a piece of string with three knots at 13 , 14 and 15 cm respectively to make it even simpler .
The cooking time t ( in minutes ) for an egg with a circumference c ( in centimeters ) is given by :
Former colleagues of mine at the University of Oslo have made a nice flash animation to do calculations with Barham ’s formula if you ’re not too keen to dig out your calculator .
Barham states that his formula gives the time for the centre of the yolk to reach the temperature T yolk whereas Williams mention in the derivation of the formula that it calculates the time for the yolk - white boundary to reach T yolk .
I ’m not able to tell whether the formulas actually differ in this respect or not ( comments are welcome on this issue ! ) .
A comparison of the two formulas for a set of 50 eggs which I weighed and measured shows that for T yolk = 63 °C and T water = 100 °C they are quite similar , except for the larger spread of the circumference measurements ( see plot below ) .
For higher T yolk or lower T water Williams ’ formula consistently gives longer cooking times than Barham ’s formula .
It remains to be seen which of the formulas will be closer to the truth .
The graph shows the cooking time for 50 eggs ( sorted by increasing mass ) calculated from the mass and circumference using the two formulas shown above with T yolk = 63 °C , T water = 100 °C and T egg = 4 °C .
For the given conditions the two formulas give similar results .
The most striking lesson learnt is that measuring the circumference is in fact not very accurate , hence the larger spread of these points .
The doneness of the egg depends on the temperature of the white and the yolk .
Egg white starts to coagulate in the range 62 - 65 °C .
At these temperatures it is the most heat sensitive protein , the ovotransferrin , which constitutes 12 % of the egg white , which coagulates .
The major protein of egg white , ovalbumin , makes up 54 % of the white and does n’t coagulate until the temperature reaches 80 °C .
The yolk begins to thicken around 65 °C and sets around 70 °C .
Further heating to around 80 - 90 °C produces the crumbly texture typical of hard boiled eggs .
Many of these changes are nicely illustrated in the picture of sous vide cooked eggs below , but the changes are also summed up in the following table :
Temperature / °C Egg white Egg yolk 62 Begins to set , runny Liquid 64 Partly set , runny Begins to set 66 Largely set , still runny Soft solid 70 Tender solid Soft solid , waxy 80 Firm Firm 90 Rubbery solid Crumbly texture
At sea level , the temperature of boiling water is 100 °C .
At higher altitudes , the boiling is lowered .
As a rule of thumb , the boiling temperature of water is lowered 0.3 °C for each additional 100 m above sea level .
For an accurate calculation , check out his calculator .
As we shall see later , the formula can of course also be used prepare eggs at sea level , using water kept at temperatures less than 100 °C .
Lastly we must know the starting temperature of the egg which will typically be 4 or 20 °C .
Based on T water = 100 °C , T egg = 4 °C and T yolk = 63 - 67 °C I ’ve prepared plots for the range of 50 eggs used in the previous graph .
If the circumference or mass of an egg is known , the boiling time in minutes can easily be determined from the graphs .
I ’ve also prepared downloadable pdfs with the circumference and mass plots .
Cooking time for eggs with given circumference or mass to reach to reach 63 , 65 and 67 °C respectively at the yolk - white boundary with T water = 100 °C and T egg = 4 °C ( click for larger image or download pdfs with circumference and mass plots )
But is this the perfect egg ?
No actually not … keep reading !
The problem with using boiling water is that while you do heat the yolk to the desired temperature , you have virtually no control with the temperature of the white .
If your water holds 95 - 100 °C , so will the white ( or at least the outer most part of the white ) .
This gives it a firm , rubbery texture .
So the problem is , to put it differently , that we want to heat the yolk to somewhere above 65 °C , but we do not want to heat the white above 80 °C .
The solution to this problem is to “ boil ” the egg at a temperature lower than 100 °C , which means not to boil it at all but rather sous vide it !
Eggs are perfect for sous vide because you can just drop them into the water bath as they are .
No plastic bags or vacuum packaging are required .
Douglas Baldwin has cooked eggs sous vide for 75 min at different temperatures ranging from 57.8 to 66.7 °C as shown below .
Notice how the egg whites and egg yolks change at the different temperatures .

The surprising thing with some of the sous vide eggs is that they are inverted ( or opposite boiled ) .
The white is still runny while the yolk is set .
If you would like to try this but do n’t have a thermostated water bath for sous vide you can improvise a little .
The thermostat most people do have in their kitchen is the baking oven ( at least those with electric stoves ) .
Preheat your oven to 70 °C .
Then heat 1 L of water to 65 - 70 °C , put the eggs in , cover with a lid and leave the pan in the oven for one hour .
The tricky thing here is that oven thermometers are notoriously wrong so use a separate handheld thermometer to check your oven .
With some trial and error you should be able to obtain an inverted egg with a runny white and a yolk that has set .
Although scientifically amusing the inverted egg is n’t really desirable form a culinary viewpoint – the white is a little to runny .
Regrettably the formulas presented above are n’t of much help either .
They fail because they only take time and not temperature into account .
The perfect soft boiled egg in my opinion would have an egg white which is heated to around 70 - 80 °C and a yolk with temperatures ranging from 64 °C at the yolk - white boundary to about 60 °C in the center .
I guess it would be possible to prepare such eggs in a sous vide water bath held at 75 - 80 °C in less than an hour .
A further complication of cooking eggs in real life is that they continue to cook when removed from the hot water .
Normally this is alleviated by shocking the eggs in cold water , but if cooked at a lower temperature this could possibly be omitted .
I will start experimenting to find a perfect mass - time - temperature combination with a time window that ’s as large as possible , and I ’ll report the results in a future blog post .
And these experiments will also include a test of the recipe for eggs cocotte by Joí«l Robuchon , found via Chubby Hubby ’s post on slow - cooking an egg .
Exotic soft boiled eggs
In his book “ Off on a comet ” , science fiction author Jules Verne shows that he was actually aware of the possibility of “ boiling ” eggs at a temperature lower than 100 °C .
He has correctly observed that water boils at lower temperature in high altitudes , and that on a fictional comet of appropriate mass , water will boil at 66 °C .
The temperature is wisely chosen , because by keeping eggs at 66 °C , you really can’t do anything wrong .
From the last paragraph of the excerpt it seems that the eggs were not fully cooked after “ a good quarter of an hour ” .
Of course , there is also no mention about the size of the eggs , so any further speculations end here .
But I ’ll rather leave it to you to read the excerpt from the Gutenberg e-text version – it ’s quite amusing :
The skillet was duly set upon the stove , and Ben Zoof was prepared to wait awhile for the water to boil .
Taking up the eggs , he was surprised to notice that they hardly weighed more than they would if they had been mere shells ; but he was still more surprised when he saw that before the water had been two minutes over the fire it was at full boil .
“ By jingo ! ” he exclaimed , “ a precious hot fire ! ” Servadac reflected .
“ It can not be that the fire is hotter , ” he said , “ the peculiarity must be in the water . ”
And taking down a centigrade thermometer , which hung upon the wall , he plunged it into the skillet .
Instead of 100 degrees , the instrument registered only 66 degrees .
“ Take my advice , Ben Zoof , ” he said ; “ leave your eggs in the saucepan a good quarter of an hour . ”
“ Boil them hard !
That will never do , ” objected the orderly .
“ You will not find them hard , my good fellow .
Trust me , we shall be able to dip our sippets into the yolks easily enough . ”
The captain was quite right in his conjecture , that this new phenomenon was caused by a diminution in the pressure of the atmosphere .
Water boiling at a temperature of 66 degrees was itself an evidence that the column of air above the earth ’s surface had become reduced by one - third of its altitude .
The identical phenomenon would have occurred at the summit of a mountain 35,000 feet high ; and had Servadac been in possession of a barometer , he would have immediately discovered the fact that only now for the first time , as the result of experiment , revealed itself to him–a fact , moreover , which accounted for the compression of the blood - vessels which both he and Ben Zoof had experienced , as well as for the attenuation of their voices and their accelerated breathing .
“ And yet , ” he argued with himself , “ if our encampment has been projected to so great an elevation , how is it that the sea remains at its proper level ? ”
Once again Hector Servadac , though capable of tracing consequences , felt himself totally at a loss to comprehend their cause ; hence his agitation and bewilderment !
After their prolonged immersion in the boiling water , the eggs were found to be only just sufficiently cooked ; the couscous was very much in the same condition ; and Ben Zoof came to the conclusion that in future he must be careful to commence his culinary operations an hour earlier .
He was rejoiced at last to help his master , who , in spite of his perplexed preoccupation , seemed to have a very fair appetite for breakfast .
There is in fact no need to head off to other planets to find examples of low temperature prepared eggs .
If you go to Japan you ’ll find onsen tamago which litteraly translates to “ hot spring eggs ” .
Originally baskets of eggs were lowered into hot springs , but the temperature of hot springs vary so I imagine that there were several types of onsen tamago available ( does anyone happen to know the exact temperature of the hot springs used ? ) .
After cooking the egg is typically cracked into a bowl of dashi soup with mirin and soy sauce .
The challenge of preparing onsen tamago eggs at home is accurate temperature control ( just as with sous vide in general ) .
One tip I found was to place the egg on top of rice that has just cooked in a rice cooker .
Leave the eggs to “ cook ” for about one hour while the “ keep warm ” function of the rice cooker is turned on .

I ’ve been told that in Finland some saunas are equipped with egg racks .
Depending on where the rack is placed one could probably chose between hard boiled and soft boiled eggs .
But the sauna would have to be kept warm for a long time due to the slow heat transfer from the hot air .
And talking about eggs and saunas :
If the eggs are placed directly on the hot stones they will not only be hard boiled , but actually turn completely brown and acquire a nutty flavor .
In Korea such sauna eggs are known as Maekbanseok gyeran .
Other aspects to consider when boiling eggs
An egg has somewhere between 7000 and 17000 pores , meaning that water slowly evaporates ( the density decreases from 1.086 g/cm3 by 0.0017 g/cm3 daily ) .
This is also why eggs age faster at room temperature than in the fridge .
Because of the pores , eggs should not be stored next to foods with a strong smell such as onions ( unless of course , you want onion flavored eggs ) .
When boiling eggs it is not uncommon that they crack .
The most obvious reason is that they are dropped into the water and hit the bottom of the pot .
Another reason for cracking is the expansion of trapped air at the blunt end of the egg .
This air cannot escape fast enough through the small pores .
Conventional wisdom has it that piercing a small hole in the blunt end will let expanding air escape to avoid cracking .
It turns out someone has actually scientifically tested this ( with 1000 eggs ) and their finding was that there was little cracking for fresh eggs , regardless if they were pierced or not .
Piercing reduced the cracking of 5 - day old eggs and totally eliminated cracking of 28 - day old eggs .
The authors theorize that the air pocket grows due to evaporation ( meaning there is more air to expand ) and that the egg shell of fresh eggs is porous but that the pores gradually become clogged upon storage .
Curiously the abstract concludes with the following sentence ( this was written in 1973 , but it ’s still quite unusual for a scientific journal ) :
Housewives should pierce eggs before boiling them , since if they are fresh it will do no harm and if they are stale it will prevent splitting .
We can safely assume that the advise holds true for men as well !
Apart from piercing holes to avoid cracking it is possible to reduce the potential damage from cracking by addition of salt or vinegar to the water .
This will help the egg white coagulate faster and thus plug any crack formed .

There is nothing sacrosanct about any particular type of school , whether state or independent , comprehensive or selective grammar .
In essence , there are good schools and there are bad schools .
From the annual desperate clamour of parents seeking to get their children into the school of their choice , and hoping not to hear that they must instead attend the school they least favour , we see they cannot be fooled – they know what a good school looks like .
So I will not pretend that all high - achieving schools must automatically be “ good ” .
Indeed , it should not come as a shock that Stretford grammar school , in Trafford , Greater Manchester , with a 96 per cent pass rate at GCSE has been put into “ special measures ” by an Office for Standards in Education ( Ofsted ) inspection team and labelled a failing school .
What is perhaps more disturbing is the inspectors ’ judgment that although academic standards were “ exceptionally and consistently high ” , they felt that the curriculum in some non-academic subjects was “ inadequate ” .
Not surprisingly , defenders of selective schools have condemned the government as being hostile to grammars .
In recent years , armies of statisticians have emerged to try to tell us what we all know – that a good school is not just a school with solid examination results .
Instead , they tell us we should make our judgment on the statistical shibboleth of “ value - added ” .
New Labour ’s obsession with mechanistic targets has reified this as the golden braid from which all true measures of excellence can dangle .
The pupils enter the gates of their new secondary schools tagged with “ measures of prior attainment ” , albeit based on spurious , contentious and unreliable data from their Key Stage 2 SATs .
If you are not “ in ” education , or do not have a child currently within the quagmire of modern schools , you will already have been lost to the obfuscating terminology that embraces education with a life - stifling grip .
It is a world in which Shakespeare is best studied by reading only the scenes that are to be examined and skipping the rest as irrelevant .
It is a world in which spirituality is measured out in the number of assemblies or minutes spent in a PSE ( personal and social education ) programme and in which governments proudly announce campaigns to tell schools that “ every child matters ” .
It is too often a world presciently described by Dickens as one from which “ springs … the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections ” .
And the ultimate measure of the mechanical art is the arrival of the Ofsted inspectorate .
I have to confess that my own school is not typical : it is one of a dwindling number of grammar schools .
It must , by most measures , be rated among the top state schools in the country , even though we frequently admit pupils not from the top two per cent of ability but from the top 25 per cent .
We have nothing to fear from the inspectors , especially as , because of our success , we were assigned a mere one - day quickie inspection .
Nevertheless , all of the staff were geared up and ready for the day , genuinely anxious to display just how good the school is .
The pupils too , even the most recalcitrant , were determined that ranks would be closed against any outsider daring to criticise their school .
Unfortunately , there was one small exception to this unification of the troops and that was the tiny minority of parents who had their own particular axes to grind .
So , the school had refused to move their child to a class with their best friend , or had been unable to provide their child with the precise subject options that they would have preferred , or the school had , without any grounds at all , complained about the conduct of their allegedly perfect offspring .
Whatever the specific cause for their festering resentment , this they saw as a chance for revenge .
No matter that they would not consider letting their child leave for an “ inferior ” school , they still felt , fortified by all the talk of parent power , determined to exact some personal retribution .
All parents are sent a benign and anonymous questionnaire by the inspectors .
We were pretty proud at the unusually high response rate , demonstrating , as we naively supposed , the overwhelming support of the parents .
Indeed , it showed overwhelming support – apart from the minority of complaints .
To our astonishment , frustration and growing anger , we found that a disproportionate amount of the day was spent feeling like suspects answering to anonymous accusations about our bad practice .
The first signs of abnormality came early on .
One of the events of the day coinciding with the inspection was a long - planned workshop for talented keyboard players to develop their skills further and to work together to learn new techniques .
The inspector , who on the telephone had claimed to be a great lover of music and proud of her own musical family , breezed into the session and stayed for 30 seconds , saying she had other things to which to attend .
We are particularly proud of our excellence in choral work and one of our choirs was rehearsing at lunchtime .
The students were told that they would be visited and , rather than end the rehearsal in time for sandwiches , voluntarily stayed on to practise .
But no visit came .
The inspectors clearly had more pressing concerns than being courteous and interested enough to listen to pupils proudly displaying their excellence .
We were allowed to see one of the complaints .
It was a three - page diatribe so ludicrous that no sane person would have treated it seriously , including , for example , the allegation that teachers were openly allowing drug - taking and boasting of their own criminal records .
On a more predictable level was the handful of parents complaining that the pupils were made to work too hard .
The inspectors , in their interviews with students , found no grounds to substantiate this odd claim .
At one point , the lead inspector said that some parents thought the pupils were unhappy .
This remark was spoken over the sound of pupil laughter in the corridors – they had not read the script .
It became more and more apparent that beneath the investigations of trivia there was resentment against a selective school being so successful and providing an education that was producing independent - minded young people with the talents and qualities to make a difference in the world .
There was , in short , a suspicion of “ excellence ” and , at the end of the day , when it proved impossible not to grade the school as “ outstanding ” in every single category , the final summing - up included the gleeful words , “ but only just ” , with the inspector ’s thumb and index finger pinched together to indicate how grateful we should be for her concessions .
After they had departed , my colleague remarked that it felt like winning the FA Cup and going home thoroughly depressed by the experience .
We had got the result we deserved , but felt that far from recognising the genuine values being added by the enthusiasm and experience of our hard - working staff , we were instead being assessed only on a set of outcomes , the numbers of examination passes that “ proved ” we were outstanding at teaching children to pass examinations .
What joys Orwell would have had with the concept of “ value - added ” .
Of course , I know that we are an outstanding grammar school , providing pupils from a huge range of social backgrounds with a secure foundation in the love of learning .
I also know that some of these pupils would have struggled and almost certainly “ failed ” in a “ bad ” school .
Yet in 20 years ’ time will they be saying , “ I am so pleased that my school provided such a great non-academic curriculum – oh , and did you know that it achieved +0.48 as a value - added score ” ?
Or will they be more likely to regret never discovering that love of literature , that facility with numbers , that passion for science which would have made them a truly educated person ?
Since Iran ’s controversial and disputed election , President Obama has been noticeably restrained in his reaction .
He has flashed his empathy , saying on Tuesday that he was “ appalled and outraged ” by the regime ’s brutality , but he has been equally emphatic about not being perceived as meddling in Iran ’s internal affairs .
Despite increasing political heat , even from Democrats and the usually adulatory U.S. media , Obama persists in his low - key approach , clinging to emotive generalizations .
But it is the president ’s underlying policies that are wrong , not just his rhetoric .
Saying that he does not want the “ debate ” inside Iran to be about the United States is disingenuous at best .
Obama ’s real objective is to launch negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program , in the belief that he can talk Iran out of its 20 - year effort to acquire deliverable nuclear weapons .
He said it during the 2008 campaign , during his inaugural address and repeatedly thereafter .
Viewed in the light of this near - religious obsession with negotiation , Obama ’s reticence is entirely understandable :
He does not want to jeopardize the chance to sit with the likes of Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard .
In fact , everything we know about the regime indicates that Iran , and the Revolutionary Guard in particular , will never voluntarily give up its nuclear program , so Obama ’s policy is doomed to failure .
( Inevitably , of course , if negotiations start , Obama would change the definition of success to include accepting a “ peaceful ” Iranian uranium - enrichment program , which means Tehran would retain its “ breakout ” capability to quickly produce nuclear weapons -- but exploring this further Obama failure has to wait for another day . )
Advertisement
Accordingly , it is Obama ’s policy errors , not his rhetorical ones , that should be opposed .
Rhetoric itself is not policy but only the adjunct of policy , albeit often an important one .
Obama ’s reticence reflects his larger misjudgment -- the dangerous misconception that there is a negotiated solution to Iran ’s nuclear threat that can satisfy both Iran and the United States .
Pursuing that objective is perilous for America , its allies and its friends -- in Europe , Israel and the Arab world alike .
Moreover , Obama rarely mentions Iran ’s continuing role as the world ’s central banker for terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah , yet this is another threat that negotiation will not eliminate .
Obama ’s policy , and that of the United States , should be the overthrow of the Islamic revolution of 1979 .
The massive resistance to the June 12 elections is just another fact supporting that conclusion .
The Tehran regime -- not just Ahmadinejad but the entire Islamic revolution superstructure -- is enormously unpopular for three major reasons .
First , the regime ’s economic mismanagement has brought the economy of a country rich in oil and natural gas to near - gridlock .
Periodic but piecemeal strikes have been put down , but the prospect of a simultaneous , sustained , nationwide strike remains a potent threat
Advertisement
Second , Iran ’s young people -- two - thirds of the population is under 30 -- know they could have a much freer life if they could only overturn the mullahs ’ strict rule .
The young are educated and sophisticated , and they know there are alternatives to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ’s velayat-e faqih , the system of “ guardianship of Islamic jurists ” that imposes harsh Sharia law on Iran today .
Third , Iran is only about 50 % Persian .
Arabs , Baluchis , Azeris , Kurds and others resent the ethnic , political and religious discrimination they face constantly and have little or no love for the Islamic revolution .
Of course , these various sources of discontent are not entirely reinforcing , and are sometimes in conflict , which indicates how difficult it is for a purely internal Iranian opposition to coalesce .
Had the U.S. and others over the last 30 years done more to help Iranian dissidents , overtly and covertly , we might be in a different place today .
The question is whether we are prepared to do now what we should have been doing for some time .
To date at least , the Obama administration ’s answer remains a resounding no .
Obama wants negotiations with Tehran , not regime change .
Given that the Revolutionary Guard and the hard - line mullahs -- and not the people -- are increasingly likely to be the short - term winners of the current Battle for Iran , supporters of regime change must now make longer - term plans .
Advertisement
We have missed a huge opportunity because of Obama ’s error ( and that of his predecessors ) , but the continuing threat of Iranian nuclear weapons and support for international terrorism make the imperative of regime change no less compelling .
The Iranian people will continue their opposition no matter how inconvenient it is for Obama ’s hoped - for negotiations .
We should support them , and not just by rhetoric .

Senate Democrats Against The Public Option Are n’t Caving They Just Do n’t Belive In Real Universal Healthcare
Chris at Americablog wonders why some Senate Democrats are caving on healthcare when 72 % want a public option and 85 % think the system needs to be fundamentally changed .
He thinks it ’s because such Dems are spineless .
That fundamentally misunderstands the situation .
To vote against something that 72 % of the population wants indicates a Congress member is n’t a panderer to public opinion .
What it indicates instead is that they either :
actually do n’t believe in a public option , let alone real universal healthcare a la single payor ; or ,
are being paid enough by insurers and other folks who want the current healthcare gravy train to continue that they are willing to vote against what the majority of their constituents want .
Personally , I ’d go with both .
They do n’t believe in universal healthcare , and they know that their real constituents are n’t the people who vote for them but the people who fund their campaigns and make sure they , their friends and their families are taken care of .
And no , they do n’t think that ’s you , the voter and taxpayer .
They do n’t believe they wo n’t be reelected if they vote against a public option .
And given re-election rates of Senators , who are the people causing the most problem , they ’re probably right , are n’t they ?
Their calculation is that voters are sheep and wo n’t make them pay any real price for killing a good healthcare plan .
I ’d say they ’re right .
So given that they probably do n’t believe in universal healthcare , that they do n’t personally need it since they have good healthcare , that they get paid to vote against it and that they ’ll pay no price for voting against it , why should n’t they kill it ?
Seems like a brain dead calculation to me .
I ’m sure it does to Diane Feinstein too .
As another entitled aristocrat once said “ let them eat cake ” .
HIGHER levels of vitamin D , synthesised in the skin after being exposed to the sun and found in oily fish , are associated with increased brain power among middle - aged men , according to a British study .
The link between increased vitamin D and faster information processing " was more significant in men aged over 60 years old , " read the report , to appear in The Journal Of Neurology , Neurosurgery And Psychiatry on Thursday .
The study , conducted by researchers from the University of Manchester in collaboration with other European specialists , compared the cognitive performance of more than 3000 men between the ages of 40 and 79 years .
Men with higher levels of vitamin D " performed consistently better in a simple and sensitive neuropsychological test that assesses an individual 's attention and speed of information processing " .
Researchers " observed a significant , independent association between a slower information processing speed and lower levels of vitamin D , " said the study 's lead author , David Lee , at Manchester 's school of translational medicine .
The study took into account other possible factors , such as depression , season and levels of physical activity .
The main source of vitamin D is ten to 15 minutes daily exposure to sunlight .
Oily fish are also an excellent source of vitamin D. A separate 2008 study by researchers in Amsterdam showed that a lack of vitamin D could increase the risk of psychiatric problems among older people .

FreeTTS makes liberal use of the " Class - Path " attribute of a jar Manifest .
As such , you need to place very little in your classpath when you run applications .
The only things you need to do are the following :
Place the lib directory anywhere you want .
directory anywhere you want .
Make sure lib / freetts . jar is in your classpath .
Note that the demonstration applications also use a jar Manifest that uses the " Class - Path " attribute .
The build places the jar files for FreeTTS in the lib directory , and the jar files for the demos in the bin directory .
The jar manifests for the demos depend on the lib and bin directories being in the same top level directory .
If you change this , the demos may not work properly .
If you are not interested in building FreeTTS , then you only need to download the FreeTTS binary distribution from the FreeTTS Download Page .
Once you 've downloaded and unpacked the FreeTTS binary distribution , perform the following steps :
We have provided a number of demonstration applications that use FreeTTS .
We highly suggest that you use these as examples for how to create your own applications .

FreeTTS Test Program
The FreeTTS distribution includes a program that will allow you to test many of the features of FreeTTS .
This program is started by running the following command :
java - jar lib / freetts .jar .
NAME freetts - exercise the FreeTTS synthesis sytem
DESCRIPTION
The lib / freetts .
jar contains a main entry point that allows a user to interactively control the FreeTTS synthesizer .
When invoked with no arguments , freetts will read text from the command line and convert the text to speech .
freetts can also be used to convert text from a file to speech .
It includes options that allow you to redirect the audio to file , as well as a number of metrics and debugging options .
OPTIONS
There are a number of options that can be used to affect the operation of freetts as described here : - detailed Metrics : turn on detailed metrics - dumpAudio file : dump audio to file - dumpAudioTypes : dump the possible output types - dumpMultiAudio file : dump audio to file - dumpRelations : dump the relations - dumpUtterance : dump the final utterance - dumpASCII file : dump the final wave to file in ASCII form ( for testing ) - file file : speak text from given file - lines file : render lines from a file - help : shows usage information - metrics : turn on metrics - run name : sets the name of the run - silent : do n't say anything - streaming : use streaming audio player - text say me : speak given text ( should be last argument ) - url path : speak text from given URL - verbose : verbose output - version : shows version number - voice VOICE : kevin , kevin16 , mbrola_us1 , mbrola_us2 , or mbrola_us3 - voiceInfo : print detailed voice info EXAMPLES Interactive mode : % java - jar lib / freetts .jar

Tools
FreeTTS now has the ability to import voice data from FestVox ( US English only ) .
With this , you can record your own voice using the FestVox tools , and then turn the resulting data into a FreeTTS voice .
Visit our FestVoxToFreeTTS page to learn how to create your own voices for FreeTTS .
It 's not trivial , and it requires using Festival and FestVox .
FreeTTS now has the ability to import CMU ARCTIC voice data from FestVox ( US English only ) .
The CMU ARCTIC voices are quite large and require a little extra work , so we created tools just for these voices .
Visit our ArcticToFreeTTS page to learn how to import the CMU ARCTIC voices into FreeTTS .

The SpaceShipTwo carrier plane WhiteKnightTwo takes off in an April 20 , 2009 flight test , a 4 - hour endurance trip that marked its longest flight
The mother shipfor a commercial suborbital spaceliner fleet made its longest flight yet Mondayin a test apparently marred only by some slight damage to thevehicle ?s tail .
The large WhiteKnightTwocarrier aircraft ?
Eve? took off from the Mojave Air and Space Port inCalifornia , flying to some 20,000 feet on a successful four - hour flight ?
the longest sofar and a good initial endurance test , noted Will Whitehorn , President of Virgin Galactic .
While theflight test expanded the flight regime of the WhiteKnightTwo , an incidentcaused a heart - stopping moment for ground watchers when an apparent crosswind duringa landing strip maneuver pitched the vehicle up steeper than expected , causingslight tail damage , according to a SPACE.com source .
Virgin Galacticis the spacetourist travel firm backed by U.K. adventurer and billionaire RichardBranson and his Virgin Group .
Eve is named after Branson ?s mother .
The WhiteKnightTwo is the mother ship for SpaceShipTwo ?
also built by a workforceat Scaled Composites in Mojave , California .
Whitehorn saidthat the aircraft ?s gear was successfully retracted and extended in flight , with the craft running up in speed in both the gear up and down configuration .
Furthermore , the aircraft ?s flightenvelope was expanded in the areas of gross weight , as well as G - loadbroached , he said .
? We are delighted with the programso far and are meeting every milestone we are setting , ?
Whitehorn told SPACE.com .?
Sir Richard Branson is looking forward to flying in Eve this summer and thenseeing SpaceShipTwo attached later in the year , ?
he added .
The WhiteKnightTwo waspublicly unveiled at the Mojave Air and Space port on July 28 , 2008 .
Pucker factor
While details remain a tad murky , thetail damage was apparently caused during a touch - and - go runway approach by WhiteKnight Two , which created a ? pucker factor ?
in eyewitnesses watching the flight .
According to a SPACE .comsource , during the maneuver , the WhiteKnightTwo appeared to have been caught bya cross wind and pitched up steeper than expected .
The result was a tail strikeby both rudders of the large craft , according to one observer .
However , the damage appeared to beminimal , with the WhiteKnight Two later making a smooth touch down on thetarmac .
Following a roster of testevaluations of the WhiteKnightTwo at the Mojave Air and Space Port , the craftwill carry the now - under - construction SpaceShipTwo - the two pilot / sixpassenger suborbital rocket plane .
Virgin Galactichas ordered fiveSpaceShipTwo rocket planes and two of the carrier craft , with options onmore .
The buckle - up pricetag per seat for a suborbital trek onboard SpaceShipTwo is $ 200,000 .

I 've read numerous right wing fear mongering statements warning about the threat of terrorists escaping and wreaking havoc on US citizens if we close Gitmo and house them in supermax prisons on US soil .
I have yet to read a counter - argument like the one I am about to make .
First I have to ask readers to disregard the fact that no prisoners , even experienced criminals with extensive support networks on the outside , have ever escaped from a US maximum security prison .
Assume then , that the possibility of escape exists - and that you are a terrorist inmate who knows little English , probably does not look like the people who live near the prison ; has never stepped foot on US soil except when being transported from Gitmo to your current prison , knows nothing of US society and customs , and nothing about the area surrounding the prison or anywhere in the US for that matter .
Further assume that you have just escaped and are somewhere in the vicinity of the prison .
What obstacles do you have to overcome before you can commit murder and mayhem ?
Turns out , quite a few .
To begin with , you need to find civilian clothes because you are dressed in easily recognizable prison garb .
Food and money are absolute necessities .
A map or even better a GPS system , would come in handy , but only if you can read English and know how to use them .
A car would be a big help because you are being pursued by angry prison guards , humiliated that you somehow escaped from their prison .
They are being led by snarling dogs who know your smell and local and state police equipped with helicopters and infrared devices .
And do n't forget the FBI , if they have had time to get into the act before you are apprehended , plus possibly the National Guard .
Unfortunately , you almost certainly do not know how to drive , so the car wo n't help you get away to where ?
Then there 's the local populace which has been alerted and is keeping an eye out for you .
Many of them are armed and know how to use a rifle or a shotgun since hunting is a way of life and everyone knows how to use them .
It would be wise for you to consider that they might shoot on sight .
So I am not at all concerned about housing terrorists on US soil .
Nor should you be .
I hope this helps you all understand why I disregard right wing fearmongers like Cheney , who never met a war he was willing to serve in , or passed up an opportunity to instill fear in the US citizenry .

Shares in Telstra were up 4 % , or 13 cents , to $ 3.34 .
The stock closed at $ 3.21 yesterday .
Mr Rudd said the broadband proposal would provide 37,000 jobs at the peak of construction , providing a major boost to the economy in the midst of a global recession .
The fibre - to - the - premise network will run to 90 % of homes and businesses .
The Government will make an initial investment of $ 4.7 billion in the company but intends to sell its interest within five years after the network is fully operational .
The network will be funded from Aussie Infrastructure Bonds while private sector investment in the new company will be capped at 49 % .
The remaining homes and businesses will be reached via wireless and satellite technologies offering speeds of 12 megabits per second .
The proposal goes much further than the Government had previously planned as fibre - optic cables will now run all the way from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses .
It had previously planned to lay cables only from exchanges to cabinets at the end of street corners .
In a major blow to Telstra , Mr Rudd said it was time '' to bite the bullet ' ' after years of neglect of the telecommunications sector .
'' Years of failed policy have left Australia as a broadband backwater , " he said .
He described it as the " single biggest infrastructure decision in Australia 's history " .
A report to the Government from an expert panel found none of the national bids " offered value for money for Australian taxpayers " .
Telstra was dumped from the tender in early December after failing to meet a basic requirement , leaving Melbourne group Acacia , the SingTel - owned Optus , the Canadian telco Axia NetMedia , the Tasmanian Government and TransAct vying for the funding .
The latter two made regional bids .
Telstra shares have fallen 22 % since it was excluded from the tender .
" The investment by the Government creates an alternative to Telstra 's fixed - line network over time , effectively re-nationalising part of the fixed - line industry in Australia , " JPMorgan 's telecommunications analyst , Laurent Horrut , said today .
Mr Horrut said the new network would make Telstra 's copper - wire network obsolete within a five- to 10 - year period .
" In addition , the Government is reviewing all key regulatory conditions in the sector and that will create significant uncertainty for the company , " he said .
The Government plans to start construction in Tasmania about the middle of the year .
Facing the loss of its near monopoly on fixed - line telecommunications , Telstra is expected to fight in the courts any attempt by the Government to force it to relinquish its grip .
Some have suggested the project could be delayed by five to 10 years by Telstra using legal action to prevent the access required to its copper - wire network to complete the project .
However , the Government today made clear it would change legislation to prevent Telstra from jeopardising the success of a national network .
Since it was dumped from the tender in early December , Telstra has been promoting its '' Plan B '' , which includes plans to spend about $ 300 million to increase speeds on its Melbourne cable network .
The alternative strategy entails shifting fixed - line customers onto its cable network and third - generation NextG mobile network .

KILLING CRAMDOWN ….
For a while , it looked like “ cramdown ” had a real chance of passing .
The measure , which would have given bankruptcy judges the authority to modify mortgages , was supposed to be the centerpiece of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act.
Instead , Democrats went up against the banking industry , including institutions getting bailout money , and lost .
The NYT had an interesting item yesterday on what transpired during the debate , most notably after Citigroup was convinced to endorse the idea .
While Mr. Durbin had trouble rounding up Democratic votes , Republican leaders kept their members — and potential renegade banks — in line .
Senator Jon Kyl , the Arizona Republican leading the charge against the bankruptcy change , told bankers there would be consequences if they dealt with the Democrats .
According to an April 20 e-mail message between industry officials in touch with Mr. Kyl , he told them “ not to make a deal with Durbin and then come looking to Republicans when they need help on something like regulatory restructuring . ”
This is pretty extraordinary revelation , given the importance of the cramdown measure .
The banking industry was moving towards accepting the concessions and the legislation , but the very Republicans doing the industry ’s bidding intervened to make sure the bill was killed anyway .
Noam Scheiber helps put this in perspective .
Aftermath of the hospital shelling .
Warnings : contains footage of the dead and injured .
Credit : War Without Witness
Staff & War Without Witness
Yesterday a shell was reported to have hit a temporary hospital in the so - called no - fire zone in north - east Sri Lanka , killing 47 people .
Vany Kumar , 25 , works at the temporary medical facility in Mullaivaikal East primary school , which is caught between government troops and the last remnants of the Tamil Tigers ( LTTE ) .
Here , in a telephone interview with the Guardian , she describes life on the front line .
This is really a disaster .
I do n't know really how to explain it .
At the moment , it is like hell .
Most of the time we live in the shelter .
There is not enough medical equipment , so it is really difficult to treat people .
Food is a problem as well .
There is no food at all here , there are no vegetables and no rice , they just eat whatever they can find , that 's all .
The hospital is located in a primary school so there is only one room .
We just try our best to achieve what we can .
I was in the office working [ when the shell hit ] .
It was definitely a shell , there is no doubt about that .
I was about 20 metres away , and I was sure that it landed inside the hospital , so I went to the shelter .
I got the news from the doctors that there were people injured and dead .
There was constant shelling so I could n't leave the shelter .
For us , shell bombing is just a normal thing now .
It is like an everyday routine .
We have reached a point where it 's like death is not a problem at all .
No one has any feeling here now , it 's like everyone says , " Whatever happens , it happens . "
That 's it , that 's the mentality every single person has here .
The most terrible thing that I have seen was when a mother had a bullet go through her breast and she was dead and the baby was still on the other side of the breast and the baby was drinking her milk , and that really affected me .
I was at that place where it happened .
There is just too much to take .
Children have lost parents , parents have lost children , it 's just a common thing now .
[ The shelling ] is definitely coming from the government side , that can be sure , because it is only a small area on the LTTE side and from the sound and from the distance I can surely say it is from the government side .
I do n't care about the government , I do n't care about the LTTE , my concern is the civilians because through all these problems they are the people affected .
The government or the LTTE , they have got to do something , and if not , I can't imagine what will happen next .
Both parties have got to have a ceasefire .
I think the international [ community ] has to either come into the country or get both parties to stop the fighting and start thinking about the civilians living here .
Every single person living here asks why the international [ community ] is not doing anything .
I really want to come to the UK but I do n't know .
I 'm talking to you now , but maybe tomorrow I 'll be dead .

If there ’s one thing I ’m good at , it ’s starting a budget .
I have no problem tracking our spending for a month or two or setting up income and expense categories .
I ’m even able to setup a working zero based budget where we allocate every dollar to a category , leaving no money left over to just disappear .
The problem is , I ’m also good at letting things slide .
Once we ’ve been doing a budget for a month or two and things seem to be going pretty well , I have a way of slowly moving back towards bad spending habits , and not keeping track of where our money is going .
I fall victim to the slow creep of budget malaise .
I no longer care to do the budget because it ’s just too much work ( just feels like it ) and it ’s not fun any more .
The past few months has been one of these off - the - tracks scenarios for me .
I keep getting back on track with our budget , and then off track again .
We ’ve been going through health issues , hospital stays and general job craziness , and through it all the budget just has n’t been as important .
It ’s been tough to get excited about doing our budget when other things seem so much more important .
Getting Back The Budget Mojo
So how do you get the passion back for doing your budget ?
I ’m not sure I have a perfect answer , but I have one that seems to work for me .
I take a month off .
I know , that does n’t sounds like the greatest idea , but I ’ve found that most things in our budget are on auto - pilot anyway , and sometimes you just need a break to collect yourself .
Taking a month off from the budget does n’t have to mean going crazy for the month , but it might mean not worrying about hitting every expense category on the head .
Maybe this month you ’ll shoot for your goals , but not be stringent about them .
If you spend slightly more in the dining out category , that ’s OK , do n’t fret about it .
Just realize that you ’re having an off month , and next month you ’ll be buckling down again .
Staying Focused With Goals
Another thing that can help you stay focused and get back on track is to actually write out your goals , and keep them front of mind by putting them on the fridge , or having them on the desktop of your computer .
Remind yourself that you ’re working towards something .
If you do n’t set goals , it ’s extremely easy to get off track and forget why you ’re even doing a budget .
Make both short and long term goals so that you have something to work towards , both in the coming months and the years to come .
Short Term Goals : Goals to be met within 2 - 3 years .
Set goals like saving for birthday gifts , saving for a new car , or paying off that nagging credit card debt .
Watch as you get closer to reaching your goal , and have a mini-party when you pay off debts !
Goals to be met within 2 - 3 years .
Set goals like saving for birthday gifts , saving for a new car , or paying off that nagging credit card debt .
Watch as you get closer to reaching your goal , and have a mini-party when you pay off debts !
Long Term Goals : Goals to be reached in longer than 3 years .
Set long term goals like retirement savings goals , college savings goals and mortgage payoff goals .
Keep track of your goals as you go .
Stay Accountable
Another thing that really helps is if you have someone who can keep you accountable and help you get back on track .
If you ’re married , your spouse is usually your best choice .
If you ’re single , talk with someone you trust that can keep you accountable , and tell you when you ’re not practicing good financial habits .
Do you have your own tricks or tips for staying on track with your family budget ?
What helps to keep you accountable ?

Today , international action on climate change is urgent and essential .
Indeed , there can no longer be any debate about the need to act , because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , of which I am chairman , has established climate change as an unequivocal reality beyond scientific doubt .
For instance , changes are taking place in precipitation patterns , with a trend toward higher precipitation levels in the world 's upper latitudes and lower precipitation in some sub-tropical and tropical regions , as well as in the Mediterranean area .
The number of extreme precipitation events is also increasing – and are increasingly widespread .
Moreover , the frequency and intensity of heatwaves , floods , and droughts are on the rise .
This change in the amount and pattern of rainfall has serious implications for many economic activities , as well as for countries ' preparedness to handle emergencies such as large - scale coastal flooding or heavy snowfall .
Some parts of the world are more vulnerable than others to these changes .
The Arctic region , in particular , has been warming at twice the rate of the rest of the globe .
Coral reefs , mega - deltas ( which include cities like Shanghai , Kolkata , and Dhaka ) , and small island states are also extremely vulnerable to rising sea levels .
Other negative effects of climate change include possible reductions in crop yields .
In some African countries , for example , yields could decline by as much as 50 % by 2020 .
Climate change would also lead to increased water stress , which by 2020 could affect 75 - 250 million people in Africa alone .
Overall , temperature increases are projected to increase by the year 2100 within a range of 1.1C to 6.4C .
In order to focus on this set of outcomes , the IPCC has come up with a best estimate at the lower end of this range of 1.8C , and 4C at the upper end .
Even at the lower estimate , the consequences of climate change could be severe in several parts of the world , including an increase in water stress , serious effects on ecosystems and food security , and threats to life and property as a result of coastal flooding .
There also may be serious direct consequences for human health if climate change is not checked , particularly increased morbidity and mortality as a result of heatwaves , floods , and droughts .
Moreover , the distribution of some diseases would change , making human populations more vulnerable .
Because the impact of climate change is global , it is essential that the world as a whole take specific measures to adapt .
But it is already clear that the capacity of some communities to adapt will quickly be exceeded if climate change goes unmitigated .
To help these most vulnerable communities , it is essential for the world to devise a plan of action to limit the emission of greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) .
Several scenarios have been assessed by the IPCC , and one that would limit future temperature increase to between 2.0- 2.4C would require that emissions peak no later than 2015 , and decline thereafter .
The rate of decline would then determine the extent to which the worst effects of climate change can be avoided .
The IPCC also found that the cost of such a strict effort at mitigation would not exceed 3 % of global GDP in 2030 .
Moreover , there are enormous co-benefits to mitigation : lower emissions of GHGs would be accompanied by lower air pollution and increased energy security , agricultural output , and employment .
If these co-benefits were taken fully into account , that price tag of 3 % of GDP in 2030 would be substantially lower , perhaps even negative .
The world could actually enhance economic output and welfare by pursuing a path of mitigation .
The need for international action , therefore , stems from two important observations arising out of the IPCC 's work .
First , if we do not mitigate emissions of GHGs , the negative effects of climate change will be difficult to reverse , implying great hardship and possibly danger to mankind and other species .
Second , the benefits of mitigating emissions of GHGs are so overwhelming that this , combined with the prospect of the harm resulting from inaction , makes it imperative for the world to devise an international response and a plan of action .
Given the challenge facing us , the magnitude and nature of which were clearly brought out by the IPCC , the Copenhagen conference later this year must produce a multi-lateral agreement that deals adequately with climate change .

Well this is almost refreshing — - A clip from Glenn Beck 's daily clownshow where the centerpiece clown is someone not named Glenn Beck .
Who could it possibly be ?
Television 's Coach Hayden Fox , naturally !
Where exactly Beck dug up Craig T. Nelson to appear on his show is anyone 's freaking guess , but good golly is he pissed !
He 's sick and tired , SICK AND TIRED , of having his money taken from him to pay for the things that he thinks that he does n't directly benefit from .
Stupid bailouts !
He 's a " fiscally responsible grandfather " dammit !
But the most baffling thing of all about this clip is about midway through , after he 's fully launched into a tirade over the government taking his money to pay for things he does n't approve of , Nelson makes this statement :
" I 've been on food stamps and welfare .
Did anybody help me out ?
No ! "
Go ahead , YOU figure that one out .
I sure as hell can't .
And if you do , please , PLEASE , share the answer with me .
I 'll be waiting .
And just a reminder , you 're a traitor if you refuse to risk losing your life to fight in a ridiculously misguided war your country engages in , but you 're a patriot if you refuse to pay your taxes so some poor slob and his family do n't get put on the street when their home gets foreclosed by the bank .
Just never forget that , okay ?!

Tory leader David Cameron has urged voters to tell Gordon Brown " enough is enough " and to " vote for change " in next month 's English local elections .
He said his party could offer " more for less " and keep council tax down .
He would urge all new or re-elected councillors to " go through the books " to see if costs could be cut further .
Launching the Tories ' local election campaign , he said it was voters ' " last chance " , before the general election to tell the PM " what you think of him " .
He accused the prime minister of running the UK into the ground with " eye- watering " borrowing , presiding over social decline , and " letting our politics descend into the quagmire " .
' Time for change ' " I promise you this , they cannot go on forever , " he told Conservative activists .
" Change in our country will come and we can make that great day of change arrive all the sooner , if on June 4th you give this weak , useless and spineless government a message they wo n't forget . "
He said every Conservative vote would deliver the message , " enough is enough .
It is over .
You are the past , it is time for change " .
A total of 34 local authorities in England hold elections next month - 27 county councils , two existing unitary councils and five new unitaries .
On the same day , voters across the UK will elect 72 MEPs through a system of proportional representation .
The European poll takes place across 27 countries , with 375 million people having the right to vote .
In last year 's English and Welsh local elections , Labour suffered its worst electoral performance for 40 years with a net loss of 331 seats .
Meanwhile the Conservatives gained 256 councillors and Boris Johnson won the London mayoralty from Labour 's Ken Livingstone .
Mr Cameron said they had won in new areas , " proving that for the modern Conservative Party there are no , no - go areas " .
For Labour , Schools Secretary Ed Balls said : " It seems a little bit premature for David Cameron to gloat - in private at least - about a ' glorious ' victory at the elections .
" There is nothing ' glorious ' about cutting public services and scrapping support for families in the middle of the recession ; nothing ' glorious ' in threatening to cut the free travel for pensioners or free TV licence for the over - 75s ; and nothing ' glorious ' about the thousands more jobs that would have been lost if we had followed David Cameron 's policy of doing nothing .

A 69 - year - old man with a cane died in Rodeo after he was hit by his friend 's pickup truck and dragged 150 feet when a gunman tried to carjack the vehicle , authorities said Wednesday .
The incident began shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday when James Gilbeaux of Rodeo was on the 1000 block of Mariposa Street and asked for a ride from a 28 - year - old friend , David Delgado , who was driving a Ford F - 150 pickup , authorities said .
Before Gilbeaux could get in , a man with a gun approached and tried to carjack the truck , said Jimmy Lee , a Contra Costa County sheriff 's spokesman .
Delgado hit the accelerator , struck Gilbeaux and dragged his friend down the street .
The gunman fired several shots at the truck , but no one was hit .
Gilbeaux died later at Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo .
The assailant remains at large ; police did not provide a description of him .
Gilbeaux 's daughter , Sheila Gilbeaux , said he was an Army veteran who had served in Vietnam and was " loved by everybody . "
She said her father had suffered strokes and heart attacks in recent years , but still " got around as best as he could and tried to put the joy in everybody .
He was happy and joyous .
He always had something good and positive to say . "
People in the neighborhood viewed him as a grandfather figure , she said .
Everyone called him " Pops . "
She said her father , who used a cane , probably could n't react quickly enough to get out of the pickup 's path when the gunman started firing .
" There 's a lot of grief for us .
It 's just a horrible thing , " she said .
" We 're just now trying to absorb it .
We hope they get him , whoever was involved in this , and get him off the streets .
He needs to know that he took a lovely person who did n't deserve this . "

I recently had surgery for appendicitis .
Upon seeing me lying in a hospital bed , none of my visitors praised the bed 's healing power in curing my illness .
All of them understood that although my condition was eliminated at the same time that I lay in bed , lying in bed does not cure disease .
They understood that two events occurring simultaneously can be coincidental and unrelated , directly causal , or linked by a third variable or sets of variables .
Obviously , my visitors were not economists or business journalists .
Had they been , the media would have quickly been praising bed rest as a cure for appendicitis .
That is not far - fetched .
Business sections of all newspapers contain such convoluted and illogical sentiments in their articles with headlines such as " Higher Oil Prices Inflame Inflation . "
Sometimes they even present analogies without even mentioning the associated theory , such as warning that the economy may become " overheated . "
Like my visitors , Austrian economists are not fooled , because they reject the idea of empirical data in the validation of theory in the social sciences .
Reason is the only tool available for economic discovery .
The difference is starkly illustrated by their treatment of the price of oil and price inflation .
Mainstream economists assert that an increase in the price of oil will increase consumer prices .
After checking the consumer price index six months after an oil price spike , they proclaim their supposition correct : inflation grew by 4.7 % ( nobody ever questions the prerogative of government to quantify with divine precision ) .
They consider the inability to isolate cause and effect as irrelevant .
The causal relationship , however , is precisely what interests Austrians .
We ask , how can increased oil prices increase all average prices ?
If people must now spend more on oil , will not prices drop for the goods that they can no longer afford to purchase ?
However , by embracing empirical " evidence " and overlooking reason , non-Austrian economic schools have cloaked themselves in legitimacy .
In the social sciences , only in extreme and rare circumstances can experiments develop that neutralize all other variables that might contain diluting or aggrandizing effects .
But under such circumstances , might Austrian economic thought be tested and compete , legitimately , on equal footing with the perceived legitimacy of " mainstream " ( i.e. , Keynesian ) economics ?
Such a situation may currently exist with prisons in testing the validity of fiat currency .
Since money is banned in prisons , the historical use of cigarettes by prisoners as money avers that money requires alternative value ( i.e. , value apart from its use as money ) and proves that our present system of fiat currency ( and fractional - reserve banking ) is eventually doomed .
Prisoners exchange cigarettes for sex , drugs , gambling , and the killing of other inmates ( all other recreational activities being provided free of charge by taxpayers ) .
The cigarettes hold alternative value through their direct consumption ( smoking ) .
And what happens to the experiment when cigarettes are banned ?
Like a free market moving from a gold to a silver standard , prisoners switch to the next best good that possesses the qualities demanded of money : portability , durability , homogeneity , and divisibility .
The article " Mackerel Economics in Prison Leads to Appreciation for Oily Fillets " published in the October 2 , 2008 issue of The Wall Street Journal , revealed the new monetary system in prisons : cans of mackerel , or " mack " in prison nomenclature .
Just as a various goods ( e.g. , gold , silver , copper , rice , salt , peppercorns , large stones , etc. ) have long competed in the marketplace to be the standard of currency , so mack had to fend off books of stamps , PowerBars , and cans of tuna .
Fiat money does not exist in prison .
Prisoners do not dye sheets of paper green and attempt to circulate them as money .
No inmate would accept this as money , not even if the penal equivalent of a Bretton Woods agreement existed between the toughest gangs .
Why is it that criminals continue to use real money in their transactions ?
Because they have not been fooled otherwise .
In The Case Against the Fed , Murray Rothbard detailed the process by which people have been fooled into thinking those green pieces of paper are a proper store of value ( the key purpose of money ) .
Once government changed the law to recognize monetary warehouse receipts ( dollar bills ) as a debtor relationship instead of that of a bailment ( the temporary possession of another 's property ) , fractional - reserve banking was born .
Fractional - reserve banking is inherently fraudulent .
In contrast , a penitentiary does not include a warehouse issuing receipts for cigarette packs or cans of mack .
If they ever do , we know what will follow : fraud ( the warehouse issuing notes in excess of deposits ) , then government - sanctioned fraud , then government - imposed fraud , and finally —
The Big House Reserve ( perhaps consisting of notes with the warden 's picture and Latin phrases ) .
Technology.am ( May 4 , 2009 ) —
In Norway the secondary school students are given a laptop for use during coursework and also taking exams .
There are about 6,000 16 - 19 year - old students in Nord - Trondelag county in Norway are doing exams on their laptops .
The laptops are utilized for everyday schoolwork and come with standard software , such as word processors , spreadsheets and calculators installed , as well as subject specific applications for particular courses .
However , the laptops are equipped with software to prevent cheating during exams by monitoring and recording all activity on the computer .
The software records keystrokes and takes and stores screenshots .
The monitoring software ensures that the students do n’t have access to the Internet during exams .
“ We have made a huge effort to make the students aware that we can actually see what they are doing so the program works as a deterrent , ” said Bjorg Helland , project manager for digital literacy at Nord - Trondelag county council .
Benno Ohnesorg became a martyr for West Germany 's radical left
By Tristana Moore
BBC News , Berlin
The case of Karl - Heinz Kurras has all the ingredients of a Cold War spy thriller .
It has now emerged that Mr Kurras , the former West Berlin police officer who shot the young student protester Benno Ohnesorg in 1967 , was actually a spy working for East Germany 's secret police , the Stasi .
For years , Mr Kurras deceived his colleagues in the West Berlin police service and the German public .
The death of Ohnesorg on 2 June 1967 during a demonstration against a visit by the Shah of Iran sparked the student protest movement in West Germany and the turmoil of 1968 .
We are totally surprised - we never thought Kurras was a Stasi man
Hugo Diederich , deputy head of the Association of Victims of Stalinism
It was always assumed that the 26 - year - old had been killed by a typical West German policeman , who in the eyes of the students epitomised the worst evils of the capitalist state and the establishment .
Shortly after Ohnesorg 's death , Gudrun Ensslin , who later became a leader of the left - wing militant group , the Red Army Faction , provocatively said : " This fascist state means to kill us all . "
The writer Gunter Grass described the killing as the " first political murder in the Federal Republic " .
The truth turned out to be more complicated .
Double identity Germans are still coming to terms with the sensational discovery .
" The myth of the 1968 student protest movement has been deconstructed , " says Hubertus Knabe , the director of Berlin 's Stasi memorial site at Hohenschoenhausen .
The files show Mr Kurras was a member of East Germany 's communist party
" The students took the death of Benno Ohnesorg as proof of the ' class state ' , but it now appears it was the East German communist party and secret police that killed Ohnesorg . "
The revelations came to light after researchers at the German government 's agency that oversees the Stasi archives discovered 17 volumes detailing Mr Kurras ' double identity .
According to the files , Mr Kurras was an ideologically - driven Stasi agent and member of the East German communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany ( SED ) .
The Stasi had managed to infiltrate West Berlin 's security apparatus and paid Mr Kurras for his services , the files revealed .
Researchers say Mr Kurras joined the Stasi in 1955 while he was working for the West Berlin police .
Under the codename " Otto Bohl " , Mr Kurras tipped off the Stasi about US and British troop movements and delivered secret information about the West Berlin police .
Mr Kurras worked under the codename " Otto Bohl " for the Stasi in Berlin " We are totally surprised .
We never thought Kurras was a Stasi man , " says Hugo Diederich , deputy head of the Association of Victims of Stalinism .
For the state - run archive of Stasi documents , the Kurras file confirms the view that the Stasi were active in West Berlin and West Germany .
But was the former police officer acting on Stasi orders ?
" We have no evidence in the file that the Stasi gave Kurras the order to shoot Benno Ohnesorg , " says the director of the government 's Stasi archives , Hans Altendorf .
" The Stasi merely described the shooting as an ' unlucky accident ' in the file and they broke off contact with Kurras after the shooting , " he adds .
Mr Kurras was charged with manslaughter , but acquitted in November 1967 .
He said the shooting was an accident , claiming that he had been attacked by knife - wielding protesters .
Following an appeal by prosecutors and Ohnesorg 's family lawyer at Germany 's highest civil court , Mr Kurras was put on trial again in 1970 but he was also acquitted .
Unanswered questions Germans have been left wondering whether history would have taken a different course if people had known that Mr Kurras was a Stasi spy back in 1967 .
The discovery of the Kurras file has stirred a heated debate in Germany .
And what if I did work for [ the Stasi ] ?
What does it matter ?
It does n't change anything
Karl - Heinz Kurras
Last week , the liberal Free Democrats ( FDP ) put forward proposals in parliament calling for all MPs who held seats from 1949 to be investigated over any possible Stasi links .
But MPs from the governing Christian Democratic Union and Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , as well as members of the Left Party , rejected the motion citing legal reasons .
" There are many barriers against research into Stasi activities in former West Germany , " says Mr Knabe .
" Today 's political establishment does n't want to be confronted with the past . "
There are now growing calls for Mr Kurras , who is now 81 years old , to be stripped of his pension .
Chancellor Merkel told the magazine , Der Spiegel , that he did not deserve to receive full state benefits .
Amid a public uproar , the Berlin Senate has launched an investigation into the former police officer 's Stasi files .
German prosecutors have also confiscated one volume of Kurras ' Stasi file to try to establish whether the agency ordered Kurras to carry out the killing .
When asked about his connection with the Stasi , Mr Kurras told the German newspaper , Bild : " And what if I did work for them ?
What does it matter ?
It does n't change anything . "
Historians say there are still many unanswered questions .
" Only a fraction of the Stasi files have been officially registered , so the Kurras case wo n't be the last , " says Mr Knabe .
" Around 50,000 people worked for the Stasi in the former West Germany . "
East Germany 's secret police had a huge network of informers who spied on millions of people .
It is clear that unlocking the secrets of the past will be a long and difficult process .

Python for S60 1.9.3 was the first release to support touch events .
In order to give us an idea of how touch detection can be used , the PyS60 team included an application in the 1.9.3 package : Scribble .
The script – scribble .py – can be found in the PyS60 source archive but for convenience we are making it available here .
Scribble is an application similar to Window ’s Paint ( well , sort of ) .
It allows you to draw free lines and points of various colours and widths .
If analyzed thoroughly , the source code can give some hints on how to use touch in Python .

It was fortunate that Andrew MacKay did not encounter one of his elderly constituents when the Conservative MP defied growing public fury to show his face in Bracknell town centre yesterday .
" I can see ordinary people going round with shotguns and shooting them all , " said a pensioner in this industrious Berkshire town .
She was so enraged by MPs ' expenses , she said , that she was tempted to shoot the Speaker herself .
The days when Dick Turpin reputedly rested up in a pub where this new town now sprawls have long gone .
But voters outside Westminster are increasingly convinced that their representatives have got away with daylight robbery .
As Keith Rogers put it in Sleaford , where Conservative MP Douglas Hogg belatedly agreed to pay back £ 2,200 spent cleaning his moat : " This is not politics .
It 's theft .
MPs ' allowances are more than most people 's wages in Lincolnshire . "
When MPs returned to their weekly surgeries and other duties in their constituencies yesterday , they encountered a landscape transformed by revelations about their expenses .
The cynicism of many voters towards Westminster had been replaced by something much more engaged , but also far more enraged .
Margaret Beckett , heckled and booed on BBC1's Question Time on Thursday , is not the only MP to have witnessed the change in mood at first hand .
In Bromsgrove , a window in Tory MP Julie Kirkbride 's constituency office was smashed with a brick .
In Rutland , where fellow Tory Alan Duncan agreed to pay back nearly £ 5,000 of gardening expenses for tending the small plot around his constituency home , a 3ft pound sign was carved into his lawn and filled with campanula and violas .
Duncan initially reported the incident to the police but quickly changed tack , preferring to pass it off as a joke .
" At first I thought : ' Oh no , this is getting nasty . '
But actually they 've been quite funny .
These are serious times but at least in the middle of it all we can have a bit of a laugh at this one . "
But Heydon Prowse , editor of the politics and culture magazine Don't Panic , which was behind the stunt , was n't laughing .
" We were outraged in general by all the expenses claims coming out .
Alan Duncan was a nice easy target .
The flowers are a nice Tory blue .
We thought about it . "
The original meaning of Bracknell was " bracken - covered hiding place " , but as MacKay and his peers found , a week of revelations left them uncomfortably exposed to the anger of their constituents .
Effusive apologies and promises to pay back their most outrageous expenses claims have failed to pacify the public .
Voters brought up the example of the communities secretary , Hazel Blears , writing a cheque on television and laughed bitterly at what they perceived as an empty self - serving gesture .
" They know they 've done something wrong because they are giving it back , " said Chris O'Riordan , a businessman , in Bracknell .
" If I said : ' I 've just nicked a bottle of shampoo from Boots but I 'll give it back , am I all right ? '
I 'd be arrested . "
MacKay , who stepped down as David Cameron 's parliamentary aide after it was revealed that he and his wife , Kirkbride , used parliamentary allowances to claim for both their homes , performed constituency duties in public in the centre of Bracknell yesterday .
He promised to call back any disaffected voters who had complained about his two homes funded by the taxpayer and claimed the majority of emails and calls had been supportive .
In the centre of Bracknell , however , even his most loyal voters expressed contempt .
" If I got caught doing that , I would lose my business .
It is fraud , " said O'Riordan , who said he had just been fined £ 1,500 by the Inland Revenue because he was late submitting his tax details .
MPs , he said , had got away with far worse : " They should lose their jobs .
They are trying to do a bit of damage limitation and it is n't working . "
While the rightwing pressure group the TaxPayers '
Alliance is threatening to launch private prosecutions against some MPs , many ordinary voters feel the long arm of the law has proved remarkably short and weak when it comes to prosecuting MPs .
Scotland Yard has yet to confirm whether it is investigating any of the complaints it has received against individual MPs .
In Lincolnshire , community support officers stood guard outside the locked gate of the constituency home belonging to Elliot Morley , the Labour MP caught claiming £ 16,000 for his home for 21 months after he had paid off his mortgage .
While the Labour whip has been withdrawn from Morley , his constituents demanded his resignation and prosecution .
" When I paid my mortgage off , I bought a bottle of champagne and a gold bracelet , " said Pam Sargent , a retired teacher .
" How on earth can he say he did not know he'd paid his off ?
I hope he goes down and I hope he goes down with a big , big bang . "
Former prison officer John Douglas said : " I shut the door on people for far less fraud than these people have committed .
They 're a disgrace .
They should all stand down , the lot of them .
If he [ Morley ] had any honour at all , he 'd resign . "
An aggravating factor for many people is how the expenses scandal has exposed the gulf between the Westminster elite and the rest of the country , and the growing level of inequality in Britain .
" It 's one law for them and another for us , " said George Hobson , out shopping in Bracknell with his granddaughter , Olivia .
" What I have to live on for a month is what they can claim on expenses for food ( £ 400 ) . "
He said he would not vote for MacKay again .
Sandra Smith , 67 , gets by on a state pension of £ 99.30 p each week and a private pension of barely £ 20 .
From this , she must pay £ 45 in rent every week for the council house she shares with her father .
" MPs have n't a clue what we have to go through .
They are not in touch with the real world .
I 'm absolutely incensed .
They send pensioners to jail for not paying their council tax . "
Several voters mentioned not just the huge sums of money that MPs can claim on expenses but the high wages earned by members of the media who are charged with interrogating them , reinforcing a sense of a country divided between a metropolitan expense - fiddling elite and the honest , hard - working voters of middle Britain .
When Fred Binding , 90 , watched the interview in which BBC News presenter Carrie Gracie admitted she earned £ 92,000 , he " nearly fell through the floor " , he said .
For Binding , and many older voters in particular , the expenses scandal has highlighted a materialistic side to society that is completely alien to them .
" It 's become a different world altogether , " he said .
" The only thing that matters is ' me ' .
People are pushing others out of the way .
MPs have gone with the flow – they have thought : this is what people do and we will join in . "
Good software engineering practice dictates that we should always write tests for all of our modules and classes .
These tests are called Unit Tests and allow us to perform regression tests every time we change a unit – so we can ensure we have n’t broken anything in the process .
The problem is , it can be very time consuming and often regarded as ‘ boring ’ to write these tests .
Thankfully , CPAN provides a number of modules to make this very easy in Perl .
In this tutorial , we go through the process of creating the simplest of test scrips and some easy extensions to make your tests more powerful .
We are going to use the Test : : Simple CPAN module to build our test script , so include the module at the top of a new Perl file :
use Test :: Simple tests =>
2 ;
The basic building block of our tests will be the ok ( ) function .
This takes two arguments , an expression in scalar context and the test name ( this can be omitted , but it makes debugging easier as your test script grows ) and will indicate whether the test passed or failed in the output to STDOUT .
ok ( $ value eq $ expected , " Test Name " ) ; ok ( $ value < $ expected ) ;
The expression will be evaluated when the test is run .
The test will pass if the result evaluates to true or fail otherwise .
You can use this , along with the fact we are working in scalar context , to perform some more interesting tests .
For example , this test will succeed if the array is non-empty :
ok ( @my_array , " Array not empty " ) ;
Already we have seen enough to build a reasonably powerful test suite and help us build better software .
However , there are some situations where we need a little more flexibility and for these we have Test :: More .
Test :: More is a drop - in replacement for Test : : Simple – you can simply change your module include and it will work exactly as before .
use Test :: More tests =>
2 ;
Test :: More gives us a range of new functions to perform more complex and powerful tests with better diagnostics .
First up we have is ( ) and isnt ( ) :
is ( $value , $ expected , " Test name " ) ; isnt ( $ value , $ expected , " Test name " ) ;
These compare the first two arguments with eq and ne respectively .
Test :: More also has native support for regular expression with 2 complementary functions : like ( ) and unlike ( ) .
like ( $ value , qr/expected / , " Test name " ) ; unlike ( $ value , qr/expected / , " Test name " ) ;
Finally , we have the cmp_ok ( ) function .
This is operates in between the flexibility of ok ( ) and the rigidity of is ( ) by allowing you to specify the two operands and the operator :
cmp_ok ( $ value , ' == ' , $ expected , " Test Name " ) ; cmp_ok ( $ value , ' && ' , $ expected , " Test Name " ) ;
This tutorial has only scratched the surface of the big world of unit testing but the key thing to remember is that doing ANY unit testing is better than doing none , so go ahead and create some simple , repeatable tests and improve the quality of your programs .

After 15 years of leading Mythic Entertainment , my time with the studio ( and EA of course ) I co-founded with Rob Denton has come to an end .
Early in May , Electronic
Arts let me know that they wanted to make some changes within the Games Label and as a result of those changes I have been out of the office ( and out of touch with the team , game , etc. ) since that day .
So , please accept my apologies if you have tried to reach me over the last couple of months but please know I was n’t ignoring you .
Well , unless you were a gold seller making me an offer I could n’t refuse in which case my email automatically deletes your message ( would be nice if it could do that would n’t it ? ) .
To describe these past two months as difficult would be a great understatement as change is almost never easy .
I have helped shepherd Mythic through good times and bad , through near bankruptcy and through our many successes .
During my tenure there my duties have run the gamut from being CEO / GM to doing some of our legal work to acting as lead designer and even using my personal credit cards / credit to pay for the phones we used when we launched DAoC back in 2001 .
While I will miss doing those things ( well , some of them anyway ) for the studio , what I will really miss are the people at Mythic .
While some of the team has changed over the years , we have always had a great team at Mythic and seeing , talking , protecting and sharing with that team is what I will both treasure and miss the most .
Mythic is , as always , more than simply the senior leadership there , it is the programmers , artists , designers , marketing , IT , operations , facilities , finance , community management , HR , customer service , quality assurance , etc. who make Mythic what is was and is today .
It is those people , most of whom whose efforts are n’t usually publicly recognized , that deserve so much credit for the success of DAoC and Warhammer .
I wish that team nothing but the best of fortune going forward as my respect and love for them runs deep and I hope , is well known by them .
I will never forget the effort made by those teammates during both the development of DAoC and Warhammer .
Whether it was the extra late night and / or weekend efforts or simply the passion so many of you showed for our games , your level of commitment is something I will never forget .
I will have a lot more to say about this over the next few weeks and I will try , and I ’m sure fail , to adequately express my thanks and deepest gratitude to many of the team members .
While I always tried to show my gratitude either through the tools available to me as CEO of Mythic or GM of EA Mythic as well as with some personal touches , I will never be able to thank you enough .
Over the next few weeks I will be using this blog to thank certain people and companies for their efforts over the years .
There will be a lot of praise , a couple of mea culpas ( I would n’t be me if I did n’t deliver some of those ) and maybe a couple of surprise shout outs .
So , I expect this space to be pretty busy for a while .
However , if you are looking or expecting me to damn EA or anyone there , you will be sorely disappointed .
Over my 23 years of making games professionally I have refrained from attacking the competition , former and / or current partners , other game developers , etc. except on a few very rare instances .
I have no intention of breaking with tradition at the present time and I hope my track record in this regard remains unchanged for the rest of my career .
During my time at EA I was privileged to get to know a number of very fine professionals and I have some fond memories of working with them .
As always EA has my thanks for their interest in acquiring Mythic and in supporting the development of Warhammer .
For those looking to contact me , the best way to reach me currently is through Facebook .
So , friend me there but if I do n’t know your name , please enclose some details in your friend request as a courtesy .

Hanging out is a great way to start .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German woman has divorced her husband because she was fed up with him cleaning all the time .
German media reported the wife got through 15 years of marriage putting up with the man ’s penchant for doing household chores , tidying up and rearranging the furniture .
But she ran out of patience when he knocked down and rebuilt a wall at their home when it got dirty , Christian Kropp , court judge in the central town of Sondershausen , said on Thursday .
“ I ’d never had anyone seek a divorce for this , ” he said .
NATE SILVER has been called a " prodigy " , a " wunderkind " , and a " genius " .
Using his unique methodology , he was able to correctly predict every state but Indiana in the 2008 presidential election .
He also got every Senate race right .
That is why we here at The Economist find ourselves visiting his website , FiveThirty Eight , several times a day .
This week Democracy in America talked with Mr Silver about polling , predictions and politics .
DIA : Since you were able to predict so many 2008 races months ahead of time based on immutable factors , how much do political campaigns really matter ?
Mr Silver :
There are two separate questions here : how much campaigns matter and how much candidates matter .
Candidates clearly do matter , in the sense that it's not uncommon to get results in individual races that significantly diverge from the national trends .
For instance , right now we have two Republican senators in Maine , which voted for Barack Obama by 18 points , and two Democratic senators in North Dakota , which has n't voted a Democrat for President since 1964 .
Likewise , we have a Republican governor in Vermont and a Democratic governor in Kansas .
When you see gravity - defying results like those , it usually boils down to a very talented candidate .
But how much do campaigns matter ?
They clearly matter some .
Hillary Clinton , who proved to be a much stronger candidate than I expected but ran a very poor campaign , is probably Exhibit A in this regard .
On the other hand , John McCain ’s campaign basically went bankrupt during the Republican primaries and he managed to win the nomination .
DIA : Was there one campaign from 2008 that stood out as best at beating the mathematical odds ?
If so , how did they do it ?
Mr Silver : The Republican Joseph Cao defeating Democratic incumbent William Jefferson in Louisiana 's 2nd congressional district , in which probably something like 70 % or 75 % of the voters are Democratic .
It 's clear enough how Mr Cao managed to do this —
Mr Jefferson was exceptionally corrupt and ran a complacent campaign — but it was nevertheless an impressive win .
DIA : Despite all of the focus on Pennsylvania in the last days of the 2008 presidential campaign , it fell so easily to Barack Obama that people asked why it was even considered a " swing state " .
What , in your mind , are the swing states to watch in 2012 ?
( Which blue state is most obtainable for Republicans ?
Which red state for Democrats ? )
Mr Silver : Generally speaking , the same states that were swing states in 2008 .
But I would keep an eye on Georgia for the Democrats , which is rapidly beginning to urbanise and is becoming part of the " New South " .
For the Republicans — maybe New Jersey ?
One would expect that their anti-tax message would play well among wealthy voters , and there are a lot of wealthy voters in Jersey .
The other thing to watch is whether Barack Obama performs better in some parts of Appalachia , where I think his race hurt him in 2008 .
It would n’t surprise me if , after watching him on television for four years , some voters who had previously harboured some degree of racial animus begin to feel more comfortable with him .
If so , Mr Obama could be more competitive in states like West Virginia .
DIA : You wrote that the McCain campaign " radically overestimated the importance of appealing to the base " in 2008 .
What type of political message would best serve Republicans trying to form a winning electoral coalition in 2010 , 2012 and beyond .
Mr Silver : Well , that ’s the $ 64,000 question .
Clearly if the economy has not recovered , the Republicans will have the script somewhat written for them , and they can rail against the expansion of government or deficits or taxes or what have you .
But I think they 'll have to do it in an affirmative , pragmatic way — the " party of no " critique is a little hackneyed , but is probably fairly effective counter - messaging .
And if the economy recovers ?
I do n’t think it matters much what they do .
If they ’re spending a lot of time talking about gay marriage , by the way , I think that 's a sign that they 're in trouble — unless perhaps the Supreme Court has ruled on it , which could reset the whole debate .
DIA : I 've heard you say that baseball analysts put too much emphasis on what just happened .
Is the same true of political analysts ?
Mr Silver : For sure .
And in baseball , at least , they 're playing every year , whereas you only have a presidential election once every four years .
The McCain campaign operated under the assumption that the political world had n't changed since 2004 — that Mr Obama could n't turn out black voters or young voters , that swift - boating would work , that Mr Obama could n't possibly win states like North Carolina and Indiana — and they paid a price for it .
On the other hand , I think some Democrats might be a little bit complacent right now .
There are a lot of things that can go wrong — both known unknowns and unknown unknowns .
What if Afghanistan turns into the next Iraq ?
What if swine flu winds up killing several hundred thousand Americans ?
What if there 's a nuclear exchange in Kashmir ?
What if there 's a significant , unpredicted increase in the crime rate ?
Some of those things might hurt the Democrats and others might not , but there 's a pretty decent chance that the core issues in 2012 will be things that we have n't even thought about yet .
DIA : You reach some surprising conclusions using your statistical techniques .
How good is your average reader 's understanding of your work ?
Do people ever say , " I do n't care about your fancy ' mathematical ' methods , that can't be right so you must be doing something wrong . "
Mr Silver : More often I get the opposite — people who tell me they do n’t really follow the analysis , but trust my conclusion .
That 's more worrying in some ways , I think .
DIA : What went wrong with the Oscar predictions ?
Mr Silver : Hah !
Well , you know , we got two different predictions wrong — we missed on best supporting actress and we missed on best actor .
The best actor prediction I do n't feel that bad about .
It 's very rare for someone to win best actor twice within a short period ( Sean Penn had won for " Mystic River " in 2003 ) , and it was probably only the fact that Mickey Rourke had been a colossal jerk to his peers that prevented him from winning .
Forecasting deals in probabilities , not certainties , and sometimes you can make a good forecast and wind up with an incorrect result , or vice versa .
If I had told you at the start of last year that the Arizona Cardinals were going to make the Super Bowl , would that have been a good prediction ?
No — if I 'd told you that you would have had me institutionalised .
On the other hand , with the best supporting actress category , I did some sloppy modeling and clearly screwed up — that might have been the worst prediction since " Dow 36,000 " .
My apologies to anyone who bet their mortgage on Taraji P. Henson .
Chicago - busy putting on its best face to garner a 2016 Olympics bid and basking in the afterglow of President Obama ’s election - has become the nation ’s most violent city for youths .
With three weeks left before summer break , a record 36 Chicago Public Schools students have been killed this school year , marking the third straight year that youth homicides have climbed into double digits .
Chicago has surpassed New York City and Los Angeles for having the highest youth homicide rate in the nation .
“ I think people in Chicago have almost gotten numb to the statistics , ” said Dexter Voisin , a researcher at the University of Chicago who studies the impact of violence on adolescents .
The latest victim in Chicago ’s long year of student killings is 15 - year - old Alex Arellano .
On May 1 , he was chased , beaten with baseball bats , run over by a car , shot and burned .
His body was found days after he disappeared from his family ’s home on the city ’s South Side .
Police continue to investigate the killing ; gang activity has been suggested .
His grieving family members have denied any gang connections and continue to look for answers .
“ The homicide rate is just the tip of the iceberg , ” Mr. Voisin said .
“ Those with nonfatal injuries are almost 100 times that of our homicide rates .
You think for about every one kid who is murdered , 100 kids witness the murder or are victims of nonfatal injuries , of robberies , muggings and gang - related incidents .
A lot of times , this exposure goes undocumented or unreported . ”
Black youths , he said , are two times more likely than white youths to fail or drop out of school , and at the same time they are also eight to 10 times more likely to be victims of homicide than whites .
“ It ’s difficult for young people to focus in school if they are traumatized by the stress in these communities , ” Mr. Voisin said .
The death toll exasperates those offering hope to troubled neighborhood children in Chicago - an increasingly tall task in impoverished areas where gangs , drugs and guns are right outside their doors .
“ I do n’t even know where to begin , ” said Diane Latiker , who runs a program for at - risk youths out of her home in the city ’s Roseland neighborhood .
“ There are n’t any words for what I feel for what is going on for our youth . ”
Ms. Latiker uses three rooms of her six - room apartment to run a nonprofit program called Kids Off the Block .
She offers tutoring , mentoring and travel opportunities designed to show Chicago youths who want successful futures that the violent culture they see daily is not the norm .
The local drug dealer in a big car with flashy rims , wearing cool sneakers , appears to many to be the model of success , Ms. Latiker said .
“ The A and B students , they have family and community support , ” she said .
“ What about the kid who is struggling , hanging out there on the street corner and joining that gang because he feels hopeless ?
That ’s what I ’m hearing from our youth .
They feel they have nothing to live for . ”
Chicago Police Department spokesman Roderick Drew said youth violence remains a top priority .
“ Even one murder is one too many , ” he said .
In April , Chicago police joined school officials to announce the expansion of a program that allows students to anonymously text - message tips about violence .
The “ Txt2Tip ” program , piloted in 10 schools , will be available to students citywide .
The police department , led by Superintendent Jody Weiss , also recommitted to strict enforcement of a curfew that requires children 16 and younger to be inside by 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and by 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday .
Last month , police said they also were adding a third Mobile Strike Force company .
Its 50 officers and supervisors would allow police to respond rapidly to emergencies in neighborhoods .
Police said that in two areas where the strike force is employed , the homicide rate has fallen by 30 percent .
Chicago ’s homicide rate is down nearly 21 percent .
Violent incidents at schools are on the decline , thanks in part to zero - tolerance policies on weapons and assaults in and around campuses .
Schools also have employed cameras , metal detectors and more security guards to keep watch on classes .
Last year , 27 students were killed during the school year , but all of those crimes took place off campus .
“ I ’m very troubled that we are not doing everything we possibly can to stop this violence , ” Ms. Latiker said .
“ We need to go to our young people and find out what is going on .
We need to know why so many feel that they have to have guns to survive .
In the civil rights movement , we mobilized to do something … nationwide .
Why are we not doing the same thing now ? ”
Ron Huberman , chief executive of the Chicago school system , has met with Mr. Weiss to discuss ways that the schools and police can join forces to help stem the violence .
One neighborhood police leader has sponsored forgiveness seminars designed to teach adults from the community that a culture of retribution reinforces youth crime .
He teamed up with local ministers who have agreed that force has n’t worked but that changing hearts and minds might be worth a try .
Mayor Richard Daley , Mr. Weiss and Mr. Huberman attended a candlelight vigil recently , hosted by Ms. Latiker ’s group at a vacant lot across the street from her home .
She and members of Kids Off the Block are putting up small gravestones to honor each student who has died in Chicago violence .
Among those speaking at the event was the father of Blair Holt , a 16 - year - old slain last year as he tried to protect a girl on a city bus .
He appealed to those attending not to take revenge , Ms. Latiker said , because the deaths would be in vain .
The Kids Off the Block program began in 2003 with 10 children and now has 259 signed up .
Ms. Latiker said she knows she could take in many more and is hoping for a bigger place to expand .
“ I do n’t put the blame on one group or segment here , ” she said .
“ I put the blame on everyone , because that is the way it should be - on our community leaders , parents , churches , schools , the police department . …
We all have to work together here if any of this is going to get better . ”

Every argument has its “ go to ” comparison .
Talk to anyone about what is going to happen with the future of TV , and inevitably there will be a reference to “ look what happened to the newspapers ” or “ Look what happened to the music industry ”
Can we just set aside those arguments for all things media going forward and say that such arugments are INCREDIBLY STUPID ?
Yes , they are INCREDIBLY STUPID .
In a digital era , it makes absolutely no sense to compare industries that were trying to protect and serve products that were and are PHYSICALLY DISTRIBUTED and by far the biggest source of their revenues vs industries that distribute their products completely digitally or for whom physical products are in the minority .
The music industry made the mistake of trying to destroy digital distribution in order to protect the physical distribution of CDs .
Not only did they not have an answer to digitally distribute music in the Napster era , but they STILL DO NOT !.
Fortunately for them , they have finally recognized that for the most part the CD is dead , but where revenue is being generated by their music , they deserve their cut .
Imagine if they had established a digital distribution portal for audio and video , ala Hulu , that could at least attempt to compete with ITunes and Youtube .
They would be in far better shape .
Instead they are reinventing their business model .
The CD was doomed to die , no matter what happened .
Trying to protect it was a mistake .
The newspaper industry tried to protect the physical distribution of their papers .
That was a mistake .
Their problem was not only that they lost their ability to differentiate from content on the net , but they also lost their ability to differentiate their value to advertisers from the net .
There is no inherent advantage to reading the news or advertisements via the paper vs the internet , it has become a personal or business preference .
Unfortunately for the local newspaper industry , it does n’t appear any of their publishers are creative enough to come up with options to attack digital .
Comparing Cable , Telco and Satellite TV vs Online Video and referencing music or newspapers is a mistake .
The internet , digital cable ( which is becoming more ubiquitous , even to the point of Switched Digital ) , Telco video and of course satellite video are all already digitally distributed .
Each has it ’s own advantages and disadvantages .
None will be the winner to the complete exclusion of another .
They all will complement each other .
The only real outstanding issue is with the big content producers .
The question is what happens with DVD sales ?
Is the decline in sales due to the economy , the impact of downloads , the impact of VOD from cable , telco and satellite and internet , or maybe even the impact of people choosing to pay $ 10 to go to the movies rather than paying $ 15 to $ 20 for a DVD ?
I ’m not sure that we know the answer yet .
As you might guess , I have an opinion on this .
I think people are choosing out of home entertainment .
They are watching more TV and things on TV , and with limited disposable income , they are choosing inexpensive out of home entertainment .
If it costs less than $ 10 per person and its outside the house , its probably a business that is doing well .
From movies to restaurants .
I think there is another issue as well .
There is a critical business distinction between the digital distribution of movies via download vs the physical distribution of DVDs .
When DVDs resellers and retailers buy quantities of the physical product , they take the responsibility of selling them .
They write a check for the products they sell net of returns for the smaller movies , and with out returns for the biggest movies .
That is real money in the bank within 90 days of shipment .
On the digital download side , its purely consignment .
No cash , no certainty until after the fact .
Why do you think Netflix gets so much product once it hits their window and Youtube / Google does n’t ?
Because Netflix will offer minimum guarantees of revenue .
Youtubue / Google and other online sites pay purely on consignment .
That is the key problem for movie and tv download sites .
They have so little confidence in their ability to sell downloads for any given title , they are terrified of having to offer guarantees .
The content companies are happy to offer any and all shows / movies / content that is not generating revenue in physical form to any and all download sites .
But that is what separates them from the music industry .
They have the ability to distribute through any and all types of distribution , as well as to offer downloads on their own .
Its just a question of managing and optimizing the allocation of product to different distribution outlets rather than trying to completely shut down digital outlets ala the music industry .

Young is just old enough to remember the era that seared his small Mississippi town of Philadelphia on to the national consciousness .
The infamous murders of three civil rights activists in 1964 laid bare the bitter racism and official complicity in the lawlessness underpinning segregation in the south , and years later prompted the film Mississippi Burning .
But the racists soon lost the struggle to prevent Philadelphia 's black residents from voting and this week it resulted in exactly what old Mississippi had tried to prevent – the election of Young as the town 's first African - American mayor with white votes helping deliver him victory .
" Philadelphia has some of the worst history and now some of the best .
This is a reversal of some of the views that have been dominant in the community , " Young said today .
" There was a time when this could not have happened .
Now it is accepted by everyone .
There 's not a major riot in the streets because I 'm black . "
The 53 year - old Pentecostal minister 's victory was perhaps more evolution than revolution in the town of 7,300 people , about 40 % of them black .
African Americans have been filling elected positions in Philadelphia and the state for years with white support , including Young who served on the local legislature .
The old racists who controlled the council and police , and won popular support by opposing civil rights , are dying off and their successors are marginalised .
Still , Young 's election has an important symbolism in a town that came to represent all that was wrong with the old south .
" It will erase the thought that we 're just a southern racist town , " Dorothy Webb , 72 , a white retired school principal told the local newspaper .
The 1964 murders of the three civil rights workers – an African - American man from Mississippi and two white New Yorkers , all in their twenties - shocked the country not only because of the crime but because of the complicity of local officials in the killing and cover up .
As the FBI hunted for the missing activists , the local sheriff , Lawrence Rainey , said they had gone into hiding to embarrass Mississippi .
The state governor , Paul Johnson , suggested they were in Cuba .
During the search , the FBI discovered the bodies of seven other black people who had been murdered in and around Philadelphia without inquiry by the local police .
Even after the civil rights workers corpses were found six weeks after they were shot , justice was slow in coming .
Mississippi officials declined to prosecute .
Seven people , including a police deputy and a Ku Klux Klan leader eventually convicted on federal civil rights charges , served only light sentences .
Mississippi took action for the first time only in 2005 when Edgar Ray " Preacher " Killen , a KKK organiser who is now 84 , was convicted of the three murders and sentenced to 60 years in prison .
For years Philadelphia lived with the legacy of the killings .
Ronald Reagan chose the town to launch his 1980 presidential campaign with a speech about states ' rights , taken as a stand with southern whites opposed to federal civil rights laws .
But however Philadelphia was still seen , it was also changing as Young 's own progress showed .
He trained as a paramedic and rose to head the county ambulance service for 20 years .
He was also elected to the local legislature four times and served on the planning board for 12 years .
That helped make him a safe choice in the election .
" A lot of barriers I would normally have had to overcome were overcome because of my work in the community , " he said .
Still , Young doubts he could have won before .
" Ten years ago I think I would have had a good showing but I would n't have won .
But changes in our nation and the age of people make it more acceptable .
We 're getting more diverse younger citizens , " he said .
By Young 's count he picked up about 30 % of the white vote and won with only a 46 % vote margin out of the 2,000 cast .
That may not be a clear endorsement but it still represents a significant shift from the past because , while most whites did not vote for Young , he says they will accept him as the legitimate mayor of Philadelphia when he takes office in July .
Young was also helped by a few factors beyond his control .
His opponent , the incumbent mayor , Rayburn Waddell , is elderly and after 12 years in office was widely regarded as having run out of steam .
Then there was Barack Obama .
" Obama 's election sent a message to our people that it was possible .
If we can elect a black man as president we can elect a black man as mayor of Philadelphia .
In the last couple of weeks I was hearing that a lot in the community , " he said .
Young 's wife , Sheryl , said it is all a further reminder that the old Mississippi is dying .
" Most of the people who were so mean and hateful are dead .
They 're gone .
Whether they instilled something in their children we do n't know and we do n't care , " she said .
" Things have changed from being openly hateful .
It 's a new day .
Let 's move on .
We 're not going to forget it .
But do I harbour it ?
No .
We have to move on . "
The Newmarket Crown attorney 's office has withdrawn assault charges against a Keswick teen after a schoolyard fight sparked by racial slurs .
" Our office has determined that there is no reasonable prospect of conviction and it would not be in the public interest to continue the prosecution , " assistant Crown attorney Amit Ghosh told justice Peter Eourque .
" The charge is to be withdrawn . "
In a prepared statement , Ghosh told the court both boys apologized to each other after the incident , in which the accused broke the other teen 's nose , and neither had had any prior difficulties with each other before the incident .
" While statements reveal ( the accused ) has not been a victim in the past of any bullying or hate - related comments , this verbal provocation and the assault upon him cannot be ignored when assessing the reasonable prospect of conviction , " Ghosh added .
The teens had traded shoves and punches after one hurled a racial slur at the other in the Keswick High School gym following a rough - and - tumble game of speedball .
The two Grade 9 students suddenly found themselves front - page news when one of them , a Korean martial arts expert with a black belt , was charged with assault causing bodily harm after he broke the other youth 's nose with a left - handed punch .
Days later , the arrest sparked an angry walkout of more than 400 students at Keswick High , who said the charged teen was only defending his honour after being racially insulted .
Furthermore , the injured youth threw the first punch and the black belt teen was only defending himself by returning it , the students told reporters .
York Regional Police Chief Armand La Barge then stepped in and ordered an expanded investigation into whether the racial slurs played any role in the assault .
La Barge called in senior detectives and members of the hate crimes unit to take a second look at the circumstances surrounding the incident .
Last week , La Barge announced at a press conference that he was recommending to the Newmarket Crown attorney that charges be withdrawn , something only the crown can do .
La Barge went even further , criticizing the thoroughness of the initial investigation that resulted in the charges , saying it was " hasty . "
This sparked an angry response from York Regional Police Association president John Miskiw , who called La Barge 's comments a " slap in the face " to the two officers .
Additionally , Miskiw maintains the officers did the right thing in laying the charges and La Barge was wrong in recommending they be withdrawn .
La Barge emphasized the police investigation found that both teens were top students who had never been in any kind of trouble .
The injured student has admitted he insulted the Korean teen in the heat of the moment and lashed out first .
He has no history of showing racial intolerance or of bullying , La Barge added .
Meanwhile , the York Region District School Board suspended both boys , then 10 days later , flip - flopped and withdrew the suspension .
An explusion hearing for the charged teen was cancelled .
All this has not played well with the parents of the charged teen , a straight - A student who lost 10 days of school .
They say the racial taunts and the fact the injured teen punched first should have been taken into account in the initial investigation .

If that had been done , the parents say they are confident charges would never have been laid .
But they are encouraged that this town of 46,000 with its own collection of embarrassing racial incidents – two years ago there were a spate of assaults against Asian fishermen that sparked criminal charges and a Human Rights Commission investigation – has stood behind their son .
Sainsbury 's chief executive Justin King landed £ 5 m in pay and share bonuses last year for helping to turn around the supermarket chain , it emerged today .
Alongside £ 2.05 m in pay , pension and bonuses , Mr King hit all the targets under the firm 's Making Sainsbury 's Great Again plan launched in 2005 - giving him nearly 900,000 shares with a value of just under £ 3 m , according to the firm 's annual report .

His rewards will continue this year as a further 831,000 shares vest under the same plan , and 195,000 shares under a separate incentive scheme - worth another £ 3.3 m in total at the chain 's current share price .
News of his package emerges a month after the UK's third biggest supermarket reported a better - than - expected 11 per cent hike in annual profits to £ 543m .
The haul means 120,000 staff will share a bonus pot of £ 60 m , up from last year 's £ 47 m payout .
Under the turnaround plan , Mr King had to grow sales by £ 2.5 bn as well as growing the group 's earnings per share by 21 per cent over the four - year period .
Both targets were exceeded by the firm .
Mr King also stands to benefit from further share awards in coming years , the annual report said .
The chief executive was last year granted a potential maximum of 630,876 shares worth £ 2.1 m under its 2006 long - term incentive share scheme .
These shares will vest in 2011 depending on performance .
Meanwhile under a third incentive programme , the deferred annual bonus scheme , Mr King invested 50 per cent of his bonus in 158,042 shares .
This will be matched by a further 316,000 shares by the company in 2011 - worth another £ 1 m - if Sainsbury 's excels in comparison to rival retailers including Morrisons , Tesco , Next and Marks & Spencer .
You can see a history of the software installed on your machine which could help you diagnose the fault you have
Troubleshooting is curious skill .
It 's part detective work , part methodical experimentation and part inspired guesswork , and part Zen Buddhism .
That 's a lot of parts but you need them all to be able to sift through a list of symptoms , identify the fault , work out an appropriate remedy and not go barking mad in the process .
Knowing how computers work is also handy , but it is n't enough by itself and it's much less important than you may think , now that all human knowledge is just a Google search away .
Knowing the answers is all very well but the real art is asking the right questions .
See what I mean about the Zen ?
So I 'm not going to give you a fish .
I 'm not even going to teach you how to fish .
I 'm going to build you a stinking trawler .
Theoretically this ought to put me out of a job but in practice , the well of human stupidity seems to replenish itself far faster than I can pump it out , so there 's no need to worry on my behalf .
Before we begin , let us consider the tools of the trade , which are : 1 . Another computer 2 . A screwdriver 3 . A credit card .
That 's it .
The screwdriver I use has a nice flowery handle and a reversible , socket barrel with two double - ended bits so I can swap between Phillips and flat - head in two sizes each , but really , just the smaller of the two Phillips heads would do for 90 per cent of the time .
The other computer should be working and connected to the internet .
Ideally , it ought to be a desktop PC of roughly the same vintage as the computer you wish to fix , but even a laptop is better than nothing .
Among the many things you will not need include : a set of watchmaker 's screwdrivers , needle - nose pliers , soldering iron , can of compressed air and anti-static wrist strap .
I have owned and recommended all of these things in the past , but I 've never actually used any of them except to impress people when I go round to their houses to fix something .
You 'll still see computer magazines listing this ' essential troubleshooting toolkit ' , but it 's honestly just there to fill up a page .
You are now equipped to attack the five different types of computer problem , which we shall deal with in turn .
1. IT USED TO WORK AND NOW IT DOESN'T ( " YOOT - WANID " )
This may sound like it could cover every computer problem but it 's actually quite specific .
IUTWANID ( pronounced yoot - wannid ) means that your computer was working perfectly satisfactorily in the recent past and then something changed that either prevent the PC working at all or disables a significant component completely .
At its most extreme , this covers virtually every PC that wo n't boot .
At one time they did boot and now they do n't – that 's IUTWANID .
Less severe examples include the sound suddenly disappearing from games or not being able to connect to the wireless network anymore .
To fix IUTWANID , you need to identify the thing that has changed .
If you 've installed software , try uninstalling it .
Unplug any new hardware , use System Restore to roll back the registry .
Do n't overreact and reformat – that 's effectively rolling back too far .
You 'll need to undo changes in strictly reverse chronological order .
Sometimes – often even – it will seem that nothing has , in fact , changed recently on your system .
This is a common delusion and must be resisted ( or beaten out of you ) .
Remember , it used to work .
The temptation of course , is to assume that some bit in your computer has just broken , spontaneously and for no reason .
This does happen but it 's very , very very rare .
A lot of the reason why computer troubleshooting is so frustrating for most people is because they leap too quickly to a ' something must be broken ' diagnosis and spend ages swapping stuff around inside their system to no effect .
So make sure you have undone every change to your PC first – every software install , every driver update , every patch and every new cable .
If all of that draws a complete and utter blank , you can start cannibalising your other PC for components to begin ruling out broken stuff .
But the snag is that almost everything you swap will require its own drivers and installing these is itself a change to the system .
This is another reason for using this as a last resort .
2. THE ERROR MESSAGE ( " I - GAME " )
Every time something does n't work on your system and instead you get a window that pops up and tries to blame you , we call this an error message .
The standard operating procedure in this kind of situation is to type the error message into Google ( on the spare PC , if necessary ) and see what results come up .
The good thing about error messages is that you can guarantee that at least one other person has already figured out the solution .
The bad thing is that lots of the solutions are idiotic .
Yahoo Answers and Ask.com are frequented by mouth breathers and you should ignore whatever they advise .
Forums attached to games sites are n't generally much better .
What you really want is a hardware or software manufacturer 's forum ; a serious computer site like Ars Technica or Tom 's Hardware or Wikipedia ( or , if you 're truly desperate , you could always try asking the knowledgeable folk at forum.pcformat.co.uk or the TechRadar forums ) .
If you can't find anything from a top - drawer resource like that , try refining your search .
You 'll need to try a different part of the error message as your search string , leaving out those hexadecimal numbers , or putting the numbers back in .
If that does n't work try putting different parts of the message in quotes .
If you get it right , you 'll find a decent hit in the first three pages of Google results .
If it takes more than that to get any solid results , you 're doing it wrong .
Read two or three different forum threads on the topic if you can and do whatever they say fixed the problem for them .
The Blue Screen of Death ( BSOD ) is the limiting case for error messages and if you find yourself facing one , your best resource is going to be Microsoft itself .
First stop should be to take the specific error code for a spin on the Knowledge Base and follow the instructions .
Because a BSOD is pretty catastrophic event , you can also treat this as a kind of IUTWANID instead , if you like .
This is n't usually very productive , though , because it ignores the specific information in the error code , but if the Knowledge Base page is all together far too vague to be of any help at all , and you know you 've changed something recently , this might be the quicker route .
3. IT 'S MORE RUBBISH THAN IT USED TO BE ( " IM - ROOTY - OOTY - BEE " )
" Rubbish " , in this context nearly always means slower , but this category can also be applied to worsening sound quality , sticking keyboards or increasingly noisy fans .
It 's different from IUTWANID , because it refers to a progressive , chronic deterioration .
If you had 80 fps yesterday and only a mere 20 today , that 's IUTWANID , but if you used to be able to play games at acceptable frames rates and nowadays it seems much jerkier , then we call it IMRTIUTB .
The key word in that last sentence is " seems " .
Often slowdown is more about your increasing expectations than decreasing performance .
When your PC is new , you 're excited and predisposed to think well of it , so the thrashing sound of the hard disk feels like the revving of a powerful engine .
That same PC two years later is old and grubby and subconsciously you would love to have an excuse to replace it ; now the hard disk seems to wheeze asthmatically .
Same noise , different spin .
There are two standard responses to IMRTIUTB ; upgrade or reformat and reinstall .
Both are wrong .
Money spent on an upgrade delays the purchase of your next PC and offers much less benefit per pound than a new system .
Upgrading is also like trying to balance a wobbly table ; each new component you add creates a bottleneck or an incompatibility somewhere else and what started as just an extra 1GB of RAM quickly becomes a new motherboard , CPU , graphics card and PSU .
Reformatting and reinstalling seems like it will get you back to the halcyonicity of a new PC , but you have to remember that all the patches , updates and new drivers downloaded since then will still need to be reinstalled and they were responsible for much of the original slowdown .
Instead , IMRTIUTB is best addressed by uninstalling things .
Any game , demo , shareware utility or Internet Explorer toolbar add - on that you do not depend on for your life needs to be removed .
If you have more than eight icons in your System Tray , get rid of half of them .
All software thinks it 's so important that it must run constantly in the background .
This is incorrect .
Whatever it 's doing can wait .
Possibly for eternity .
Any other kind of IMRTIUTB is probably dirt .
Take the lid off , blow away the dust , run your keyboard through the dishwasher and stop eating pizza while you play Crysis .
4. RANDOMLY , A THING HAPPENS ( " WRATH " )
We live in a deterministic universe .
The movement of stars , the radioactive decay of atoms and everything in between is controlled by immutable physical laws .
We just do n't know what all of them are yet .
If your PC crashes , halts , fails or stymies you , every time something else happens , then it 's either IUTWANID or IGAEM .
If it only sometimes happens , what you have is RATH .
From a wide enough perspective , of course , random faults are just deterministic ones whose cause you have n't managed to identify yet .
But some causes are better at appearing random than other causes .
Overheating is the classic example of this .
Your computer mostly works when you turn it on , but somewhere between a few minutes and an hour after that , it reboots or locks up or the graphics goes very peculiar or the sound goes screwy .
Overheating is quite easy to diagnose – rebooting immediately , does n't help but shutting down and leaving it for a while does .
However , other ' random ' influences are harder to isolate : radio frequency interference from nearby electrical equipment ; heavy network traffic ; dry solder joints on circuit boards , broken wires in cables ; power surges in the domestic supply .
Be methodical , write down a hypothesis , devise a test , record the result and repeat the experiment to confi rm your conclusion .
Or , just take it as a sign that it 's time for your next PC .
5. I CAN'T DO THE NEW THING ( " ICY - DONUT " )
We all want to do the ' New Thing ' .
The New Thing is exciting and wonderful .
All the magazines are talking about the New Thing .
Every website has banner ads reminding you that the New Thing will help you meet girls , earn more money and prevent cancer .
The New Thing is good because it 's new .
But the New Thing does n't work on your old PC .
It does n't fit in the slot , has the wrong number of pins , requires too much RAM and gives you unacceptable frame rates .
The New Thing also does n't work in your new PC .
It 's really quite buggy still , requires constant driver updates , does n't let you run in high resolution and causes all your USB ports to stop responding .
Faced with this , most of you will either blame the old PC or the New Thing .
A few may even blame everything on the new PC .
But in fact , the blame lies with you .
It 's your fault for wanting the New Thing .
It 's your fault for thinking you could just install it and skip merrily along .
It 's entirely your fault for believing that the New Thing would be reliable and trouble - free .
This is not the way of the New Thing .
Wherever possible , PCs should only have new software or hardware added in the first year of their lives .
Doing this gives you a reasonable chance that your hardware configuration was considered when the developers were developing .
After that year , you can continue to use your PC , of course ; just do n't add anything new to it .
If the computer is n't connected to the internet , you could , theoretically , stay in this holding pattern forever , but a networked PC will need to download Windows updates at the very least and your orbit will gradually decay .
This , coupled with the fact that you will inevitably occasionally ignore this rule , which will lead to IMRTIUTB over time and when your PC is somewhere between 18 months and three - years - old , you will buy a new one .
This , if you absolutely must , is the time to invest in the New Thing .
Stipulate to the supplier in writing that you are buying the PC for this purpose , thereby making compatibility a condition of sale .
If possible , get the supplier to install the New Thing for you .
Then it's his fault ( and therefore problem ) if you get ICDNT .
The best approach of all , is not to do the New Thing at all .
Wait a while ; six months or a year .
This will turn the New Thing into the Established Thing .
The Established Thing is cheaper and has had the rough edges knocked off it .
And the forums are already full of helpful advice should you run into IGAEM .

A dying star has been caught in the act of resurrecting itself by eating its neighbor .
Together , the stars represent a previously unseen stage in the lifecycle of millisecond pulsars , the fastest - spinning objects in the universe .
" It ’s really a missing link in the chain from young pulsar to old pulsar , " said Anne Archibald , a McGill University graduate student and lead author of the study published in Science Thursday .
Pulsars are a special class of neutron stars , the corpses of massive stars that exploded as supernovae .
They ’re born spinning quickly , up to tens of times per second , and sweep the sky with a beam of radio energy as they rotate .
Eventually , they slow down to the point where they can no longer emit radio waves and die a second death .
But until now , scientists could n't explain how some old , dead pulsars become millisecond pulsars , which rotate hundreds of times a second .
The new discovery of an intermediate step between the two appears to be the missing link .
Astronomers have long theorized that these superfast stars share their orbit with a companion star from which they leech extra material .
The material settles around the pulsar 's middle in a so - called accretion disk .
As material from the disk falls onto the surface of the pulsar , it imparts enough angular momentum to spin back up into what scientists call a " recycled pulsar . "
" We mean it in the same sense as recycling your plastics , " Archibald said .
" These pulsars have died and become invisible and useless to us , but they get brought back to life by getting fed from a companion . "
Astronomers suspect that another type of pulsar - star pair is a way station between normal pulsars and millisecond pulsars .
Called a low - mass X - ray binary , such a system is also made up of a neutron star and an accretion disk , but it does n't emit radio waves .
While the neutron star feeds off its neighbor , the gas flowing between them blocks low - energy radio waves from escaping the system .
But when the accretion disk runs out , the radio waves come back , and astronomers can recognize it as a pulsar .
Until recently , this was only a theory .
But Archibald and an international team using radio telescopes on four continents , stumbled on just such a pulsar right in the middle of this metamorphosis .
The system , called J1023 , was discovered in 2007 when the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia was down for repairs .
The radio telescope could n't be steered to different points in the sky , but resourceful astronomers took data anyway , observing whatever happened to pass overhead .
That survey uncovered a millisecond pulsar about 4,000 light years away , spinning 592 times per second .
But this was n't the first time this system caught astronomers ' attention .
Another survey in 1999 missed the pulsar but identified its companion as a sun- like star .
When they looked again with radio telescopes in 2000 , they saw evidence for an accretion disk around a neutron star .
By 2002 , the accretion disk had disappeared , but the neutron star was still not emitting radio waves as would be expected of a pulsar .
It was only the 2007 observations that pinned it down as a millisecond pulsar .
Astronomers had managed to catch the system changing over the course of 10 years , an eye blink on astronomical timescales .
" This is a completely new thing , seeing it go from one state to another , " said co-author Maura McLaughlin of West Virginia University .
" We ’ve never seen that before , ever . "
Aside from proving that recycled pulsars form through cannibalism , J1023 provides a living laboratory for studying how these systems evolve .
" Studying this system will teach us an awful lot about the recycling process , " McLaughlin said .
" We may see the radio pulsations disappear and come back again a year from now .
There are lots of neat things we can do . "
" It ’s a bit of a landmark in tying together what we think happens in these dead stars , " said Don Backer , an astronomer at the University of California , Berkeley and one of the discoverers of the first millisecond pulsar .
" You can see the transitions and understand more about how both of these stars work .
That ’s a great deal of fun . "

• Building ban is torn up so canton can lure wealthy • Critics say special zones are ' a form of apartheid '
The plans of a Swiss canton to attract the super - rich by offering them the chance to buy property in exclusive , previously out of bounds locations has sparked a political row and accusations that the country is encouraging apartheid of the rich and poor .
The canton of Obwalden is planning to launch " special living zones " for millionaires in an attempt to boost its tax take by luring the wealthiest residents .
Like other cantons in the tax haven , Obwalden finds itself short of revenue because it has been competing with other jurisdictions to see who can offer the lowest rate of tax .
The result has been a drastic shortfall in tax revenues as people set up PO box companies to take advantage of the low rates , while contributing nothing to the local economies because they live elsewhere .
Obwalden 's answer is to lift construction bans on land reserved for agricultural use , offering the rich the chance to secure property on protected land , with the promise of spectacular views of lake and alpine landscapes .
Details of Obwalden 's plan , published in the Swiss press , suggest selling villas on an exclusive basis to those who pay high taxes or who create work in the area – " a sunny location , with low noise emissions , good amenities … as well as an unrestricted view that cannot be built on " .
The homes would be constructed on land not usually accessible to ordinary citizens , leading to accusations that the policy discriminates against less wealthy inhabitants while rewarding the rich .
" These special living zones are nothing less than a form of apartheid , " said Moritz Leuenberger , of the Social Democrats , who is Switzerland 's environment and transport minister .
" Is a racing car driver of so much more use than a nurse ? " he asked , referring to the rich personalities such as Michael Schumacher who have moved to Switzerland to take advantage of its favourable tax laws .
Many argue that the drive to draw in the rich is destroying communities as normal earners are forced out by rising prices .
Obwaldeners are likely to get the chance to vote on the special zones policy in a referendum later this year .
Farmers and the Green party have joined the campaign to stop the special zones .
But Obwalden 's decision makers have hit back at the criticisms , arguing that those who have the money should have a wider choice .
" Swiss Railways offers a first class with more comfort and more space , " said Obwalden 's finance director , Hans Wallimann .
" There 's also the second class where I have less space , but I pay half the amount .
Is that so unfair ? "
Obwalden reduced its taxes by a quarter three years ago , bringing corporate tax down to 6.6 % and local income tax down to 1.8 % in reaction to pressure from its inhabitants – 90 % voted in favour of the move in a referendum .
It also introduced a flat tax rate , meaning that a millionaire chief executive pays the same percentage of tax as a toilet attendant .
While on paper it appears that 400 new companies moved to the area as a result of the changes , most are nothing more than PO box companies .
They fail to offer employment to locals or boost consumer spending in the region .
why you should think before ranting
According to an anti-science demagogue , teaching evolution and being an atheist is banned by law .
I ’m not sure why an American far right pundit wannabe , Timothy Birdnow , is writing in a Canadian conservative publication about how much he hates atheists , but apparently he is .
And his thesis is not a lot saner than the story of a father threatening to report his daughter to the FBI for being an atheist .
According to Birdnow , the Constitution does n’t allow atheists to be atheists since it only specifies freedom of religion not freedom from religion .
Clearly , the man is not exactly what you ’d call the brightest legal mind in the nation , to put it mildly .
He also is n’t good at editing his articles because after insisting that atheism and unbelief are n’t protected by law , he tries to turn atheism into a full blown religion with the following strained attempt at logic …
Atheism worships ( they hate that word ) the Cosmos , Evolution , and Reason .
The Big Bang and Darwinian Evolution are the creation myths , and the Big Crunch the prophecied [ sic ] cataclysm .
You know , I ’ve never encountered an atheist who prays to a picture of Darwin or a poster from a physics class with a graphic of the Big Bang .
I ’ve never seen an incantation over The Origin of the Species or a homily after the reading of A Brief History of Time .
There ’s also no building where atheists gather once a week to recite or memorize passages from the latest papers on astrophysics and evolutionary biology .
So where ’s the worship and the ritual ?
Oh and the whole thing about the Big Crunch as the doomsday cataclysm ?
At the rate that our universe is expanding , it seems very , very unlikely that it would actually happen .
The current mainstream idea of how the universe will end involves the observable cosmos running out of fuel over trillions of years .
If you ’re going to make comparisons , at lest try to get your cataclysms right .
But his argument gets even stranger …
Oh , I know ; these are scientific concepts and not simply faith - based stories .
So then what ’s your point ?
If you know these are n’t just tall tales , what are you complaining about and why are you comparing them to myths written sometime during the bronze age ?
The evidence for all those scientific concepts are repeatable , observable facts .
The evidence for the Bible is people demanding that we accept it as a true account and an accurate transcription of conversations with a supernatural entity .
Sorry but when the facts are in front of me , I ’m temped to go by the facts .
But that ’s just what Birdnow expects and counters with …
Of course , this means that the ultimate questions of where this random , mechanistic universe came from cannot be answered .
God is as good of an answer as any , but most atheists simply insist there can be none and believe in a mechanical universe that generated spontaneously with physical laws balanced just right for the evolution of life and human consciousness .
If you believe you ca n’t answer the question of where the universe came from and decide to invoke a creature for which we have no evidence in any way , shape or form other than philosophical musings of your fans , you are intellectually lazy .
God is not as good an answer as any because we have no proof for an all knowing and omnipotent creature creating the cosmos .
Hell , if we need to use magic to make a theory work , that theory is just wishful thinking .
And the whole idea that the laws of physics are balanced just right for evolution and for human consciousness ?
Nonsense according to physicists .
There are plenty of other things I could mention in Birdnow ’s long , tedious , grossly uninformed rant which has so much hatred and passion emptied into it , one can imagine him foaming at the mouth and barking while he pounded this fiery mini-screed into his keyboard .
But it ’s probably best that I leave it at this .
Just because you write in a way that makes readers imagine you leaping out of the screen and trying to beat them over the head with something heavy , does n’t give your arguments a single shred of validity .

A segment on yesterday ’s Glenn Beck show on Fox News was supposed to be about the Rev. Pat Robertson giving Americans financial advice , but it turned into a discussion of why the government can’t make people donate to charity , and how Obama in injecting socialism into the nation .
Here is the video from Media Matters :

Beck said , “ I guess my problem is our government now believes that they can force our government to be charitable , and also that they can stop all greed through regulation .
Pat , I think there is only one cure for both of those .
You ca n’t do that .
Is n’t that the point of faith and religion and everything else , not government , but our faith to make us better people . ”
Robertson replied , “ Until a person ’s heart is changed , until the inner motive is changed , we ’re not going to have different conduct , and there is no government big enough to enforce that kind of conduct .
It ca n’t do it .
It was said by John Adams we do n’t have a government or constitution capable of taming the animal passions of mankind .
You ca n’t do that with government , and these socialists think you can . ”
Robertson later said , “ Franklin Roosevelt used the Great Depression to bring forth a dramatic change in the way we lived our lives .
Obama and his crew are taking advantage of this to insert socialism and government control .
He wind up taking over the automobile industry , the banking industry , and before long healthcare .
It ’s a massive power grab to satisfy the left . ”
Think about this for a second , one man in this conversation , Robertson ,
has made himself rich through charitable donations , yet he arguing against the government encouraging charity .
The other man in this conversation is complaining about socialism , yet he has gotten very wealthy by broadcasting radio and television programs overly publicly owned airwaves .
People often forget that the public still owns the airwaves , no matter who owns the station .
This is how the FCC has maintained regulatory authority .
Only Glenn Beck and Pat Robertson could take a segment about giving financial advice , and turn it into an anti-Obama tirade .
What is the heck would Pat Robertson be doing giving financial advice to anyone ?
What does he know ?
Without people giving him money , he would n’t have anything .
By the way , Beck and Robertson that the “ this ” Obama is supposed to be exploiting is the total collapse of the economy brought about by years of destructive Republican policies .
Also , Obama did n’t take over the banking industry , Bush did , but this is something that has been conveniently forgotten by Republicans .
Whatever you did to the video you ruined it .
The original menu music is way too loud and endlessly loops over the dialogue .
Please fix it .
And the Republicans want to follow whom ?
After losing big the past two election cycles ?
Folks , well , Republicans listen up .
Cheney and Limbaugh do n't really care or give a damn , this publicity is all about their OWN AGENDA .
For Cheney , trying to clean up his image , garner a book deal .
Does anyone think after all we know NOW that Cheney is credible ?
Please .
For Limbaugh , it is all about the ratings for his fanatical radio show .
Why would this man really care ?
This is a man sitting on a 400 million dollar contract ?
His job is to keep controversy up .
Since he has not made much headway with Democrats , he is stirring his own Republican pot and calling out Republicans and stating who is a Republican and who is not .
If you are going to be that gullible to listen to these gasbags , carry on .
Soon , you will only be a southern regional party , which is want is happening already .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey , released Monday , suggests that 70 percent have a favorable opinion of Powell , who was Secretary of State during President George W. Bush 's first term , and who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian Gulf War .
Only 30 percent of those polled have a favorable view of Limbaugh , the popular conservative radio talk show host , with 53 percent saying they hold an unfavorable opinion .
In poll numbers released Thursday , 37 percent say they have a favorable opinion of Dick Cheney , with 55 percent indicating they hold an unfavorable view of the former vice president .
Among Republicans , it 's a different story .
The poll suggests that 66 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of Cheney , 64 percent give Powell a thumbs up , and 62 view Limbaugh in a favorable way .
Republicans may love Rush , but Republicans can't win with just Republican votes .
It was antics by the Limbaughs of your party that ran everyone away , especially the independents , to voting Obama .
If you can not see the handwriting on the wall , hey , the wilderness must be lovely for the next 20 years .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The federal government ran a deficit in April for the first time in 26 years , pushing the red ink so far this budget year to a record $ 802.3 billion .
The Treasury Department said Tuesday the deficit for April was $ 20.9 billion , a sharp contrast from the surplus of $ 159.3 billion in the same month last year .
It also was slightly more than the $ 20 billion deficit economists had expected .
For the budget year that began Oct. 1 , the imbalance totals $ 802.3 billion , keeping the country on track to register the first $ 1 trillion annual deficit in U.S . history .
And the Obama administration made an accounting change on bailout payments or the deficit already would have been at nearly $ 1 trillion .
The administration on Monday raised its deficit estimate for the year to $ 1.84 trillion , from the $ 1.75 trillion it estimated less than two months ago .
The government normally runs surpluses in April as Treasury 's coffers swell with people paying their annual tax bills by the April 15 deadline .
But the deficit is being driven higher by the billions of dollars being spent to rescue the financial system from its worst crisis since the 1930s and deal with the worst recession in decades .
The recession also has boosted government outlays for benefit programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps while slashing tax revenues .
The administration made revisions to the deficits reported from October through March to reflect a change in how it was accounting for the bailout payments .
The Bush administration recorded each payment to a bank or auto company getting bailout support on a dollar - for - dollar basis .
However , the Obama administration said it was changing the accounting process to a " net present value " basis , which means it assumes that the government is getting an asset when it provides loans to the banks and auto companies .
Based on the new accounting method , the size of the deficit from October through March fell about $ 175 billion .
Through the first seven months of this budget year , the government has collected $ 1.26 trillion in receipts , a drop of 18.9 % from a year ago .
Outlays totaled $ 2.058 trillion , a record for the first seven months of a budget year and up 20.9 % from a year ago .
The deficit of $ 802.3 billion compares with an imbalance of $ 153.5 billion through the first seven months of last year .
Economists are worried the government 's huge borrowing needs will trigger steep increases in interest rates if domestic and foreign investors start demanding a larger return for holding Treasury debt .
But so far the big increase in the supply of Treasury securities has occurred at a time when interest rates have been pushed lower by heavy demand for what investors see as super - safe investments during a time of high anxiety about other types of debt .
Under the administration 's new budget estimates , the $ 1.84 trillion deficit for this year will be followed by a $ 1.26 trillion deficit in 2010 and will never dip below $ 500 billion over the next decade .
The administration estimates the deficits from 2010 to 2019 will total $ 7.1 trillion .
The current record deficit was the $ 454.8 billion imbalance recorded last year .

In all , states will face a $ 121 billion budget gap in the coming fiscal year , according to a recent report by the National Conference of State Legislatures , compared with $ 102.4 billion for this fiscal year .
The recession has also proved politically damaging for a number of governors , not least Jon Corzine of New Jersey , whose Republican opponent in this year ’s race for governor has tried to make inroads by blaming the state ’s economic woes on him .
Mr. Schwarzenegger , who sailed into office on a wave of popularity in 2003 , will leave in 2011  barred by term limits from running again  under the cloud of the nation ’s worst budget crisis .
And the bleak economy has played a major role in the waning popularity of Gov. David A. Paterson of New York .
Over all , personal income tax collections are down by about 6.6 percent compared with last year , according to a survey by Mr. Pattison ’s group and the National Governors Association .
Sales tax collections are down by 3.2 percent , the survey found , and corporate income tax revenues by 15.2 percent .
( Although New Jersey announced last week that a tax amnesty program had brought in an unexpected $ 400 million  a windfall that caused lawmakers to reconsider some of the deeper cuts in a $ 28.6 billion budget they were set to approve in advance of the July 1 deadline . )
As a result , governors have recommended increasing taxes and fees by some $ 24 billion for the coming fiscal year , the survey found .
This is on top of more than $ 726 million they sought in new revenues this year .
The proposals include increases in personal income tax rates  Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania has proposed raising the state ’s income tax by more than 16 percent , to 3.57 percent from 3.07 percent , for three years  and tax increases on myriad consumer goods .
“ They have done a fair amount of cutting and will probably do some more , ” said Ray Scheppach , executive director of the governors association .
“ But as they look out over the next two or three years , they are also aware that when this federal money stops coming , there is going to be a cliff out there . ”
Raising revenues is the surest way to ensure financial stability after the stimulus money disappears , Mr. Scheppach added , saying , “ You ’re better off to take all the heat at once and do it in one package that gets you through the next two , three or four years . ”
It ’s bucketing down , up to 10 times faster than was thought possible ( Image : Julio Lopez Saguar / Photonica / Getty )
Many raindrops travel at “ super - terminal ” velocities , faster than was thought possible .
As a result , meteorologists may be miscalculating how much it rains .
Previously , it was assumed that all raindrops fall at terminal velocity , a constant maximum speed that is determined by the interplay of gravity and drag .
The velocity for individual drops is considered to be largely controlled by their size : larger drops fall faster than smaller drops , due to their greater mass .
Fernando García - García of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and colleagues measured the shadows of natural raindrops passing through a ray of infrared light .
They found that up to half exceed their terminal velocity .
Some travel as much as 10 times faster , for their size .

Broken drops
“ Others had detected this before , but everybody disregarded it , blaming it on an error , ” says Garcia - Garcia .
The team suspects that the super - terminal drops may be fragments of larger drops broken apart as they fall .
“ If a large drop breaks into several fragments , each drop will have the speed of the large drop , at least temporarily , until the smaller drops slow to their new terminal velocity , ” García - García says .
As a result , meteorologists may be overestimating total rainfall by up to 20 per cent , say the team .
Weather forecasters use total rainfall figures to predict floods , and climatologists use the estimates to gauge how rain patterns are changing with climate change .
Rain radar
Total rainfall over an area is generally calculated indirectly , by using a Doppler radar that bounces electromagnetic waves off the raindrops .
The radar can measure rainfall over thousands of square kilometres .
But the radar records only the speed of drops .
This is then used to infer the average size of the drops .
This is then multiplied by the number of drops to give a total volume of water .
“ If you get a signal back and see drops are moving quickly , you assume they are big drops , but in reality they are small drops moving faster , ” says Garcia - Garcia .
Ana Barros of Duke University in Durham , North Carolina , says meteorologists ’ rainfall estimates are unlikely to be too far wrong , pointing out that the super - terminal drops would soon slow down after fragmenting from larger drops .

Oh noes !
None of the right wing talking points that Roger Ailes has been distributing to his minions seems to be taking hold .
Despite their best effort to throw all sorts of poo at the president , Obama still appears to be very popular with the American people .
What 's a RNC propaganda outlet to do ?
Declare that the mainstream media is in bed with Obama , naturally .
WALLACE : So let ’s go over the record , and let ’s put it up on the screen .
CBS is running an interview today with Barack Obama , “ An American Dad . ” ABC is running coverage throughout the day on Wednesday of President Obama ’s health care plan including a prime - time town hall .
NBC just ran two specials , “ Inside the Obama White House . ”
Tom Brokaw was named this week to a presidential commission .
And Newsweek has put Mr. Obama on the cover 19 times since 2004 .
Steve Hayes , how do you explain all of that ?
HAYES : A lot of people call Newsweek now “ Obamaweek ” because they ’ve put him on so often .
Look , I mean , clearly , his joke about rolling over and finding Brian Williams is more than just a joke .
I mean , I think the sense is -- and you ’ve provided evidence that it ’s true -- that he ’s in bed -- the media are in bed with Barack Obama .
Wow .
The media is covering the " leader of the free world " !
That 's some seriously deviant and ideologically - driven behavior ... right ?
Right ?
Or maybe not so much .
Aside from the Freudian implications of using the " in bed with " metaphor , I 'm curious when Fox News decided they were n't mainstream .
Have n't they been insisting that the country is right and they are correctly reflecting the country 's values ?
But the general lack of self - examination is comical .
Fox News -- who never met a Bushie that they did n't kneel before and service -- thinks the media is too kind to Obama ?
Uh right .
That 's why we had stories within the first month all over the media debating whether the honeymoon was over ?
Even Mara Liasson , no big friend to the administration , admits that the comparison to the favorable coverage of Bush and Clinton is not entirely fair , since Bush was still embroiled in the aftermath of his contested ascension ( and taking vacation days ) and Clinton flubbed up badly , pushing too aggressive an agenda .
But Wallace does n't want taint this smear with any actual facts :
LIASSON : On the other hand , some of those numbers are reflective of -- look , Bill Clinton had an incredibly chaotic first 100 days .
There was a pratfall every other day to cover .
George Bush was the result of -- I ’m assuming that was the first term -- was the result of ...
WALLACE : Yes .
LIASSON : ... a contested election .
And Barack Obama came in as a real majority winner .
He has a big majority in Congress .
WALLACE : Oh , come on , do n't you think some of it is because he ’s got liberal ideas ?
Does Wallace not realize that by characterizing this all as being mainstream -- the love of Obama 's " liberal " ideas ( and as a liberal , I wish he was way MORE liberal ) and the monolithic media that love him -- he is de facto admitting that Fox is out of the mainstream ?
Damn conservatives , their logic fails them every time .
WALLACE : And that was President Obama at a dinner with reporters Friday making his own joke about what many believe is a sweetheart relationship between the White House and the mainstream media .
And we ’re back now with Stephen , Mara , Byron and Juan .
So let ’s go over the record , and let ’s put it up on the screen .
CBS is running an interview today with Barack Obama , “ An American Dad . ”
ABC is running coverage throughout the day on Wednesday of President Obama ’s health care plan including a prime - time town hall .
NBC just ran two specials , “ Inside the Obama White House . ”
Tom Brokaw was named this week to a presidential commission .
And Newsweek has put Mr. Obama on the cover 19 times since 2004 .
Steve Hayes , how do you explain all of that ?
HAYES : A lot of people call Newsweek now “ Obamaweek ” because they ’ve put him on so often .
Look , I mean , clearly , his joke about rolling over and finding Brian Williams is more than just a joke .
I mean , I think the sense is -- and you ’ve provided evidence that it ’s true -- that he ’s in bed -- the media are in bed with Barack Obama .
I do n’t think there ’s any question that he ’s had better treatment than any president in recent memory , in decades .
WALLACE : And why do you think that is ?
HAYES : Well , I think there are two reasons .
One , I think people are genuinely cheering for him .
I mean , I think this -- he is breaking barriers , and there ’s something genuinely exciting about that that journalists are not supposed to allow to affect their coverage , but they do .
And secondly , there ’s a clear ideological affinity for Barack Obama and his programs .
And we ’ve seen that in the discussions of -- in the debates that have taken place over the first six months .
I mean , think about the torture debate .
There ’s a debate about the language to be used there .
Is it enhanced interrogations or is it torture ?
And everybody , with unanimity , across the media call it torture .
They ’ve made a decision .
There ’s a debate going on .
They ’re not part of it .
They ’re on one side of it .
WALLACE : Let me add something to this , Mara .
It is n’t just the amount of coverage .
It ’s also the tone .
And let ’s put up on the screen a recent analysis that was done of Obama ’s first 100 days in media coverage .
Forty - two percent of the coverage of Obama ’s first 100 days has been positive , as compared to 22 percent for George W. Bush in his first 100 days , and 27 percent for Bill Clinton .
Again , how come ?
LIASSON : Look , I think that there ’s definitely something to this kind of aura of incredible celebrity and excitement .
And you know , you go to any newsstand , and it ’s a sea of Obama faces , and then there ’s a shelf for Bo and another shelf for Michelle , but -- and people are truly fascinated .
On the other hand , some of those numbers are reflective of -- look , Bill Clinton had an incredibly chaotic first 100 days .
There was a pratfall every other day to cover .
George Bush was the result of -- I ’m assuming that was the first term -- was the result of ...
WALLACE : Yes .
LIASSON : ... a contested election .
And Barack Obama came in as a real majority winner .
He has a big majority in Congress .
WALLACE : Oh , come on , do n't you think some of it is because he ’s got liberal ideas ?
LIASSON : Yes , there ’s Definitely some of it .
But when he starts -- when his programs run into trouble , there was a headline in the New York Times next week , you know , “ Obama ’s Plans Hit , ” you know , “ Obstacles , ” or , “ Snags . ” I mean , when there is opposition , it should be and I think is covered by the media .
And it ’s hard to talk about the media as just one thing , because it ’s not .
He is popular .
And I think as soon as things turn for him , the media , like lemmings , will turn , too , unfortunately .
WALLACE : Byron ?
YORK : You know , this has led to a certain undertone of contempt from Obama to the press .
Did you --
I felt that in the Brian Williams joke and at the earlier White House Correspondents Dinner .
Obama said , “ Most of you covered me .
All of you voted for me . ”
But the Pew poll that you mentioned earlier about the positive coverage said that in this case , in Obama ’s case , as was not the case with Bush or Clinton , an enormous amount of the coverage focused on the president ’s personal characteristics , his personal appeal , rather than his policy stuff , what he actually wants to do .
And the question and the test for the press is going to come this summer where we do have a huge debate over health care .
I guess ABC has voted already .
But we are going to have a huge debate over health care , and will they really cover specifically what it is he wants to do ?

Turley : Spanish courts may be building case against Cheney
David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
According to constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley , the prosecution of Bush ’s so - called “ torture lawyers ” might just give Spanish prosecutors the “ low lying fruit ” needed to bring a case against Vice President Cheney .
Appearing on Monday night ’s edition of MSNBC ’s Countdown with Keith Olbermann , George Washington University law professor Turley said that although President Obama is “ protecting ” the former administration from prosecution , the Spanish investigation could serve as a point of leverage .
By targeting attorneys who wrote legal justifications for torture , said Turley , prosecutors are going “ for the first line of defendants . ”
“ And then if you have a case , you go for the higher ones , ” he added .
Referencing Seymor Hersh ’s allegation that an “ executive assassination ring ” reported directly to the former Vice President — and the apparent confirmation of the allegation ’s veracity by a former Cheney aide — Olbermann wondered , “ Should the Spanish prosecutors be taking notes ? ” ”
“ It ’s well known the Obama administration is protecting President Bush and Vice President Cheney from criminal investigation , ” he concluded .
“ And if he went after the two of them , the U.S. government could move aggressively to shut down the inquiry . ”

Version Control for Designers
このドキュメントは Version Control for Designers の日本語訳であり、元のドキュメントと同じくソースコード管理に予備知識がまったくない人を想定している
Published on : 2009-06 - 23
はじめに
What have you done for me lately ?
バージョン管理、ソース管理やリビジョン管理とも呼ばれているものはあらゆる開発に必須である。なぜなら基本的にはメールやインスタント・メッセンジャーと同じようなコミュニケーションをとることができるツールでありながら、人々の会話ではなくソースコードを元にして機能することができるからだ。
バージョン管 理
他のプログラマと簡単に意思の疎通を図ることができる
開発チームでコードを共有することができる
デプロイしている「製品」バージョンを別個にメンテナンスできる
同じコードをベースにして同時に別々の機能を開発できる
全ての古いバージョンのファイルを追跡できる
作業が上書き ( 変更ではなく ) されることがな い
バージョン管理とは何か
バージョン管理、リビジョン管理またはソース・コード管理としても知られているもの、は累積する開発の各段階におけるファイルの変更を保存して維持するシステムである。バージョン管理システムはファイルをバックアップするシステムと同じ原理であるが、もっと賢い。システムの管理下にある全てのファイルは完全な変更の履歴を持ち、その履歴の任意のバージョンへ簡単に戻すことができる。その各バージョンはアルファベットと数字で構成されたユニークな識別子 ( 443e63e6 .. ) を持っている。
バージョン管理には様々なソフトウェアがある。この文書では
Git を使って解説しているが、他にも Subversion や CVS 、 Darcs 、 Mercurial など色々ある。それぞれの違いはわずかな操作法の違いでしかない。
リポジトリの構 造
最も単純なバージョン管理システムは、全てのファイルとそのバージョンが格納されているリポジトリで構成されている。リポジトリとは簡単に言えばデータベースのようなもので、その管理下にあるあらゆるファイルを任意のバージョンに戻すことができたり、任意のファイルの変更履歴であったり、プロジェクト全体の変更履歴であったりする。
# 25 Joe Adjust user profile information # 24 Fred Add login box # 23 Mary Allow user photo uploads # 22 Joe Change the color of the header to yellow # 21 Mary Change the header to blue
リポジトリのユーザーは、変更を加えることができる最新のファイル群のコピーである作業コピーをチェックアウトすることができる。いくつかの変更を加えた後、チェックインまたはコミットすることによって変更をリポジトリに反映させると、変更されたファイルや変更を加えたユーザーなどについてのメタ・データと共に新しいバージョンが作成される。
基準になるリポジトリがあることは単純明快ではあるが、必須というわけではない。各ユーザーがリポジトリの完全なコピーを自身のマシンに持っていても良い。一般的には、自身のローカル・リポジトリに変更をコミットし、一段落したら開発チームが共有するリポジトリにプッシュする。他のリポジトリから変更をプルすることもできる。
ブランチ
ブランチはメールを書くときの下書きのような役目を果たす。下書きを書いている時、完成するまでこまめに保存するだろう。そして完成したら、メールを送信し下書きを削除する。こういった場合、メールを送信するまでに下書きを頻繁に更新してもメーラーの送信トレイが下書きであふれてしまうなどということはない。
ブランチを切ることは新しい機能を開発する時に役に立つ。なぜなら master ブランチ ( メーラーの送信トレイにあたる ) は常にきちんと機能するままなので、デプロイできる状態を維持できるからだ。いくつもの下書き
( 実験的なブランチ ) を必要なだけ開発中に作成することもできるだろう。ブランチは簡単に作成でき、かつ簡単に切り替えることができる。
ブランチでのコーディングが完了し、そのブランチがテストを通ったなら、変更を master ブランチにマージし、メールの下書きのようにブランチを削除することができる。また、もし誰かが master ブランチにコードをコミットした時も、最新の master のコードにブランチを簡単に更新することができる 。
作業の流 れ
Attack of the clones
作業コピーをベースになるコードから取得するには、リモート・リポジトリを自身のマシンへクローンする必要がある。クローンすることによってリポジトリが作成され
HEAD として参照されている最新のバージョンがチェックアウトされる。
まず、オープン・ソースのプロジェクトをクローンしてみよう。
$ git clone git://github.com/wycats/jspec.git
Initialized empty Git repository
これで最初のリポジトリをクローンできた。 clone コマンドはいくつかの便利な機能を提供する。元になったリポジトリのアドレスを保存したり、それに対して origin という名前でエイリアスを張ったりなどだ。これらの便利な機能によって
( 適切な権限を持っているのならば ) 変更をリモートのリポジトリに反映させることが簡単にできるようになっている。
カレント・ディレクトリに jspec という名前のディレクトリが作成されているだろう。 cd でそのディレクトリに移動すれば、 JSpec のソース・コード ( いくつかのファイルだけだが ) の中身を見ることができる 。
Git は先ほど利用した " git :/ / " プロトコル ( 多くの公開プロジェクト は git:// を使用している ) を初めとして、様々なプロトコルをサポートしている。デフォルトで
Git はリモート・リポジトリに安全にアクセスしてもらうために ssh プロトコルを使用する 。
$ git clone user@yourserver.com :thing.git
上記のようにして ssh 認証情報を設定してアクセスすることができる 。
変更を加え る
以上で作業コピーは手に入ったので、ファイルに変更を加えることができるようになった。ファイルの編集に特別なことは何もなく、ファイルを編集し保存するだけだ。一旦ファイルを保存したなら、現在のリビジョンに変更したことを追加する必要がある
( または、大抵はそうするが、いくつかのファイルに変更を加えた後にまとめて追加する) 。そうするには git add で変更したファイルを指定する。これを 「 ステージに追加する ( staging ) 」と言う 。
$ git add index.html
あるディレクトリ全体をステージに追加するには以下のように指定する。
$ git add public /
これは public / にある全てのファイルをステージに追加する。カレント・ディレクトリをステージに追加するには以下のように指定する。
$ git add .
もしステージに追加した後 ( コミットする前 ) にそのファイルに何かしらの変更を加えた場合、もう一度 git add する必要があ る
git status コマンドはリポジトリの現在の状態を表示する 。
ninja - owl : public courtenay $ git status #
On branch master # Changes to be committed : # ( use " git reset HEAD < file > ... " to unstage ) # # modified : public /index.html #
git diff コマンドは差分を表示する。デフォルトではまだステージに追加されていないファイルの変更の差分も表示するが、
-- cached オプションを付けると、ステージに追加されたファイルの変更の差分のみを表示する。
ninja - owl : public courtenay $ git diff -- cached diff -- git a/public/index.html. b/public/index.html index a04759f..754492a 100644 --- a/public/index.html +++ b/public/index.html @@ - 8,7 +8,6 @@ revision control or source code management , is a system that maintains versions +
This a line that I added to the file - This is a line I removed from the file
このような出力は diff や patch と呼ばれており、これを共同開発者にメールで送信して、その人のローカルのコードに変更を適用してもらうこともできる。ファイル名や行番号、 + と - の記号による変更の表示をしてくれるので、人間が読んで理解できるものでもある。また、この差分をファイルにパイプで出力することもできる。
ninja - owl : public courtenay $ git diff -- cached > line_modify .patch
Commit to something in your life
好きなように変更を加えた後にファイルをステージに追加したなら、次にその変更を自身のローカルなリポジトリへコミットすることになる。そうするには git commit コマンドを実行する。このコマンドを実行すると、変更を加えたファイルの一覧に先頭に空白行を加えたテキスト・ファイルがテキスト・エディタで開かれる。その空白行には、共同開発者が一目で自分が変更した内容を把握できるように具体的に変更した内容を記述する必要がある。「何か」というような漠然としたものよりは詳しく書く必要はあるが、以下のように極端に詳しく書く必要はない。
Changed line 434 in index.html to use spaces rather than tabs .
Changed line 800 in products .
html.erb to have two spaces between the tags .
Changed line 343 , 133 , 203 , 59 , and 121 to have two spaces at the start rather than 9 .
変更した内容の短い概要で十分なので、簡潔なコミット・メッセージを書くのがコツである。
Minor formatting changes in the code .
1 行目に 80 文字以下で概要を書き、 2 行目に空白行、 3 行目に詳しい内容を書いたりもできる。 2 行目と 3 行目は必須ではない 。
コミット・メッセージを書き終わったなら、保存しテキスト・エディタを終了させる。すると自身のローカル・リポジトリにコミットされ、開発作業に戻ることができる。
Push back
ローカル・リポジトリに変更をコミットしたなら、次はリモート・リポジトリ、誰でも作業コピーを取得することができる基準になるリポジトリ、にプッシュする
( 変更を反映させる ) ことになる。そのためには git push コマンドを実行する。このコマンドは自身のローカル・リポジトリにコミットされた変更を全てリモート・リポジトリに反映させる。
Git の push コマンドは git push < repository > < branch >
というように複数のパラメータを取る。クローンした場合、元になったリポジトリには既に origin という名前でエイリアスが張られている。それに対して master ブランチをプッシュするので以下のように実行する。
$ git push origin master
git push コマンド ( と git pull コマンド ) はデフォルトでローカル・リポジトリと元になったリポジトリの双方に存在する全てのブランチをプッシュする ( またはプルする ) ので、パラメータは省略することもできる。
git push コマンドを実行すると以下のように表示される 。
your - computer : git_project yourusername$ git push updating ' refs/heads/master ' from fdbdfe28397738d0d42eaca59c6866a87a0336e2 to 1c9ec11f757c099680336875b825f817a992333e
Also local refs / remotes / origin / master Generating pack ...
Done counting 2 objects .
Deltifying 2 objects ... 100 % ( 2/2 ) done Writing 2 objects ... 100 % ( 2/2 ) done Total 2 ( delta 3 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) refs/ heads / master : fdbdfe28397738d0d42eaca59c6866a87a0336e2 ->
1c9ec11f757c099680336875b825f817a992333e
この出力は、プッシュする準備が整ったこと ( Generating pack ) や、リモート・リポジトリがファイルを受け取ったこと
( Writing 2 objects ) を教えてくれる。そしてリモート・リポジトリの head / master ( リポジトリのデフォルトのブランチ ) を更新して、今コミットしたリビジョンを参照するようにしている。これで誰もがローカルの作業コピーを更新して、コミットした変更が反映されたコードへ同期させることができるようになる。
Get updates from afar
自身のローカル・リポジトリと作業コピーをリモート・リポジトリへコミットされた最新のものへ更新するには、 git pull コマンドを実行する。このコマンドはリモート・リポジトリから全ての変更点をダウンロードして、自身のローカル・リポジトリに加えた変更とマージする ( 変更点があるなら ) 。
git pull コマンドを実行すると、以下のように表示される。
remote : Generating pack ... remote : Done counting 12 objects .
remote : Result has 8 objects .
remote : Deltifying 8 objects ... remote : 100 % ( 8/8 ) done Unpacking 8 objects ... remote : Total 8 ( delta 4 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) 100 % ( 8/8 ) done * refs / remotes / origin / master : fast forward to branch ' master ' of git@yourco.com :git_project old..new : 0c793fd..fdbdfe2 Auto - merged file.cpp

基本的には push コマンドと反対の動作をする。リモート・リポジトリの準備が整ったら
( Generating pack ) 、自身のローカル・リポジトリへ変更された点を転送する
( Unpacking 8 objects )
。これでローカル・リポジトリに自分でコミットした変更と同じように変更が反映される
( ローカルで例のよう に file.cpp をマージした時や、 .gitignore や your_file.txt を作成した時のように ) 。
.gitignore : .gitignore ファイルは
Git に特定のファイルやディレクトリを無視させる時に利用する。コンパイルされたバイナリやログ・ファイル、パスワードを含むファイルに対して使うと良い。
ブランチを切 る
必ず作業を開始する前にブランチを切るべきである。そうすれば master は常にきちんと動作する状態を維持でき、他の開発者たちが行う変更とは独立して作業することができる。ブランチを作成すると、 master ブランチをクローンし、そのクローンしたブランチにコミットできるようになる。そして作業が完了したら、そのブランチでの変更点を master ブランチにマージすることもできる。もし master ブランチに何かしらの変更を加えていた場合は、その変更も含めてまとめてマージすることができる。プッシュやプルと同じような形ではあるが、ブランチは同じディレクトリの中で完結する。以下は以上のプロセスを図解したものである。
ブランチを切ることは、同じコードに対して複数の人間が同時に別々に作業する必要がある時などに威力を発揮する。大幅なコードのリファクタリングやウェブ・サイトのリデザインといったような恒久的な結果をもたらすようなことから、パフォーマンスのテストといったような一時的な変更まで、様々なケースで利用することができる。
ブランチの作 成
Git でブランチを作成するには、 git checkout - b < branch name >
を実行する。すると更新されているファイルがリストアップされ、 redesign ブランチがチェックアウトされる。
$ git checkout -b redesign M public / index .html Switched to a new branch " redesign "
master ブランチに戻るには、パラメータで master だけを指定する 。
$ git checkout master M public / index .html Switched to a new branch " master "
他の開発者にそのブランチでの変更をプルできるように、リモート・リポジトリにもブランチを作成することができる。
$ git push origin redesign
また、現在のブランチを名前を変えてリモートへプッシュすることもできる。
$ git push origin redesign : master
これは現在の作業コピーをローカルの redesign ブランチとリモートのリポジトリへ全ての変更をコミットしてプッシュする。全ての追加点や変更点は master ブランチではなくこのブランチに残ることになる 。
現在のブランチは？ : 現在のブランチを調べたり、全てのローカル・ブランチを一覧するには git branch コマンドを実行する 。
もしリモートの master ブランチから変更 ( 例えば重要なコードの変更やセキュリティ関連の更新など)
をプルして現在のブランチにその変更を反映させるには git pull コマンドを使って以下のように実行する。
$ git pull origin $ git merge master
このコマンド は
Git に全ブランチを含んだ origin リポジト リ ( Git デフォルトのリモート・リポジトリのエイリアス ) から全ての変更点を取得するように伝え、現在のブランチへ master ブランチからマージしている。作業が完了し master ブランチへマージさせる場合は、以下のようにまず master をチェックアウトし、それから作業ブランチをマージする必要がある。
$ git checkout master $ git merge redesign
これで redesign ブランチでの変更点は master ブランチにマージされる。作成したブランチでの作業が完全に終了したのなら、
-d オプションを使ってそのブランチを削除できる。
$ git branch -d redesign
リモート・リポジトリのブランチを削除するには、 push コマンド ( git push < remote > < local branch >:< remote branch >
でローカルのブランチをリモートの違う名前のブランチにプッシュすることができる)
をうまく利用して、空のブランチでリモートのブランチを上書きする。
$ git push origin : redesign
様々な変更の取り消し方
ステージに追加したファイルをステージから削除するには git reset HEAD < filename > を実行する ( HEAD は省略しても構わない ) 。
ファイルに加えた変更をなかったことにしてリポジトリのコピーに戻すには git checkout < filename > を実行して、リポジトリからファイルをチェックアウトし直す。
ファイルを古いリビジョンに戻す場合にも git checkout を実行するが、リビジョンの ID を指定する必要があるので、まず git log を実行してコミット・ログを参照する 。
$ git log index.html commit 86429cd28708e22b643593b7081229017b7f0 f8d Author : joe < joe@example.com >
Date : Sun Feb 17 22:19:21 2008 - 0800 build new html files commit 3607253d20c7a295965f798109f9d4af0fbeedd8 Author : fred < fred@example.com >
Date : Sun Feb 17 21:32:00 2008 - 0500 Oops .
古いリビジョン ( 360725 ... ) に戻すには、その ID を指定してチェックアウトする。する と
Git はその古いバージョンのファイルを確認してからコミットできるようにステージに追加してくれる。
$ git checkout 3607253d20c7a295965f798109f9d4af0fbeedd8 index.html
もしその巻き戻した古いバージョンを必要としない場合は、ステージから削除してチェックアウトし直せば良い。
$ git reset HEAD index.html $ git checkout index.html
これは以下のようにまとめて実行することもできる。
$ git checkout HEAD index.html
HEAD をリビジョンの ID と入れ替えても大丈夫なことに気が付いただろうか。それは
Git においてリビジョンとブランチが事実上同じものであるからだ。
この行は誰が書いたのだろうか
git blame < file > を実行すると誰が何時そのファイルのどこに変更を加えたのか見ることができる。
履歴の閲 覧
gitk を使うと作業コピーの詳細な履歴を見ることができる。
gitk はツリー状の変更履歴 ( ブランチをまたがった変更履歴 ) のブラウズや差分の閲覧、古いリビジョンの検索など様々な機能を持っている。
ベスト・プラクティ ス
バージョン管理システムを使って開発を続ける上でのちょっとしたヒントやアドバイスをこのセクションにまとめた。
こまめにコミッ ト
ワープロ・ソフトを使う時は「頻繁に保存しないと後悔する」とよく言われるように、ローカル・リポジトリにできる限り頻繁にコミットするべきである。作業内容が消えてしまうことがないだけではなく、いつでも必要な時に古いバージョンに戻すことができるという安心感も得られるだろう。もちろん単語や文字を入力するたびにコミットしたり、コミットするごとにコミットしたことをコミットするなどというのは極端すぎる。重要な変更
( 全部または一部が重要だと思われる変更 ) の度にコミットするべきである。
こまめにプ ル
また、こまめにプルするべきでもある。こまめにプルすることによって、常に最新のコードであることを維持でき、運が良ければ重複した作業を避けることができる。既に共同開発者によって実装済みでかつリポジトリに反映されている機能を、3週間に一度しかプルしないために知らずに何時間もかけて実装した時はとてもショックを受けるだろう。
checkout と reset は気を付けて使 う
最後のコミットから特定のファイルに加えた変更を元に戻す場合、 git checkout < filename > か git reset を使って直前のコミット以降の変更点をなかったことにできる。元に戻すという機能はとても重要な機能だ
( 特に完全に間違ったアプローチで作業をしていたことに気づいた場合 ) が、諸刃の剣でもある。一旦 checkout や reset で変更点を削除してしまうと、それらを元に戻すことはできないので気を付ける必要がある。何も考えずに実行した reset によって数時間に渡る作業が無に帰すこともある。
リポジトリはどこにでも作ることができる
ローカルの小さなプロジェクト ( つまり巨大なリモート・リポジトリなどがまったくないプロジェクト)
をバージョン管理したい場合、単に git init を実行して独立したローカル・リポジトリを作成すれば良い。例えば、新しいアプリケーションの構想を練るというような場合、以下のようにするだけで良い。
$ mkdir design_concepts $ git init
これで Git の本当のリモート・リポジトリと同じようにファイルを追加したり、ブランチを作成したりすることができるようになる。もしプッシュやプルも行いたくなった時は、リモート・リポジトリを設定してやる必要がある。
$ git remote add < alias > < url > $ git pull < alias > master
" You are the controller , " teased Microsoft at their E3 conference today , firing the shot heard round the blogosphere : a no-controls - whatsoever motion - sensing device .
" Can we make you the controller ? " they asked , before answering with an Obama - like " Yes we can . "
Forget Steve Austin , it 's The Six Million Dollar Design Grail : Gentlemen , we can rebuild you ... we have the technology ... better , stronger , faster ... and did we mention without an external controller ?
Like a nerdy gladiator swaggering onstage to do battle with breathlessly expectant fans and naysayers alike , Microsoft utterly wowed with " Project Natal . "
I mean really wowed .
Yeah , it 's kind of a dumb name , but it may turn out to be the most impressive show item any company 's crowed about in years .
It 's Nintendo 's Wii without the gangly Wii-remote , Sony 's Eye Toy with dramatically better vision .
The promise of interaction without wires or widgets .
The future you 'd been thinking was still a year or three away .
What we saw today was unprecedented : True 1 - to - 1 motion tracking .
Wave your arm and your onscreen avatar follows you precisely .
Bend , yoga - like , to form cute animal shadow - shapes and a silhouetted image on a virtual canvas curls and contorts picture - perfectly .
Shift toe - to - toe , tennis - like , anticipating objects hurled your way and whatever algorithms are intelligently sorting behind the scenes recognize your intentions , filtering out flailing limbs or ignoring unnecessary maneuvers .
And then there 's Milo .
the innocent little boy who seemed to react viscerally to the human asking him questions .
Peter Molyneux ( Fable 2 ) claimed it was n't staged or scripted .
At one point Milo tossed a pair of goggles at the screen and the player demoing the game reached down , instinctively , to catch them .
Molyneux pointed out that " every player reaches down , " highlighting the almost autonomic response a character like Milo engenders .
Molyneux 's enthusiasm was palpable , even contagious -- a guy who 's probably been anticipating this sort of interactive naturalism longer than any of us , now perched center - stage with his fingers on a product that might just deliver it .
Now think beyond games for a moment , which is where trotting out a filmmaker of Steven Spielberg 's stature factors more than superficially .
Natal is n't new technology — it 's been anticipated for years — but it 's part of more than just Microsoft 's gaming lineup .
Think about walking into a room to play a game that already knows precisely where your hands and feet are .
A system that already knows whether you 're grumpy or melancholy , smiling or frowning , how many fingers you 're holding up , or how curled or extended each one is .
Think , in short , about a system that gets to know you from every angle , eerie as that sounds ... and inevitable as it's always been .
Will it deliver the experience the demos seemed to promise ?
Wait and see .
For now , Microsoft 's just enjoying the buzz , and for a change , deservedly so .

Mr Ghailani 's trial will be an important test case for closing Guantanamo
The first Guantanamo detainee to be brought to the US for trial has pleaded not guilty to involvement in two embassy blasts in East Africa in 1998 .
Ahmed Ghailani appeared before a federal court in New York , after being transferred there earlier in the day .
Mr Ghailani , a Tanzanian , was detained in Pakistan in 2004 and taken to Guantanamo in late 2006 .
The case is seen as a test of the Obama administration 's pledge to close Guantanamo Bay by next January .
Mr Ghailani entered the courtroom in Manhattan wearing a blue prison uniform .
AHMED KHALFAN GHAILANI
Born in Zanzibar but date varies from 1970 to 1974 Alleged to have been Osama Bin Laden 's bodyguard Accused of buying equipment for embassy attack in Tanzania in 1998 and involvement in simultaneous Kenya attack Indicted in 1998 in New York and reportedly fled to Afghanistan Reported in Liberia in 2001 Arrested in Pakistan in 2004
Profile : Ahmed Ghailani Judge Loretta Preska asked him for his plea to charges of conspiring to commit the bombings of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya that killed 224 people , including 12 Americans .
" Not guilty , " Mr Ghailani said .
Judge Preska set a date of 16 June for the next hearing .
The justice department says Mr Ghailani faces 286 charges .
They include conspiring with Osama Bin Laden and other members of al - Qaeda to kill Americans around the world , and murder charges for each of the victims of the embassy attacks of 7 August 1998 .
If found guilty Mr Ghailani could face the death penalty .
Earlier , US Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement : " With his appearance in federal court today , Ahmed Ghailani is being held accountable for his alleged role in the bombing of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya . "
Congress rejection
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington says if President Barack Obama is to honour his promise to close Guantanamo Bay in his first year in office he needs as many cases from there as possible to be tried as ordinary criminal cases in federal courts .
However , the US Congress has already rejected an administration request for funding to close down Guantanamo amid widespread opposition to bringing detainees on to the US mainland .
Our correspondent says Mr Ghailani 's case will also establish whether defence lawyers will seek to have US federal trials thrown out on the grounds that the government has admitted applying harsh interrogation techniques to some detainees , and holding others in secret prisons overseas .
Mr Obama is hoping to persuade America 's allies around the world to take some of the other Guantanamo detainees , but negotiations have proved difficult .
A number of high - value prisoners are likely to face indefinite detention without trial , our correspondent says .
Apology According to the transcript of a closed - door hearing in March 2007 , Mr Ghailani admitted delivering explosives used to blow up the US embassy in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam .
Ahmed Ghailani appeared at the Federal Courthouse in New York However , he told the hearing he did not know about the attack beforehand and apologised to the US government and the victims ' families .
Investigators say he left Africa just before the bombings .
Mr Ghailani is thought to have been born on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar in 1970 or 1974 - making him 39 or 35 years old .
He is said to speak fluent English .
He is alleged to have risen through the ranks of al - Qaeda to become a bodyguard of Osama Bin Laden .
According to the US transcript , he admitted visiting an al - Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan after the bombings .
But he denied being a member of al - Qaeda .
Analysts described him as a very important figure , who was probably sent to east Africa at the time of the bombings by Osama Bin Laden 's second - in - command , Ayman al - Zawahiri .
It is suggested that Mr Ghailani fled to Afghanistan after being indicted in 1998 .

With Linux having gained traction in business , certifications of Linux expertise are becoming more popular , similar to how Novell or Microsoft systems certifications became important for those platforms .
But some in the Linux community say the emergence of certifications is by no means a golden ticket for admins , and perhaps just a waste of time and money .
Major Linux distributors , including Novell and Red Hat , have their own certification programs , notes Jim Zemlin , executive director of the Linux Foundation .
Employers come to the foundation seeking Linux talent and want to know if a candidate is qualified , he says : " They want to see a Good Housekeeping seal of approval , for lack of a better term , that 's neutral and third - party . "
So the foundation offers the Linux Foundation Certified Developer certification and accompanying courses .
[ Has desktop Linux lost its chance in business ?
InfoWorld 's Neil McAllister explains why desktop Linux 's chances are increasingly slim . ]
Certification of Linux skills has become " pretty mainstream , " Zemlin says , and more people are seeking certifications of Linux proficiency , including those previously certified to work with Solaris , Microsoft , and Novell systems .
" Particularly with the down economy and consolidation in the Unix market , people are looking to improve their skills and make [ themselves ] more marketable [ in ] the job market , " he adds .
Linux certification is by no means a must - have to get a job
Yet on a list of most desirable certifications , Linux is nowhere to be seen -- even though Linux skills are highly desired by companies .
The April 2009 Foote Partners Hot Lists cite Linux IT skills as No. 2 , right behind Java , on its roster of most desired , noncertified IT skills .
The employment research firm's other list , featuring " hot " IT certifications , does n't include any Linux certifications .
" Certifications are not particularly necessary with a lot of people that are hiring , " says David Foote , CEO of Foote Partners .
" Clearly , the world is not saying , ' You need a certification in Linux to be hot . '
You simply need Linux experience , " he adds .
Even an unlikely source -- Linux vendor Novell -- backs up the notion that not everyone values the certifications .
Corporations are looking for Linux skills but not putting value in the certification , says MaryJo Swenson , vice president of training services at Novell , which offers the Suse Linux distribution .
But Foote says he has heard from managers who find certifications attractive in hiring for deeply technical jobs in security , for example .
But when hiring project managers or architectures , experience is the main criteria , he notes .
The case for and against Linux certifications
" The premise of any certification is that it should ultimately help a hiring manager sort the pile [ of résumés ] , " says Randy Russell , Red Hat 's director of certification .
Dennis Little , a member of the Central Pennsylvania Linux User Group , sees government agencies particularly looking for people with Linux certifications , especially Red Hat's .
( Little says he would prefer a Linux Professional Institute certification , because he believes it to be superior to Red Hat 's certification . )
But the use of certifications can raise eyebrows about a candidate 's actual skills at many companies , says Eric Andreychek , lead organizer of the Central Pennsylvania Linux User Group .
" Some folks feel that [ certifications ] are used by underqualified people to try and hide their lack of real - world knowledge or skill , " he says .
" One person said they 'd scrutinize a résumé even more if a person had a certificate than if they had none .
Other people felt that [ the certification ] was n't testing knowledge and skills that are usable in the real world . "
Experience matters more than anything
It 's clear that experience is what matters most to employers .
By themselves , Linux certifications are " just a piece of paper , " Little says , and employers will avoid candidates who " do n't have any real - world experience . "
Yet employers will hire experienced candidates who do n't have a Linux certification , he notes .
That 's the case at hosted service provider Rackspace , which does not require technicians to gain Red Hat certification .
" While we do n't require it , there 're not really any technicians that do n't take it , " says Frederick Mendler , a vice president for support at Rackspace .
And he sees that Red Hat certification is common on employee résumés .
( More than 100,000 people have taken its certification exams , according to Red Hat . )
Some certification providers have gotten the " experience matters " message and adapted their tests to be more real - world .
For example , Novell now determines attainment of its Suse - oriented Certified Linux Professional certification on a performance - based test .
" You have to actually perform administrative and troubleshooting tasks , " Swenson says .
If something is broken , the candidate must fix it .
" I usually tell people , if you have a downed server in an exam , you have downed the server and now you have to figure your way out of it , " she notes .
Only about 45 percent of candidates pass Novell 's tests on the first try , Swenson notes , while the second - time passage rate is about 70 percent .
Likewise , the decade - old Red Hat Certified Engineer program 's certifications are performance - based .
" People earn these certifications and credentials by passing practical examinations using live equipment and performing real - world tests , " says certification director Russell .
You would think , somewhere , someone would have suggested that maybe having a sequence where we look at Pelosi down the barrel of a gun , hear shots fired , and then watch blood drip down our screens was n’t exactly the smartest or most responsible way to Jaysus .
What is it about right - wingers and their Pelosi assassination fantasies anyway .
Eliminationism much , ya think ?
ARLINGTON , Texas , May 11 ( UPI ) -- A
Texas body modification enthusiast said he broke a Guinness World Record by receiving 1,197 piercings in a single day .
Jeremy Stroud said Arlington body modification artist Tyson Turk spent about five hours May 2 inserting 800 needles into his back , 300 in his right arm , 50 in his leg and about 20 in his left arm , the Fort Worth ( Texas ) Star - Telegram reported Monday .

He said the needles were removed at the end of the day but they left scars all over his body .
" They 're so close together that they leave a line .
It kind of looks like I had stitches from my wrist all the way up to my shoulder , " he said .
Stroud said two emergency medical technicians were on hand during the record attempt as well as a witness and a photographer to support his bid to make it into the record book .
He said the original plan was 2,000 piercings , but the pain from the needles eventually started to catch up to him .
" I made it to 1,200 and my body was getting ready to shut down , " he said .
" I had no idea what I was getting into . "
Watershed Down [ Image : Mike Bouchet 's Watershed being towed through Venice towards the Arsenale basin , against a backdrop of Italian palazzi ] .

This is a guest post by Nicola Twilley .
The Watershed .
David Birnbaum , the Biennale 's curator , told camera crews filming the installation that he thought the project " sounded a bit megalomaniac , " but the sight of the oversized house , clad in beige vinyl , flimsily bobbing up and down against a backdrop of palazzi and piazzi as it was towed through Venice 's canals , was breathtaking .
It was an architectural icon of the American Dream revealed in all its formulaic absurdity .
Amazingly , then , one of the pontoons capsized , and the entire house sank to the bottom of the canal — an unintentional yet utterly perfect coda to the house 's own built - in commentary .
Now , a fake generic American suburban home will add its ruins to the underwater archaeology of Venice .

We are so inured to tales of business corruption that even a devastating exposé in The Wall Street Journal no longer shocks us .
The fact that the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank made millions off his secret purchase of Goldman Sachs stock , “ in violation of Federal Reserve policy , ” as the WSJ put it , at a time when the N.Y .
Fed was ostensibly overseeing the antics of the Wall Street firm , has barely registered a blip of outrage .
When N.Y . Fed Chairman Stephen Friedman bought stock in the company that he once headed , and where he still serves as a director , he was already in violation of Federal Reserve policy and was hoping for a waiver to permit him to hold his existing multi-million - dollar stock stash and to remain on the Goldman board .
The waiver was requested last October by Timothy Geithner , then the president of the N.Y.
Fed and now Treasury secretary .
Yet , without having received that waiver , Friedman went ahead in December and purchased 37,300 additional shares .
With shares he added in January , after the waiver was granted , he ended up with 98,600 shares in Goldman Sachs , worth a total of $ 13,330,720 at the close of trading on Tuesday .
Friedman was in violation of the Fed ’s policy because , thanks in part to the urging of Geithner and the N.Y .
Fed , Goldman Sachs was allowed to become a bank holding company , making it eligible for government bailout funds ( an option that Geithner had denied to Goldman rival Lehman Brothers ) .
But that shift also put Goldman under more rigorous banking regulations that required Friedman as Class C director of the N.Y .
Fed , a position in which he ostensibly represents the public instead of the banks who dominate the board , to step down as a Goldman director and divest his holdings .
Instead , he stayed on the Goldman board and added additional shares while waiting for the Fed waiver .
Nor did he inform the Federal Reserve of his additional purchases last December , and the lawyers for the N.Y .
Fed did n’t know about that purchase until the WSJ raised questions in April .
Friedman has made a profit of about $ 3 million on the additional shares .
The significance of this conflict of interest was summarized by the lead of the WSJ story : “ The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shaped Washington ’s response to the financial crisis late last year , which buoyed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other Wall Street firms .
Goldman received speedy approval to become a bank holding company in September and a $ 10 billion capital injection soon after . ”
In addition to that capital injection , which at least carries some expectation of being repaid , Goldman received an additional $ 8.1 billion that will not have to be returned to taxpayers .
This is a result of the bailout engineered by then - N.Y .
Fed president Geithner of AIG , which listed Goldman as its top insured credit - swap customer .
As Jerry Jordan , former president of the Fed Bank in Cleveland , told the Journal in reference to Friedman ’s obvious conflict of interest , “ He should have resigned . ”
Unfortunately , this was not the view during the reign of Geithner , who argued that Friedman needed to remain chairman of the N.Y .
Fed board to find a suitable replacement for Geithner as he moved on to be secretary of the Treasury .
Friedman chose a fellow former Goldman Sachs exec for the job .
All of which calls into question the unique power of Goldman Sachs over the U.S. government , as described in another important , but largely ignored , article from The New York Times last October headlined “ The Guys From ‘ Government Sachs . ’ ” Their power is vast , no matter which party controls the White House .
As the Times noted , two leaders of Goldman Sachs — Robert Rubin , who co-chaired Goldman with Friedman , and Henry Paulson — had become secretaries of the Treasury in the Clinton and Bush administrations , respectively .
Under Paulson , the bailout of Wall Street was dominated by Goldman Sachs alums , and as the Times noted , “ Indeed , Goldman ’s presence in the ( Treasury ) department and around the federal response to the financial bailout is so ubiquitous that other bankers and competitors have given the star - studded firm a new nickname : Government Sachs . ”
That power continues unabated in the Obama administration .
Geithner is a protégé of former Goldman Sachs chairman Rubin .
And it was therefore not surprising when he picked Mark Patterson , a registered lobbyist for Goldman Sachs , to be his chief of staff at the Treasury Department .
That appointment was made on the same day that Geithner announced new rules for limiting the influence of registered lobbyists .
Need more be said ?
In 1919 , British scientist Arthur Eddington embarked on an historic expedition to the island of Principe , off the west African coast , to observe a total solar eclipse .
David Tennant played Eddington in a recent BBC drama Stars in the Hyades cluster were behind the Sun during the eclipse , and appeared to shift from their true positions .
This discovery provided the first experimental confirmation for Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
On 29 May , the island of Principe marked the 90th anniversary of the experiment , described by many as one of the most important scientific achievements of the 20th Century .
Astronomer Richard Massey , from the Royal Observatory Edinburgh , has been in Principe with colleagues and is writing a diary for BBC News .
ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS
The visitors received a warm welcome .
From l to r : Pedro , Gisa and Richard
After a long journey , we reached the Sundy plantation where Eddington observed the 1919 eclipse .
We received a huge welcome : the residents stayed up dancing , drumming and singing in our honour .
And their delicious but potent pineapple homebrew had quite the effect on my tired legs .
Excitement on the island has mounted during the past week , with visits to nearby schools and reports on the radio .
In the morning , a convoy of almost a hundred visitors returned to the plantation .
For a population of less than 5,000 , this shows how the islanders have taken to their anniversary celebration .
The day is conveniently sandwiched between Africa Day earlier in the week , and Children 's Day on Monday .
Both are already excuses for a party here , and this bridges the gap .
Just as in 1919 , heavy clouds cleared right on schedule .
The president of Principe unveiled the Royal Astronomical Society plaque , and launched a new set of postage stamps featuring Eddington .
The anniversary has attracted lots of interest from the island 's residents
I was pleased to see people gathering around and discussing the plaque 's text during the day .
This island has become quite the centre of general relativity !
It 's also a simply beautiful place .
Island - hopping back by small plane shows the golden sandy coves slicing between bright blue sea and verdant rainforest .
And I 've found only the friendliest people , with more time to help a lost or confused stranger than I am used to expect .
The island is poor but staggeringly rich .
The challenge faced by this small nation is to maintain its currently undiscovered paradise while developing responsible tourism and exploiting recently discovered oil reserves .
WARPED SPACE AND BENT LIGHT
During this week in 1919 , Sir Arthur Eddington profoundly changed the way we view the Universe .
Eddington watched stars near the Sun during a total solar eclipse on the African island of Principe .
When the Sun was in front of the stars , they appeared to move away from their true positions , which Eddington had recorded in Oxford , three - and - a - half months earlier .
This was the first observational proof of Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
Interestingly , Einstein 's first celebration was , like Eddington , to write to his mum .
There must be a moral to take from this common theme .
General relativity describes how any massive object , such as the Sun , produces gravity by bending space and time around it .
Everything in that space is also bent : even rays of light , and these get deflected .
Light does n't always travel in straight lines .
Gravitational lensing occurs when the light from a distant object is bent around a massive object in between it and the observer .
The massive body distorts the spacetime ( represented as the yellow grid ) making the distant object look distorted
Distant sources behind the massive object can therefore appear to move - or also get brighter or change shape .
Einstein 's prediction of this effect was used to determine the nature of gravity .
But now that it is well understood , the effect of " gravitational lensing " has become one of the most powerful tools used by astronomers to probe the Universe .
Gravitational lenses work effectively like glass lenses , focusing and magnifying light - but on a huge scale .
They let us see objects otherwise too far away or faint for even the largest telescopes on Earth .
Scientists have recently discovered that most of the Universe is in the form of invisible dark matter and dark energy .
But because it still has gravity , it is revealed by gravitational lensing .
Images of distant galaxies that appear grossly distorted and magnified in Hubble Space Telescope photographs are a sure sign that a lot of dark matter is sitting in front of them .
To mark this anniversary , and the special place that this island holds in the history of science , we will , on Friday , unveil an informational plaque at the site on Principe , amid a series of talks from us and local people .
SETTING OFF
What was arguably the most important scientific experiment of the 20th Century , happened in a slave plantation on a remote African island .
In 1919 , the Royal Astronomical Society ( RAS ) launched an expedition to observe a total solar eclipse from Principe , to prove or disprove Einstein 's theory of general relativity .
This week , we are going back .
Astronomers Pedro Ferreira and myself , with Oxford University anthropologist Gisa Weszkalnys , are paying homage to the original expedition by Sir Arthur Eddington .
The island holds a special place in the history of science .
In concert with the local and Portuguese governments , we shall be giving a series of public talks , unveiling an informational plaque at the plantation , and installing an exhibition in the capital .
The team will unveil an informational plaque on Principe
Our expedition left on Thursday 21 May , and will reach a climax on 29 May , the anniversary of the eclipse .
In the aftermath of World War One , Eddington 's journey to Principe took six weeks by steam ship .
He frequently wrote home and his archives at Trinity College , Cambridge , tell an adventure from a forgotten age .
Eddington got stuck on Madeira for three weeks , when all the ships were full of returning troops .
Amid ongoing rationing in Britain , the sugar and exotic fruits were welcome relief .
But he seems some sort of fanatic for Madeira bananas , eating about a dozen every day .
Most of his letters went to his mother ; somehow he failed to mention the island 's casino .
Principe is still not easy to reach .
From Edinburgh , it will take me four flights , some of which run only once a week .
Getting all of the equipment there on time is also proving only slightly less of a challenge than in 1919 .
To a modern scientist , Eddington 's archives also provide a fascinating snapshot into the frustratingly slow pace of early 20th Century research .
We now rely totally on the internet to maintain the pace of international collaborations .
Wi - fi permitting , I will continue the story next week from Principe .
Richard Massey is an astronomy fellow at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh and is a visiting associate in astronomy at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) .
Gisa Weszkalnys is an anthropologist at the University of Oxford who studies the economics of Principe island .
Pedro Ferreira is a professor of astronomy at the University of Oxford

Online comment forums create ample opportunity for behavior of such extreme jerkitude that it can drive even the most patient Netizens batty .
You know what I 'm talking about :
The know - it - alls , fight - starters , and doctrinaire zealots who seem to frequent every message board on the entire ' Interwebs ' , using any and every topic as a springboard for their sociopathic gratification .
We 've sifted through pages of forum messages to find the most absolutely asinine tactics .
So get ready to cringe :
On the pages that follow you 'll meet our nominees for the 12 biggest jerks of the Web 's online forums .

Une campagne de sensibilisation au problème du réchauffement climatique , par la chaîne américaine MTV et baptisée Switch .
Une baseline forte « Notre planète perd patience » et une déclinaison de 3 affiches conçue par l’agence Ogilvy , en Autriche .
It rains overnight and the next day Cannes feels as though it 's been out at sea .
Everything is drenched and dripping ; I half expect to see fish expiring on the steps of the Palais .
On the rooftop terrace of an adjacent hotel , the plastic sheeting billows like a mainsail , and there in the corner sits Francis Ford Coppola , the ancient mariner of American cinema himself , blown back from obscurity .
He says he needs a coffee to perk him up .
Coppola first came to Cannes in 1969 - with a film called The Rain People , strangely enough - and remains one of the few directors to win the festival 's top prize twice : for The Conversation in 1974 , and for Apocalypse Now in 1979 .
Today , with his white beard and bright pink socks , he has the look of a tourist letting his hair down on a summer vacation .
Where did the time go , he wonders .
" I 've been in this business for more than 40 years .
It feels like two . "
The film festival originally offered him an out - of - competition slot for his latest film - an exalted but largely meaningless honour - and he turned them down .
Instead , he has opted to compete in the Directors '
Fortnight , where he looms like a giant among the less familiar names .
Yet , this is somehow fitting , because his low - budget , black - and - white , entirely self - financed Tetro looks for all the world like the work of a first - or second - time film - maker .
It is , he says , the sort of film he always wanted to make , before events dragged him off in a different direction .
After a 10 - year hiatus starting in the mid-1990s , Coppola is back behind the camera - first with 2007's Youth Without Youth , and now this one .
" I 'm like a retired businessman , " he says .
" But rather than play golf , I 've decided to make art films instead . "
Age , he says , has brought a new perspective .
He is done with the critics , and done with the studios .
He is not worried about ruining his career , because he does n't have a career to ruin .
" I know people say , ' Well , these films are n't as good as the ones he made earlier . '
But you have to remember that those were bad movies , too .
Read the first reviews of Apocalypse Now !
Read the Variety review of The Godfather !
They said it was boring , and dark , and pretentious .
So it 's funny .
It 's like I 'm competing with this version of myself from a time when they did n't like me anyway . "
It 's true that Tetro has had mixed reviews since its premiere last Thursday night , but it worked for me .
Luxuriating in the sights and sounds of Buenos Aires , the film follows the attempts of a callow young sailor ( Alden Ehrenreich ) to forge a relationship with his estranged elder brother ( Vincent Gallo ) .
It is a ripe , expressionistic family saga ; a film half - drunk on high emotion and fantastical set - pieces .
It 's so clearly born out of passion that you forgive its occasional cornball digressions .
Coppola 's coffee arrives and he sits cradling it to his kingly paunch .
He is preoccupied with this idea of criticism .
It can hurt , he says , because it gets delivered from on high and makes no distinction between the art and the artist .
He admits this is something he sometimes struggles with himself .
" It 's like me with Picasso .
His work is very clever and impressive , but he was a terrible person .
He was a bad father and a bad husband .
So I have a hard time admiring his work , because I know he was n't good to his kids . "
When he started out , Coppola says , his plan was to be a writer - director of small - scale , personal projects .
Except that , at the age of 30 , he won an Oscar for writing the war movie Patton and was carried away by the tide .
This sounds suspiciously close to a repudiation of pretty much everything he has done .
God forbid that he is disowning the films that made him great ?
" Well , when I was offered The Godfather , it was so surprising : I was so young .
It was offered to a lot of very important directors - Elia Kazan , Costa - Gavras - and I was at the bottom of the barrel .
I only got it because I was young and cheap , and was known as a writer , and they figured I could rewrite this terrible script they had .
Oh , and also because I was Italian . "
He shakes his head .
" The Godfather was an accident .
But then it turned out to be so successful , despite the Variety review - that was a blow , my worst nightmare .
I 'd never had money before , and all at once I had money and esteem and the car and the house , and I went on a different trip to the one I intended .
And then everything I did was trying to get back .
When I made Apocalypse Now , the idea was to make a big , successful war film like A Bridge Too Far and then use the money to make smaller pictures .
That was always the idea .
That was what we were all going to do .
Even George [ Lucas ] , when he made Star Wars .
Star Wars was not what he wanted . "
In the early 1970s , Coppola was the leading light in a generation of movie brats who turned the Hollywood studio system on its head .
He reframed the American experience through a more radical European style - but where Robert Altman was free - form , and Martin Scorsese wired , Coppola 's films were brooding and measured , characterised by hushed conversations and sudden rips of violence .
Along with Lucas , William Friedkin and others , these directors proved it was possible to make serious , artistic pictures within the studio system .
Except that then Lucas - Coppola 's one - time protege - took on the role of Judas .
Star Wars wrecked the dream , sending Hollywood down the mega - budget , blockbuster route and casting Coppola out into the wilderness .
Coppola winces ; he thinks this is too harsh a judgment .
" But success can be very intoxicating , " he says .
" Particularly when you did n't plan it .
It 's like you 're working in a coal mine and all of a sudden you become prime minister .
Well , gee , OK , it 's good to be king .
The truth of the matter is that I was a few years older than George and Marty [ Scorsese ] , so I was able to help them .
But then you get seduced .
And when you become successful , it becomes harder to go back and do the things you said you were going to do .
So I 'm still waiting for George to make his personal films , because you would be shocked at how talented he is . "
As for Coppola , a certain bullheaded - ness and spendthrift nature proved his undoing .
He went " insane " ( his word ) in the jungle while shooting Apocalypse Now , ran up such debts with his ambitious Zoetrope studios ( as well as with gargantuan flops One from the Heart and The Cotton Club ) that by the late 1980s he was forced to work as a hack for hire .
" I had to make a payment every year , so I had to make a movie every year , " he sighs .
" That was a tough time for me . "
Is Tetro a more personal film than , say , The Godfather , Rumble Fish or The Conversation ?
All share the same sombre texture , the same themes of loyalty and betrayal , ambition and corruption .
But Coppola says Tetro is his most explicitly autobiographical film - a reimagined photo album that probes his relationship with his adored older brother , August ( father of Nicolas Cage ) , who avoided the limelight and pursued a career in academia .
" Well , this film is obviously tackling some demons in my own family , " he says .
" You know families - you love all these people , but you hate them .
But you love them .
It 's a very cloudy situation .
But making a film like this was like asking a question and receiving some kind of answer .
I learned some things about myself that I did n't know before .
I did n't know that I felt abandoned by my brother .
My brother was so good to me . "
He chuckles .
" I 'm 70 years old and I 'm only finding this stuff out now .
" A couple of years ago I realised something , " Coppola continues .
" I realised that my time was running out .
So now , because of my other activities , I 'm in a position to concentrate on cinema and to make movies that are entirely independent of the companies that control the movies . "
Besides , he says , he finds that film - making keeps him young .
Cinema is such a youthful art that it makes children of us all .
There is still so much more to discover ; so many places to travel .
" Sitting here talking to you , " he says .
" I feel as though the future is a clean sheet of paper " .

It 's a recurring pipe dream for technophiles and luddites alike : computers that not only listen but understand our every command .
And each year , like clockwork , someone claims this day is upon us — that we can toss out our keyboards and warm up our larynges for a new relationship with our machines .
Press or say " 1 " for a cold , hard dose of reality .
Despite being crammed into nearly every imaginable electronic receptacle — from cell phones and desktop operating systems to cars and aircraft cockpits — speech - recognition software remains light - years away from tackling the general - purpose applications that would change the way we interact with computers .
Sure , we 've seen modest improvements , but breakthroughs have been rare .
One of the most recent occurred more than a decade ago : Rasta , developed at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley , enabled different kinds of hardware to use the same speech - recognition software .
It was widely implemented in mobile phones in 2001 , and nothing game - changing has happened since .
What 's the holdup ?
Part of the problem is that , unlike with other types of software , processing power alone does n't solve your problem .
Moore 's law only boosts a machine 's ability to navigate larger pronunciation databases .
Those databases do help .
By compiling massive lists of pronunciation variants , engineers try to minimize errors .
But with some 30 ways of saying " of , " and nearly infinite spoken iterations for more complex words , even the largest inventory is easy to foil .
" There 's not a speech recognizer today that you can't break by stretching out certain syllables , " says Deb Roy , director of the Cognitive Machines Group at the MIT Media Lab .
So scientists continue to hack away at the problem , and they 're learning a ton about how we meatbags process and understand sound .
It turns out that we are n't flawless speech recognizers either .
Rather , we often eke out meaning based largely on context and expectations .
" The next major thing in speech recognition is letting machines train themselves on the context , " Roy says .

Twenty - two years after the Chernobyl nuclear power station accident in the Ukraine — the worst in history — scientists are reporting insights into the mystery of how plants have managed to adapt and survive in the radioactive soil near Chernobyl .
Their research is the first to probe how production of key proteins in plants changes in response to the radioactive environment , according to the report .
It is scheduled for the June 5 issue of ACS ’ Journal of Proteome Research .
Martin Hajduch and colleagues note in the new study that plants growing in the Chernobyl area following the April 26 , 1986 disaster somehow adapted to the radioactive environment and thrived .
But until now , nobody knew what biochemical changes in the plants accounted for this miracle and enabled plants to adapt .
The researchers found that soybean plant seeds exposed to radiation produced different amounts and types of protein than seeds from unexposed plants .
The proteins protected the seeds from radio - contaminated environment .
Interestingly , plants from contaminated fields produced one - third more of a protective protein called betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase — the same protein known to protect human blood from radiation damage .

Never Rely on Tomorrow to Pay for Today
One of my largest annoyances with American society is our fixation on today .
We want a new house today .
We want a flat screen TV with HD service today .
We want a new car today .
We want to retire today .
You get the idea .
Honestly I see no problem with wanting those things .
Sure the new car , television , and HD service are true wants and not critical to our everyday survival .
I ’m just saying I would n’t complain if I had them .
The problem we run into as a society — generally speaking ( I know I have a lot of intelligent , frugal readers ! ) — is we combine want and today together into an unhealthy mentality .
Buy Today , Pay Tomorrow
This pretty much sums up our consumerism mentality .
I want the car , the TV , the new house today .
I ’ll pay for them tomorrow or maybe the next day .
I promise !
I ’ll pay them off .
Honest .
I really mean it this time …
As you can imagine this gets these individuals into trouble .
They have homes full of nice things , but empty wallets and bank accounts .
The phone rings off the hook from creditors demanding to be paid .
The reliance upon tomorrow was missplaced , and disaster follows .
You Ca n’t Predict the Future
If you could predict the future your best bet would be to borrow as much money as possible and put it into an investment or gamble that you absolutely knew was going to pay off .
The last time I checked no one reading this blog could predict the future .
I ’ll also be the first to admit we all rely on tomorrow being relatively similar to today .
We expect to go to work , pick up the project or task that we left unfinished from the day before , and continue on .
We expect to have a home , a spouse , or a family to come home to .
We expect our car to start and our paychecks to be direct deposited on time .
These are all relatively safe expectations , and most of us rely on them on a daily basis .
But at the end of the day if I asked you to predict what tomorrow was going to be like you would only have a general idea .
You would n’t be able to provide all of the specifics .
Unfortunately during our days here on earth life is going to throw us a bunch of curve balls .
What If the Unexpected ( and Unprepared For ) Happens ?
I expect my next paycheck come in , or a big bonus , or a promotion , or to land that next job .
I do n’t have goals and I spend money as soon as I get it , or worse yet I put it on credit .
Everything cruises along just fine until that fateful day where I get passed up for that promotion , I bomb that interview , or I get laid off and that paycheck — really , that series of paychecks — that I counted on suddenly disappear .
But the bills do n’t disappear .
They ’re not figments of your imagination .
You ’ve filled your life and home up by overspending and now the bills are due without any income .
( Good luck with that . )
How to Avoid the Today Mentality
If you been living your life in the unplanned and unprepared today , this is going to take some adjusting .
Some quick pointers on how to stop relying on tomorrow :
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday 27 June 2009
The piece below wrongly stated that North Korea recently restarted its main nuclear reactor .
Rather , it is taking steps to do this , and so has resumed reprocessing spent fuel rods .
North Korea today threatened to retaliate with a nuclear " fire shower " if it is attacked by the US and warned it would expand its nuclear arsenal , a month after it carried out a controlled nuclear explosion in defiance of the UN security council .
The regime used the 59th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war to step up its threats against the US , whose navy is tracking a North Korean vessel off the Chinese coast that is suspected of carrying weapons .
Earlier this month the UN banned all weapons exports from North Korea in response to the May 25 nuclear test , its second in three years .
The latest warning came as speculation mounted that Pyongyang is preparing to test launch short - and medium - range missiles .
North Korea has banned ships from the waters off its east coast until July 10 for " military exercises " , but South Korean and US intelligence officials do not believe the tests will involve a long - range Taepodong - 2 missile , which is theoretically capable of reaching Hawaii .
Yesterday President Barack Obama extended Washington 's sanctions against North Korea for another year and warned that the regime 's nuclear weapons programme posed " an unusual and extraordinary threat " to the US .
North Korea , which is thought to possess between five and seven nuclear bombs , recently restarted its main nuclear reactor , which is capable of reprocessing spent fuel rods used in the production of weapons - grade plutonium .
In Pyongyang the state - run media accused the US of provoking the Korean war – most historians agree the conflict was started by the North – and of looking for an excuse to launch another attack .
The Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the North had every right to defend itself in the face of what it called US hostility .
The regime " will never give up its nuclear deterrent … and will further strengthen it , " it said .
The newspaper said a recent US pledge to use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea amounted to " asking for the calamitous situation of having a fire shower of nuclear retaliation all over South Korea " .
The three - year Korean war ended in 1953 with a fragile truce and the creation of the most heavily fortified border in the world .
Last month Pyongyang said it was no longer bound by the armistice after the South agreed to take part in US - led searches of vessels suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction .
The ship now being tracked by a US navy destroyer has reportedly cleared the Taiwan Strait and is thought to be heading to Burma with a shipment of conventional munitions .
The US and its allies have yet to decide whether to intercept and search the ship , a move that North Korea said it would view as a declaration of war .
Hazel Blears : “ I have heard absolutely the outrage and the anger that the public feel about what has been going on .
I would never do anything to let down the people that I represent and serve and that is the most important thing for me .
It is n’t just enough to claim within the law , that is why I have decided to send to the inland revenue a cheque . "

Imagine you are a flight dynamics specialist at ESOC , ESA 's European Space Operations Centre , Darmstadt , Germany , on the afternoon of 14 May 2009 .
You and your colleagues on the Mission Control Team have just watched two satellites lofted into space on top of a powerful Ariane 5 ECA launcher .
On the edge of space and unseen by any human eyes , the two spacecraft separate from the upper stage .
An ESA ground station in Perth , Australia , picks up the first telemetry signals from the pair .
The launch is a success !
Pressure is on while the clock ticks down
Your colleagues now turn to you , and ask urgent questions :
Where are the two spacecraft ?
In which direction are they heading ?
How fast are they going ?
How does their actual speed compare to that required to get into their proper orbits ?
Also :
Should we fire the thrusters to speed them up or slow them down , and if so , by how much ?
And by the way : the longer you take to figure out the answers , the further off course both may go , necessitating an even greater course correction later on , burning even more precious fuel and cutting the lifetime of these hugely valuable missions .
The pressure is on - the clock is ticking .
These questions , and the limited time in which to answer them , are part of the challenges faced by the engineers , mathematicians , computer scientists and astrophysicists on ESA 's Flight Dynamics team during the critical launch and early orbit phase ( LEOP ) for Herschel and Planck , which lasts about three days after liftoff .
advertisement
" Immediately after launch , we must determine the two spacecraft orbits and calculate the thruster burns required to conduct the initial trajectory correction manoeuvres .
The team will be very busy and will work in shifts to support the missions 24 hours per day , " says Gottlob Gienger , the senior flight dynamics advisor for the Herschel and Planck missions .
Gienger explains the process for fixing the spacecraft locations in space .
" From the ground stations , we receive ranging and Doppler data - numbers that tell us very accurately how far away the spacecraft is and how fast it is moving in the direction toward or away from Earth .
But we do n't immediately know how fast it is moving in any other direction with sufficient accuracy , and space is of course three - dimensional , " he says .
This is when the experts on the Flight Dynamics team go into action , using sophisticated software tools to iteratively refine and recalculate a fix of the spacecraft locations , using not only the ground station data but also data sent by the Ariane launch controllers on the booster 's actual performance , the time of flight before separation and other inputs .
The team also take into account astronomical details , such as the location of Earth and the Moon at the time of launch ; their calculations are based on Kepler 's 400 - year - old equations of planetary motion and Newton 's famous law of gravitation .
advertisement
" We start with an educated guess based on Ariane performance , and then extrapolate using several hours ' worth of ground station data as to where the spacecraft are , " says Gienger .
The Flight Dynamics team can , in this case , reuse some of the orbit determination models that were previously developed for ESA 's Mars Express and Venus Express , since Herschel and Planck initially leave the Earth on a trajectory similar to the interplanetary trajectories followed by the earlier deep - space missions .
Once the orbits have been determined , flight dynamics are then responsible for generating the manoeuvre calculations - essentially a set of numbers describing the time and direction for the thruster burns that will correct their post - launch trajectories .
For Herschel , this first trajectory correction manoeuvre ( TCM ) on L+1 , the day after launch , will be followed by several more , slotted for L+2 and L+12 .
If all goes well , Herschel will then be on target to enter a large , 900x500 - thousand - kilometre , ' Lissajous ' orbit centred on the L2 Lagrange point .
This point is located approximately 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth .
Planck 's trajectory is more complicated , and there are the same TCM slots available on L+2 and L+12 , plus three more that will enable the spacecraft to be injected into a much tighter , 300 - by - 200 - thousand - kilometre Lissajous orbit , also about the L2 point .
Gienger says that orbits around L2 are unique in many ways and that these are the first ESA missions to go there ( NASA 's WMAP observatory spacecraft is presently in orbit about L2 ) .
" Yes , we can reuse some software from previous missions .
But the two spacecraft operate in fundamentally different ways , so everything will have to be calculated , checked and tested twice . "
Who 's Lagrange ?
And what 's L2 ?
Lagrange points are special locations in space where gravitational forces and the orbital motion of a body , such as a satellite , balance each other .
They were discovered by French mathematician Louis Lagrange in 1772 .
There are five Lagrangian points in the Sun-Earth system , with L1 , L2 and L3 all existing along a straight line running through the centres of mass of the Sun and the Earth , while L4 and L5 exist at the apexes of two equilateral triangles formed between Earth and the Sun .
L2 , the Herschel and Planck target , is located 1.5 million kilometres from our planet , on the side of Earth opposite the Sun .
As they orbit the Sun -Earth system , the spacecraft will also orbit around the L2 point , following a complex ' Lissajous ' pattern .
This orbit is inherently unstable , and both spacecraft will need regular thruster burns throughout their missions - about once per month - to stay on track .
" Without regular trajectory corrections , they would naturally drift off into a useless orbit about the Sun or Earth , with the rate of drift increasing with time , " says Gienger .
The trade - off , however , is that the L2 location provides an almost perfect vantage point from which to conduct both missions ' scientific observations , which depend on maintaining a clear view of the universe while minimising influence from the Earth or Sun 's gravity , heat or radiation .
Flight Dynamics team members have exhaustively developed and tested possible trajectory scenarios for the two missions since 2005 , but the final test will only come after launch , when the spacecraft are on their way .
Throughout the critical LEOP period , the two - month voyage to L2 and during the missions ' routine phases , ESA 's Flight Dynamics team will play a crucial role in day - to - day mission operations .
" In spaceflight , there is always a little uncertainty in determining the actual orbits and in the results of thruster burns .
How the missions actually perform is always at least a little bit of a surprise .
But the team is ready and we expect the spacecraft to perform very well , " says Gienger .
Again to sum up , TechEd 2009 has brought us fresh headlines for Windows 7 , Office 2010 , and Windows Mobile 6.5 .
So , what else is worth talking about ?
How about the Microsoft Surface .
The company quietly ( sans press release ) announced that Service Pack 1 for the super - duper coffee table has been released .
Apparently the service pack is the result of feedback from more than 180 partners in 11 countries who are developing on the Microsoft Surface .
SP1 is meant to make development on the platform faster and easier : the SDK supports development on any .NET framework and is optimized for WPF and XNA .
Surface can run multiple applications simultaneously , but only with SP1 is it easy to tell if an application in the background needs your attention , thanks to a small notification on the side .
Surface is also now easier to set up since you can calibrate without needing to plug in an external display .
SP1 gives users more visual feedback about where they 've touched and where they should have touched to select a specific item .
Also , where applicable , Surface will let the user know that he or she cannot zoom into a specific object by showing lines leading away from the object .
Below is a quick list of features that have been added ; I think the Microsoft Update one is the most important one ( and it probably should have been there from the start ) :
Application Development : API enhancements , WFP library and menu controls , stress testing tool , and 128 - big identity tag resources
New platform capabilities : Enabling users to quickly switch between applications using tagged object routing , as well as background service application support
Improved User Interface : Improved " Access Points , " single application mode , touch / contact feedback and visualization
Localized end-user and administrative interface in available countries
New calibration guides removing need for external display during configuration
Microsoft Update integration
Microsoft Management Pack support
CrunchGear has a video ( embedded below ) that gives you a peek into what SP1 adds to the Surface .
I can't promise the video will be as cool as the iPhone and Surface mashup , but it definitely helps with explaining some of the new features .
If you already own a Surface and you 'd like SP1 , you 'll need an SP1 order form , which you can get by e-mailing the Microsoft Surface Business Desk with the subject heading " SP1 Upgrade Request " or by downloading the order form from the Microsoft Surface Community website .
At TechEd 2009 , Microsoft also noted that although Windows 7 will only have two - finger gesture support and the first Windows phones will have single - figure gesture support , the company is looking to standardize touch gestures across its products .
SP1 includes new and improved multi - touch controls that are coming later to .NET 4 and that will make it easier to create applications that run on both Surface and Windows 7 .
Brad Carpenter , general manager of the Surface SW Platform , explains the software giant 's thinking :
There 's lots of interest around multi-touch and NUI [ Natural User interface ] inside Microsoft and that 's great , but making sure we have consistency is important .
We are at the stage where we are internally driving to an agreement about what is the right set of gestures , but we have to think about this across devices .
But a flick needs to be a flick needs to be a flick ; the gesture - and the underlying response - should be the same .
On one device it should n't take forever to get across the screen .
Getting the same touch gestures across all Microsoft platforms is very important if Redmond wants to be a key player in this type of computing .
Currently it wo n't be very easy to achieve this because the hardware is n't readily available to the general market , but eventually one would hope that the software giant can achieve this goal .
It would be nice to only learn one set of gestures and be able to use them on various devices .
The Prahran Football Club has been ordered to appear before the Victorian Amateur Football Association following reports a stripper performed for players before a game .
The Herald Sun newspaper says the club will appear before the association 's integrity subcommittee tonight to explain the incident from May 1 .
Victorian Premier John Brumby says he is angered by the reports and says that conduct sends all the wrong messages .
" It 's completely inappropriate behaviour .
We 're trying to encourage people to play sport , then you read about a football club that gets a stripper in before a game , " he said .
" They need to be offering , I would have thought , some public apologies about this matter .
It is just an appalling example to set [ for ] young people and families , " he said .
Michael Sholly , the chief executive officer of the Victorian Amateur Football Association , says if the club has been found guilty of unbecoming conduct it could be fined , lose premiership points or forfeit games .
He says the association views the incident very seriously and said it is clearly inappropriate behaviour before a game .
" It 's certainly a one - off in our association , this is the first time in our 120 years that we 've had an incident like this , so that 's why we 've asked them to come in and just advise us of exactly what happened , " he said .
" We want to get all the facts before we make a statement about what actually occurred . "
There may be no way to improve Tara Reid 's acting ability .
But friends and family members say the treatment program this troubled actress is undergoing has already improved her outlook on life .
" She 's doing well .
The whole family is very positive about this being the new beginning for her , " a source told People Magazine .
The American Pie star checked herself in to Promises Treatment Center in early December ; those close to the actress are optimistic about her future .
" They are taking steps to do everything they can to help Tara keep on the right track , " said the source , adding that Reid is expected to check out of the center any week now .
Sculpting in Driftwood – the beginning …
“ … the answer is staring you in the face – if only you can see it ”
Depression can appear to be without antidote .
For years I struggled with it , even though I made a good living from my paintings and to the observer , my life typified the creative dream .
Horses had always been my passion and the accuracy of my portraits bore testimony to years spent in close observation drawing them in the field , but despite this they did not satisfy me .
I ached to find a unique artistic expression .
In search of it I had tried all manner of different approaches , mediums and subject matters but nothing really worked for me .
It had to be possible for me to do better .
Then I tried sculpture , but the same thing happened .
Whatever I did , my work remained a pale imitation of countless other artists .
I was at that time using copper wire which , braised together , resembled Leonardo da Vinci ’s drawings but the work still lacked the power of authenticity .
I repeatedly tended towards over finishing and the results were weak and uninspired .
After months of struggle , one dark day , I sat in my studio utterly bereft of ideas .
I was at my lowest ebb and close to giving up when I remembered something I had read .
It was this :
In any given moment the answer to your problem is staring you in the face – if only you can see it .
All else had failed and I decided that I would test the theory .
There was nothing to lose .
If what I had read contained the truth then somewhere in this room , in this moment , lay the answer to my difficulty .
Somewhere in this bleak , dirty interior littered with failed attempts and debris was something I had missed .
I took a breath and sat .
I looked slowly round the room , there was nothing remarkable , and nothing I had not seen a thousand times .
My attention was taken by few bits of discarded twigs lying near the wood burner , the sort of thing that gardeners use to support peas .
That was it .
Nothing more .
I had spent hours in contemplation .
It was getting dark , I had grown cold , the cupboards were empty and I was hungry .
Disheartened I went out to stock up on groceries .
But it was as though I had been looking at a candle , the after image of the twigs and their rhythm was burned on my retina .
When I returned , it was to a warm house , my son had lit the wood burner with the pea sticks .
He had also chopped up a long piece of ivy that twined round a long since rotted fence post ; it had been standing dusty and forgotten in a corner of my studio .
Only a short section remained but to my so recently informed eye , it was a horse ’s torso complete with saddle .
Filled with a sudden deep excitement I picked it up and placed it into the copper wire form I had been working on .
An astonishing transformation took place as the horse came alive with great force .
I had never seen anything like it before .
It perfectly expressed what I had been seeking and I knew with certainty that I finally held the key in my hand to a way of working that felt uniquely my own .
The rest of the journey is still unfolding , thirty years on .

In a move that surprised absolutely no one , the GOP announced with fake trepidation that it was cool with dudes marrying dudes .
And for that matter , chicks marrying chicks .
It ’s not because all the closeted homosexuals in the Republican party got tired of living double lives or being hypocrites .
Nah , the whole thing came down to money and power .
From that article in the Times :
The other reason , members of both parties said , is that the argument over gay marriage seems beside the point at a time when the country is facing a severe economic crisis , remains on edge for another domestic terrorist attack and has just inaugurated its first black president .
Of course it seems beside the point to the Dems ; they ’re winning !
As for the GOP — that ’s right , your civil rights are less important than money !
Ah , we exaggerate .
Not about the money and power angle .
No !
That ’s legit .
We mean the gays marrying thing .
It ’s not so much that the GOP likes gay marriage .
They ’ve just realized that their party base is dying — literally — and that younger people generally do n’t give a shit about who does what to whom in the privacy of his and his own home .
Here ’s the bury - the - we - no - longer - hate - gays - because - it - suits - us - monetarily strategy :
The GOP tells its constituents that a scary black man is going to take their money .
( And scary black men taking money are far less scary than this gay guy . )
Then , the GOP quietly lets outrage in its party over tacit approval of gay marriage die with all the old people who hate the gays , or think that two men getting it on threatens the fabric of the American family or some shit .
( They ’re busy protesting over not having money they never had . )
Then , they draw everyone back when Obama fails .
And then — BANG ! — Charlie Crist ( secretly gay ) secures the Republican nomination in 2012 .
It ’s so crazy , it just might work !
At some points it can get quite annoying ...
It can get annoying at some bits and pieces in the song , but It 's perfect in every other way .
I can see this in some futuristic teenager hangout , I know I 'd be there ... heh .
I swear ,
When you pump up the bass to it you can actually feel the heartbeat of the song .
Even though the heartbeat stops in some parts ... >.>
Anyways , this is one badass song , man ... If they still had the rank system this would be platinum ...
( CNN ) -- Consumers who bought " Caylee Sunshine " dolls and Michael Vick dog toys were misled into believing that a portion of their purchases would go to charity , according to a lawsuit filed this week .
The " Caylee Sunshine " doll cost $ 29.99 before Showbiz Promotions halted its production .
The Florida Attorney General 's Office filed a lawsuit Thursday against Showbiz Promotions and its owner , Jaime Salcedo , seeking $ 10,000 in penalties for each violation under the state 's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act .
But Salcedo denies the allegations , saying he has been trying to resolve the disputes and compensate charitable organizations .
The Jacksonville - based entrepreneur claims he has been working with the attorney general 's office for more than one year to settle the issue .
The suit also asks that Salcedo stop running the Web site , www.cayleedoll.com, his short - lived vehicle for selling dolls that critics said were modeled after slain Florida toddler Caylee Anthony .
Salcedo says the doll was not meant to be Caylee , but rather a tribute to her memory .
The dispute began with the attorney general 's investigation into complaints about dog chew toys in the likeness of suspended NFL star Michael Vick , who is serving a federal prison sentence for his role in a dogfighting operation .
Consumers said they ordered and paid for merchandise from the company but did not receive the items , according to the lawsuit .
The lawsuit also claims that Showbiz Promotions told consumers that a portion of the proceeds would go to local animal shelters , another promise Salcedo allegedly never made good on .
" Defendant Salcedo began cooperating with the Attorney General and made attempts to either make delivery on consumer orders for the Vick Dog Chew Toy or to provide refunds .
However , numerous consumer complaints remain unresolved , " the complaint alleges .
But Salcedo claims the scope of the damage is less extensive .
Of 200 complaints that he says the attorney general 's office received , all but 10 were resolved .
" Those people purchased on PayPal , so the only way I had to get in touch was going though e-mail .
If they do n't respond , then I can't help them , " he said in a telephone interview Friday .
Salcedo also insists that his company made donations to animal shelters in forms of merchandise , including Vick chew toys , T - shirts and hats .
" They 'd rather have $ 100 in toys because they can sell them or auction them off , " he said .
" We said they could have either and every time they said they wanted the toys . "
The suit also addresses Salcedo 's promotion of the Caylee Sunshine Doll and other members of the Sunshine Doll Collection , including Gracie Sunshine and Hope Sunshine .
The dolls set off a firestorm of controversy with its launch in January , drawing allegations that Showbiz Promotions was attempting to profit off the death of Caylee Anthony , whose mother is facing trial for her murder .
Members of the public , media pundits and the Anthony family called for production of the dolls to be halted .
One month later , Showbiz Promotions pulled the plug on the Sunshine Collection , citing high manufacturing costs and tepid consumer response .
The company had fulfilled just five orders and provided refunds for 20 , according to Salcedo .
The lawsuit alleges that the product 's Web site , www.cayleedoll.com, falsely claimed that " 100 % of the profits " from the Sunshine Doll Collection would go to charity , accusing Salcedo of fabricating a donation receipt and posting it on the site so visitors could view " the first donation " made to charity .
The receipt -- a purported screen grab from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children 's Web site -- shows an " online credit card donation confirmation " for $ 5,000 in the name of Showbiz Promotions , according to the lawsuit .
Salcedo says he never posted any such image on the site .
The alleged receipt is attached as an exhibit to the lawsuit , along with another purported receipt in Salcedo 's name that the attorney general 's office says is the only existing NCMEC donation associated with Salcedo or Showbiz Promotions .
See exhibits attached to the lawsuit
" The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children confirmed that their records showed that a donation was made by Jaime Salcedo on March 12 , 2009 at [ 5:28 p.m. ] in the amount of $ 10 , " the lawsuit states .
" The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children confirmed that they had no record of a donation from Showbiz Promotions in any amount or any additional donation from Jaime Salcedo . "
Salcedo insists that the receipt for $ 5,000 is not real -- and says his company had nothing to do with it .
" They 're saying this was posted on our Web site and clearly it was not .
That is clearly something that someone made and sent to them and they 're jumping the gun , " he said .
Furthermore , he does not deny making a $ 10 donation to NCMEC out of his own pocket .
" We had nothing left to give to charity apart from what I give every year , which is $ 10 , " he said .
" If giving $ 10 every year to charity is a crime , then I 'm guilty . "

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Pope Benedict XVI ’s outreach tour of the Middle East this week failed to placate critics still smarting from his riot - inciting comments in a 2006 speech at Germany ’s Regensburg University .
The pontiff at that time quoted 15th - century Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Paleologus who said : “ Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman , such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached . ”
The pope said he regrets any hurt feelings , but some Muslims want more contrition .
Sheik Yusef Abu Hussein , mufti of Karak in Jordan , said , “ We wanted him to clearly apologize .
What the pope said about the prophet Muhammad is untrue .
Islam did not spread through the power of sword .
It ’s a religion of tolerance and faith . ”
A recent post on a jihadist Web site took a somewhat different tone , denouncing “ this cursed Pope ” and calling on its readers to “ strive to kill him , strive to slaughter him . ”
That Muslim poster must have missed the sermon on tolerance and faith .
Paleologus , the Byzantine emperor , was something of an authority on Muslim military power .
He spent much of his reign defending his hard - pressed realm from the predatory Ottoman Empire .
Before ascending to the throne , he spent a year in the court of Sultan Bayezid I as an honorary hostage and was forced to accompany the Ottoman army that conquered Philadelphia , the last Christian bastion in Anatolia .
The city was renamed Alasehir , the city of Allah .
Those who object to the idea that Islam was spread by the sword are not at war with Pope Benedict but with history .
What are now called Muslim lands used to be Christian , Jewish and Zoroastrian lands .
Force was the key element in the rapid expansion of the caliphate in the century between the death of Muhammad in 632 and the Muslim defeat at the hands of the Franks in the Battle of Tours in 732 in what is now southern France .
The rules of engagement were laid down in the Hadith Sahih Muslim 19:4294 , which instructs Muslims to offer any unbelievers they encounter three choices : to convert , pay tribute or be forcibly subjugated .
The martial underpinnings of Muslim expansion conveniently are summarized in the flag of Saudi Arabia , which features the Shahada , the first pillar of Islam , underlined by a sword .
According to the Web site of the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the sword was added in 1906 , “ symbolizing the military successes of Islam ” as well as those of founding King Ibn Saud .
Muslims who object stridently to the implication they are not peace - loving would have a stronger claim if Islam ’s most ardent proponents did not resort instantly to violence over perceived slights .
The Muslim world ’s supposed universal culture of tolerance also is open to question .
Muslims in the West enjoy freedoms that frequently are denied in the Middle East , such as repairing their ancient houses of worship or publicly discussing their faith .
Islam is the only major religion in which it is settled religious law that those who convert to another religion face the death penalty .
The pope is brave to stand by his faith .
Mutual respect can only come when both sides face reality and embrace history , warts and all .
It is plainly farcical to assert that Islam was never spread by the sword , just as it would be historically inaccurate to say Christians and Jews never raised the sword .
If apologies are in order , we are still waiting for any apology from the Muslim world for the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .

The mountains have been mapped in detail for the first time by bouncing radar signals off their hidden surface and observing how long they took to return .
The highest peak was found to be 2,434 m ( 7,985 ft ) above sea level , about twice the height of Ben Nevis .
A new type of air - fuelled battery called the STAIR ( St Andrews Air ) cell could give up to ten times the energy storage of designs currently available , meaning a new generation of batteries for electric cars , mobile phones and laptops .
The new design has the potential to improve the performance of portable electronic products and give a major boost to the renewable energy industry .
The batteries will enable a constant electrical output from sources such as wind or solar , which stop generating when the weather changes or night falls .
Improved capacity is thanks to the addition of a component that uses oxygen drawn from the air during discharge , replacing one chemical constituent used in rechargeable batteries today .
Not having to carry the chemicals around in the battery offers more energy for the same size battery .
Reducing the size and weight of batteries with the necessary charge capacity has been a long - running battle for developers of electric cars .

Oxygen drawn from the air reacts within the porous carbon to release the electrical charge in this lithium - air battery .
Credit : University of St AndrewsThe STAIR cell should be cheaper than today ’s rechargeables too .
The new component is made of porous carbon , which is far less expensive than the lithium cobalt oxide it replaces .
This four - year research project , which reaches its halfway mark in July , builds on the discovery at the university that the carbon component ’s interaction with air can be repeated , creating a cycle of charge and discharge .
Subsequent work has more than tripled the capacity to store charge in the STAIR cell .
Principal investigator on the project , Professor Peter Bruce of the Chemistry Department at the University of St Andrews , says : “ Our target is to get a five to ten fold increase in storage capacity , which is beyond the horizon of current lithium batteries .
Our results so far are very encouraging and have far exceeded our expectations .
” “ The key is to use oxygen in the air as a re-agent , rather than carry the necessary chemicals around inside the battery , ” says Bruce .
The oxygen , which will be drawn in through a surface of the battery exposed to air , reacts within the pores of the carbon to discharge the battery .
“ Not only is this part of the process free , the carbon component is much cheaper than current technology , ” says Bruce .
He estimates that it will be at least five years before the STAIR cell is commercially available .
The project is focused on understanding more about how the chemical reaction of the battery works and investigating how to improve it .
The research team is also working towards making a STAIR cell prototype suited , in the first instance , for small applications , such as mobile phones or MP3 players .
The research work , funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , is being led by researchers at the University of St Andrews with partners at Strathclyde and Newcastle .

Law prof Eugene Volokh blogs about a U.S. House of Representatives bill proposed by Rep. Linda T. Sanchez and 14 others that could make it a federal felony to use your blog , social media like MySpace and Facebook , or any other web media " To Cause Substantial Emotional Distress Through " Severe , Repeated , and Hostile " Speech . "
Oh lordy , there goes 4 chan .
Here 's the relevant text :
Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication , with the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person , using electronic means to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both … .
[ " Communication " ] means the electronic transmission , between or among points specified by the user , of information of the user 's choosing , without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received ; … [ " Electronic means " ] means any equipment dependent on electrical power to access an information service , including email , instant messaging , blogs , websites , telephones , and text messages .
Jacob Sullum at Reason thinks the proposed law is stupid , too .
It was bad enough that a grandstanding U.S. attorney successfully prosecuted Lori Drew , a Missouri woman who participated in a cruel MySpace prank that apparently precipitated the 2006 suicide of 13 - year - old Megan Meier , under an anti-hacking law that clearly was not intended for this sort of situation .
Now Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - Calif. ) and 14 of her colleagues want to make such prosecutions easier through a breathtakingly broad bill that would criminalize a wide range of speech protected by the First Amendment .
The Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention
Act would make it a felony punishable by up to two years in prison to transmit an electronic communication ( " including email , instant messaging , blogs , websites , telephones , and text messages " ) " with the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person …to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior .

Giant jellyfish are taking over parts of the world 's oceans due to overfishing and other human activities , researchers say .
Nomura jellyfish are the biggest in the world and can grow as big as a sumo wrestler .
They weigh up to 200 kilograms and can reach 2 metres in diameter .
Dr Anthony Richardson and his colleagues from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research says jellyfish numbers are increasing , particularly in South East Asia , the Black Sea , the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea .
" We need to take management action to avert the marine systems of the world flipping over to being jellyfish dominated , " says Dr Richardson , who is also a marine biologist at the University of Queensland .
He says the Japanese have a real problem with giant jellyfish that burst through fishing nets .
He says other researchers are experimenting with different ways of controlling jellyfish , including using sound waves to explode jellyfish and using special nets to try and cut them up .
Overfishing
Dr Richardson and his colleagues reviewed literature linking jellyfish blooms with overfishing and eutrophication ( high levels of nutrients ) .
Jellyfish are normally kept in check by fish , which eat small jellyfish and compete for jellyfish food such as zooplankton , he says .
But with overfishing , jellyfish numbers are increasing .
Jellyfish feed on fish eggs and larvae , further impacting on fish numbers .
To add insult to injury , nitrogen and phosphorous in run-off cause red phytoplankton blooms , which create low - oxygen dead zones where jellyfish survive , but fish cannot .
" You can think of them like a protected area for jellyfish , " Dr Richardson says .
The researchers say climate change may also encourage more jellyfish and they have postulated for the first time that these conditions can lead to what they call a " jellyfish stable state " , in which jellyfish rule the oceans .
Taking action
The team recommends a number of actions in its paper , published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution and released to coincide with World Oceans Day .
They say it is important to reduce overfishing , especially of small pelagic fish like sardines , and to reduce run-off .
They also say it is important to control the transport of jellyfish around the world in ballast water and aquariums .
Jellyfish are considered simple jelly - like sea animals , which are related to the microscopic animals that form coral .
They generally start their life as a plant - like polyp on the sea bed before budding off into the well - known bell - shaped medusa .
Jellyfish have tentacles containing pneumatocyst cells , which act like little harpoons that lodge in prey to sting and kill them .
The location and number of pneumatocysts dictate whether jellyfish are processed for human consumption .
While dried jellyfish with soya sauce is a delicacy served in Chinese weddings and banquets , not all kinds of jellyfish can be eaten , Dr Richardson says .
According to Dr Richardson , the species increasing in number are not generally eaten .
Karta 's keepers say she is ingenious , but has been known to cause problems
An orangutan used a branch to short - circuit a security fence and escape from an Australian zoo , only to change her mind and return to her enclosure .
Karta , a 27 - year - old primate , cleared one fence and began piling up debris to scale a wall at Adelaide Zoo .
Visitors who witnessed the escape alerted staff , and the zoo was promptly evacuated and closed for the day .
But Karta spent less than 30 minutes on the loose before apparently thinking better of her escape attempt .
Zoo curator Peter Whitehead told reporters the ape seemed to realise she was in a place where she should not have been .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" She 's actually hung on to the wall and dropped back into the exhibit , " he said .
It was not the first time Karta had caused a headache for the zookeepers .
" You 're talking about an animal that 's highly intelligent , " Mr Whitehead said .
" We 've had issues with her before in normal day - to - day operations where she tries to outsmart the keepers .
She 's an ingenious animal . "
The zoo offered a refund to visitors after closing down for the day , but few zoo - goers seemed flustered by the drama .
Ryan Johnston , 11 , told ABC News he had seen Karta 's escape , and described it as " amazing " .

Although the Great Depression engulfed the world economy many years ago , it lives on as a nightmare for individuals old enough to remember and as a frightening specter in the textbooks of our youth .
Some 13 million Americans were unemployed , " not wanted " in the production process .
One worker out of every four was walking the streets in want and despair .
Thousands of banks , hundreds of thousands of businesses , and millions of farmers fell into bankruptcy or ceased operations entirely .
Nearly everyone suffered painful losses of wealth and income .
Many Americans are convinced that the Great Depression reflected the breakdown of an old economic order built on unhampered markets , unbridled competition , speculation , property rights , and the profit motive .
According to them , the Great Depression proved the inevitability of a new order built on government intervention , political and bureaucratic control , human rights , and government welfare .
Such persons , under the influence of Keynes , blame businessmen for precipitating depressions by their selfish refusal to spend enough money to maintain or improve the people 's purchasing power .
This is why they advocate vast governmental expenditures and deficit spending — resulting in an age of money inflation and credit expansion .
Classical economists learned a different lesson .
In their view , the Great Depression consisted of four consecutive depressions rolled into one .
The causes of each phase differed , but the consequences were all the same : business stagnation and unemployment .
The Business Cycle
The first phase was a period of boom and bust , like the business cycles that had plagued the American economy in 1819 – 1820 , 1839 –1843 , 1857–1860 , 1873–1878 , 1893 –1897 , and 1920 – 1921 .
In each case , government had generated a boom through easy money and credit , which was soon followed by the inevitable bust .
The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the Federal Reserve System under the Coolidge administration .
In 1924 , after a sharp decline in business , the Reserve banks suddenly created some $ 500 million in new credit , which led to a bank credit expansion of over $ 4 billion in less than one year .
While the immediate effects of this new powerful expansion of the nation 's money and credit were seemingly beneficial , initiating a new economic boom and effacing the 1924 decline , the ultimate outcome was most disastrous .
It was the beginning of a monetary policy that led to the stock - market crash in 1929 and the following depression .
In fact , the expansion of Federal Reserve credit in 1924 constituted what Benjamin Anderson in his great treatise on recent economic history ( Economics and the Public Welfare , D. Van Nostrand , 1949 ) called " the beginning of the New Deal . "
The Federal Reserve credit expansion in 1924 also was designed to assist the Bank of England in its professed desire to maintain prewar exchange rates .
The strong US dollar and the weak British pound were to be readjusted to prewar conditions through a policy of inflation in the United States and deflation in Great Britain .
The Federal Reserve System launched a further burst of inflation in 1927 , the result being that total currency outside banks plus demand and time deposits in the United States increased from $ 44.51 billion at the end of June 1924 , to $ 55.17 billion in 1929 .
The volume of farm and urban mortgages expanded from $ 16.8 billion in 1921 to $ 27.1 billion in 1929 .
Similar increases occurred in industrial , financial , and state and local government indebtedness .
This expansion of money and credit was accompanied by rapidly rising real - estate and stock prices .
Prices for industrial securities , according to Standard & Poor 's common stock index , rose from 59.4 in June of 1922 to 195.2 in September of 1929 .
Railroad stock climbed from 189.2 to 446.0 , while public utilities rose from 82.0 to 375.1
A Series of False Signals
The vast money and credit expansion by the Coolidge administration made 1929 inevitable .
Inflation and credit expansion always precipitate business maladjustments and malinvestments that must later be liquidated .
The expansion artificially reduces and thus falsifies interest rates , and thereby misguides businessmen in their investment decisions .
In the belief that declining rates indicate growing supplies of capital savings , they embark upon new production projects .
The creation of money gives rise to an economic boom .
It causes prices to rise , especially prices of capital goods used for business expansion .
But these prices constitute business costs .
They soar until business is no longer profitable , at which time the decline begins .
In order to prolong the boom , the monetary authorities may continue to inject new money until finally frightened by the prospects of a runaway inflation .
The boom that was built on the quicksand of inflation then comes to a sudden end .
The ensuing recession is a period of repair and readjustment .
Prices and costs adjust anew to consumer choices and preferences .
And above all , interest rates readjust to reflect once more the actual supply of and demand for genuine savings .
Poor business investments are abandoned or written down .
Business costs , especially labor costs , are reduced through greater labor productivity and managerial efficiency , until business can once more be profitably conducted , capital investments earn interest , and the market economy function smoothly again .
After an abortive attempt at stabilization in the first half of 1928 , the Federal Reserve System finally abandoned its easy - money policy at the beginning of 1929 .
It sold government securities and thereby halted the bank credit expansion .
It raised its discount rate to 6 percent in August 1929 .
Time - money rates rose to 8 percent , commercial paper rates to 6 percent , and call rates to the panic figures of 15 percent and 20 percent .
The American economy was beginning to readjust .
In June 1929 , business activity began to recede .
Commodity prices began their retreat in July .
The security market reached its high on September 19 and then , under the pressure of early selling , slowly began to decline .
For five more weeks , the public nevertheless bought heavily on the way down .
More than 100 million shares were traded at the New York Stock Exchange in September .
Finally it dawned upon more and more stockholders that the trend had changed .
Beginning with October 24 , 1929 , thousands stampeded to sell their holdings immediately and at any price .
Avalanches of selling by the public swamped the ticker tape .
Prices broke spectacularly .
Liquidation and Adjustment
The stock market break signaled the beginning of a readjustment long overdue .
It should have been an orderly liquidation and adjustment followed by a normal revival .
After all , the financial structure of business was very strong .
Fixed costs were low as business had refunded a good many bond issues and had reduced debts to banks with the proceeds of the sale of stock .
In the following months , most business earnings made a reasonable showing .
Unemployment in 1930 averaged under 4 million , or 7.8 percent of labor force .
In modern terminology , the American economy of 1930 had fallen into a mild recession .
In the absence of any new causes for depression , the following year should have brought recovery as in previous depressions .
In 1921 –1922 , the American economy recovered fully in less than a year .
What , then , precipitated the abysmal collapse after 1929 ?
What prevented the price and cost adjustments and thus led to the second phase of the Great Depression ?
Disintegration of the World Economy
The Hoover administration opposed any readjustment .
Under the influence of " the new economics " of government planning , the president urged businessmen not to cut prices and reduce wages , but rather to increase capital outlay , wages , and other spending in order to maintain purchasing power .
He embarked upon deficit spending and called upon municipalities to increase their borrowing for more public works .
Through the Farm Board , which Hoover had organized in the autumn of 1929 , the federal government tried strenuously to uphold the prices of wheat , cotton , and other farm products .
The GOP tradition was further invoked to curtail foreign imports .
The Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act of June 1930 , raised American tariffs to unprecedented levels , which practically closed our borders to foreign goods .
According to most economic historians , this was the crowning folly of the whole period from 1920 to 1933 and the beginning of the real depression .
" Once we raised our tariffs , " wrote Benjamin Anderson ,
an irresistible movement all over the world to raise tariffs and to erect other trade barriers , including quotas , began .
Protectionism ran wild over the world .
Markets were cut off .
Trade lines were narrowed .
Unemployment in the export industries all over the world grew with great rapidity .
Farm prices in the United States dropped sharply through the whole of 1930 , but the most rapid rate of decline came following the passage of the tariff bill .
When President Hoover announced he would sign the bill into law , industrial stocks broke 20 points in one day .
The stock market correctly anticipated the depression .
The protectionists have never learned that curtailment of imports inevitably hampers exports .
Even if foreign countries do not immediately retaliate for trade restrictions injuring them , their foreign purchases are circumscribed by their ability to sell abroad .
This is why the Smoot - Hawley Tariff
Act which closed our borders to foreign products also closed foreign markets to our products .
American exports fell from $ 5.5 billion in 1929 to $ 1.7 billion in 1932 .
American agriculture customarily had exported over 20 percent of its wheat , 55 percent of its cotton , 40 percent of its tobacco and lard , and many other products .
When international trade and commerce were disrupted , American farming collapsed .
In fact , the rapidly growing trade restrictions , including tariffs , quotas , foreign - exchange controls , and other devices were generating a worldwide depression .
Agricultural commodity prices , which had been well above the 1926 base before the crisis , dropped to a low of 47 in the summer of 1932 .
Such prices as $ 2.50 a hundredweight for hogs , $ 3.28 for beef cattle , and 32 ¢ a bushel for wheat plunged hundreds of thousands of farmers into bankruptcy .
Farm mortgages were foreclosed until various states passed moratoria laws , thus shifting the bankruptcy to countless creditors .
Rural Banks in Trouble
The main creditors of American farmers were , of course , the rural banks .
When agriculture collapsed , the banks closed their doors .
Some 2,000 banks , with deposit liabilities of over $ 1.5 billion , suspended between August 1931 , and February 1932 .
Those banks that remained open were forced to curtail their operations sharply .
They liquidated customers ' loans on securities , contracted real - estate loans , pressed for the payment of old loans , and refused to make new ones .
Finally , they dumped their most marketable bond holdings on an already depressed market .
The panic that had engulfed American agriculture also gripped the banking system and its millions of customers .
The American banking crisis was aggravated by a series of events involving Europe .
When the world economy began to disintegrate and economic nationalism ran rampant , European debtor countries were cast in precarious payment situations .
Austria and Germany ceased to make foreign payments and froze large English and American credits ; when England finally suspended gold payments in September 1931 , the crisis spread to the United States .
The fall in foreign bond values set off a collapse of the general bond market , which hit American banks at their weakest point — their investment portfolios .
Depression Compounded
Nineteen
Thirty - One was a tragic year .
The whole nation , in fact , the whole world , fell into the cataclysm of despair and depression .
American unemployment jumped to more than 8 million and continued to rise .
The Hoover administration , summarily rejecting the thought that it had caused the disaster , labored diligently to place the blame on American businessmen and speculators .
President Hoover called together the nation 's industrial leaders and pledged them to adopt his program to maintain wage rates and expand construction .
He sent a telegram to all the governors , urging cooperative expansion of all public - works programs .
He expanded federal public works and granted subsidies to ship construction .
And for the benefit of the suffering farmers , a host of federal agencies embarked upon price - stabilization policies that generated ever larger crops and surpluses , which in turn depressed product prices even further .
Economic conditions went from bad to worse , and unemployment in 1932 averaged 12.4 million .
In this dark hour of human want and suffering , the federal government struck a final blow .
The Revenue Act of 1932 doubled the income tax , the sharpest increase in the federal tax burden in American history .
Exemptions were lowered , " earned income credit " was eliminated .
Normal tax rates were raised from a range of 11 / 2 to 5 percent to a range of 4 to 8 percent , surtax rates from 20 percent to a maximum of 55 percent .
Corporation tax rates were boosted from 12 percent to 133 / 4 and 141/ 2 percent .
Estate taxes were raised .
Gift taxes were imposed with rates from 3 / 4 to 331/ 2 percent .
A 10 percent gasoline tax was imposed , a 3 percent automobile tax , a telegraph and telephone tax , a 2 ¢ check tax , and many other excise taxes .
And finally , postal rates were increased substantially .
When state and local governments faced shrinking revenues , they , too , joined the federal government in imposing new levies .
The rate schedules of existing taxes on income and business were increased and new taxes imposed on business income , property , sales , tobacco , liquor , and other products .
Murray Rothbard , in his authoritative work on America 's Great Depression ( Van Nostrand 1963 ) , estimates that the fiscal burden of federal , state , and local governments nearly doubled during the period , rising from 16 percent of net private product to 29 percent .
This blow , alone , would bring any economy to its knees , and shatters the silly contention that the Great Depression was a consequence of economic freedom .
The New Deal of NRA and AAA
One of the great attributes of the private - property market system is its inherent ability to overcome almost any obstacle .
Through price and cost readjustment , managerial efficiency and labor productivity , new savings and investments , the market economy tends to regain its equilibrium and resume its service to consumers .
It doubtless would have recovered in short order from the Hoover interventions had there been no further tampering .
However , when Franklin Delano Roosevelt assumed the presidency , he , too , fought the economy all the way .
In his first 100 days , he swung hard at the profit order .
Instead of clearing away the prosperity barriers erected by his predecessor , he built new ones of his own .
He struck in every known way at the integrity of the US dollar through quantitative increases and qualitative deterioration .
He seized the people 's gold holdings and subsequently devalued the dollar by 40 percent .
With some third of industrial workers unemployed , President Roosevelt embarked upon sweeping industrial reorganization .
He persuaded Congress to pass the National Industrial Recovery Act ( NIRA ) , which set up the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) .
Its purpose was to get business to regulate itself , ignoring the antitrust laws and developing fair codes of prices , wages , hours , and working conditions .
The president 's Re-employment Agreement called for a minimum wage of 40 ¢ an hour ( $ 12 to $ 15 a week in smaller communities ) , a 35 - hour work week for industrial workers and 40 hours for white - collar workers , and a ban on all youth labor .
This was a naive attempt at " increasing purchasing power " by increasing payrolls .
But , the immense increase in business costs through shorter hours and higher wage rates worked naturally as an antirevival measure .
After passage of the act , unemployment rose to nearly 13 million .
The South , especially , suffered severely from the minimum - wage provisions .
The act forced 500,000 Negroes out of work .
Nor did President Roosevelt ignore the disaster that had befallen American agriculture .
He attacked the problem by passage of the Farm Relief and Inflation Act , popularly known as the First Agricultural Adjustment Act .
The objective was to raise farm income by cutting the acreages planted or destroying the crops in the field , paying the farmers not to plant anything , and organizing marketing agreements to improve distribution .
The program soon covered not only cotton , but also all basic cereal and meat production as well as principal cash crops .
The expenses of the program were to be covered by a new " processing tax " levied on an already depressed industry .
NRA codes and AAA processing taxes came in July and August of 1933 .
Again , economic production which had flurried briefly before the deadlines , sharply turned downward .
The Federal Reserve index dropped from 100 in July to 72 in November of 1933 .
Pump - Priming Measures
When the economic planners saw their plans go wrong , they simply prescribed additional doses of federal pump priming .
In his January 1934 budget message , Mr. Roosevelt promised expenditures of $ 10 billion while revenues were at $ 3 billion .
Yet the economy failed to revive ; the business index rose to 86 in May of 1934 , and then turned down again to 71 by September .
Furthermore , the spending program caused a panic in the bond market , which cast new doubts on American money and banking .
Revenue legislation in 1933 sharply raised income - tax rates in the higher brackets and imposed a 5 percent withholding tax on corporate dividends .
Tax rates were raised again in 1934 .
Federal estate taxes were brought to the highest levels in the world .
In 1935 , federal estate and income taxes were raised once more , although the additional revenue yield was insignificant .
The rates seemed clearly aimed at the redistribution of wealth .
According to Benjamin Anderson ,
the impact of all these multitudinous measures — industrial , agricultural , financial , monetary and other — upon a bewildered industrial and financial community was extraordinarily heavy .
We must add the effect of continuing disquieting utterances by the president .
He had castigated the bankers in his inaugural speech .
He had made a slurring comparison of British and American bankers in a speech in the summer of 1934 … .
That private enterprise could survive and rally in the midst of so great a disorder is an amazing demonstration of the vitality of private enterprise .
Then came relief from unexpected quarters .
The " nine old men " of the Supreme Court , by unanimous decision , outlawed NRA in 1935 and AAA in 1936 .
The Court maintained that the federal legislative power had been unconstitutionally delegated and states ' rights violated .
These two decisions removed some fearful handicaps under which the economy was laboring .
NRA , in particular , was a nightmare with continuously changing rules and regulations by a host of government bureaus .
Above all , voidance of the act immediately reduced labor costs and raised productivity as it permitted labor markets to adjust .
The death of AAA reduced the tax burden of agriculture and halted the shocking destruction of crops .
Unemployment began to decline .
In 1935 it dropped to 9.5 million , or 18.4 percent of the labor force , and in 1936 to only 7.6 million , or 14.5 percent .
A New Deal for Labor
The third phase of the Great Depression was thus drawing to a close .
But there was little time to rejoice , for the scene was being set for another collapse in 1937 and a lingering depression that lasted until the day of Pearl Harbor .
More than 10 million Americans were unemployed in 1938 , and more than 9 million in 1939 .
The relief granted by the Supreme Court was merely temporary .
The Washington planners could not leave the economy alone ; they had to earn the support of organized labor , which was vital for reelection .
The Wagner Act of July 5 , 1935 , earned the lasting gratitude of labor .
This law revolutionized American labor relations .
It took labor disputes out of the courts of law and brought them under a newly created federal agency , the National Labor Relations Board , which became prosecutor , judge , and jury , all in one .
Labor-union sympathizers on the board further perverted the law that already afforded legal immunities and privileges to labor unions .
The United States thereby abandoned a great achievement of Western civilization : equality under the law .
" The vast money and credit expansion by the Coolidge administration made 1929 inevitable . "
The Wagner Act , or National Labor Relations Act , was passed in reaction to the Supreme Court 's voidance of NRA and its labor codes .
It aimed at crushing all employer resistance to labor unions .
Anything an employer might do in self - defense became an " unfair labor practice " punishable by the board .
The law not only obliged employers to deal and bargain with the unions designated as the employees ' representative ; later board decisions also made it unlawful to resist the demands of labor - union leaders .
Following the election of 1936 , the labor unions began to make ample use of their new powers .
Through threats , boycotts , strikes , seizures of plants , and outright violence committed in legal sanctity , they forced millions of workers into membership .
Consequently , labor productivity declined and wages were forced upward .
Labor strife and disturbance ran wild .
Ugly sit - down strikes idled hundreds of plants .
In the ensuing months , economic activity began to decline and unemployment again rose above the ten-million mark .
But the Wagner Act was not the only source of crisis in 1937 .
President Roosevelt 's shocking attempt at packing the Supreme Court , had it been successful , would have subordinated the judiciary to the executive .
In the US Congress , the president 's power was unchallenged .
Heavy Democratic majorities in both houses , perplexed and frightened by the Great Depression , blindly followed their leader .
But when the president strove to assume control over the judiciary , the American nation rallied against him , and he lost his first political fight in the halls of Congress .
There was also his attempt at controlling the stock market through an ever - increasing number of regulations and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
" Insider " trading was barred , high and inflexible margin requirements imposed and short selling restricted , mainly to prevent repetition of the 1929 stock - market crash .
Nevertheless the market fell nearly 50 percent from August of 1937 to March of 1938 .
The American economy again underwent dreadful punishment .
Other Taxes and Controls
Yet other factors contributed to this new and fastest slump in US history .
The Undistributed Profits
Tax of 1936 struck a heavy blow at profits retained for use in business .
Not content with destroying the wealth of the rich through confiscatory income and estate taxation , the administration meant to force the distribution of corporate savings as dividends subject to the high income - tax rates .
Though the top rate finally imposed on undistributed profits was " only " 27 percent , the new tax succeeded in diverting corporate savings from employment and production to dividend income .
" When Franklin Delano Roosevelt assumed the presidency , he , too , fought the economy all the way … "
Amidst the new stagnation and unemployment , the president and Congress adopted yet another dangerous piece of New Deal legislation : the Wages and Hours Act or Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 .
The law raised minimum wages and reduced the work week in stages to 44 , 42 , and 40 hours .
It provided for time - and - a - half pay for all work over 40 hours per week and regulated other labor conditions .
Again , the federal government thus reduced labor productivity and increased labor costs — ample grounds for further depression and unemployment .
Throughout this period , the federal government , through its monetary arm , the Federal Reserve System , endeavored to reinflate the economy .
Monetary expansion from 1934 to 1941 reached astonishing proportions .
The monetary gold of Europe sought refuge from the gathering clouds of political upheaval , boosting American bank reserves to unaccustomed levels .
Reserve balances rose from $ 2.9 billion in January 1934 , to $ 14.4 billion in January of 1941 .
And with this growth of member - bank reserves , interest rates declined to fantastically low levels .
Commercial paper often yielded less than 1 percent , bankers ' acceptances from 1 / 8 percent to 1 / 4 percent .
Treasury - bill rates fell to 1 / 10 of 1 percent and Treasury bonds to some 2 percent .
Call loans were pegged at 1 percent and prime customers ' loans at 11 / 2 percent .
The money market was flooded and interest rates could hardly go lower .
Deep - Rooted Causes
The American economy simply could not recover from these successive onslaughts by first the Republican and then the Democratic administrations .
Individual enterprise , the mainspring of unprecedented income and wealth , did n't have a chance .
The calamity of the Great Depression finally gave way to the holocaust of World War II .
When more than 10 million able - bodied men had been drafted into the armed services , unemployment ceased to be an economic problem .
And when the purchasing power of the dollar had been cut in half through vast budget deficits and currency inflation , American business managed to adjust to the oppressive costs of the Hoover - Roosevelt " Deals . "
The radical inflation in fact reduced the real costs of labor and thus generated new employment in the postwar period .
" The professors of earlier years were as guilty as the political leaders of the 1930s . "
Nothing would be more foolish than to single out the men who led us in those baleful years and condemn them for all the evil that befell us .
The ultimate roots of the Great Depression were growing in the hearts and minds of the American people .
It is true , they abhorred the painful symptoms of the great dilemma .
But the large majority favored and voted for the very policies that made the disaster inevitable : inflation and credit expansion , protective tariffs , labor laws that raised wages and farm laws that raised prices , ever higher taxes on the rich and distribution of their wealth .
The seeds for the Great Depression were sown by scholars and teachers during the 1920s and earlier when social and economic ideologies that were hostile toward our traditional order of private property and individual enterprise conquered our colleges and universities .
The professors of earlier years were as guilty as the political leaders of the 1930s .
Social and economic decline is facilitated by moral decay .
Surely , the Great Depression would be inconceivable without the growth of covetousness and envy of great personal wealth and income , the mounting desire for public assistance and favors .
It would be inconceivable without an ominous decline of individual independence and self - reliance , and above all , the burning desire to be free from man 's bondage and to be responsible to God alone .
Can it happen again ?
Inexorable economic law ascertains that it must happen again whenever we repeat the dreadful errors that generated the Great Depression .

The Muslim Canadian Congress is an organization established in 2001 that seeks to represent the Muslims in Canada who are not currently represented by another organization .
The Congress aims to give them a voice , to make their opinions heard and to have a positive effect on the community .
Their goal is to bust all of the outdated myths and misconceptions regarding the Muslim faith , beliefs and customs , and in doing so distinguishing themselves from Islamism and alleviating islamophobia .
Origins and Inception
The attacks on September 11th 2001 had a horrible effect on a lot of people , even those that were n’t directly affected by them .
Three thousand families lost their loved ones , and America mourned with them .
A country that previously stood proud as the Western giant of the world now found itself as vulnerable as any other , gripped in the vice of fear and paranoia .
But one of the biggest repercussions of the attack was that an entire religion was vilified overnight just because nineteen out of its millions of followers decided to launch a misguided attack in its name .
As horrible as it is , fear often turns into aggression , and in this case the target of said aggression were people who had absolutely nothing to do with what happened on 9/11 .
This islamophobia quickly spread out of the United States and into other countries where Muslims are a minority , including Canada .
Fearing the safety of their community , in December of 2001 many Canadian Muslims from the Toronto area , under the leadership of Tarek Fatah , decided to unite and create the Muslim Canadian Congress .
Their hope was to distinguish themselves and the Muslim community from the Islamist movement by promoting “ separation of religion and state in all matters of public policy ” – in other words , the exact opposite of what the Islamists are fighting for .
Goals and Stances
The Muslim Canadian Congress quickly established itself as a more liberal - thinking ( as opposed to the highly conservative Islamism movement ) with their stances on various controversial subjects .
Their only belief is that all Muslims should adhere to the 5 commandments of the Qur’an – faith in God , regular prayers , paying a tax to the poor , fasting for a month every year and a once in a lifetime visit to Hajj .
In their own words , all other rules and laws that are commonly associated with Islam , such as burkas and Shariah Law , are not actually rules from the prophet Mohammed and , if they cause more harm than good , need to be eliminated from practice .
The Congress firmly believes in freedom of speech and freedom of expression .
They hold the distinction of being the very first Muslim group that has openly supported the rights of gays and lesbians , going as far as to write op - eds on the subject in newspapers .
Another one of their core ideologies is that men and women are completely equal , which is very different from more conservative Muslim organizations that often do not allow men and women to pray on the same floor of their mosques , with some communities even requiring them to wear burkas ( black clothes that only expose the woman ’s eyes ) .
The Congress has openly fought to ban this practice , citing not only gender equality , but also security concerns over how easy a woman could conceal her identity by wearing a burka .
A notable example of their stance in action is the 2007 controversy surrounding author Mark Steyn , whose magazine column was called “ Islamophobic ” and attacked by several members of the Canadian Islamic Congress .
The MCC contested the allegations , or rather , the Islamic Congress ’ reaction to the column , stating that it “ has only given credence to [ Steyn ’s ] premise – that Muslims in the West cannot accept the values of individual freedom , a free press and the right to offend … ”
The polite ( economists ’ ) term for theft is wealth redistribution .
Economists ( apart from the Rothbard school ) leave out the adjectives : coercive , aggressive , violent , forceful , involuntary .
Much of U.S. politics is coercive wealth redistribution .
Much of politics is theft .
As such , it is not above being called criminal .
In the past two years , theft through politics for bailouts has risen to a minimum of $ 13 trillion in the U.S .
This does not include the Obama spending bill ( $ 700 billion ) .
By comparison , the largest estimate of private crime I have found is $ 1.7 trillion annually ( double earlier estimates . )
The bailouts are forcible wealth transfers ( or guarantees of such ) from taxpayers , current and future , to various financial institutions and to various classes of investors .
Rather than these persons bearing their own losses , the government and Federal Reserve are shifting their losses to taxpayers .
When it comes to politics as theft , the range of it is extensive , covering nearly all political actions .
Taking from the young to support the old is theft .
Forcing a man to sell his stock of face masks at reduced prices during an epidemic is theft .
Price controls on bread are theft .
Being forced to pay taxes to provide health care for others is theft .
Inflation is theft .
If one argues against bailouts , one cannot turn around and argue for Social Security without avoiding the fact that both are thefts .
If one does , one can only argue that the bailout theft is bad and the Social Security theft is good .
Such arguments about which theft the society will undertake are arguments about who will whip whom and how many lashes will be doled out .
These arguments are embroidered in our society by complex voting procedures .
They are part of the mechanisms of the politics .
The politics itself remains the politics of theft .
Every society has governance in various forms .
Persons wish to maintain their lives and property and do with them what they will .
This leads to conflicts .
A social group has to solve the problems of property : what it is , who lawfully owns it , what the ownership rights are , and what the rights of the property - owner are in exchange and transfer .
A social group has to solve the problems of behavior that damages others or torts .
It has to solve the problem of obligations or contracting and enforcement of obligations or contracts .
These problems may be grouped together and called social or political or governmental .
Politics as theft solves these problems using force .
The alternative to politics as theft is politics as justice .
Politics is an aggregate term .
There are many acts of politics .
Some involve theft .
Others involve justice .
There is no bright line that we cross that tells us we have changed from one regime to the other .
Our society is rife with politics as theft .
When the ways of theft are learned , the ways of justice are forgotten .
They atrophy or are put aside , until the day they are brushed off and brought back .
Politics as violence is habitual .
It is built into the structure of the entire system .
It is built into the ways of thinking about and approaching any and all problems .
The use of force comes without thought .
It is what lies at hand .
It is the habitual tool .
Politics as justice is alive .
It never dies .
But it slumbers in hibernation , ready to be awakened .
We have put it to sleep .
Politics as theft is politics as injustice .
When many of us give no thought to politics as justice , or when we have a difficult time imagining what the politics of justice looks like , or when we can imagine no other politics but the politics of theft , we are confirming the dominance of the politics of injustice .
When schools teach injustice and theft as justice , when pulpits advocate injustice as justice , and when the media trumpet the injustices of government power , politics as theft and as injustice is in full force .
It has a thorough hold on our society .
" None calleth for justice , nor any pleadeth for truth : they trust in vanity , and speak lies ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity . "
( Isaiah 59:4 . )
" Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Let it suffice you , O princes of Israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice , take away your exactions from my people , saith the Lord GOD . " ( Ezekiel 45:9 . )

Mohamad Anwar , 32 , was killed by two Komodo dragons after trespassing in Komodo National Park in order to gather fruit according to CNN .
Anwar was declared dead on arrival to a clinic on Flore Island from loss of blood .
While attacks by Komodo dragons , the world ’s largest lizard , are rare , a series of recent attacks have garnered international attention .
Last year a group of divers fought off attacks by the giant lizards while awaiting rescue .
In 2007 a local boy aged 9 was killed by the dragons .
Most recently , a park ranger survived an attack by a Komodo dragon who climbed into his hut .

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , conservationists have run into criticism by some local villagers who accuse environmentalists of protecting Komodo dragons at the expense of human safety .
Populations of both humans and dragons have risen on the islands , although there is no evidence that attacks have actually risen as a result .
A recent ban on deer hunting by the Komodo National Park is meant to provide the Komodo dragon with ample prey .
Komodo dragons only survive on the island of Komodo and a few neighboring islands with an estimated 4,000 - 5,000 individuals .
They are listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Redlist .

Virgin dragon to give birth this Christmas
( 12/20/2006 )
A virgin Komodo dragon will give birth to offspring this Christmas ( or thereabouts ) at the Chester Zoo in Britain according to researchers .
Flora , a female Komodo dragon , will reproduce asexually in a process called parthenogenesis , where eggs become embryos without male fertilization .
The process is known to occur in about 70 reptile species but had n’t been observed in Komodo dragons — the world ’s largest lizard species — until this year .
Another dragon , Sungai , had virginal conception earlier this year .
Both cases are described in Thursday ’s issue of the journal Nature
Contract workers walked out of Longannet on Monday
Contractors at Longannet power station who have been on strike are to return to work after a deal was reached to end the dispute at Lindsey Oil Refinery .
About 150 staff walked out of the Fife site on Monday , in support of sacked staff at the refinery in Lincolnshire .
A deal has now been struck to end the bitter jobs dispute at Lindsey , which could see 647 sacked staff reinstated .
Almost 200 staff had also downed tools at the Cockenzie power station in East Lothian and Mossmorran plant in Fife .
Unions had urged the Longannet contractors to return to work , but they twice voted to continue with their stoppage .
Mass meeting
The wildcat action - which has taken place in Scotland , Wales and England - was called in support of workers who were sacked from the Lindsey refinery , owned by oil company Total .
The Lindsey workers went on strike on 11 June after a sub - contractor cut 51 jobs .
The strikers were dismissed by Total and told to reapply for their jobs .
It is thought the 51 sub - contractors will also be offered jobs under the deal agreed by union leaders and employers .
The agreement will be put to a mass meeting on Monday .
The strike has not affected power production .
Startling new figures have revealed that on average there are 10 jobseekers for every vacancy advertised in the UK .
In one area of the south - east , 60 workers are available for each job .
This week , as unemployment is expected to burst through the 2 million barrier , The Observer can reveal that the spectre of mass unemployment is forcing the government to reinforce job centres , with civil servants diverted from child maintenance and disability claims .
Already 600 staff working for the Child Support Agency , which has been renamed the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission , and 300 Pensions , Disability and Carers Service staff have been asked to work with the growing number of unemployed , to the anger of charities .
The full extent of the jobs misery is shown in a nationwide analysis by the TUC .
In some parts of the country , the task facing jobseekers is critical .
The Isle of Wight has more unemployed workers per new job than any other area .
In total , there are 3,152 people chasing 52 advertised vacancies , as its main industries of tourism and manufacturing suffer from the credit crunch .
" These shocking figures blow out of the water the government 's claim that there are plenty of jobs available for people who are prepared to look , " said Brendan Barber , the TUC general secretary .
As unemployment has risen in recent months , Gordon Brown and James Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , have stressed the large number of job opportunities available , but the research shows that they are heavily outnumbered by unemployed workers .
When Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire held a recruitment day recently to hire 150 staff , it attracted a crowd of up to 3,000 people .
Central London emerges from the TUC 's research as another unemployment blackspot , where the number of vacancies is far exceeded by unemployed workers .
There are just 4,275 vacancies across the 12 inner London boroughs , against almost 71,000 unemployment benefit claimants .
Hackney , in east London , has 37 claimants for every new job .
The claimant count , a key measure of unemployment , is expected to show a sharp rise for February of up to 90,000 , when official figures are announced on Wednesday , which would make it the worst month since the early - 1990s downturn .
On the broader measure favoured by the government , total unemployment is almost certain to hit 2 million , or 6.5 % of the workforce .
Since job losses usually lag behind an economic downturn by several months , the impact of the chaos unleashed last autumn after Lehman Brothers collapsed is unlikely to be felt until later in the spring .
" There must be a good chance that we get a 100,000 - plus monthly rise in unemployment soon , " said Michael Saunders , chief UK economist at Citigroup .
As Chancellor Alistair Darling draws up plans for his budget next month , Barber called for more help from the Treasury for the unemployed , including an increase in jobseekers ' allowance to at least £ 75 a week , from the current level of £ 60.50 .
Together with the Federation of Small Businesses , the TUC is also calling for subsidies to support firms that are putting staff on to shorter working weeks on a temporary basis .
" The government must use all available means to stem rising unemployment and provide much - needed support for those who are struggling to pay their bills , " Barber said .
" Measures such as increasing jobseekers ' allowance and introducing short - term wage subsidies could be up and running straight away and prevent unemployment reaching the levels of previous recessions . "
The revelation that the government was switching civil servants from crucial jobs to deal with the unemployed has angered charities and the opposition parties .
Shadow work and pensions secretary Theresa May said : " If Labour had n't been so negligent in closing a job centre every week during 2008 , when unemployment was rising , we would n't be in this situation .
" We support measures to help job centres struggling with the increased workload during the recession .
However , I have serious concerns about the knock - on effect this will have on the CMEC and its ability to chase absent fathers who are dodging paying maintenance . "
A DWP spokesperson said : " Where there is no operational risk to the departments ' services , we will loan or transfer staff from other areas of DWP , but our main focus has been to hire staff externally and so far we have recruited 4,000 new staff to cope with rising demand in job centres . "
As job losses mount across the economy , analysts are becoming increasingly worried that mass unemployment will exacerbate the downturn in consumer spending and the housing crash , and create a vicious circle .
" Looking ahead , the pressing concern now is whether the rise in unemployment will become self - sustaining by creating a negative feedback loop between demand and unemployment .
While we are perhaps not in this territory yet , this is a clear medium - term risk for the economy , " said Jonathan Loynes , of consultancy Capital Economics .
What defines a schizophrenic ?
How can we correlate social media to loss of identity ?
And would it be rational to declare that many social media users suffer from schizophrenia ?
Finally , is schizophrenia always negative ?
I can safely assume that we all agree that there exists many types of social media users online , males and females , at varying ages , roaming social media outlets for various reasons , at different times and with multiple goals and intentions .
Moreover , the changing habits of social media users seem to have a very peculiar side that I think is worth discussing and evaluating in a later post since “ many people view social media as a waste of time while others expect them to be some kind of promised land for self promotion .
Both groups will never use social media to their fullest potential .
The truth lies of course somewhere in between . ”
Whether you are a student , businessman , social media lover , super user , skeptic , time waster and so on , in my opinion , the truth of the matter remains that many social media users have one thing in common : a slight discrete schizophrenic tendency !
We all know , for a fact , that many people are just infatuated with and even more crazy about social media but is that , in return , making them a little bit crazy themselves ?
I am not talking about the infamous psychos who murder , steal , stalk and threaten national security through social media usage , I am talking about a less threatening yet more mysterious kind of mental state resulting in loss of identity !
Well , here is what I think …
Notice the trend below taking place on Reddit :
BrianBurger seems to be interested in almost everything on the Internet , so does rmuser !
With karma of over 14,000 , BrainBurger appears to be a well - rounded person whose interests expand and go beyond the norms of almost every topic online , and offline as well .
Or is he just simply unsure of who he is and what he is looking for ?
How about Twitter ’s Guy Kawasaki ‘s tweets ?
And even mine as well !?
Notice how we both tweet constantly about different unrelated topics that do not reveal anything real about our true selves ( although I do every now and then :P )
Let ’s take another example by referring to Digg ’s user irfanamp ( no offense intended ) , for example , who dugg the following articles in the period of few hours :
It is a fact that online communication is a basis for gender switching and pseudonyms .
In addition to that , it seems that online communication is taking a different turn for many users these days , towards the path of mental instability !
BrainBurger , Guy and irfanamp , do n’t you feel it , too ? :)
Throughout my research relating to this topic , I have found a variety of articles discussing the issue pertaining the possible loss of identity due to using “ broken ” social media such as Twitter , for example .
If anything , this confirmed to me my view towards possible mental damage this medium might cause and here I quote “ we are enthusiastically embracing the possible erosion of our identity through social networking sites ” .
What about avatars , especially the cartoon ones ?
Now do n’t get me wrong , I am a great fan of cartoons , funny cute ones make my heart sing !
Yet , how true are we being to our real identity when we replace it with a cartoon which many others can be using simultaneously ?
Not so true I guess !
What happened to good old day facial recognition ?
You know , when you identified others the traditional way ?
Moving on to effort and the numerous steps , tutorials and hours needed to maintain your online identity which in turn causes stress and confusion , leading to higher chances of mental impairment !
My final question here is :
Is there a real cure for this state of mind ?
If not , is there at least a way to prevent it through educating people about social media behavior and conditioning human behavior online ?
Great thanks to cerulean226 for the amazing image that helped me illustrate my point :)

OAKLAND , Calif . --
Facing pressure to crack down on crime amid a record budget deficit , Oakland is joining other U.S. cities that are turning over more law - enforcement duties to private armed guards .
The City Council recently voted to hire International Services Inc. , a private security agency , to patrol crime - plagued districts .
While a few Oakland retail districts previously have pooled cash to pay for unarmed security services , using public funds to pay for private armed guards would mark a first for the city .
Hiring ...
Following an online manhunt that turned up a long list of suspects , Fake Stephen Conroy decided to turn himself in before he could be outed .
" OK , so here it is ; Fake Stephen Conroy = Leslie Nassar , " he wrote yesterday .
Nassar 's Linked
In profile says he is a " Senior Emerging Technology Specialist ( Mobile ) " at Telstra and has previously worked for the ABC , spearheading its podcasting efforts .
Nassar confirmed this but refused to provide any further comments .
" I 've been instructed not to talk to the press , so you 'll need to talk to Telstra PR , " he said .
Telstra has not responded to calls requesting comment .
A spokesman for Senator Conroy would not comment on the fact that Fake Stephen Conroy was a Telstra staff member but said Senator Conroy was aware of the fake profile .
" Satire is an important part of any healthy democracy , " he said .
Since the profile was created in October last year , Fake Stephen Conroy has published 708 tweets and attracted 1531 followers .
He has been called on to write satirical guest articles for Crikey and ZDNet.com.au .
The trend towards fake online profiles was sparked by US journalist Daniel Lyons , who famously created the Fake Steve Jobs blog in 2006 .
Lyons was outed by The New York Times in August 2007 but not before amassing a cult following online and garnering a mention from Apple founder Steve Jobs himself .
Fake Steve Jobs was ranked 37th on Business 2.0's " 50 Who Matter Now " feature and Lyons went on in 2007 to release a book titled Options : The Secret Life Of Steve Jobs , A Parody .
Nassar followed a similar style with Fake Stephen Conroy .
Some examples of his 140 - character - or - less tweets are :
" Apparently LOL means ' Laugh Out Loud ' and not ' Lots Of Love ' .
Now I 'm going to have to re-read all those internet comments about me . " " about to board my flight to Melbourne .. nabbed seat 1B !
a person in a wheelchair was going to get it .. lucky IM CONROY !
Trump card played ! "
" When I Googled for information on how to circumvent surrogacy laws in Victoria , I bookmarked the results so we could ban the sites later . "
" The filter is a community service ; it 's not just about removing content , we can also repair content .
We can make it truthier . "
" I do n't think it 's unreasonable to compare the National Filter Network to a cure for Super - AIDS ; both of them protect children . "
" Dear journalists ; please do not continue to report on my enormous penis and ability to please the ladies .
My personal life is off - limits . "
" Today I received an I - Phone .
The IT people tell me that it is biometrically activated , but no matter how much I lick it , it wo n't turn on . "

Its an interesting concept , but perhaps it may be useful to come up with a list of programs that can be removed , startup applications that can be stopped , applications that load during boot that you do n't need ( e.g. bluetooth ) .
Something simple like :
sudo apt - get remove ekiga etc etc .
Might be useful .
Again just trying to understand how this could be effectively used .
The developers behind the GNOME project announced the official release of version 2.26 on Tuesday .
It includes several useful enhancements , new programs , and improved configuration utilities .
GNOME is an open source desktop environment for the Linux platform .
It provides a cohesive desktop user interface and an assortment of applications and utilities for messaging , multimedia , web browsing , and a variety of other tasks .
In addition to applications and user interface components , it also offers a collection of application development frameworks that have made it the nexus of a much broader software ecosystem .
GNOME serves as the foundation of the graphical environment in many popular Linux distributions .
It is built with an incremental time - based development cycle that produces new stable releases every six months .
Although each individual GNOME release is generally a bit light on new features as a result of the short cycle , changes in GNOME account for an important segment of the shared improvements that appear in distros that ship the environment .
Several Linux distros , such as Ubuntu , base their development schedule on the GNOME cycle .
Empathy improves but still is n't ready
Empathy is an instant messaging program built on the Telepathy framework .
It 's designed to provide tighter desktop integration and offer features that are currently outside the scope of Pidgin .
In this version , it has gained basic file transfer functionality ( only for XMPP at the present time ) and support for video chat with clients that support Google 's XMPP - based Jingle protocol .
Empathy was originally planned for GNOME 2.22 but was first included in GNOME 2.24 .
The program still has a lot of rough edges and has n't yet been adopted by any major Linux distribution .
Ubuntu developer Matthew Paul Thomas conducted a usability study last year in which he compared Pidgin and Empathy .
His findings led the Ubuntu desktop team to conclude that Empathy is n't quite ready yet for widespread use .
Pidgin is still shipped as the default messaging client in the upcoming Ubuntu 9.04 release .
Similarly , the Fedora development community was originally hoping to ship it in the upcoming Fedora 11 release , but identified some key problems that have compelled them to push it back and delay it until Fedora 12 .
Empathy 's highly modular design , basic video chat capabilities , and excellent support for desktop integration are all major assets .
For a growing number of users , these benefits outweigh its deficiencies and limitations .
I suspect that it only needs one or two more GNOME development cycles before it 's going to be ready to displace Pidgin in GNOME distros .
Brasero burns my eyes
The Brasero disc burning software is one of the new applications that is included in 2.26 .
GNOME 's Nautilus file manager already had built - in functionality for burning ISO file and simple data discs , but Brasero offers a wider range of features including support for creating audio CDs .
Prior to its inclusion in GNOME , Brasero was already being shipped in several Linux distributions .
I included a concise overview of its strengths and weaknesses in my review of Ubuntu 8.04 last year .
It 's improved a bit since then and has added support for video and several other features .
The project user interface , however , seems to have worsened .
They have gotten rid of the useful disc capacity meter at the bottom and replaced it with a size indicator element that is displayed next to each item in the file list .
They have also added a file filtering mechanism of some kind at the bottom of the window .
It is n't entirely clear to me what purpose it is supposed to serve , but it seems like unnecessary clutter .
I also strongly dislike the superfluous file preview feature which wastes a lot of screen space in order to display a playable video thumbnail .
The preview feature is fortunately easy to disable .
The whole programs feels uncharacteristically clunky by GNOME standards , but it 's a lot more functional than the stale and unambitious CD burning component that was included in previous versions of GNOME .
I think that Brasero is the right way forward in the long term , but the user interface really does n't please me .
My biggest complaint with the old Nautilus CD burner is that it did n't give you clear visual hints about how much space you have left when you are putting in files to burn .
The fact that Brasero dropped that feature is a bit of a disappointment .
It seems like the task of building a good disc burning UI with GTK + is not trivial and it's something that I suspect will take a skilled designer rather than a developer .
Despite the problems with Brasero 's interface , it 's really a very capable program with a rich feature set , which leaves me hopeful that it will be able to really shine someday .

If you have played an MMORPG before and have chosen to tell a non-MMORPG player about playing said MMO , there is a good chance that the person you told gave you a weird look as if he was thinking something along the lines of : “ But you do n’t look like someone who plays MMOs . ” or “ I knew it .
This person definitely looks like someone who plays MMOs . ”
This is because somehow , in the history of gaming , MMO players have been assigned an often negative stereotype .
It seems like the general public is stuck on particular notions or ideas of how MMO players live , spend their time , and interact ( or , according to them , do n’t interact ) .
Not surprisingly , many of the stereotypes and stigmas that people hold toward MMOs and MMO players are wrong .
For the rest of this blog post , I will examine some of these stigmas and stereotypes , compare them to statistical data on MMORPG player demographics and analyze whether or not there is any basis in these beliefs .
Note : Unless otherwise stated , data comes from The Daedalus Project .
Stereotype 1 : “ Almost all MMO players are male . ” ( Gender )
Actually , this stereotype is somewhat accurate .
Most players are male .
However , the percentage of male players is not as overwhelming as many people believe .
Although the percentage of male players may have been greater in the past , currently only 60 % of MMO players are male ( BBC ) and this percentage continues to shrink as more and more females are starting to play MMOs .
Stereotype 2 : “ Only single people play MMOs . ” ( Marital Status )
This stereotype is actually quite wrong .
It turns out that 36 % of MMO players are married or engaged .
Females , however , are more likely to be married / engaged than males , feeding the “ single male ” stereotype .
It is important to note that the 36 % number does not include people who are currently in relationships who are not either married or engaged , so the real number of “ non- single ” players is probably quite a bit higher than 36 % .
Stereotype 3 : “ People who play MMOs only play the game by themselves . ”
There seems to be a general belief that MMOs are solitary games where people play by themselves .
Besides the fact that what MMORPG stands for proves it wrong ( Massively Multi-playerOnline Role Playing Game , multi- player as in more than one person ) , there is statistical evidence that proves that most subscribers play and prefer to play with other people .
59 % of females and 56.5 % of males tend to group with other people .
Almost 20 % of females and 24 % of males play solo due to “ schedule constraints ” or “ lack of good groups . ” 14.4 % of females and 13.9 % of males have no preference towards grouping or soloing and only 6.6 % of females and 5.3 % of males actually prefer to play alone .
Stereotype 4 : “ People who play MMOs tend to play with strangers that they do n’t know in real life . ”
Similarly , the belief that MMO players only play with strangers that they met through the game is wrong .
80 % of players normally play with someone that they know in real life .
Of this number , 25 % play with romantic partners , with females being more likely to play an MMO with their partner .
19 % play the game with their family members .
The younger or older someone is , the more likely they are to play with a family member , with the 23 - 28 year old range being the least likely to play with a family member .
Additionally , the family member is normally a brother or son , with older female players being more likely to play the MMO with their son .
Finally , 70 % of the people that play with someone that they know in real life play the MMO with a friend .
In the younger age ranges , males were more likely to play the game with a friend , but the gender difference decreases as age increases .
Stereotype 5 : “ Most people who play MMOs are unemployed . ” ( Occupational Status )
This is another incorrect stereotype .
Everyone seems to be aware that MMOs cost a lot of money to play , yet it never occurred to them that most people would need a job to fund this play .
Over 50 % of MMO players work full - time .
Another 12 % are working part - time and / or attending school part - time .
22 % are full time students , 3 % are home - makers , 1 % are retired , and only 10 % are unemployed .
There is not a significant gender difference among the unemployed , proving that it is untrue that mainly males are unemployed .
Stereotype 6 : “ Most people spend an unhealthy amount of time playing MMOs . ” ( Hours of Play )
It is very difficult to define what “ an unhealthy amount of time ” is , so instead I ’ll compare MMO playing time to the time that an average American spends watching TV .
According to an AC Nielsen survey , the average American spends 28 hours watching TV each week .
MMO players only spend about 21 hours per week on their game of choice , but only 7.7 hours per week watching TV .
This brings them to about 29 hours spent on TV and MMOs combined , which is very close to the national TV “ watching time ” average .
This suggests that MMO players are no less healthy in their habits than the average American TV watcher , whether you consider that amount of time to be “ unhealthy ” or not .
With these facts in mind , it is clear that many of the stereotypes about MMO players are quite wrong .
Although there are certainly people out there who fit the classic MMO player stereotypes , there is no data to support that these stereotypes can be fairly applied to MMO players as a whole .
Indeed , MMO players are a very diverse crowd , with only one similarity necessarily in common : they ’re there to have fun .
Researchers may have found a way to extract large amounts of natural gas from methane hydrates -- ice - like structures that might contain more energy than all the world 's coal , oil and conventional natural gas combined .
Massive amounts of frozen natural gas are buried far below the ocean floor and Arctic permafrost , but the compounds are highly unstable when they experience changes in temperature or pressure .
Until now , scientists have struggled to find how to economically extract usable fuel from them .
But Columbia University researchers believe they may have discovered ideal conditions for separating gas from the ice , and they have developed an apparatus to help them do that .
Methane hydrates , also known as " ice that burns , " form when natural gas from microbial activity or organic decomposition gets trapped within water molecules at low temperature and high pressure .
Research has begun to find the best way to unlock the energy potential of hydrates under permafrost .
The energy source -- which scientists and industry have known about for nearly 200 years but only recently have begun considering as a viable energy alternative -- would be reached using conventional drilling techniques .
But when holes are drilled into the permafrost , the reservoir containing the hydrates is depressurized , which causes the hydrates to become unstable and decompose , said Marco Castaldi , a chemical engineer at Columbia .
" Whenever gas expands , it cools , " Castaldi said .
" As hydrates decompose , it produces cooling , which re-establishes another equilibrium and creates more hydrates . "
To avoid that scenario , scientists have used heat to break down hydrates in a stable manner .
Demonstration projects have pumped steam into the reservoir to produce a steady flow of gas .
But Castaldi said that method is extremely inefficient .
" Often you 're using more energy to make the steam than you 're producing , " he said .
" When you put in more energy than you get out , it does n't make sense . "
And that is where Castaldi 's research comes into play .
Castaldi and his colleagues in Columbia 's Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering have developed a localized non-steam heat source -- a fuel - burning apparatus that would be placed down the drill hole -- to provide the heat needed to decompose the hydrates and produce a steady stream of methane .
And he said preliminary tests have found their combustion method to be highly efficient : 50 percent or more .
Efficiently maintaining natural gas production could be a key step toward boosting industrial - scale methane production from hydrates , the researchers suggest in a study published in a recent edition of Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research .
But field testing of a down - hole heating system is likely five to eight years away , Castaldi said , due in large part to the economic crisis and a recent period of tight supply .
Climate impact
The Columbia method has an added benefit , Castaldi said :
It can produce fuel in an essentially carbon - neutral way .
The combustion process that heats the reservoir produces carbon dioxide and water -- two ingredients necessary to form another type of hydrate .
CO2 hydrates form at a higher temperature than methane hydrates , Castaldi said .
" That 's exactly the direction you want , " he said .
" As things cool down , carbon dioxide forms a hydrate , so it gets sequestered . "
He said scientists are still conducting research , but preliminary tests show the method can sequester at least as much carbon as produced in the combustion process .
" It 's at least carbon neutral , " he said , " but there are indications it could be carbon negative . "

世代別ガベージコレクタ JavaSEデフォのGC。新世代はめちゃくちゃ早い変わりにFullGCが走ると非常に遅くなるという特徴がある。メモリの使用量や旧世代へいくオブジェクトの生成頻度を把握してコンカレントGCを設定したほうが良い。
個人的にはかなりオススメできない。ゲームのみならずIDEやアプリケーションサーバー等ヒープの使用量が多いアプリの場合FullGCの停止時間が馬鹿にならないためだ。例えばWebアプリで普段1秒でGCが終了しているところに、たまに1分くらいまたされるGCが発生した場合どうなるだろう。フリーズしたとユーザーは考えるのではないだろうか。 起動オプション -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=1 - Xms28M - Xmx28 M - noclassgc

Will sez , " The Department of Justice is using secretive prison facilities on U.S. soil , called Communication Management Units , to house inmates accused of being tied to ' terrorism ' groups .
They overwhelmingly include Muslim inmates , along with at least two animal rights and environmental activists . "
It is difficult to discern the rationale behind why some inmates are transferred to the CMU and others are not .
For instance , John Walker Lindh , the " American Taliban , " is housed at the CMU in Terre Haute .
He pleaded guilty to supporting the Taliban and carrying a rifle and grenades on the battlefield in Afghanistan .
However , the government announced last month it is actually easing restrictions on his communication .
In the case of Andy Stepanian , he was one of six codefendants , and by the admission of prosecutors he was one of the minor players in the case .
He is not accused of any violent crime or any property destruction , and had no disciplinary problems while incarcerated .
Stepanian received the second - lowest sentence of the group , and his codefendants are not in CMUs .
Daniel McGowan 's notice of transfer to the CMU gives some indication of the government 's reasoning .
It says that he has been identified " as a member and leader in the Earth Liberation Front ( ELF ) and Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) , groups considered domestic terrorist organizations . "
But in a letter from the CMU , McGowan wrote : " It 's funny - I have like 13 codefs [ codefendants ] + there are 11 other eco prisoners and I end up here . "
Part of the explanation for his transfer to the CMU , it seems , is that he is a vocal , prominent activist with a large group of active supporters .
For McGowan , his near celebrity status within the environmental movement , along with his continued activism , has become a liability .
When I attended his sentencing hearing in Eugene , Ore. , in 2006 , the judge made a point of criticizing his media appearances and his website , SupportDaniel.org .
Suppose that you are travelling abroad and you need to access some Internet sites that are not available abroad .

In his recent report , James Hamilton states that :
With hindsight , it is hard to deny that the price rose too high in July 2008 , and that this miscalculation was influenced in part by the flow of investment dollars into commodity futures contracts .
It is worth emphasizing , however , that the two key ingredients needed to make such a story coherent — a low price elasticity of demand , and the failure of physical production to increase — are the same key elements of a fundamentals - based explanation of the same phenomenon .
I therefore conclude that these two factors , rather than speculation per se , should be construed as the primary cause of the oil shock of 2007 - 08 .
Hamilton continues :
At a minimum it is clear that something other than housing deteriorated to turn slow growth into a recession .
That something , in my mind , includes the collapse in automobile purchases , slowdown in overall consumption spending , and deteriorating consumer sentiment , in which the oil shock was indisputably a contributing factor …
Eventually , the declines in income and house prices set mortgage delinquency rates beyond a threshold at which the overall solvency of the financial system itself came to be questioned … had there been no oil shock , we would have described the U.S. economy in 2007 :Q4-2008:Q3 as growing slowly , but not in a recession .
Hamilton acknowledges early on in his report that the proportion of income spent on energy is an important determinant of consumer spending patterns .
The theory is fairly simple : if energy expenditures rise faster than income , then the share of income for other things besides purchasing energy must decline , such as spending on mortgage payments for a second home in Las Vegas .
In other words , rapid , large increases in energy prices may curtail consumption enough to trigger larger financial problems – like the bursting of a housing bubble – that when aggregated across an economy may cause or contribute significantly to a recession .
Figure 1 shows petroleum expenditures by consumers as a share of total GDP .
Monthly data for 2008 was annualized so that each value represents what the petroleum expenditures as a share of GDP would have been had the expenditures remained the same until the end of 2008 ( i.e. the value in March of 2008 represents what the annual expenditures would have been if the level of expenditures in March remained constant for all of 2008 ) .
We did this because the increase and subsequent decline in prices and consumer spending occurred within one year , so that using annual averages actually “ annualizes - out ” the volatility of the data .
Figure 1 shows that slow economic growth and even recessions tend to occur when petroleum expenditures reach about 5 or 6 % of GDP .
This relation seems to be consistent for the major recessions but not for the minor recessions that occurred in 1990 – 1991 and 2001 .
However , a clearer picture is painted by looking at the year on year change in GDP and the year on year change in percent of GDP spent on petroleum expenditures ( Figure 2 ) .
In this graph it is clear that rapid increases in the price of oil leads to rapid increases in the percent of GDP spent on petroleum which is followed by a slowing of economic growth , i.e. a recession .
Although neither correlation nor causation between expenditures and recessions are tested explicitly in these figures , the implication is certainly present .
Every major and minor recession in the past 38 years was proceeded by a rapid increase in prices and expenditures on petroleum .
This does not mean that recessions are caused , or caused solely by increasing oil prices or expenditures on petroleum , rather that it is a common pre-condition for recessions .
Often there are exogenous and / or endogenous factors that seem to exacerbate the economic climate during times of high petroleum prices and expenditures , which taken together , can cause a recession .
The major recessions of the 70’s and early 80 ’s were driven clearly by exogenous supply perturbations , while the recession of the early 2000 ’s ( dot- com bubble ) and the current recession ( housing bubble ) were driven by endogenous financial problems .
Nonetheless , the common factor to all of these recessions was a rapid and large increase in expenditures on petroleum .
The next phase of this research will test statistically for correlation and causation within this data set .
We welcome any comments / critiques / alternative theories .
When I was a summer intern at The Times ' editorial page in 2004 , I expressed some surprise to an editor that , nearly a year after Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor and Sacramento seemed to have passed the peak of its 2003 budget crisis , the state was still in a bad enough spot for the paper to continue publishing editorials under its " Reinventing California " tagline .
The editor smiled and replied , " Ah , the naivete of our youth , " implying that I was wrong to have ever expected the state 's fiscal nightmare to end with the election of a new governor .
How right she was .
Nearly five years later , the state 's situation remains so dire that many prominent voices have re-calibrated their criticism of the people and interests that control Sacramento , taking aim instead at the very Constitution that sets the rules for governing California .
The state needs a constitutional convention , they say , and the Times ' editorial board endorsed the idea last week :
There have been calls for months now to convene a state constitutional convention and , in essence , start over .
It 's a good idea .
The state Constitution runs to two fat volumes in print and is padded each year by new voter initiatives or legislative propositions .
In the end , it 's just a document .
It 's not the enemy .
But retooling is one necessary step to make the state function better ....
No convention -- in fact , no statewide fix -- will work if it consists simply of one interest group 's shopping list .
The Times has made no secret of its position against the two - thirds legislative threshold for tax increases and budgets , and we will keep pushing to overturn it .
But the point is to get more ideas on the table .
Prepare for the season of reform and reinvention .
A tax reform commission is to release its report in July .
Political parties and candidates will focus on next year 's gubernatorial election .
It 's not time to back away from government ; it 's time to engage it , and change it .
Over the coming weeks and months , this page will not be shy about asking questions and offering suggestions .
Bring on the ideas .
Bring on the convention .
UC Irvine law school Dean Erwin Chemerinsky took to our Op - Ed pages this week to throw some cold water on the idea :
My experience as chairman of a similar convention -- an elected commission created in 1997 to propose a new Los Angeles city charter -- makes me skeptical that a constitutional convention can provide a solution to the serious problems that face the state .
It 's not that I disagree about the roots of the crisis .
The California Constitution is deeply flawed and desperately needs revision ....
But is a constitutional convention the best path to a solution ?
Even if there is a constitutional convention , and even if it does come up with a coherent and meaningful package of proposed changes , it 's uncertain that that package would ever be adopted .
There are countless controversial issues that could doom it .
For example , if the revised constitution protects a right to marriage equality for gays and lesbians , a significant number of voters will oppose it on that basis alone .
Fellow Anteater Bernard Grofman , a UC Irvine political science professor , suggested in his May 27 Blowback that Californians should be given the chance to vote on ballot measure to repeal " all special - interest budgeting in one fell swoop . "
In last week 's Dust - Up , Tom Campbell and Daniel J.B. Mitchell floated their ideas to end the state 's perpetual financial crisis .
Forbes columnist Peter Robinson today called for a constitutional overhaul :
Jim Wunderman , president of the Bay Area Council , a business group , has begun calling for a constitutional convention .
The current constitution , Wunderman argues , is so long , convoluted and encrusted with amendments that Californians ought to toss it out and start again from scratch .
To keep the political class from taking over the convention , Wunderman wants to choose delegates from the state jury pool .
Does that sound like placing trust in chance ?
If so , you 've got the idea .
Ordinary Californians , redesigning the entire state government .
William F. Buckley Jr. once said , " I would rather be governed by the first 400 names in the Boston telephone book than by the faculty of Harvard University . "
Me ?
I 'd rather be governed by a few hundred jurors from Los Angeles , San Francisco , San Jose , Irvine , San Diego , Bakersfield , Fresno , Modesto and Stockton than by all the lobbyists and union officials in Sacramento .
It is , as I said , a beautiful idea .
Never let a good crisis go to waste , as the saying du jour goes , and ideas for fixing California are indeed flowing .

Mystery at 13,000 feet :
What jet pilot saw over Liberty FAA looks into what pilot saw over Liberty
The FBI , the Federal Aviation Administration and the Liberty County Sheriff ’s Department met Tuesday to compare notes on an unidentified flying object reported late last week by an ExpressJet Airlines pilot .
The pilot reported a “ missile or rocket ” flying near his airplane Friday at 8:09 p.m. , shortly after takeoff from Bush Intercontinental Airport , according to sheriff ’s officials .
“ The FAA then contacted the Liberty County department dispatcher and reported their pilot reported an object flying straight at his aircraft and passed 100 feet under it , ” said Ken DeFoor , chief deputy for the Liberty County Sheriff ’s Department .
FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap said the agency was aware of the sighting .
“ While we have no information to indicate there was a criminal act we certainly do not rule anything out and certainly would not want to speculate on what it may or may not have been , ” she said .
The flight was over the southern edge of Liberty County flying at 13,000 feet when the incident occurred , officials said .
ExpressJet flies regional routes for Continental Airlines as Continental Express .
“ We have n’t found anything yet — either something on the ground where it launched or on the ground where it came down , ” said Liberty County Sheriff ’s Cpl. Hugh Bishop .
DeFoor said the agencies consolidated their notes and information at the meeting .
“ The FAA is in the process of debriefing the pilot today ( Tuesday ) , ” he said .
“ We are going to try and come up with a more definite track of this object and its path .
We are trying to find out where it came from , where it went , and who may be responsible for it . ”
The Continental Express jet was on a commercial flight to Greenville , S.C .
“ No people were injured and no evasive action on part of the airplane was taken , ” DeFoor said .
DeFoor said he was aware of local hobbyists who fire rockets but did not know if any were in the area at the time .
“ We 're checking with club owners and presidents , ” he said .
“ If we can get a correct track of what this object was there is no need to check with hobby fields . ”
DeFoor said if the object was a rocket , it was fired illegally .
“ They have to have permits to use the airspace , ” he said .
In May 2008 , a Continental Airlines pilot reported a similar incident .
“ It was the same situation , almost identical , ” DeFoor said .
“ The FBI are pulling their records on that one .
It was roughly in the same area almost a year ago . ”
The Boeing 737 , en route to Cleveland , Ohio , with 148 passengers , was not damaged .
“ We looked into that , along with the FAA and some local law enforcement , ” Dunlap said .
“ To my knowledge , it was never determined what may of been observed during that incident . ”
The FAA referred all questions about Friday ’s incident to the Liberty County Sheriffs Department .

Away in the constellation of Cassiopeia some 7,100 light - years from Earth , a star 40 times more massive than our Sun is blowing a giant bubble of its own material into space .
Inside its magic blue sphere , the gigantic star burns at blue flame intensity – rendering a 6 light year wide envelope of hot gas around it that ’s expanding outward at a speed of 4 million miles per hour .
Are you ready to open wide and step inside ?
Then welcome to a little dimensional magic ….
As always , whenever we present a dimensional visualization it is done in two fashions .
The first is called “ Parallel Vision ” and it is much like a magic eye puzzle .
When you open the full size image and your eyes are the correct distance from the screen , the images will seem to merge and create a 3D effect .
However , for some folks , this does n’t work well – so Jukka has also created the “ Cross Version ” , where you simply cross your eyes and the images will merge , creating a central image which appears 3D .
For some folks , this wo n’t work either …
But I hope it does for you !
As the central star in NGC 7635 sheds its material , we can see it is n’t even and its appearance varies with the thickness of the surrounding gases .
What appears to be cloud - like structures are very thick and illuminated by the star ’s intense ultraviolet light .
Believe it or not , it is here where the stellar “ winds ” blow the fastest and it wo n’t be long until these areas quickly erode .
However , there is one feature that stands out more than any other – the “ bubble - within - a - bubble ” .
What is it ?
It may be two distinct winds …
Two distinct streamers of material colliding together .
“ The bubble in NGC 7635 is the result of a fast stellar wind expanding into the interior of the larger H II region .
However , the central star BD +60 2522 is appreciably offset ( by about 1′ ) from the center of the bubble in the direction of the wall of the dense molecular cloud that defines this blister H II region . ” says B.D. Moore ( et al ) , “ This offset is the result of evolution of the wind bubble into the density and pressure gradient established by the photoevaporative flow away from the cavity wall .
The physical conditions around the bubble vary according to the medium into which the bubble is expanding .
Away from the cavity wall the bubble is expanding into the low density interior of the H II region .
Toward the wall , in the region of our images , the wind termination shock is very near the ionization front .
The resulting physical structure , in which the photoevaporative flow away from the cloud wall is confined by the ram pressure of the wind . ”
But , are we not seeing the proverbial forest because we ’re too busy looking at the trees ?
“ BD +60 is the ionizing star of NGC 7635 , the so - called “ Bubble Nebula ” .
NGC 7635 lies at the edge of a low - density clumpy molecular cloud and the nebula can be interpreted as a wind - blown bubble created by the interaction of the stellar wind of BD +60 with the ambient interstellar medium .
While many investigations have focused on the nebula , little attention has been paid to the star itself . ” says G. Rauw ( et al ) , “ Considerable progress in our understanding of the stellar winds of early - type stars has been achieved through extensive monitoring of their spectroscopic variability and the discovery that some of the cyclical variations could be related to a rotational modulation of the stellar wind .
Since rotation is believed to shape the winds of Oef stars , these objects appear a priori as good candidates to search for a rotational wind modulation . ”
Throughout their long term observing campaign , the group found strong profile variability on time scales of 2 – 3 days , variability on time scales of a few hours that might be related to non-radial pulsations , and even tentatively propose that the beating of several non-radial pulsation modes triggers transient large - scale density perturbations in a confined stellar wind that produce the 2 –3 day time scale variability .
“ While this scenario could easily account for the lack of a single stable period ( through the effect of the propagation velocity of the perturbation and the interplay of various clocks : pulsations , rotation … ) , it seems more difficult to explain the changing pattern of the TVS .
For instance , if a density wave moves around the star , why would it not affect the absorption and the emission components in a similar manner ? ” says Rauw , “ One possibility could be that the density perturbation affects the absorption column only as long as it remains close to the stellar surface whilst the impact on the emission lines would be larger when the perturbation has moved outwards , but this is admittedly still rather speculative . ”
Just how common is it for a huge star to form a bubble around itself ?
“ Massive stars evolve across the HR diagram , losing mass along the way and forming a variety of ring nebulae .
During the main sequence stage , the fast stellar wind sweeps up the ambient interstellar medium to form an interstellar bubble .
After a massive star evolves into a red giant or a luminous blue variable , it loses mass copiously to form a circumstellar nebula .
As it evolves further into a WR star , the fast WR wind sweeps up the previous mass loss and forms a circumstellar bubble .
Observations of ring nebulae around massive stars not only are fascinating , but also are useful in providing templates to diagnose the progenitors of supernovae from their circumstellar nebulae . ” says You - Hua Chu of the University of Illinois Astronomy Department , “ The fast stellar wind of a main sequence O star sweeps up the ambient interstellar medium ( ISM ) to form an interstellar bubble , which consists of a dense shell of interstellar material .
Intuitively , we would expect around most O stars an interstellar bubble similar to the Bubble Nebula ( NGC 7635 ) to be visible ; however , hardly any O stars in HII regions have ring nebulae , suggesting that these interstellar bubbles are rare . ”
Like a child chewing gum , the bubble will continue to expand .
And what comes after the bubble ?
Why , the “ bang ” of course .
And when it comes to a star going bang , than can only mean a supernova .
“ By pursuing the calculation through the various stages of massive star evolution , using a realistic mass loss history as input , we simulate the creation and evolution of a wind - blown bubble around the star up to the time of the supernova explosion . ” says A. J. van Marle ( et al ) , “ The outflowing matter encounters an inner shock , where its velocity is reduced to nearly zero .
The kinetic energy of the wind becomes thermal energy .
This interaction creates a “ hot bubble ” of nearly stationary , hot gas .
The thermal pressure of the hot bubble drives a shell into the surrounding interstellar medium .
Here it is assumed , that the pressure driven shell will be restrained only by the ram pressure created by its own velocity and the density of the surrounding medium .
This assumption is correct if we consider the surrounding medium to be cold .
However , if we take photo- ionization into account the situation becomes rather more complicated .
First of all , the photoionized gas will have a much higher pressure than the cold ISM .
Therefore , the HII region will expand , driving a shell into the ISM .
Second , the hot - bubble created by the stellar wind will now expand into a hot HII region , which means that the thermal pressure restraining the shell , will no longer be negligible compared to the ram pressure .
A wind - blown bubble expanding into a compact HII region can be observed in NGC 7635 . ”
So how do we know when the final moments have come ?
“ As the star ages , it becomes a red supergiant with a dense and slow wind .
The number of ionizing photons drops .
Therefore , the HII region disappears .
Owing to the low density , recombination will take a long time , but radiative cooling will cause a decrease in thermal pressure .
The hot wind - bubble , which keeps its high pressure , expands into the surrounding gas , creating a new shell .
A third shell appears close to the star , as the drop in ram pressure from the RSG wind causes the wind bubble to expand inward , sweeping up the wind material . ” say van Marle , “ The presence of an expanding HII region changes the density structure of the nebula during the main sequence .
Our main goal at this time is to simulate the circumstellar environment of stars between 25 M and 40 M at the time of the supernova explosion . ”
Magic bubbles ?
Just stay out of the way when they pop !
Many thanks to JP Metsavainio of Northern Galactic for his magical personal image and allowing us this incredible look at distant beauty !
While casting his ballot earlier in the day Friday , Ayatollah Khamenei had said that people were using texting to spread rumors , but it is unclear if that is why the services were shut down .
Amid the confusion overnight , a reformist Web site called Fararu said Mr. Moussavi was talking with the two other candidates , Mr. Karroubi and Mr. Rezai , to discuss the situation .
Mr. Karroubi is a reformist cleric and Mr. Rezai is a conservative and the former commander of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards .
Tens of millions of Iranians crowded voting stations throughout the day , with long lines forming outside some polling stations well before they opened at 8 a.m .
Polls were originally due to close at 6 p.m. , but voting was extended by four hours .
The strong showing appeared to be driven in part by a broad movement against Mr. Ahmadinejad that has spurred vast opposition rallies in Iran ’s major cities over the past few weeks .
Many reform - oriented voters stayed away from the polls in 2005 , and now say they are determined not to repeat the mistake .
According to Iran ’s election rules , if none of the candidates wins more than 50 percent of the vote , the top two finishers will compete in a runoff in a week .
Most analysts had assumed that the election would go to a second round , but in recent days , the extraordinary public support for Mr. Moussavi had led to predictions that he could win the presidency in the first round on Friday .
Iran ’s president is less powerful than Ayatollah Khamenei , who has final authority over affairs of state .
But the president wields great power over domestic affairs , and Mr. Ahmadinejad has skillfully used the office as a bully pulpit both at home and abroad .
The Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) is an international comparison of 15 - year - olds conducted by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) that measures applied learning and problem - solving ability .
In 2006 , U.S. students ranked 25th of 30 advanced nations in math and 24th in science .
McKinsey & Company , in releasing its report " The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America 's Schools " ( April 2009 ) said , " Several other facts paint a worrisome picture .
First , the longer American children are in school , the worse they perform compared to their international peers .
In recent cross-country comparisons of fourth grade reading , math , and science , US students scored in the top quarter or top half of advanced nations .
By age 15 these rankings drop to the bottom half .
In other words , American students are farthest behind just as they are about to enter higher education or the workforce . "
That 's a sobering thought .
The longer kids are in school and the more money we spend on them , the further behind they get .
While the academic performance of white students is grossly inferior , that of black and Latino students is a national disgrace .
The McKinsey report says , " On average , black and Latino students are roughly two to three years of learning behind white students of the same age .
This racial gap exists regardless of how it is measured , including both achievement ( e.g. , test score ) and attainment ( e.g. , graduation rate ) measures .
Taking the average National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) scores for math and reading across the fourth and eighth grades , for example , 48 percent of blacks and 43 percent of Latinos are ' below basic , ' while only 17 percent of whites are , and this gap exists in every state .
A more pronounced racial achievement gap exists in most large urban school districts . "
Below basic is the category the NAEP uses for students unable to display even partial mastery of knowledge and skills fundamental for proficient work at their grade level .
The teaching establishment and politicians have hoodwinked taxpayers into believing that more money is needed to improve education .
The Washington , D.C. , school budget is about the nation 's costliest , spending about $ 15,000 per pupil .
Its student / teacher ratio , at 15.2 to 1 , is lower than the nation 's average .
Yet student achievement is just about the lowest in the nation .
What 's so callous about the Washington situation is about 1,700 children in kindergarten through 12th grade receive the $ 7,500 annual scholarships in order to escape rotten D.C. public schools , and four times as many apply for the scholarships , yet Congress , beholden to the education establishment , will end funding the school voucher program .
Any long - term solution to our education problems requires the decentralization that can come from competition .
Centralization has been massive .
In 1930 , there were 119,000 school districts across the U.S ; today , there are less than 15,000 .
Control has moved from local communities to the school district , to the state , and to the federal government .
Public education has become a highly centralized government - backed monopoly and we should n't be surprised by the results .
It 's a no- brainer that the areas of our lives with the greatest innovation , tailoring of services to individual wants and falling prices are the areas where there is ruthless competition such as computers , food , telephone and clothing industries , and delivery companies such as UPS , Federal Express and electronic bill payments that have begun to undermine the postal monopoly in first - class mail .
At a Washington press conference launching the McKinsey report , Al Sharpton called school reform the civil rights challenge of our time .
He said that the enemy of opportunity for blacks in the U.S. was once Jim Crow ; today , in a slap at the educational establishment , he said it was " Professor James Crow . "
Sharpton is only partly correct .
School reform is not solely a racial issue ; it 's a vital issue for the entire nation .
Image posted on the site " We Are All Neda " .
Neda ’s blood - stained face and frozen stare has come to symbolise the violent clashes between protestors and police or militia forces in Iran .
She has become the icon of democracy advocates opposed to the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
But the authorities are trying hard to break her aura .
Neda , 27 , was a philosophy student in Tehran .
She was shot in the chest and killed during last Saturday ’s protests in the city .
Footage of her death was captured on a cellphone camera and were reportedly posted online on Facebook by Hamed R , an Iranian blogger living in the Netherlands .
The circumstances of Neda ’s death have been at the centre of a heated debate on the Iranian web .
According to her fiancé , Caspian Makan , who spoke on the Arabic news channel Al - Jazeera , Neda was not even protesting that day .
She was stuck in traffic with her music instructor due to the protests , and got out of the car to observe the protests when she was shot ( see video below ) .
Makan cites eyewitnesses as saying that Neda was deliberately targeted by Basiji militiamen , who theoretically do not have the right to bear arms .
According to Makan , Neda was neither pro-Mousavi nor pro-Ahmadinejad , although she did take part in several pro-democracy rallies .
Several other far - fetched versions have circulated on official Iranian media .
The Guardian quoted Iranian newspaper Jomhouri Islami as reporting that Neda was shot by a sniper from the People ’s Moudjahiddin group , to reinforce anti-government propaganda .
The pro-Ahmadinejad newspaper Javan claimed that expelled BBC correspondent Jon Leyne orchestrated the shooting to enrich his coverage of the protests …
Authorities have not yet opened an official investigation into Neda ’s death .
She was reportedly buried on Sunday in the outskirts of Tehran , the authorities having apparently refused a public funeral or memorial for her in the capital .

Even if we could freeze - frame the atmosphere as it is today , sea levels would still rise by 25 metres , says the latest study into the effects of climate change on melting ice sheets .
Eelco Rohling of the UK National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton and colleagues reconstructed sea level fluctuations over the last 520,000 years and compared this to global climate and carbon dioxide levels data for the same period .
They found a tight coupling between carbon dioxide and sea level rise .
Based on this relationship , the team calculated that if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were fixed at current levels , temperature rises over the next couple of millennia would eventually drive sea levels up by 25 metres .
The team emphasise that the rise would not happen overnight or even over the next century .
Two studies published last year suggested that there is a limit to how fast the water can rise .
According to one , sea-levels could rise by approximately 1.3 metres by 2100 .
The other set the upper limit at 2 metres .
For an idea of what the European , Eastern US and Caribbean coastlines would look like with 2 metres ( red ) and 25 metres ( yellow ) sea level rise , have a look at the maps to the right .

Bayer Heroin Ad
Diacetylmorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by C.R. Alder Wright .
He had been working with finding an non-addictive , or less addictive , form of opium .
However , he soon found diacetylmorphine was more addictive than morphine and the drug was abandoned .
In 1897 , Felix Hoffman produced two new compounds for the company he worked for , Bayer .
These compounds were acetylsalicylic acid and diacetylmorphine .
It should be noted that Hoffman was unaware of the work of C.R. Alder Wright .
The Bayer company observed that acetylsalicylic acid was effective in relieving minor aches and pains , while diacetylmorphine was a very effective at relieving moderate pain .
As well it alleviated the symptoms of breathing disorders including asthma , bronchitis , tuberculosis .
In 1898 , Bayer registered and marketed diacetylmorphine under the brand name Heroin .
The word itself comes from the German word heroisch , meaning heroic .
In 1899 , the Bayer company marketed acetylsalicylic acid under the brand name Aspirin .
Above is a US ad from 1899 , or more likely the early the 1900s .
The ad includes information about both Bayer Aspirin and Bayer Heroin .
Aspirin and heroin were both legally available over the counter at the time , heroin being marketed as a cough suppressant .
In the US , the Harrison Act was passed in 1914 .
It made heroin harder to acquire , by necessitating a prescription to obtain it .
Then in 1924 , importing , manufacturing , or selling heroin was outlawed completely .
In 1925 heroin was made illegal in many other countries by the League of Nations .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday 1 May 2009
A further error has come to light in the story below about the use of seaside imagery from Northumberland in a promotional film about landlocked Alberta .
The story quoted Tom Olsen , identified as " head of media relations for Canada 's prime minister Stephen Harper " , defending use of the foreign beach image .
This led the writer to deduce , and write , that the national government was delighted with the film clip .
Federal officials were not involved in the promotion , and Tom Olsen is spokesman for the premier of Alberta , Ed Stelmach .
The sea was blue , the beach was gold and the children skipping through the sand dunes seemed a testament to the healthy joys of holidays in the Canadian province of Alberta .
Tourist officials and the national government in Ottawa were delighted with the promotional clip , part of a £ 14 m attempt to offset controversy over oil extraction in Alberta 's beautiful wildlands .
But hours of sleuthing by a puzzled sailing enthusiast , aware that Alberta has no coastline , have revealed that the idyll was filmed 5,000 miles away across the Atlantic .
The girl with the flying hair and her friend were romping on the sweep of sand at Beadnell Bay near Bamburgh , Northumberland , where the North Sea rolls in from Lindisfarne .
" We think it 's quite funny - a landlocked province in Canada presenting an image of itself as an island , " said Sheelagh Caygill of Northumberland Tourism , which is now fondly hoping to piggy - back on the international campaign .
News of the gaffe is spreading like wildfire on the internet with tags such as : " Come to Alberta - no , wait , it 's Britain . "
The curious choice of a seaside beach for a place which has none , was spotted by Peter Bailey , a Canadian looking for places to take his dinghy .
He initially thought that the scene might be set on one of Alberta 's many lakes , whose sandy shores and unpolluted water are important to the tourism drive .
Oil extraction is concentrated in Alberta 's Oil Sands region , which include landscapes vaguely similar to Northumberland 's unspoilt coast .
But Bailey tracked down the real setting - halfway between the drama of Bamburgh castle and the kipper - smoking village of Craster - after a marathon email session with the Canadian government , tourist authorities and their PR advisers .
Ottawa has responded by suggesting that the choice of Northumberland symbolised the fact that " Albertans are a worldly people " .
Tom Olsen , head of media relations for Canada 's prime minister Stephen Harper , said : " There 's no attempt to mislead here .
The picture used just fitted the mood and tone of what we were trying to do . "
His take that the British children were " a symbol of the future " was echoed by Olga Guthrie of Alberta 's public affairs bureau , who is managing the campaign .
She said : " This represents Albertans ' concern for the future of the world .
There 's no attempt to make people think that the place pictured is Alberta . "
The PR agency Calder Bateman which devised the rebranding campaign in Edmonton , Alberta 's capital which stands roughly 500 miles from the Pacific and 2,000 miles from the Atlantic , said that it could not comment " because of the terms of the government 's contract . "
Back in Northumberland , Caygill said that local people were " actually quite thrilled " that one of their prime beauty spots was being publicised free to so many people worldwide .
Legendary links between Bamburgh castle , Lancelot and Guinevere and Tristan and Isolde have been used to plug the area as perfect for romantic getaways .
" We 're delighted with any new way of promoting the beauty of the north of England , which is often neglected , " Caygill said .
" I hope that when people in Alberta realise where the beach is , they 'll want to come and visit . "
Beadnell was quiet yesterday , but one pre-season visitor Ian Hooper from Edinburgh sang its praises .
The 52 - year - old doctor said : " I 'm originally from Newcastle and I love it here .
I used to play in the sand dunes as a child , and now I 've five children of my own and they love to play in the dunes too , and do watersports here . "
The affair follows other recent outbreaks of international poaching , including the lifting of a scene from the sun-kissed Bahamas in February this year , to stand in for the Costa Brava in Spain .
More cosily , Rochdale Development Corporation was caught out using photographs of street cafes in the centre of Manchester two years ago to back its slogan that Rochdale was " a happening place " .
Different worlds :
Plenty of sand , but only one sea
Alberta is the size of France , Holland and Belgium but has no coast , though plenty of everything else , from deserts to icefields .
Temperatures range from 40C ( 104 F ) in summer to - 54C ( - 70C ) in winter .
The population of 3 million thrives on petrochemicals , exporting the world 's second largest amount of natural gas .
Tourist attractions include Lake Louise and the Alberta Prairies Steam Railway .
The province 's official bird is the great horned owl
Beadnell has a population of 528 , two holiday caravan sites and a beach stretching for 1.8 miles .
It hosts the largest colony of Arctic terns on mainland Britain .
It has a fortified pele tower and a record of famous swimmers , including the poet Swinburne and the novelist EM Forster .
Fishing continues from a port which is the only west - facing one on England 's east coast .
Local specialities include Craster kippers and Lindisfarne mead .
• This article was amended on Tuesday 28 April 2009 .
Errors of distance appeared in the story above about how seaside imagery from Northumberland was used in a promotional film about landlocked Alberta .
We should have sited Edmonton about 2,000 miles from the Atlantic , not 600 miles , and about 500 miles from the Pacific , not 400 miles .
The story called Alberta a province , but the headline wrongly called it a state .
These errors have been corrected .
NEW YORK ( May 19 , 2009 ) -- Researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College have published results showing that a new contraceptive device may also effectively block the transmission of the HIV virus .
Findings show that the device prevents infection by the HIV virus in laboratory testing .
The promising results are published in the most recent issue of the journal AIDS .
The new device is a vaginal ring that releases multiple types of non-hormonal agents and microbicides , which would prevent conception as well as sexually transmitted HIV infection .
Worldwide , there are about 5 million new infections and 3 million deaths per year due to HIV / AIDS .
If proven successful in future clinical trials , the new device could empower women to effectively and conveniently protect themselves from unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection .
The ring may also someday represent a novel method to prevent STIs for those with aversion to currently available methods , with hormonally derived active agents , or with allergies to latex condoms .
" This device is a new approach to birth control , because it avoids the long - term use of hormonal methods that have been associated with increased risk of certain cancers , " says Dr. Brij Saxena , lead author and the Harold and Percy Uris Professor of Reproductive Biology and professor of endocrinology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College .
" At the same time , this is the first device to simultaneously offer the possibility to prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV transmission . "
" No one has ever conquered a viral epidemic with treatment , so prevention is the most effective option .
Ideally , an HIV vaccine is the most desirable method , but that is not foreseeable in the near future , " explains Dr. Jeffrey Laurence , co-author of the study and attending physician at NewYork - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center .
" The next best thing would be something that would prevent infection and put the power in the susceptible female partner 's control .
That 's the potential a device such as this can offer . "
The vaginally inserted ring is incorporated with multiple antiviral drugs that prevent HIV infection and are time - released over a period up to 28 days .
The compounds tested were a newly developed anti-HIV agent , Boc-lysinated betulonic acid , TMC120 ( dapivirine ) , PMPA , and 3 ' - azido - 3'- deoxythymidine ( AZT or zidovudine ) , which , when combined , were found to block infection in human cells exposed to the virus in a laboratory setting .
" The combination of these antiviral drugs has proven to be potent agents that may block infection by the HIV virus , " says Dr. Saxena .
The ring is also incorporated with compounds that prevent conception by arresting sperm motility , raising vaginal mucous viscosity , and sustaining the acidity of the vagina in which sperm do not survive .
Traditionally , similar devices have used hormonal compounds that have been linked to increased risk of breast and cervical cancers , or spermicidal compounds that kill sperm , but may lead to irritation and inflammation .
Past findings published in the journal Contraception found the device to be highly effective in animal models and in laboratory testing .
" The compounds in the device are natural materials that are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in humans , " explains Dr. Saxena .

Remember when the Nazis forced the jews to wear the star of david to distinguish them from the rest of society .
How is this any different ?
Enlarge By Saul Loeb , AFP / Getty Images President Obama waves after speaking to the National Academy of Sciences annual meeting in Washington on Monday .
WASHINGTON  President Obama on Monday called for a renewed national commitment to science and education , promising to back his vision with a bully pulpit and increased funding .
" Science is more essential for our prosperity , our security , our health , our environment , and our quality of life than it has ever been before , " Obama said , speaking here at the National Academy of Sciences .
Obama said the nation should spend more than 3 % of its total economic output , or gross domestic product , on research and development , an increase of about $ 50 billion that would make the financial commitment " exceed the level achieved at the height of the space race . "
" The president recognizes that science , technology and innovation , as well as science education , are critical to our economic recovery and to the long - term future of this country and of the planet , " says science budget expert Al Teich of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
To applause from the audience of scientists , Obama also called for : • A federal effort to inspire students to pursue science and engineering careers , particularly " clean energy " ones , through education and scholarships .
• The creation of an organization within the Energy Department , called the Advanced Research Projects Agency , devoted to developing " breakthrough energy technologies . "
• A decade - long $ 42.6 billion budget - doubling for the National Science Foundation , National Institutes of Standards and Technology and Energy Department 's science office .
The nation now spends about 2.6 % of its $ 14.2 trillion GDP on research and development , primarily in the defense industry , according to the National Science Foundation .
Most of that development funding comes from industry , more than $ 270 billion , with federal agencies spending roughly $ 100 billion .
Recent stimulus spending added $ 21.5 billion to the federal total this year .
" As a scientist , I am delighted with the strong pro-science positions of the Obama administration , and hope they survive the difficult and inevitable aftermath of stimulus spending , " says former Bush administration science adviser John Marburger , by e-mail , expressing concern that some of the proposed funds will be spent unwisely .
" The devil is in the details , " Marburger adds , warning that Congress may try to direct research funds to special interests .
Increased science training , as well , " needs lots of practical analysis of workforce supply and demand so young people are not recruited into fields that can't feed them . "

That 's rich .
As to your question to Giuliani , Jesse is worried about torturing people like KSM because it endangers our soldiers .
" Mistreatment of enemy prisoners endangers our own troops who might someday be held captive . "

That 's why torture is wrong and illegal -- because it 's incongruous
with our values as a nation , and it puts our soldiers at increased risk
of being tortured .
Oh , and it 's illegal according to both American law

You coward .
It should seriously be a crime to be that dumb and on TV .

In fact , it 's a prerequisite for getting your own show on cable news .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 22 June 2009
In the article below about fertility clinics in Spain we said insemination treatment has become more difficult in Britain since sperm donors lost the right to remain anonymous in 2005 and that , after the law changed , the numbers of sperm and egg donors fell dramatically .
Figures published by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority show that , although the number of new egg donors declined in the two years after donor anonymity ended , the number of new sperm donors increased during that period .
Overall , the numbers of new egg and sperm donors registering at clinics in Britain fell .
As niche package tours go it is one of the most original and precisely targeted .
As of this week , British lesbians are being invited to dig into their pockets , catch a flight to the Spanish costas and come back either pregnant , married or both .
The offer comes from a fertility clinic and a gay and lesbian travel agency , which have launched joint package tours to what has now become one of the most socially tolerant countries in Europe .
Together they have spotted a growing trend among British lesbians , who increasingly travel to clinics in liberal Spain for insemination treatment , which has become more difficult in Britain since sperm donors lost the right to remain anonymous in 2005 .
" We noticed the increase in British women coming to us as soon as the law was changed , " said Dr Rafael Bernabeu , founder of the Instituto Bernabeu clinic in Alicante , eastern Spain .
" Here we can still offer that anonymity , so people are coming to us . "
Bernabeu said his clinic saw 30 British women a month .
About 40 % of British women seeking donor insemination were single and many were lesbians .
" We do n't ask questions about people 's sexuality , so I can't give exact figures , " he said .
" But often they come with same - sex partners or simply tell us that they are lesbians . "
He said that couples , gay and straight , who wanted fertility treatment were often worried about the effect on a child of knowing that they could track down their missing biological parent .
" Many couples in this situation do not want problems of that kind , " he said .
The guarantee of anonymity means Spanish clinics have few problems finding sperm and egg donors , whose numbers fell dramatically in Britain after 2005 as people worried about getting a knock on the door in 18 years ' time .
Unlike some other countries in Europe , Spain does not require those wanting fertility treatment to be married .
" As long as you are in control of your mental faculties , then you can do it , " said Bernabeu .
" The question of your sexual orientation or whether you are married has nothing to do with it . "
Spanish law obliges doctors to seek as close a physical match as possible between the parents and the donor .
British women take day trips to Alicante to start the treatment , continue with it at home and then make a day trip for insemination or implantation of an egg .
" Sometimes , however , they need to be here for several days , so we thought it would be a good idea to approach the new gay and lesbian travel organisation in Alicante , " Bernabeu said .
" Two women travelling to Spain so that they can have a baby are doing something that is very special to them , " said María José Rico , of Rainbow Travel .
" We want to make the experience as pleasurable as possible .
The treatment does not require you to rest a lot , so we want to offer people things to do and places to stay that will make it a real holiday as well , " she said .
Hotels with views over the Mediterranean , evening outings in yachts and massages to help with pre-treatment nerves would all be on offer , she said .
Spain , which introduced gay marriage four years ago , has shed its Roman Catholic - inspired suspicion of same - sex couples , Rico said .
" Alicante is very cosmopolitan .
We live in the 21st century and nobody finds it strange to see two women here with a child , " she said .
" In fact if people want to come back here to celebrate the child 's birthdays , we'd be happy to arrange that as well . "
Rainbow also offers to help lesbian couples who want to marry in Spain .
" First of all we help them bear a child and then we can help them marry – as long as they meet the legal requirements , " she said .
" That makes them feel psychologically more like a family . "
More than 12,000 same - sex Spanish couples have married in the last four years .
" If they are both foreigners then one of them has to be resident in Spain , " said Rico .
It is relatively easy to register as a resident in Spain and formally meet the requirement .
The marriages are valid only in Spain and in other countries that accept same - sex marriages .
Britain and Spain have the most liberal assisted fertility regimes in Europe .
Bernabeu said his clinic also received many Italian patients – where sperm and egg donation is illegal – and from northern European countries that require women to be married .
He was also beginning to get patients from the US .
" We cost a lot less , " he said .
The process is not cheap , however .
Prices for egg implantations in Spanish clinics start at about € 7,000 ( £ 6,000 ) and go above 12,000 .
Donor insemination is generally cheaper , starting at about € 1,500 .
In April , the rumors about the Zune HD were plentiful and very interesting .
Among them was one that suggested the device would be powered by Nvidia 's Tegra chipset .
This rumor kept coming up every few weeks or so , but no one could get official confirmation from Microsoft .
However , during podcast number 24 of the Zune Insider , Matt Akers , Software Development Engineer in Test , finally gave the official statement that many have been waiting for .
We actually wanted to confirm something .
There 's been a lot of chatter going on right now about us possibly putting the Nvidia Tegra chipset in the Zune HD .
Guess what we did .
Ok , right now , we ’re going to go ahead and confirm that .
Yes , the Zune HD does have the Tegra chip in it , which is so sick .
So much better battery life , graphics acceleration .
I mean , this thing is like a mini laptop in your hand .
It 's so awesome .
If you still have n't heard , in May , Microsoft officially announced the Zune HD , describing it is a multitouch device with a 16:9 OLED screen , a Web browser , and HD radio support .
You also might want to check out the first Zune HD videos to see what all the commotion is about .
A typical American church service includes religious hymns , readings from the Bible and prayers .
But a house of worship in Kentucky is seeking to add a new element : guns .
In an effort to encourage gun ownership , The New Bethel Church in Louisville , Kentucky is hosting an ' open carry ' service on 27 June .
Promoters of the Independence Day event are asking attendees to bring their unloaded weapons to the service , which will include patriotic music , talks by gun store owners and a raffle to win a handgun .
Ken Pagano , New Bethel 's pastor , said the event was planned months ago and will continue despite Sunday 's shooting of abortion doctor George Tiller at a Kansas church .
He said the momentum for the service grew during Barack Obama 's candidacy for president .
Firearm sales have surged since Obama was elected president over fears he will tighten gun laws .
Pagano said the event is " just a celebration we 're doing to coincide with Fourth of July " .
" There are people who own firearms and do so responsibly and enjoy them as a sport , maybe like golfing or bowling . "
Critics argue the service goes against Jesus Christ 's message of peace .
Reverend Jerry Cappel , president of the Kentuckiana Interfaith Community , said : " Even if I were perfectly comfortable with open - carry handguns or gun rights , it seems to me a completely whole other thing to connect those rights to Jesus Christ . "
Combining the event " with one who explicitly called us to put down the sword and pick up the cross and love our enemies and turn the other cheek , it just makes no sense , " he said .

The Washington DC subway was urged to replace or upgrade aging trains three years before Monday 's crash that killed nine people , investigators have said .
The National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) said the trains had continued running on the system despite a warning the board had given in 2006 .
About 70 people were injured as a train ploughed into the back of a second , stationary one in evening rush hour .
Investigators said the moving train was in automatic mode at the time .
The collision happened above ground between Fort Totten and Takoma at 1700 ( 2200 BST ) .
See a map of the crash site
The NTSB called for the replacement or upgrading of some carriages on the Metro system after investigating a 2004 accident which injured 20 passengers .
" We recommended to WMATA [ Washington 's Metro Area Transit Authority ] to either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet , " NTSB 's Debbie Hersman said .
" They have not been able to do that and our recommendation was not addressed . "
Metro general manager John Catoe said the authority expected to receive proposals " over the next month or so " to replace the old carriages , but new trains were still years away from being installed .
He insisted the existing carriages were safe .
' Loud impact '
Ms Hersman also revealed that an emergency brake button was found pushed down in the train that caused into the stationary one .
However , she stressed it was not clear if the brake was engaged when the crash occurred or in the aftermath .
The fact the train was in automatic and not manual mode is standard procedure .
Investigators will be looking at mobile phone and text - messaging records from the train operator , also standard practice , she added .
The city 's mayor Adrian Fenty said the crash was " the deadliest accident in the history of our Metro train transit system " .
On Tuesday , Metro spokeswoman Candace Smith said two men and seven women had died , confirming early reports of the number of fatalities .
She said that five bodies had been recovered from the wreckage on Tuesday , in addition to the four removed on Monday .
I thought it was like the train bombings in London .
There was smoke and dust everywhere

The death toll had been revised down for several hours on Tuesday after Mr Fenty said just seven people had been killed .
Passenger Maya Maroto , who was on board the moving train , said it had been going at " full speed " .
" I did n't hear any braking .
Everything was just going normally .
Then there was a very loud impact .
We all fell out of our seats .
" Then the train filled up with smoke .
I was coughing , " she told the Associated Press .
Driver killed Theroza Doshi told Reuters news agency : " There was no slowing down of the train , just a jerk .
There was no attempt at braking .
" We just slammed into whatever we slammed into . "
Passenger Abra Jeffers , 25 , told the AFP news agency : " I was on the train that got hit .
I thought it was an explosion .
I thought it was like the train bombings in London .
There was smoke and dust everywhere . "
On Tuesday morning , Mr Fenty said two of the patients with critical injuries remained in hospital .
The driver of the moving train was among the dead , and was named as Jeanice McMillan , 42 , by the Associated Press ( AP ) and the Washington Post .
Washington fire chief Dennis Rubin said a large crane had been used to separate mangled pieces of wreckage so that rescuers could search for injured or dead .
He said parts of the lower carriage were 70 to 80 % compressed , and that rescuers did not know if there were still more bodies to be found .
A thorough search of the sidings and surrounding woodland had been made , he said .

Investigators have been trying to find recorders that would have details of the train 's speed at the time of the crash and other information which could explain how the accident happened .
The accident happened at the peak of rush hour , at 1700 local time ( 2200 BST ) on a busy commuter line .
But the trains involved were heading towards the centre of Washington rather than to the city 's outlying areas .
This meant they were likely to have had fewer people on them , Ms Hersman as said .
The accident is the 33 - year - old Metro network 's first crash with any passenger fatalities since 1982 when three people were killed in a derailment .

The best way to make Mars habitable would be to inject synthetic greenhouse gases into its atmosphere , researchers said Thursday .
The stuff could be shipped to Mars or manufactured there .
Scientists and science - fiction authors have long pondered terraforming Mars , melting the vast stores of ice in its polar caps to create an environment suitable for humans .
The topic is highly controversial .
Some think earthlings have no right to mess with the climate of another planet .
Others see Mars as a refuge for people who might need to flee this world as conditions deteriorate .
Another argument holds that Mars was likely warmer and wetter in its distant past , and it might have harbored life , so bringing it back to a previous state makes sense .
Among the ideas for how to warm Mars : sprinkling stuff near the poles that would absorb more sunlight ; or placing large mirrors in orbit around the planet to reflect more sunlight onto it .
Jumpstart the warming
The new research suggests that forcing global warming by injecting greenhouse gases may be the best way to terraform , should governments decide to do so .
The conditions warming Earth could be harnessed to transform Mars , the scientists determined .
Jumpstarting global warming in a planet - sized laboratory would be a boon to science in some respects .
" Bringing life to Mars and studying its growth would contribute to our understanding of evolution , and the ability of life to adapt and proliferate on other worlds , " says Margarita Marinova , at the NASA Ames Research Center when the study was done .
" Since warming Mars effectively reverts it to its past , more habitable state , this would give any possibly dormant life on Mars the chance to be revived and develop further . "
The research is presented in the February issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research - Planets , published by the American Geophysical Union .
With a very thin atmosphere and being farther from the Sun , Mars is much colder than Earth .
There is no evidence for any liquid water presently on the surface .
Liquid water is considered essential to life as we know it .
The polar regions contain vast stores of water ice and carbon dioxide , or dry ice .
Theorists have said in the past that melting the poles might thicken the atmosphere , which like a blanket would insulate the surface and eventually create a more Earth - like climate .
Studies suggest Mars had surface water and bouts of rain in its early history .
Gas of choice
The new research modeled how manmade greenhouse gases would affect Martian temperature and melt water ice and carbon dioxide ice at the poles .
Artificially created gases could be 10,000 times more effective than carbon dioxide in warming up the Red Planet , the study determined .
The gases that would work the best are flourines and could be made from elements readily available on Mars , Marinova and her colleagues found .
Adding 300 parts per million of the gas mixture into the Martian air would trigger a runaway greenhouse effect , according to the models .
The polar ice sheets that would slowly evaporate .
The newly released carbon dioxide would cause further warming and melting .
Atmospheric pressure would rise .
The process would take hundreds or thousands of years to complete , the scientists report .
Spanish copyright group SGAE has taken legal action in order to close down a site which offers links to copyrighted music hosted elsewhere .
In seeking an injunction to close the site , SGAE said it was not necessary for the court to hear the site 's defense .
The court disagreed .
Yet again , Spain ’s answer to the RIAA has been flexing its muscles in trying to close down another site that offers links to copyright works .
Time and time again the Spanish courts have kicked out claims against similar sites , declaring them to be entirely legal , but SGAE has its hands firmly pressed to its ears .
This time SGAE targeted Agujero.com , a site which amongst other things offers links to files found on various P2P networks .
Defended by lawyers David Bravo and Javier de la Cueva , Agujero.com is protesting its innocence using the same successful defense employed earlier by P2P site Sharemula .
However , the increasingly deaf SGAE believes otherwise , claiming that the site operates illegally .
“ The entertainment industry has tried to criminalize websites linking to P2P , ” Javier de la Cueva told TorrentFreak .
“ After four years , it seems they have given up with criminal proceedings as it is clear it is not a crime because a link is not a copy nor is it public communication .
It is just metadata , data about data .
Now they [ SGAE ] have begun civil claims . ”
SGAE told the court that Augujero ’s continued operation was so serious that it required an immediate injunction to close it down .
In fact , it further insisted that the urgency of the case meant that it was not even necessary for the court to hear the defendant ’s side of the story .
SGAE insisted that they “ had long remained passive ” in taking action against Agujero , having been aware of the site ’s operations since 2007 .
Now , in 2009 , suddenly everything has become so urgent that they do n’t want the site to have a defense in the face of an application for an injunction .
Thankfully the court disagreed with this reasoning and allowed an interim hearing on May 5th 2009 , to be attended by both sides .
During the hearing , lawyers for SGAE claimed that Agujero.com infringed the copyright of its members .
For the defense , lawyer Javier de la Cueva argued that the site did not , since it only carries links to material hosted elsewhere , a position already declared legal under Spanish law in previous cases .
An expert presented by the defense confirmed that the site carried only links and that the only material actually hosted by Agujero is ‘ copyleft ’ material .
The judge noted that closing the site in advance of a full hearing “ might cause irreparable prejudice to the defendant , ” and therefore denied SGAE ’s application to have the site closed at this stage .
“ In the end it could be considered a legal activity , ” Javier told TorrentFreak .
To be continued ….
Currently I am doing research at the University of Minho in the group of distributed systems , with duration of one year .
My job is to find a way to identify specific links between a user and a distributed system .
The general idea is to draw a map of services in a distributed system .
This post only refers to the first milestone .
The proposal was to make such a system using Snort .
Snort
Snort is a Network intrusion detection system , that means with Snort you can detect malicious activity in your network .
We can detect many types of network attacks .
We can identify DoS , DDoS attacks , port scans , cracking attempts , and much more .
Snort can operate in two different ways .
We can set up Snort to run in passive mode , putting it to listen in promiscuous mode .
That is , because Ethernet network switches send traffic to all computers connected to itself , we get traffic addressed to other machines on the network .
To do this we only need to connect to the network and turn Snort on in our machine , no one knows that we are recording every traffic ( including traffic destined for other computers ) .
Snort may also run in active mode .
This “ active ” is not able to modify the data channel , but to be able to be installed in a network , a router for example and reap more information than in passive mode .
Thus it makes sense to use the capacity of rules that Snort supports , to filter the traffic that it read .
To do this , Snort capture all packets that pass the network and interprets each .
As the rules we have defined Snort tries to find these patterns in each packet , or each set of packets and take certain actions for each of them .
For example , if a large number of TCP requests reach a particular host , to a large number of ports in a short space of time we probably are the target of a port scan .
NIDS like Snort know how to find these patterns and alerting the network administrator .
Objective
Our aim was to use Snort to capture all traffic into passive mode .
root@pig : # snort -u snort -g snort - D -d -l / var / log / snort -c /etcsnort/snort.debian.conf - i eth0
We are saving the logs in binary ( tcpdump format ) , for that I use the “ - d - l / dir / ” flags .
I prefer to save all the packets into binary because is more easier to parse , than the structure of files and directories that Snort creates by default .
I started by trying to use some language that advised me to try to do the parsing of the file created by snort .
Initially started to use python , but only find a tcpdump parser and could not get more than one file translated in tcpdump to hexadecimal .
After that I tried to use Haskell and I was amazed !
Haskell and packet parsing
House is a Haskell Operative System done by The Programatica Project .
This is a system than can serve as a platform for exploring various ideas relating to low - level and system - level programming in a high - level functional language .
And indeed helped me a lot in doing my job .
This project have already done a lot of parsers for network packets .
It implements the Ethernet , IPv4 , IPv6 , TCP , UDP , ICMP , ARP and I think is all .
The libpcap ( tcpdump parser ) is already implemented in Haskell too , so is very simple to parse a complete packet :
getPacket :: [ Word8 ] ->
InPacket getPacket bytes = toInPack $ listArray ( 0 , Prelude.length bytes -1 ) $ bytes -- Ethernet | IP | TCP | X getPacketTCP :: [ Word8 ] -> Maybe ( NE .
Packet ( NI4 .
Packet ( NT . Packet InPacket ) ) ) getPacketTCP bytes = doParse $ getPacket bytes :: Maybe ( NE .
Packet ( NI4 .
Packet ( NT . Packet InPacket ) ) )
As you can see is too easy to have a compete structure of a packet parsed with this libraries .
The problem is that they do n’t have already implemented a application packet parser .
So , according to that image :
This is the level of depth we can go with this libraries .
What is very good , but not perfect for me :S
My supervisor told me to start searching a new tool to do this job .
I was sad because I could not do everything in Haskell .
But it is already promised that I will continue this project in Haskell .
You can see the git repo here .
I find tshark , a great tool to dissect and analyze data inside tcpdump files .
The power of tshark
tshark is the terminal based Wireshark , with it we can do everything we do with wireshark .

Conclusion
With tshark we could do everything we want to know what is inside a network packet .
The trick is to understand the statistics that tshark generate , and know how to ask it .
Now my work will get a machine to run Snort in an active mode and begin to understand how to use Snort to do all this work of collecting information .
If you feel interested and understand Portuguese , see the presentation :

The operators of Britain 's first " biofuel " power plants are considering burning palm oil , which is blamed for causing rainforest destruction in south - east Asia .
At least four new power stations are being planned around the UK to burn vegetable oils with the assurance that they will generate less pollution than burning climate - change - causing fossil fuels .
Two that would power more than 50,000 homes , at Portland in Dorset and Newport in South Wales , are considering using palm oil .
W4B Energy , which has submitted a planning application to build the £ 30 m
Portland plant , says it would use only sustainable supplies certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) .
Vogen Energy , behind the plant at Newport , says production of its palm oil would not harm the environment .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But environmentalists say using any palm oil would be unwise because it would put pressure on supplies , even if the supplies which go into the power stations are officially sustainable .
Some green groups are also unsure whether the RSPO system for certifying " sustainable " supplies is sufficiently robust .
Most of the 38 million tonnes of palm oil produced globally is used in food and cosmetics .
But the need for biofuels to mix with petrol and as " feedstock " for power stations is putting pressure on demand , which is forecast to grow at 6 to 10 per cent a year .
Conservationists are concerned at the loss of primary forest in Sumatra and Borneo and elsewhere , to make way for plantations .
New plantations result in large losses of wildlife and are blamed for imperilling the future of the tree - dwelling orangutan , which could become extinct in the wild in 20 years .
The power plants would help the UK meet its target of generating 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 , but the Government says it must " proceed cautiously " to prevent biofuels raising food prices and destroying wildlife in developing countries .
New sources of power are also required because new nuclear power stations will not be in operation until after 2020 and many existing fossil fuel power stations are coming to the end of their life .
But Robert Palgrave , a member of the pressure group Biofuelswatch , argued that growing crops for electricity was a less efficient use of resources than using that land for wind turbines : " To produce the amount of palm oil for food , cosmetics and biofuel is an incredible demand and the only way they can get it is through deforestation . "
James Turner , a Greenpeace forests campaigner , said : " Using palm oil to fuel a power station could be even more damaging than burning fossil fuels . "
A bride and groom murdered a man the morning after their wedding night , a court heard today .
Wendy Shobrook , 39 , had walked out on Barry Johnson , 40 , halfway through their reception because she did not think he was paying her enough attention , Plymouth crown court was told .
Next morning , Johnson found his bride at the flat of her former boyfriend , George Auchterlonie , 45 .
She let Johnson in and he used an oar that was hanging on the wall as a decoration to batter Auchterlonie to death , it is alleged .
Husband and wife fled together , leaving Auchterlonie dying in a pool of blood .
He is thought to have lived for several hours , but his body was only found by a neighbour three days later .
He had suffered 38 separate injuries .
Johnson and Shobrook , of Plymouth , deny murdering Auchterlonie at his flat in June last year .
Martin Meeke QC , prosecuting , said Johnson and Shobrook had got married at short notice at Plymouth register office with three friends as witnesses , and gone on to celebrate at three pubs in the city .
He said Shobrook had set Auchterlonie up for the beating , enabling Johnson to attack him by letting him into the flat .
The trial continues .
New Rifle Can Fire Bullets Through Walls , Explode Them Once Inside
Here ’s something you do n’t want fired in your direction : a “ smart ” gun that fires bullets that can travel through walls , exploding once they ’re inside .
It ’s the accuracy of a rifle with the explosiveness of a grenade launcher .
The XM25 rifle is about to begin testing in Iraq and Afghanistan , and it sounds pretty nuts .
As the 25 - millimetre round is fired , the gunsight sends a radio signal to a chip inside the bullet , telling it the precise distance to the target .
A spiral groove inside the barrel makes the bullet rotate as it travels , and as it also contains a magnetic transducer , this rotation through the Earth ’s magnetic field generates an alternating current .
A patent granted to the bullet ’s maker , Alliant Techsystems , reveals that the chip uses fluctuations in this current to count each revolution and , as it knows the distance covered in one spin , it can calculate how far it has traveled .
And this , my friends , is why I stay on the good side of the US Military .

You are sitting there in your recliner chair in your small city apartment desperately longing for the day when you can escape to the country and become a homesteader and become more self - sufficient .
Well , do n’t just sit there .
Get a head start .
Bloom where you are planted until you can actually make the big move .
Do n’t waste valuable time in pointless dreaming .
Begin making your dreams a reality , now .
White bloom colonnade apple tree .
Stark colonnade apple tree with a petunia .
Stark colonnade apple trees with basket of apples .
Stark maypole flowering crab apple and Stark emerald spire .
Stark Sensation Miniature Peach .
You dream of growing your own fresh , pesticide - free , organic vegetables .
So do it .
Go dumpster diving and trash mongering and collect all the free containers you can find that will hold soil and that you can poke a few holes into .
Wash and disinfect the containers thoroughly .
Then get some potting soil suitable for veggies .
Make your own compost to add to your potting soil in a dark corner ( or under the sink ) by putting shredded newspaper , kitchen wastes ( not meat or grease ) , and coffee grounds in a large container and adding a few earthworms ( which you can either buy or collect for free after a rain at the nearby park ) .
Maybe you can get some leaves and grass for your compost bin at the park too .
Keep the composting materials moistened .
While you are waiting for your earthworms to make the fertilizer , you can order your seeds .
Here , I can give you another shortcut .
Since I ’m stuck in an in - town situation myself at the moment , I ’ve already done the research to find which vegetables are best for small space and container gardening , and where to get them .
Here are a few recommendations to get you started .
( Keep in mind that this list is by no means all - inclusive .
It is only meant as a suggestion . ) :
Small miracle broccoli , from Park Seed are little beauties that can be planted as close as eight inches apart so you can fit many in a small space .
Broccoli is a heavy feeder so compost well and maybe add a sprinkling of blood meal as a side dressing once or twice during the season .
Early sunglo corn is also from Park Seed .
This corn grows on small stalks so they can be planted close together .
Enrich your soil with lots of compost and a sprinkling of bone meal and blood meal .
You should then be able to plant the seeds about four to six - inches apart each way .
Keep the soil moist , but not soaked .
The ears will be small but tasty .
Dynamo mini cabbage , from Johnny ’s Selected Seeds can also be planted close together like the broccoli .
The same planting instructions apply .
Kinko mini carrots , from Johnny ’s Selected Seeds , grow only four - inches long but you will need a pot at least six - inches or more deep .
If you do n’t have a pot that deep , Bountiful Gardens offers Parisian rondo heirloom which is a little , round , bite - sized carrot which does n’t need much space at all .
You can plant your carrots two - to three - inches apart each way .
Superb super bush container tomatoes , from Shepherd ’s Garden Seeds , promise to yield abundantly on 2 ½- to 3 - foot space - saving plants .
They also boast “ firm , juicy fruit with a full tomatoey flavor . ”
Park ’s creamy hybrid yellow squash are a straight - necked squash which grows on 18 - inch plants .
Park
Seed also has green magic II zucchini which grows on an 18 - inch compact plant as well .
Sweet pickle peppers , from Park Seed , are the ones to try for an abundance of sweet salad peppers , although most any pepper can be grown in a pot .
Little gem lettuce , from Park Seed , or little diamond gem lettuce , from The Cook ’s Garden , both produce lovely , tiny , sweet , space - saving heads .
Each head makes an individual salad .
Pole ( green or yellow ) beans of any kind can be grown in a tub .
Just make a bean tepee using three or four bamboo poles sunk into the outer edge of the soil in your bean tub .
Tie the poles together at the top .
Plant four bean seeds around each pole .
Emerite , from Cook ’s Garden is an “ incredibly productive and easy to grow ” green , stringless pole bean which should suit your purpose well .
Pronto baby beets , from The Cook ’s Garden is a good beet choice for container growing , because they are small .
So , you can fit a lot into a small space .
They are also reported to be sugar sweet and are said to retain their tenderness as they mature .
The Cook ’s Garden is also famous for their lettuce mixtures .
They offer cutting mix lettuces , fall mix lettuces , and winter mix lettuces .
Plus they offer Cook ’s tangy mesclun mix and Cook ’s mild mesclun mix .

So , now that we have your container vegetable garden squared away , let ’s talk about your balcony orchard .
Orchard ?
No , I ’m not crazy .
You do n’t have to live in the country to produce a substantial amount of fruit .
If you have a four - foot by six - foot space , you could produce apples , strawberries , cranberries , blueberries and peaches .
I ’m not kidding .
First , however , check with your landlord to find out how much extra weight your balcony can hold before you purchase any trees .
With that information in hand , now you can choose your combination of trees :
Stark Brothers
Nursery offers colonnade apple trees which can be planted in containers as small as 17 inches .
The trees grow eight - feet tall and two - feet wide and come in five varieties .
When mature , they produce an abundance of full - sized , deliciously flavored apples .
But , you will need to plant at least two for proper pollination .
Henry Field ’s Seed and Nursery will sell you a strawberry tower which takes up only two feet by two feet of space , is on casters for easy moving , and comes in two heights .
The two - foot version holds 45 strawberry plants and the four - foot version holds 90 .
At a recommended 25 plants per person in the household you can do some serious strawberry picking here .
By the way , I hear that Ozark beauty strawberries grow well in towers .
Henry Field ’s also offers a new cascading cranberry which can be grown in hanging baskets .
They like acidic soil and do n’t even mind shade .
Dwarf top hat blueberry plants , again from Henry Field ’s , grow only two - feet tall , but produce full - sized berries .
They are even self - pollinating .
Finally , Stark Brothers has developed the cutest little peach tree called Stark sensation .
When it matures , it will produce full - sized fruit but is small enough to be grown in an 18 - to 24 - inch container .
And , if you have a wee bit of extra space , they will sell you a mini apricot and a mini-nectarine tree as well .
So , with your vegetables , herbs , and fruits established in pots , your apartment gardens and orchard are all transportable .
That means you can take them with you and continue to enjoy a measure of healthy food until you finally make that move to the country and get your full - sized garden and orchard established .
Truly the best of both worlds .
Although by and large I enjoy being a man , I 've always had an awkward relationship with some of the niche aspects of maleness , such as the dull preoccupation with sport and pubs , or the deluded belief that breaking wind is funny .
I like to think there 's more to us than that .
Apparently I 'm wrong .
That 's all we are .
We 're goons .
Well , according to the telly , anyway .
We 're not portrayed as sex objects .
We 're not portrayed as bastards .
No .
We 're portrayed as bell - ends , and it 's getting embarrassing .
He 's Having A Baby ( today , 5.35 pm , BBC1 ) is the final straw .
The premise : each week , Davina McCall hosts a live studio show following a group of first - time dads ( some whose partners have recently given birth , some who are still expecting ) .
And each week , a couple of these dads are given hilarious tasks to undertake - such as organising a toddlers ' party , or teaching a kiddywink to swim .
These reach us in the form of side - splitting VT segments , generally accompanied by comedy parp - parp music .
After which we cut back to the studio where Davina takes the piss out of them while the audience laughs .
Because men are hilariously rubbish !
They 're big useless boys !
Ha ha ha !
But they 're cute , too , bless 'em !
A can of beer and some footie on the box and they 're in heaven !
Awww !
Wook at his wickle face !
He 's dreaming about pubs !
Tee hee !
Men !
Lovable , huggable , tumbling ninnies , the lot of 'em !
NO !
NO !
JESUS CHRIST , NO !
If we men must be reduced to paper - thin cartoons , I 'd rather see us depicted as warmongering rapists - in - waiting than dickless pudge - faced clowns .
Every man involved in He 's Having a Baby is a sex traitor who should hang his head in shame ( except for Danny Wallace , who should hang his in a box of seriously irritated rats ) .
It is n't the only offender , of course .
We 've also got to contend with the downright jaw - dropping Bring Your Husband To Heel ( Mon , 7 pm , BBC2 ) , in which " misbehaving " men have their behaviour " modified " by a dog trainer , and Kept ( Sun , 10 pm , VH1 ) , a reality show about a wizened hag ( played to perfection by Jerry Hall ) choosing a pet boy from a bunch of dismal , preening bimbos .
You could be forgiven for thinking Michael Buerk 's recent grumble about women ruling TV was correct .
But you 'd be wrong .
There are loads of women in television , but few are network controllers ; ultimately men are nodding these through .
Why ?
Well , since the anal study of demographics became a number one priority in TV land , it 's been noted that men are a tough audience to snare .
So perhaps it 's an act of revenge .
Here 's a quote in which Nick Elliot , ITV 's controller of drama , explains why most of his output is aimed at women :
" You can bash your head against a brick wall trying to make dramas for 16 - to 34 - year - old males , but if they only want to watch football or videos and PlayStation , there 's no point ...
I 'm not sure what a very male drama is .
Maybe it 's about business or something .
We do guns and violence for boys occasionally ...
We actually thought Footballers '
Wives would appeal to men , but it does n't very much ... they soon suss out it is n't about football . "
Jesus !
He hates men !
And no wonder : from the sounds of it , they 're morons !
Because that 's what you see when you study any demographic : a hateful , ignorant , unthinking mass .
And in this case , a mass which does n't watch much telly .
Everyone in telly studies demographics .
And I think that 's why they hate us .
So - how about a Saturday night show called Tumblebloke Twit Time , in which men in nappies bounce around inside a large revolving drum , while Jerry Hall sits at the side laughing whenever one of their balls pops out ?
And in the second round they climb greased poles to reach a can of beer perched on top ?
And in the third round we let them off their leads in a park , and they scamper about and blow off and talk about football - and it 's cute !
Because that 's where we 're headed , chaps .
Pass the noose .
One of the best ways to lose all of your money in stock trading is to fight the market .
The market reacts based on several factors , but chief among them is simple human behavior .
There are controlling factors that dominate the way the market plays out , and if you can learn to recognize those behaviors , you ’ll make a killing in the market every time .
FEAR is the number one factor that affects the market .
Do n’t believe me ?
Watch a stock price after a bad earning ’s announcement .
What happens ?
Prices plummet as traders exit their position .
Do quarterly earnings announcements indicate an underlying problem with the company ?
Maybe .
It would be worth some research to check the quarter on quarter performance of the stock price to determine if you ’re hanging onto a sinking ship .
But usually , a bad quarter does not a bankrupt company make !
Still , the market is full of speculators , and if you can determine how their fear is going to trend a price , and position yourself carefully , you will walk away a winner , no matter which direction the market takes .
IGNORANCE goes hand in hand with fear .
Stupid people invest in the stock market all of the time , lazy traders who follow “ hot tips ” and numerical formulations for get rich quick schemes .
They are the bread and butter of stock fluctuations , and when you can identify where their money is going , you can profit greatly .
The opposite of ignorant is the learned .
They make mistakes , but they do n’t fail .
A failure is a mistake you do n’t learn a lesson from .
Smart people do n’t fail .
Smart people learn , and do n’t allow ignorance to persist .
The best way to learn is through researching the market , and studying the history of trading .
HOPE is the killer of many rich dreams .
If you want to fight the market and lose your capital , use hope as your inspiration .
Hope that the price will reverse , hope that earnings wo n’t affect the stock , hope that the overall economy will have no impact on your trade .
Hope may spring eternal , but it ’s usually fueled by ignorance , and guided by fear .
The opposite of hope is know , as in you know which direction the trend will fold .
Knowing comes from study .
If you know , you do n’t have to hope .
Leave that to the uneducated traders who are going to help you make money on each and every trade .
GREED is good .
No more famous words were quoted and re-quoted by Gordon Gecko want - to - be traders around Wall Street than those .
Greed can rule the market on any given day , greed can make blood run on the Street .
If you can recognize a trend from reading historical analysis , then you will never be ruled by greed .
If you plan each stock trade with thoughtful deliberation , you wo n’t have to worry about greed .
Greed is one of the seven deadly sins , and for good reason .
It indicates we are taking too much , more than we can handle and it ’s going to hurt us .
More money is going to hurt us ?
No , you can make more money on a consistent basis through careful planning and picking .
Greed is something different .
Greed is staying in the trade too long , trying to squeeze out every penny of profit , instead of exiting early .
Is there a fine line between making the maximum profit before exiting or walking away with money on the table ?
Yes .
Will you be able to identify each of those times during a trade ?
No .
Can you exit a position with a profit , and reenter with additional capital to risk the trend going higher ?
Absolutely .
So long as you protect your position with a stop loss order and play out the risk .
There are pivotal points in prices where history and tradition take over , and the stock wo n’t trend higher .
You can learn this by studying the chart history , and risking that “ this time ” is the time things are going to change .
( recognize hope here ? )
But if you ’re all ready made a profit , and you ’re risking a little capital to earn additional profit , then be just a little bit greedy .
Learn to recognize human emotions and how it will affect the stock market and your trading days will be filled with profit .
Remember that historical trends have an impact on the day to day fluctuations of the market , as other traders who do their research are taking positions and affecting prices .
With the knowledge that other traders are using the same charts you have access to , and building their trade off that information , you can have an advantage by knowing which emotion is ruling the market on that trade .
I have written a great deal about the failure of CentrePointe , the downtown Lexington development which has failed to produce promised jobs and economic contributions to our city .
It has left a scar in the middle of our city which has persisted for the better part of a year .
It has exposed just how flawed Lexington 's planning and economic development processes are .
As much as I have commented on CentrePointe , however , it is primarily a failure of omission , of delivery .
There is a far larger and more important story about a failure which has actively destroyed jobs and economic contribution in our city .
It is a story of the colossal mismanagement of one of Lexington 's biggest employers .
It is a story of the destruction of shareholder value and the bleeding of high - tech jobs in Lexington .
It is a story about how a $ 12 billion company became a $ 1.2 billion company in just 5 years .
It is a story of wasted opportunity .
It is a story which serves as a damning indictment of the failed executives who have presided over this corporate implosion .
This is a story of the decline and fall of Lexmark International .
Business Model
Upside - Down Economics
Strategic Blunders
The magnitude of losses for high - end products might be greater than the losses for low - end products .
The lower prices likely appeal to the same lower - usage consumers which Lexmark is attempting to avoid
Death Spiral
Cash Burn
About 5 years ago , Lexmark had a market value of over $ 12 billion , and its stock was over $ 95 a share .
As of this writing , it is worth less than $ 1.2 billion , and its stock is struggling to stay above $ 15 a share .
What happened ?
Through a series of misinvestments and strategic blunders , Lexmark 's executive management has simultaneously squandered a huge pile of cash , strangled most of their inkjet division , and destroyed some $ 11 billion in shareholder value .
In this post , we 'll explore a big strategic mistake which is leading to the downfall of Lexmark 's inkjet division .
Then , we 'll look at how management has failed to invest properly for the Lexmark 's future .
But in order to understand the true extent of this failure we need to start with how a printer company makes money .
Essentially , a printer business has two major components : 1 ) Printers and 2 ) Supplies for printers .
( Lexmark has also been trying for years to expand a services business for corporate customers , but we 'll keep it simple here . )
Lexmark has two major divisions : the Printing Solutions and Services Division ( or PS&SD ) which focuses on enterprises and uses more - expensive laser - based technology ; and the Imaging Solutions Division ( ISD - formerly known as the Consumer Printer Division , or CPD ) , traditionally a more consumer - oriented division which mainly uses cheaper inkjet technology .
The printers are relatively expensive to buy , but are narrowly profitable or even unprofitable - especially with inexpensive ' low end ' inkjet printers - for their makers .
Printer sales can be fairly volatile - up one quarter , down the next .
All of the active printers that a manufacturer has in the market are considered the ' installed base ' of printers .
Compared to printer costs , supplies tend to be relatively inexpensive .
Even though they cost less to customers , they offer a high profit percentage for their makers .
Supplies sales also tend to be much more stable and reliable , because supplies are generated from multiple years of sales of printers .
In other words , supplies are not generally subject to excessive swings like printers are .
Most of the printer industry tries to offset each high - dollar , low - margin printer with several low - dollar , high - margin supplies sold over the life of that printer .
The initial printer sale yields little profit ( or a loss - as Lexmark has admitted they lose money on many of their inkjet printers ) , while supplies sales from that printer help ( eventually ) drive high profits .
This business model is often called a razors - and - blades model for its similarity to how Gillette made enormous profits :
Sell the razors for as little as possible , and make it up with profits from blades .
As the installed base of printers ramps up , more and more of the company 's revenues ( and , of course , profits ) come from supplies sales .
Eventually , the more stable and reliable supplies business will outpace the more volatile printer business .
Over the past 5 years , supplies have accounted for between 60 and 70 % of Lexmark 's revenues .
In order to get access to the market , most inkjet products are sold through major retailers like Walmart , Best Buy , and Staples .
These retailers wield enormous influence over printer manufacturers .
Retailers are driven to maximize the profitability of their limited shelf space .
If a product is n't creating enough selling " velocity " for a given space , then the retailer will discontinue , or " de - list " it .
And because manufacturers are in a blind competition with one another for shelf space , de-listing poses an enormous threat to future supplies sales .
Lexmark 's competition for retail shelf space is intimidating : it includes market - leader Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) , as well as Canon , Epson , Brother , and Kodak .
To ensure continued access to the retailer 's customers ( and to the future supplies sales ) , manufacturers often feel compelled to sweeten the pot for retailers when their selling velocity is n't high enough .
Most often , this comes in the form of price cuts for printers .
Lexmark was in the vanguard of the low - priced printer movement , offering the same ( or more ) functionality for lower prices than the competition .
For a few years , this was Lexmark 's main competitive edge in the inkjet market .
But in 2003 , HP - who had almost always used its market leadership to demand premium prices - changed its strategy and began to match Lexmark 's pricing .
Over time , the printer industry kept giving more and more ground in this Faustian bargain with retailers , driving printer prices lower and lower , until they ultimately lost money on many of the printers they sold in order to get access to profitable supplies sales .
But when a company loses money on its initial printer sale , funny things start to happen to the business model .
If it grows too fast , then the losses from printers can drain the profits from supplies :
In other words , building the business for long term profit can require the sacrificing of profitability in the short term .
Conversely , if printer sales drop dramatically , then the business can appear enormously profitable : Management can enhance short - term profit even while destroying long - term business fundamentals .
These upside - down economics can be difficult to manage , especially during strategic shifts : it is expensive and uncomfortable to change , but it is also expensive and uncomfortable to remain in place .
In the case of Lexmark 's inkjet - focused ISD , Lexmark executives failed to manage those economics - to the detriment of the ISD business .
For several years , Lexmark executives have signaled their intent to get " higher - usage customers " for ISD .
The premise of these announcements was that Lexmark would sell fewer printers , but that they would n't lose ( as much ) money on printers and would simultaneously gain enormously - profitable customers who used lots of supplies .
HP has traditionally been very strong among small businesses and other high - usage customers , and Lexmark was attempting to crack into that market .
Repositioning to get higher - usage customers would also be a marked departure from Lexmark 's history ( and its brand image ) of cheap , low - end inkjet products .
Trouble is , the executives never identified any sustainably differentiated qualities in their high - end products which would tempt customers to leave the vaunted HP brand for the Lexmark label .
To date , Lexmark 's products are " me-too " products : the same basic functions , features , and performance as the products offered by other printer manufacturers .
The few differentiated features that Lexmark has introduced ( wireless printing , for example ) have been quickly matched by rivals .
And it is n't clear that Lexmark has , in fact , gained higher - usage customers with the few printers it has managed to sell .
Spot - checking product prices in stores and online , it is common to see Lexmark 's " high - end " inkjet products at nearly half the price of competitive products from HP .
This is a clear signal that Lexmark 's products are n't getting the velocity of HP 's products , and that retailers are extracting price concessions as a result .
Further , as these high - performance , heavily - featured products drop in price , two other upside - down dynamics kick in :
An example : a feature - laden product designed for the , say , $ 200 price point might lose even more money when repriced to $ 149 than a sibling product which was designed for $ 49 and reduced to $ 29 .
And that bigger financial hole might be even harder to get out of if Lexmark " wins " customers who do n't print frequently .
So , how did this " repositioning " strategy play out ?
With new ISD leadership in 2008 , Lexmark began to aggressively abandon low - end printers in the pursuit of the high end of the printer market .
Almost immediately , Lexmark 's retail presence was dramatically reduced as it was de-listed at or kicked out of retailer after retailer , ending up with a significant presence only at Walmart and Circuit City - not the kinds of retailers where higher - usage customers would be expected .
Perhaps feeling the sting of being locked out of so many retailers , a more flexible Lexmark began regaining listings earlier this year .
By the end of 2008 , the damage was done : Lexmark lost almost half of the printers sold in 2007 .
2008 revenues were down 22 % from 2007 , while profits were up 47 % in the same period .
Remember when we said that a dramatic drop in printer sales usually creates a temporary boost in profits ?
Well , in this case , Lexmark 's supplies revenue and profit - usually the most stable part of a printing business - have also been dropping , which is a particularly worrisome trend .
This implies significant deterioration in Lexmark 's cash cow - its installed base of printers .
In the past 5 years , the attempts to move to the high end have has disastrous effects :
Since 2004 , ISD has lost two - thirds of its printer sales and 40 % of its revenues .
Profits in the division have dropped by nearly 60 % .
And the prospects for the future are not good .
When the most stable generator of cash ( supplies ) starts drying up , it can put a printing company in a kind of death spiral .
Because of its leveraged , upside - down economics , the company can no longer fund the aggressive growth initiatives which could help pull it out of the downward spiral .
Will the move to higher - usage printers pull Lexmark out of the death spiral ?
No .
As we outline above , Lexmark has failed to offer truly differentiated products with a compelling business model , and it appears that the aggressive move upmarket may actually speed the division 's demise .
What 's even more troubling are the warning signs of a similar death spiral in Lexmark 's larger , more - business - focused PS&SD .
While not as volatile as ISD , the same patterns are emerging to point toward flat or falling supplies revenue : declining overall revenue , declining printer sales , and what appears to be a shrinking installed base .
Once both divisions have entered the spiral , it will be difficult for Lexmark to maintain long - term viability .
For years , Lexmark 's executives have touted the company 's amazing ability to generate cash from its supplies - heavy business model .
But how have they deployed that cash for investors ' and the company 's benefit ?
They have n't .
It is another troubling example of the mismanagement of the company .
At a recent meeting with analysts , Lexmark executives crowed about returning $ 3.2 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks .
As we delve into the effects of those buybacks , we have to wonder what they were so proud of ...
With a buyback , management essentially tells shareholders , " We 've determined that the best investment we can make is in our own company , so we 're going to buy back our own stock . "
After a buyback , since there are fewer shares on the market , each remaining share owns a bigger chunk of the company .
Normally , a buyback is a great thing for long - term shareholders .
Because each share owns a bigger chunk of the company , the share 's price usually goes up .
And a buyback usually acts as a signal from management that they believe in their company 's health and prosperity .
But sometimes , buybacks are used by management as a weak attempt to prop up the share price of a flagging company .
Buybacks are especially worrisome when they are the primary use of cash by technology companies :
Executives are signaling to shareholders that they can find no innovative technology more worthy of investment than simply plowing that cash back into the company 's stock .
As a result of depriving technology development and acquisition , a buyback company 's technology often falls far behind that of competitors .
In Lexmark 's case , the buybacks have backfired .
Over the past 5 years , management has used $ 3.2 billion to buy back some 59 million shares of Lexmark stock at an average price of approximately $ 54 a share .
At $ 15 a share , that $ 3.2 billion investment is now worth about $ 900 million - a loss of over 70 % .
But it is worse than that .
The 59 million shares Lexmark 's executives repurchased represent about 45 % of the shares they started with in 2004 .
So each share should have nearly doubled in value .
Without the buybacks , Lexmark 's share price would likely be around $ 8 , instead of $ 15 .
All in all , Lexmark 's value has dropped by a scandalous 90 % .
In 2004 , Lexmark was sitting on $ 1.5 billion in cash and securities .
By 2008 , Lexmark had burned through that cash ( and other cash it had generated since 2004 ) through share buybacks .
So , it took on a $ 650 million long - term loan , and began using that to continue purchasing new shares .
Rather than deploying this arsenal of cash to fund growth with significant new technologies ( which might have helped to differentiate their products - see discussion above ) , Lexmark invested in its failing status quo .
And , by any measure , that investment failed .
Miserably .
Is this executive incompetence ?
Perhaps .
But there is another , equally - distressing , explanation for why Lexmark 's management engaged in this failed buyback strategy on such a massive scale :
They were protecting themselves .
When a company builds a large mountain of cash , it becomes an attractive takeover target .
In Lexmark 's case , this is especially true , because it has also had ( until recently ) a reliable stream of cash from its supplies business coupled with a depressed stock price .
A private equity firm would look at buying the firm and using the cash and future profits to finance the acquisition .
In 2005 , one of the industry 's best analysts ( Toni Sacconaghi , now with Bernstein Research ) suggested that Lexmark was ripe for precisely such a scenario .
By buying back almost half of Lexmark 's outstanding stock , executives could solve multiple ' problems ' at the same time :
They reduced their cash holdings , thereby reducing their attractiveness as a takeover target ;
They could potentially buy out dissatisfied shareholders ( further reducing takeover potential ) ; and ,
They could prop up their flagging stock price , with the hopes of deferring shareholder judgment on their failures .
All in all , such a strategy would have allowed Lexmark 's executives and board to maintain and concentrate control of the company .
In the process , however , they have failed their shareholders , their employees , and the communities in which they live and work ( especially Lexington ) .
Incompetence .
Or self - interest .
Neither explanation is satisfactory .
And both are deeply troubling .
A call for change

As a former Lexmark employee , I 'm prohibited from using knowledge and insights I gained while I was employed by the company .
I 'm not allowed , for instance , to talk about how board meetings are orchestrated .
I also ca n't use the insights I may have gained in meetings with current and former executives at Lexmark .
I can't talk about the specific products , internal strategies , and personalities which might have led to the failures which I document here .
As a result , this story is stitched together entirely from studying publicly - available financial statements , presentations to analysts , and other public releases from the company and others .
I have not owned Lexmark stock for over 1 year .
I have friends , family , and customers who still work at Lexmark .
This in no way reflects their views , or conversations I may have had with them .
I did not consult with any of them before writing this .
These observations are mine and mine alone .
Finally , this critique is aimed squarely at Lexmark 's executive management .
The failures I document here are theirs , not the failures of Lexmark 's smart and creative rank - and - file employees .
CEO Paul Curlander , ISD President Paul Rooke , and PS&SD President Marty Canning have all been with Lexmark for over a decade .
They presided over the destruction of 90 % of Lexmark 's market value .
They have marshaled failed ( and failing ) business strategies .
They have continually pursued failed financial strategies through stock buy - backs .
They have destroyed some 600 mostly - local US jobs .
By every meaningful business measure , they have failed .
It is time for Lexmark 's board to act decisively .
Lexmark needs a vibrant new strategy 1 ) to survive and 2 ) to grow profitably .
The current standard - bearers are clearly not up to the task .
My hope is that the board can bring in new executive management who can articulate and execute that strategy .
As a Lexington business owner , I want and need Lexmark to thrive .
Lexmark 's current leaders have failed its shareholders , its employees , and our community .
It is time for meaningful change at Lexmark .
A few disclosures are in order :
Credit CARD
Act of 2009 : How it Affects You
Update : Read more about CARD
Act of 2009 here .
It looks as though we will be seeing some of the first serious credit card reform since … well , ever .
The House passed the Senate ’s version of the Credit CARD Act of 2009 .
This , taking effect in February 2010 , is meant to protect consumers from the abuses of credit card companies .
While there is no protection greater than sound and responsible credit habits , a little extra protection never hurts .
Here are some of the big changes to the way credit card companies will be able to function as the new Credit Card Reform
Act comes into being – and how it affects you :
How Payments are Applied to Balances
When you get a promo rate for a portion of your balance , it is lower than your regular purchase rate .
Likewise , a cash advance rate is usually higher than your purchase rate .
For instance , on a credit card with a $ 2,500 balance , you might have :
Promo rate of 2.99 % on $ 800
Cash advance rate of 27.99 % on $ 700
Regular purchase rate on $ 1,000 .
Currently , the credit card issuer would apply your payment ( after interest is deducted , of course ) to the debt with the lowest interest rate .
This way , your balance will earn highest interest for the longest possible period of time .
The new rules change this policy .
Now , the principle payment will be applied to the debt with the highest rate first .
For those who carry balance with different rates , this means you can pay off the overall balance a little faster , and pay less in interest charges .
Retroactive Interest Rate Hikes
Right now , credit card companies raise interest rates if something worsens in your credit report – even if it happens to a different account .
Being late on one payment could trigger interest rate hikes on all your cards .
This does n’t change .
What changes is the way the interest rate hike is applied .
The new rules say that , unless you are 60 days delinquent on your account , the new interest rate can only be applied to new balances .
Your old balance has to be charged at your old rate .
For those working to pay down their debt , this is encouraging .
It means that as long as you stay current , your old balances will not be charged more .
Notice of Changes to Card Agreements
Credit card companies today can change rates , rewards programs and other terms of the card agreement at any time – for no reason and with no notice .
They can even retroactively date changes so that the terms change as of two months before you were notified .
The new law requires that credit card companies give 45 days notice before making changes .
For those who like to be in control of their credit card account , this will be quite helpful .
45 days might be enough time for you to adapt a new plan to pay the card off before the changes .
For those with rewards points , 45 days will give you time to use those points , instead having all your points unceremoniously removed ( or dramatically reduced ) .
Over the Limit Fees
Credit card issuers make a great deal of money by letting you keep charging , even if you are over your credit limit .
For each occurrence , you end up paying $ 39 , or more .
That amount is added to your balance , and you are charged interest on it .
Now , credit card companies will have to get your permission to do this .
I ’m not sure how the “ opt in ” will work , but you will have to agree to allow this to happen in your credit card agreement .
For those who do not keep careful track of their spending , being cut off immediately might encourage them to change their habits .
And , as long as you do n’t opt in , it means no more over the limit fees .
Age Requirements for Credit Cards
Today , anyone over the age of 18 can get a credit card without a co-signer .
The new law , requires a co-signer for anyone under 21 .
This means college students will have a hard time getting credit .
If someone under 21 can prove that they have a job , and can make payments on a credit card , the requirement for a co-signer will be waived .
What to Watch Out for in the Coming Months
Because the new credit card act rules will not take effect until Feb 2010 , it is important that you remain vigilant and consider the affect this legislation might have on you .
Watch for interest rate hikes on your credit cards .
Some issuers may try to raise rates while they can .
Another thing to watch out for is an accelerated loss in terms of the value of your rewards points .
You may see your 5 % gas rewards cut to 3 % or 4 % .
Or your airline miles may not go as far as they did .
Also , be on the look out for the possibility of new annual fees .
“ Premium ” reward programs have been emerging recently , but you may see more of them in coming months .
And , finally , watch your mailbox carefully for “ opt in ” agreements for over the limit transactions .
Who knows how the credit card companies will try to implement this , but you know that they will want you to opt in .
Be especially careful to read everything you get from your credit cards in the coming months .
Finally , the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosures act of 2009 is not a panacea .
You still need to be responsible in the way you handle your credit .
Pelosi now recalls being briefed on NSA 's wiretapping of Rep. Harman Jeremy Gantz
Published : Wednesday April 22 , 2009
Print This Email This STORY UPDATED : Pelosi allegedly " went ballistic " when pushed by a wealthy donor to make Harman Intelligence Committee chairman in exchange for continued donations .
Contradicting a statement made Tuesday , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) said Wednesday that she had in fact been briefed " a few years ago " about a 2005 FBI wiretap involving Californian Representative Jane Harman .
But Pelosi said she was never told the details of the wiretap , and denied that her knowledge of it and a subsequent Justice Department review had anything to do with Harman being passed over for the chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee in late 2006 , the Washington Post reported .
" I did n't even know what [ those briefing me ] were talking about , " Pelosi said .
" All they said was that she was wiretapped . "
Harman was allegedly caught by an FBI wiretap pledging to intervene in an espionage case involving Israeli lobbyists , the Congressional Quarterly 's Jeff Stein revealed Sunday .
Wednesday , Stein reported that Harmon was overheard on a later NSA wiretap discussing with a suspected Israeli agent " a failed fundraising ploy designed to get her named chairman of the House Intelligence Committee . "
An anonymous former national security official who heard the recorded conversation said the suspected agent was " heard telling Harman that ' Pelosi went ballistic ' when [ wealthy Israel supporter Haim ]
Saban allegedly warned her that if Harman were not made chairman of the Intelligence Committee after the 2006 elections " ' you 'll get no more contributions from me ... ' "
Quoting former senior Bush Administration officials , Stein 's Sunday article also alleges that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales conspired to drop criminal action against the then - ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , because he needed her help when a firestorm of criticism erupted in December 2005 after the New York Times published details about the NSAs warrantless wiretapping program .
According to a purported transcript of the wiretapped call between Harman and a suspected Israeli agent  which was reportedly tapped legally under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court  Harman was recorded saying she would waddle into the AIPAC case if you think itll make a difference . 
 In exchange for Harmans help , the sources said , the suspected Israeli agent pledged to help lobby Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , then - House minority leader , to appoint Harman chair of the Intelligence Committee after the 2006 elections , which the Democrats were heavily favored to win ,  Stein added .
Pelosi , who noted Wednesday that it is a " tradition " for the House 's top Democrat and top Republican to be briefed any time a member of the legislative body appears on a wiretap , said Harman did n't receive the chairmanship because she had already held for two terms .
 The only reason Jane is not the chairman is because she already served the two terms ,  Pelosi told a New York Times reporter .
 It had nothing to do with donors , nothing to do with eaves - dropping , wiretapping . 
Harman has denied allegations that she intervened on behalf of the two Israeli lobbyists , this week calling for the Justice Department to release the wiretap transcripts .
But Wednesday she began walking back her original and emphatic denials .
Pelosi called Harman an " extraordinarily talented member of Congress " and a " patriotic American " who " would never do anything to hurt her country . 

High rollers : Paton ( centre , front ) with the Bay City Rollers in 1976 , and recently
BEEN AND GONE
By Nick Serpell
BBC Obituary Unit
Our regular column covering the passing of significant - but lesser - reported - people of the past month .
The Scottish band , The Bay City Rollers , owed much of their high - profile but ultimately short - term success to their flamboyant manager Tam Paton .
A former big band leader he maintained tight control over his charges with a bewildering series of line - up changes .
He also tried to boost their boy - next - door image by insisting they preferred milk to alcohol .
He took the band from the first chart success , Keep on Dancing in 1971 , through the hype of Rollermania with its hordes of tartan - clad , mainly female , fans .
The band reached their peak in 1975 when Bye Bye Baby topped the charts for six weeks , going on to be the best - selling single of the year .
But by 1979 the group 's popularity had begun to wane and Paton was fired following rows over royalty payments .
He was jailed in 1982 for gross indecency with teenage boys but went on to build a multi-million pound property business .
Bea Arthur in Mame in 1974 , and 28 years later Actress Bea Arthur only achieved real fame at the age of 50 , when she appeared in the US TV series Maude .
She began her career in New York 's Greenwich Village , augmenting her salary with singing stints at local nightclubs .
There were a number of small parts in film and TV before she won a Tony in 1966 for her role as Vera Charles in the musical Mame .
She had originally created Maude Findlay for the sitcom All in the Family and CBS executives decided to give her the lead role in a spin - off series .
The show did not hesitate to tackle what were then divisive social issues , including abortion , drug use and family abuse .
She picked up an Emmy for the role but decided to quit in 1978 as ratings fell .
Seven years later she was back , this time in the Golden Girls , a gentle comedy about a group of women sharing a house in Florida .
Screened at the same time as Miami Vice it was referred to by its many fans as " Miami Nice " .
Chambers , holding the detergent pack on which she appears with a baby The film Behind the Green Door , starring Marilyn Chambers , was a world away from Bea Arthur 's gentle comedies .
It was the first hard - core pornographic film ever put on general release in the United States and was especially shocking to 1972 audiences as it depicted a white woman having sex with a black man .
Chambers ' previous career had been as an advertising model , notably for Procter & Gamble 's Ivory Snow , where she appeared under the slogan " 99 and 44/100 % pure . "
Boxes of the detergent were swiftly withdrawn after her cinema debut and the notoriety which accompanied the film made it almost impossible for her to break into mainstream cinema .
She later regretted her career in porn , saying : " If I were to do things over again , I 'd do them differently . "
In 2004 she ran for US vice - president as a member of the libertarian Personal Choice Party , gaining just over 900 votes A paucity of votes was also the preserve of Colin Jordan , whose extreme right - wing views were distinctly at odds with the new spirit of liberalism which was being engendered during the 1960s .
The son of a Birmingham postman , he formed the National Socialist Movement in 1962 , an organisation which was both anti-Semitic and opposed to black and Asian immigration .
In 1965 Jordan led a group of fascist demonstrators that invaded a Labour Party meeting at which he ended up being punched by the then defence secretary , Denis Healey .
Jordan stood for Parliament on several occasions , regularly losing his deposit .
In 1968 the NSM was reconstituted as the British Movement with Jordan as leader .
However , he was forced to stand down in 1975 after being convicted of stealing women 's underwear from the Leamington Spa branch of Tesco .
Jack Jones - once more powerful than the prime minister , said the British public Jack Jones spent his early years fighting fascism before becoming one of the most influential trade union leaders of the 20th Century .
He was beaten up by Oswald Mosley 's Blackshirts on the streets of his native Liverpool before being badly wounded fighting with the International Brigade against Franco 's forces in the Spanish Civil War .
He became a full - time official with the Transport & General Workers ' Union and was elected general secretary in 1968 .
It was the time of beer and sandwiches at No 10 when the union block vote wielded massive power within the Labour Party .
A 1977 poll revealed that 54 % of the respondents believed Jones was the most powerful man in Britain .
His hardline attitudes were , in part , responsible for the winter of discontent in 1979 which precipitated the return of a Conservative government and curbs on trade union powers .
Exotic Dancer became famous for his rivalry with Kauto Star , a horse he never managed to beat .
Bred in France , and trained by former jump jockey Jonjo O'Neill , he won his first race at Cheltenham as a novice in 2005 .
He tasted success in the 2006 - 07 season with wins in the Paddy Power Gold Cup , Boylesport Gold Cup and the Letheby & Christopher Chase , all at Cheltenham .
But he was beaten into second place by Kauto Star in both the King George VI Chase and the Cheltenham Gold Cup .
Entered for the 2009 Grand National he was subsequently withdrawn and ran in the Totesport Bowl on the Thursday of Grand National week finishing second .
He died of a heart attack shortly after the race .
Among others who died in April were Clement Freud , former Liberal MP and Just a Minute star ; Lennie Bennett , comedian and quiz show host ; Peter Rogers , producer of the Carry On films .

Poll : Democrats lead GOP by double digits
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Democratic Party Republican Party Opinion Research Corporation or or Create Your Own
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A CNN poll released Wednesday may continue the anxiety for the GOP , showing Democrats with a 14 - point advantage over Republicans among registered voters asked their preferences in this year 's midterm elections .
The poll , conducted for CNN by Opinion Research Corp. , found that 52 percent of respondents who were registered voters said they were leaning toward voting for a Democrat , while 38 percent said they were leaning toward a Republican .
Ten percent said they did n't know how they would vote or that they would choose a candidate not from the two major parties .
( Watch what is pulling down the president 's approval rating -- 2:07 )
Among all Americans , the poll found 50 percent leaning toward Democrats , 37 leaning toward the Republicans and 3 percent intending to vote for non-majority candidates .
Ten percent had no opinion
The poll , based on telephone interviews with 1,021 adult Americans between Friday and Sunday , had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .

Republicans are suffering politically , the poll suggested , because nearly half of the Americans interviewed said they think the country is on the wrong track .
Forty - six percent of respondents said they believed things were going well and 53 percent said they felt things were going badly .
Two percent had no opinion .
The question had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
The figures are nearly reversed from what a similar CNN poll found in February , when 51 percent of respondents said they thought things were going well and 47 percent said things were going badly .
Republicans enjoy a 29 - seat majority in the House and a 10 - seat majority in the Senate , but political watchers say those majorities , especially the one in the House , may be threatened .
Democrats would need to pick up 15 seats to regain the House and six seats to take control of the Senate .
Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri , the No. 3 Republican official in the House , told CNN he is n't worried about his party losing power .
" Between now and [ the midterm elections ] , the Democrats are going to be forced to define what they 're for , " said Blunt , who is the majority whip .
" That 's going to work to our advantage as it works to our advantage to have a chance to explain what we 're for . "
Congressional Republicans have also been weighed down by the public 's low opinion of President Bush 's job performance .
A CNN poll released Monday found Bush 's approval rating was 34 percent -- an uptick of 2 percentage points from the most recent CNN poll in late April .
( Full story )
The president 's disapproval rating was 58 percent , down 2 points from the previous poll .
( View Bush 's latest approval numbers )
The poll , also done by Opinion Research Corp. , was based on interviews of 1,021 adults .
Both shifts are within the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
More than half of those who disapproved of Bush 's job performance -- 56 percent -- said the war in Iraq was the reason .

Thirteen percent said the recent increase in gas prices had fueled their displeasure .
Twenty - six percent gave other reasons .
Because that question was asked only of those who disapproved , it had a different sampling error -- 4 percentage points .
