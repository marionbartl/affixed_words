BAGHDAD–In 2003 , when Saddam Hussein ruled Iraq , a woman named Hamdiyah al - Dulaimi had three handsome sons .
They had grown into good men with wives and families .
They were the shining accomplishments of her life .
In hindsight , it was a much better life than she realized at the time .
Most certainly better than it is now , four years after the fall of Baghdad .
On April 9 , 2003 , the people of the city cheered invading U.S. soldiers in the city square .
Leaders of the coalition troops promised liberty , freedom and life without tyranny .
But Baghdad still has none of those things .
And al - Dulaimi has no sons .
One day last spring , a dozen men in black uniforms knocked down her door with machine guns .
They screamed " Filthy Sunnis ! " and they handcuffed her sons : Haqqi , 39 , Qais , 37 , Ali , 31 .
" Why ?
What did my boys do ? " the mother cried .
She got no answers .
The dozen gunmen dragged their new prisoners across the floor , pummelling heads with their rifle butts .
Al - Dulaimi dropped to her knees , clinging to the ankles of a kidnapper .
She begged , kissing his shoes .
Then she bargained : " At least leave me one .
Take the other two .
Leave me one . ''
They beat her head with their gunstocks until she passed out .
Then they took her sons .
The next day , their corpses were on the sidewalk .
Haqqi's body was headless .
The bodies of Qais and Ali had been mutilated ; some parts were missing .
Like so many others , their grieving mother fled – to Syria , in her case .
She left behind deprivation and corruption , mayhem and madness ; a city that is hemorrhaging many of its best and brightest , while many of those left behind are brutalized and traumatized .
Not withstanding the well - publicized stroll by Arizona Republican Senator John McCain last week – " Things are better , " he insisted – Iraqis wonder :
Can a place where men blow themselves up in street markets , cars implode at traffic lights and kidnappings occur in broad daylight ever recover ?
There is a way out , say historians and sociologists .
South Africa went on , after the horrors of apartheid , in large part because of reconciliation hearings headed by Nobel - prizewinner Archbishop Desmond Tutu , who gathered victims and perpetrators in the 1990s and led them through extraordinary meetings of shared memories that led to forgiveness .
In the same way , Rwanda tried to reach beyond the machetes that hacked to death 800,000 Tutsis , putting the Hutus who wielded them in the same room with their victims ' families .
Such methods take years , and nothing can be done until the fighting stops .
" It 's one of those terrible situations where you are at first aghast that such things could happen , " said Jack Goldstone , a sociologist at George Mason University in Virginia , who specializes in international conflict .
" And then you realize that people are people and they 've been doing this kind of thing forever and it's not the end of the world .
People do go on . ''
But , " for any of this to occur , there has to be a settlement that provides security for the people of Iraq , " he cautioned .
" And we 're a long way from that . ''
Baghdad 's brain drain
Gone missing are the simple things that feed body and soul : drinkable water that flows from a tap , electricity that stays on , movie theatres that open , booksellers with new books .
Also missing are an ever - growing number of doctors , professors and teachers – " the brain of Baghdad , " as the Iraqis say .
There is no official record of the number of professionals who have fled .
There are only anecdotes – an Iraqi doctor now living in Jordan who says 80 per cent of his colleagues ran for their lives , based on what he saw at his hospital .
An architect in Baghdad who must now work at home , who says 30 per cent of her fellow designers are gone .
Dr. Haidr al - Maliki , a specialist in child psychology , is a guarded but compassionate man .
For him , leaving Iraq is not an option .
" If I leave and all the other doctors leave , all the hospitals would be closed , " he said .
" We have to take care of our people .
Death can come in any country . ''
It has already come calling for al - Maliki , but the visit was unsuccessful .
A 16 - year - old , " fine looking boy " walked into his clinic in 2005 and asked , " Are you Dr. Haidr ? ' '
" Yes , " said al - Maliki .
With that , the teenager produced a pistol and opened fire .
The doctor dove under his desk ; he was shot twice , in the hand and shoulder .
He said the attack was part of an insurgent campaign against doctors .
Six others were attacked in the city , and four died .
The doctor never returned to his clinic .
Instead , he now works out of a hospital in central Baghdad .
The flashbacks he suffers from the shooting are horrible , he says , but sometimes they help him empathize with his young patients , who are more traumatized than their parents .
There is the 16 - year - old girl who was abducted in February outside her school in a Sunni neighbourhood .
She was beaten and kept in a room for nine days with about 20 other kidnapped girls .
She was forced to sleep next to the corpse of another victim , a girl who was killed when her parents could n't pay .
The parents of al - Maliki 's patient paid $ 20,000 – the going rate in ransom negotiations – for her safe return .
She is seriously damaged – terrified of darkness and the nightmares that come with sleep ; hostile and aggressive when she is awake .
There are the sister and brother haunted by the recurring images of gunmen who invaded their house , tied up their parents , and beat them before their eyes .
The children cannot function at school and now remain at home .
There is little that al - Maliki can do except listen and offer words of calm comfort .
1.7 million have fled
Faiza al - Arji last visited Baghdad in November .
She stayed for a week .
She had planned to stay longer , but her friends begged her to leave .
It 's too dangerous , they said .
Maybe someone will shoot you .
Maybe there will be a bomb in the road .
Who knows where death comes from ?
But she remembers a night when she and her friends had gathered for dinner .
There was laughter at the table .
Al - Arji could not join in .
She could n't even eat .
She sat there , bewildered by the revelry , astonished that her friends could make light of such darkness .
" Faiza , relax , " they told her .
" It 's okay to have fun .
We have to go on .
We cannot give up . ''
Al - Arji gave up on life in Baghdad long ago .
She now lives in Jordan , which has become home to roughly 700,000 Iraqi refugees – a staggering number in a small country of 5.6 million .
Another estimated 1 million are scattered in Syria , Lebanon and other countries .
Al - Arji is lucky .
She and her husband have money and can afford to live in the expensive city of Amman .
Both are civil engineers .
They left in 2005 , even though she vowed after the invasion that she would never leave .
She endured having guns shoved in her face and her car stolen .
She reported it to the Iraqi police , who said , " My sister , I understand .
But what can I do ?
The police are weak . ''
But when one of her three grown sons was kidnapped , that was the end .
He was abducted by security guards at his university , who considered him a terrorist because " he had a beard on his face , '' said his mother .
The kidnappers demanded $ 20,000 .
Her husband paid it .
They fled .
Still , she maintains her ties to her homeland .
She works with aid agencies , navigating a rabbit warren of bureaucracy and logistics , sending water filtration kits to hospitals in Iraq .
She often hears horror stories from loved ones left behind .
An aunt was standing in her garden last year .
A missile fell , and she was killed .
A neighbour was standing outside his door when a roadside bomb erupted .
Just the other day , she spoke to her sister in Baghdad .
On the walls of the houses on her street , someone had scrawled , " All Shia must leave . "
Her sister wasted no time .
The family abandoned their house and most of their belongings .
They are staying with friends in another neighbourhood , hoping the invaders will someday leave .
" It is hell , " al - Arji said .
" It is a war zone .
It is not a city any more . ''
She cannot understand the insurgents .
" Who are these people ? '' she cries on the phone from her home in Amman .
" Who is funding them ?
How can they do this ? ''
They are simple questions with no answers , sensible thoughts for an insensible city .
" You can't walk in the street .
You can't go to buy a book .
Everything has been cancelled .
They have lost the meaning of life . ''
UPDATE : I 'm waiting for Mr. Sanchez to endorse the Meehan legislation that would let him continue his service .
In the military .
In this first - person piece he just wrote in Salon , former gay porn star and gay prostitute Matt Sanchez , a GOP hero , blames those evil liberals for outing his man- whore , porn star past .
Sanchez , who starred in such thrillers as " Touched by an Anal : Four Hours of Heavenly Anal Action " - I 'm not joking ( this is NOT a work - friendly link ) - now says that the porn industry is evil and liberal and that 's why he became a conservative .
Get it .
It 's our fault that he was a man - whore , it 's our fault that he went in to gay porn .
Uh huh .
He also notes that his conservative friends are still embracing him .
I 'm sure they are .
We 've discovered long ago what hypocritees conservatives are about their family values .
( We also discovered how many of the most ardent conservatives are big ole closet cases , so I 'm sure they 'd love to embrace you , Matt . )
Speaking of hypocrites , this guy says he 's a Marine reservist .
How cool is that .
I did n't know they let gay porn star hookers in the Marine reservists .
While I doubt there 's a specific line - item in the Do n't Ask Don't Tell ( DADT ) legislation covering starring in gay porn and engaging in gay male prostitution , I 'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it 's probably covered by the spirit of DADT .
Then again , this guy is making history .
By leaving this guy in the Marines , Bush is pretty clearly violating Dont ' Ask Don't Tell and establishing a legal precedent for other gays ( or guys who have starred in gay porn and worked as gay prostitutes ) to stay in the military , since apparently gay sex no longer makes you gay per the Bush administration ( then what does ? ) .
Yes , I 'm sure Matt 's conservative friends in the Bush administration , and his buddies Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity , wo n't have any problem with Matt remaining a Marine reservist and keeping his benefits now that they know he 's a gay porn star hooker .
They 'll have no problem with Sanchez being the guy who brings Do n't Ask Don't Tell to its knees ( sorry , I had to ) .
To paraphrase Syliva Plath , every conservative loves a gay man-whore .
The irony of course is that we evil liberals support Matt 's right to serve in the military , his conservative buddies do n't .
Now , I 've heard that Sanchez says he 's not gay .
Yeah , I 'm sure there 's an exemption in Do n't Ask Don't Tell for guys who perform in gay porn movies and sell themselves as prostitutes to other man .
He 's not really gay , it 's just a job , and an adventure !
Far more background from our Joe :
Andy at Towleroad tipped us off to the story of conservative star Matt Sanchez that was intially exposed by Joe .
My.
God. in post titled " Jeff Gannon Redux . "
That gets your attention , huh ?
Seems that in addition to being a star at CPAC and in other right wing circles , including appearances on O'Reilly and Hannity , Sanchez has starred in a number of " films " that probably were n't being shown at CPAC -- or maybe they were :
Now , if you 're like me , you might think , " Hmm , 36 years old and he 's a junior in college and only a corporal in the Marines ? "
Odd , but not totally implausible .
But Sanchez ' face tinkled a few gay bells out there in fairyland , and last night I began to get emails letting me know that his rather late appearance on the Ivy League scene was because Sanchez has had a lengthy career in gay porn , working under the names Rod Majors ( NSFW ) and Pierre LaBranche , starring in such art films as Jawbreaker ....
[ This is where it gets not so work place friendly ]
Seriously , you can't make this stuff up .
Sanchez had a " devoted following " from his film career .
One wonders if Sanchez had a devoted following at CPAC ?
Joe .
My .
God. is staying on top of this one .
He 's talked to Sanchez and just posted an interview with him here
Unlike the makers of nearly all other online games , the operators of SecondLife not only allow and encourage the exchange of game currency for real money , but they actually facilitate it .
As early as 2005 I began noticing a rumbling in interest - focused blogs about the exploding market that was SecondLife .
Touted as a pioneering future Metaverse on the industry ’s most informed blog , TerraNova , an array of journalists , academics , and company executives have claimed that SecondLife boasts an economy complete with in - game banks , multiple currency exchanges , a floating currency exchange rate , and a burgeoning in - game commerce and business base .
In 2005 I began working as a venture consultant for some entrepreneurs and investors trying to develop a fairly ambitious “ real - money - trading ” ( RMT ) business idea .
My work resulted in my collection of a large amount of RMT market data for most of the popular massively multiplayer games and virtual worlds .
Although the new venture was never pursued due to my analysis of the true RMT market , one game caught our particular interest : SecondLife , operated by Linden Research Inc. ( privately held , San Francisco CA ) .
The Virtual Economy
Although many people were introduced to the idea that commerce and trade within virtual reality worlds could represent real world money profits by BusinessWeek ’s cover story on infamous SecondLife resident and self described “ Land Baroness ” , Anshe Chung , industry followers had long realized the potential of RMT .
Shanda Entertainment ( SNDA ) , operator of the most popular and successful games in Asia , for example , had committed to a strategy of harvesting RMT profits long before Linden Research set up shop .
Nonetheless , financial publications such as The Economist and The Financial Times began catching on , running articles about RMT – often citing SecondLife as the phenomenon ’s leading model .
One Financial Times article , referencing a university professor who makes his career by studying “ virtual economies ” , suggested the size of the total RMT market was $ 1bn USD in 2005 , and would grow to over $ 7bn USD by 2009 .
And SecondLife was at the forefront of where money was being made .
Or , so one would rationally conclude from the buzz .
When BenchMark Capital backs a company like Linden Research , it ’s safe to assume otherwise smart investors are expecting huge potential market payoffs .
The idea of SecondLife ’s economy is simple .
It ’s just like a real world economy , except it takes place entirely within the company operated game servers .
Customers from around the world connect with a sort of super - browser , which renders complex graphics , video , stereo music and other useful utilities not unlike a web browser .
But the difference is that SecondLife is a virtual world .
More like a Hollywood representation of the web than today ’s mundane reality .
Customers take on avatars which represent their presence in the virtual world .
As these avatars interact , commerce is conducted .
One starts SecondLife with some fairly mundane clothing , for example .
Upon entered the world , a new customer is immediately assaulted with a variety of clothes , jewelry , shoes , hair styles ; and that ’s only the tip of the iceberg .
But nothing is free , not even in virtual reality .
New customers are allocated a few “ Lindens ” or L$ ( SLL being the standard trade abbreviation ) .
Most new customers quickly blow through these starter L$ as they dress up their avatars .
New L$ are distributed to customers as they pump real money into the virtual world .
Nearly all customers utilize the game ’s built - in “ buy money ” feature , which allows them to charge their credit card or PayPal account “ micropayments ” .
Micropayments are a popular , proven business model first established in the mobile - phone market .
All SecondLife does is extend this concept to a virtual reality game world .
Multiply all these micropayments among Linden ’s claim of millions of customers , tens of thousands of which are online at any given time , and SecondLife supposedly represents a very real economy generating hundreds of thousands of real dollars of commerce , daily .
Linden self reports an astonishing L$ 314,101,463 were earned in December 2006 .
That ’s $ 1,163,338 USD of value by Linden ’s average “ exchange rate ” of SLL / USD .
But more about exchange rates later .
What are People Buying ?
Reading BusinessWeek , or studying Linden ’s or various other SecondLife blogs , it appears that the largest business of SecondLife is land speculation .
Anshe ’s claim to have earned over $ 1 m USD from SecondLife is primarily related to her virtual land brokering business .
Another important source of SecondLife commerce is people “ playing dress up ” with their avatars .
Buying clothes , earrings , new faces , or other more private body parts represents a great deal of the readily visible commerce outside of virtual real estate brokers .
Of course , anyone lingering in the world of SecondLife for more than a passing glance quickly discovers the real engine to the SecondLife economy : sex and gambling .
A healthy share of micropayments are pumped into the system as customers engage in pulling the virtual slot lever or patronize one of the myriad virtual sex workers .
But it ’s Still an Economy , Right ?
As opportunists and capitalists , we ’re not particularly bothered by indications that SecondLife generates most of its economic “ wealth ” through a rampant virtual real estate bubble which makes San Francisco , Marina District condo look like a bargain .
Nor are we particularly bothered that the virtual playground provides a safe harbor for what is effectively the phone - sex industry reinvented .
And internet gambling , despite the US Federal Government ’s recent protestations to the contrary , is inevitable .
So why not profit off of it ?
And how better , than in a utopian Ayn Rand open market capitalistic metaverse ?
Of course , it ’s not all that simple .
And what ’s true of the real world turns out to be true of the virtual world : if it sounds too good to be true …
The Test
In order to participate in a legitimate economy , there are a few basic prerequisites .
SecondLife has the appearance of a virtual “ securities and exchange commission ” , virtual banks , virtual currency exchanges , and even virtual venture capitalists and REITS .
In July of 2006 we took a look at two in - game banks which allowed SecondLife residents to deposit their L$ , and earn interest on the balance .
These are private banks , run by other players , not by the game company itself .
I discovered that the interest rates being paid by these banks , when calculate by interest - rate - parity against the USD , were mispriced allowing for a whopping 2,786.32 % return arbitrage opportunity .
Over some months we sunk the better part of $ 10,000 USD into SecondLife , borrowing from banks , lending to banks , and entering into various types of virtual financial arrangements with virtual businesses .
The first problem we encountered was one of counterparty risk .
Put simply , you can seldom trust those with whom you ’re doing business in SecondLife .
Even supposedly well established , well regarded business citizens are prone to defaulting on any obligations which prove inconvenient .
Whole banks will disappear over night , along with your L$ balance .
Private businesses will simply refuse to make good on financial contracts .
And individuals , pretty much all of whose real world identities are carefully guarded anonymous secrets , sometimes even will openly default , without recourse .
Justifications for default and non performance are usually wrapped in pseudo - libertarian internet political rants , or SecondLife political hyperbole .
The simple fact is , if you arbitrage a bank for over 2,000 % return because they do n’t understand financial engineering , do n’t expect to be able to collect come payment time .
But , that does n’t mean it ’s impossible to make L$ .
In fact , we were able to make quite a few L$ in a very short period of time , despite disingenuous counterparties .
Enter the second problem , the L$ exchange markets are effectively rigged .
At any given time over the past year or so , the SLL / USD exchange rate has hovered between about 250 and 300 .
That is , for every L$ 300 you earned , you could expect to get $ 1 USD .
Now recall , there are supposedly hundreds of thousands of real dollars being spent daily ; over L$ 250,000,000 .
Between Linden 's official exchange market and the private exchanges , all appearances suggest a large volume of L$ daily exchange trade .
The catch is , however , these headline rates only apply to small amounts .
For small time buyers and sellers of L$ -- be they virtual Johns paying up for sexy avatar escorts , or small time digital jewelry makers cashing out a couple hundred real dollars – this works well .
Most of these people will use Linden ’s official LindeX exchange , anyway .
LindeX is actually not a virtual currency exchange market so much as it is an open auction , anyway .
This means LindeX is not particularly useful for big trades .
The private exchanges , however , are owned by the businesses which sit at the top of the SecondLife economic pyramid .
The “ Virtual Land Baroness ” owns the largest such exchange .
So it is not surprising that our attempts to trade our L$ for $ USD were met with confiscatory market reflectivity .
Or , put simply , every time we attempted to transact more than a couple hundred dollars , the SLL / USD rate would spike to levels approaching or even greater than 500 .
Example : mid July 2006 SLL / USD was 293.0/279.2 bid/ask on the primary open exchange .
Our attempts to trade L$ 650,000 resulted in settlement bids of 350-450 .
Interestingly , these trades tended to net returns of right around 4 % , which was the prevailing dollar deposit rate .
The Ponzi Scheme Epiphany
As we scratched our heads trying to figure out if there were n’t a more clever way of disguising our trades , or perhaps creating our own in - game banks and exchanges in order to arbitrage the other direction , it suddenly dawned upon me .
This game was just a pyramid scheme .
SecondLife is not a dramatic taste of our future , in which markets are virtual , currency is free from government control , taxes are non-existent , and normal people can become real millionaires simply by clicking their mouse a few times .
SecondLife is n’t even a simple virtual economy , with legitimate buying and selling , and opportunity for those who would compete .
No , SecondLife is a classic pyramid scheme .
Or , more of an Amway - like pyramid : partially legitimate , partially ponzi .
Sure , there are plenty of legitimate SecondLife customers who just like to go there to get their kicks , spend a couple dollars , and be on their way .
But , the buzz is n’t that Joe Sixpack can sit at his computer and gamble a little before bed with a smashingly attractive avatar .
The buzz is that Anshe and others are making real millions .
And a short visit to the world of SecondLife will reveal the frighteningly large portion of residents who “ know someone who makes his or her living ” doing something in SecondLife .
Just the other night I had an interesting conversation with someone claiming to be a single mom of three , who spends her days turning virtual tricks and arranging for E - Bay payments through SecondLife L$ .
She did n’t seem to have any idea why her mysterious benefactor would pay her a commission to simply arrange PayPal transfers .
More cynically intelligent readers will immediately recognize these transactions for what they are .
Again , the fact that tax evasion , organized crime and money laundering exist in the virtual world does n’t distress me all that much ; these things exist in the real world , and have for a pretty long time .
The distressing part is what this single mom said later ; the same thing one will hear over and over from SecondLife residents : she was just doing the cybersex and E - Bay stuff to fund her virtual jewelry store .
She was a jewelry designer , and had already opened a little shop in a virtual mall .
And , to her amazement , she ’d already made over L$ 50,000 after only a month ( about $ 185 USD ) .
I did n’t bother to point out that she had n’t counted her expenses for renting her virtual shop or accounted for taxes , let alone the fact that she was earning less than 1/100th of what she could get just flipping burgers in the real world .
[ This statement was an error .
I should have said " let alone the fact that she was earning much less than she could get ... " ]
SadLife
And that ’s the story of SecondLife .
Like the paid promotion infomercials that run on CNBC , sadly SecondLife is a giant magnet for the desperate , uninformed , easily victimized .
Its promises of wealth readily ensnare those who can least afford to lose their money or lives to such scam in exactly the same way that real estate investor seminars convince divorcees with low FICO scores to buy houses sight unseen with no money down .
Even some corporations have dedicated marketing budgets to creating a presence in SecondLife .
While few will shed a tear for the frivolousness of these companies ’ spending , such adds a false legitimacy to SecondLife .
Interestingly , no legitimate , real world corporation has earned net profit from SecondLife activities .
That ’s because there are but a very tiny handful that profit off of the SecondLife economy .
A handful of casino owners , large scale virtual land flippers , and brothel owners are responsible for nearly all of the real money extracted from the game .
And they continue to attract new recruits to the bottom of the pyramid .
After all , Anshe Chung herself started out as a virtual whore , so you too can become a SecondLife millionaire , right ?
[ I apologize to Anshe for what was a very poorly considered statement .
I deeply regret any ill will it has caused .
Please consider it retracted .
I also thank Prokofy for enlightening me to some of the bitter realities experienced by those on top of Second Life 's economic order . ]
Read the ValleyWag version of this article .
Retractions and Corrections :
Acknowledging an error in my original article : A “ burger flipper ” does not earn 100 times more than a Second Life income earner , at least not as I intended express .
I double dipped on my analogy and merely meant to demonstrate that a “ burger flipper ” earns significantly more than a similarly skilled Second Life income earner .
By now , you 've all likely seen this Washington Post headline :
Shortages Threaten Guard 's Capability
88 Percent of Units Rated ' Not Ready '
And it probably comes as no surprise to you .
After all , it 's practically become the secret Conventional Wisdom ( if such a thing can possibly exist ) : George W. Bush is destroying America 's Armed Forces .
And sure , we all knew this :
" We ca n't sustain the [ National Guard and reserves ] on the course we 're on , " said Arnold L. Punaro , chairman of the 13 - member Commission on the National Guard and Reserves , established by Congress in 2005 .
And this :
" The Department of Defense is not adequately equipping the National Guard for its domestic missions , " the commission 's report found .
It faulted the Pentagon for a lack of budgeting for " civil support " in domestic emergencies , criticizing the " flawed assumption " that as long as the military is prepared to fight a major war , it is ready to respond to a disaster or emergency at home .
And this :
In the Washington area , Guard officials worry about a catastrophic attack .
In the event of " a very large . . . chemical , biological or nuclear incident in the national capital region , I would need every truck I was authorized , and we do n't have that , " said Col. Robert Simpson , director of the joint staff for the Virginia National Guard .
" We are definitely short trucks , all wheeled vehicles , " as well as radios , bulldozers and other gear , Simpson said .
The state Guard could handle ordinary contingencies such as " bad winter weather , " he said .
But you only know that because you 're a bunch of liberal moonbats , and you read " newspapers . "
Well , traitor smarty - pants , did you know this ?
Some employers , already pinched by mobilizations of workers who are in the National Guard or reserves , are saying privately they ’ll be reluctant to hire new employee - reservists .
Discriminating against someone because of their military obligations is illegal , but 51 percent of employers who responded to an informal , online poll by Workforce Management magazine said they would not hire an employee who is a citizen - soldier " if they knew that a military reservist or National Guard member could be called up and taken away from their job for an indeterminate amount of time , " as the question was posed .
Yes , that 's right .
The hard workin ' , job providin ' , beer - with - the - preznit wantin ' backbone of ' merika -- not you , dummies , your bosses -- are at the point where they 'd rather break the law ( and hate on the troops , too ) than put their money where their mouths are , and support Th' Decider .
Oh , they 'll still tell you they do ( though in ever - dwindling numbers ) .
But they 've got their fingers crossed behind their backs with one hand , and have a death grip on their wallets with the other hand .
Carry on your war , Mr. President .
Just do it with someone else 's workers .
Great thread , Chanderjeet .
I always enjoy your photography .
That one above looks like " someone " was doing a little nuke testing ...

When I made the switch to Ubuntu Linux on my desktop computer ( that is , if you can call triple - booting Windows XP , Vista , and Ubuntu a " switch " ) , I was a little worried about finding the applications and tools that would make me as productive working in Ubuntu as I am working on Windows .

After a little searching around the interweb , however , I 've been more than impressed with the number of great , full - featured applications available for Linux , many of which outshine their Windows counterparts .
And what 's best - they 're all totally free .
Here are my top 10 favorite applications and tweaks that made replacing Windows with Ubuntu a breeze .

Beagle is the Spotlight / Google Desktop search app for Linux .
However , think more Spotlight than Google Desktop ( which is a good thing , because Google Desktop can suck at times ) .
Beagle indexes your files and lets you construct quick , powerful file searches .

3. Gnome Deskbar Applet
The Gnome Deskbar Applet is sort of a cross between Spotlight and Quicksilver .
Basically it 's a great app launcher and then some , with plugins designed to integrate more search options than you can shake a stick at , from live Google searches to integration with Beagle .

To use the Deskbar Applet , right - click the top panel and select Add to Panel ... and find Deskbar Applet ( incidentally , there are a lot of other great tools in the Add to Panel ... dialog worth checking out ) .
It 's no Quicksilver , but it 's better than any app launcher / search tool available on Windows .

8. Add NTFS Read / Write support
If you 're switching from Windows , chances are you 've got lots of data stored on an NTFS ( New Technology File System ) formatted drive that you 're not ready to get rid of .
This used to be a major problem , since Linux is n't able to write files to NTFS drives .
Or at least that used to be the case .
Luckily the Linux - NTFS project has built a driver to overcome those limitations .

9 . Turn off the system beep
You know that annoying , shrill beep that comes not from your speakers , but rather inside the depths of your computer called a system beep ?
I hate it , but Ubuntu likes to use it when , for example , I 'm searching for text in Firefox and I get to the point where the text does n't match anything .
In Windows , this invokes a fairly annoying noise .
In Ubuntu , it 's the system beep , which is even worse .
Here 's how to disable it :
rmmod pcspkr
If you decide you miss it , this will re-load it :
modprobe pcspkr

As for me :
While I am really happy with all of the programs I 've found for Linux that replace their Windows counterparts ( switching to Linux has never been easier ) , I have to admit that I 'm in desperate need of a text replacement tool along the lines of AutoHotkey or Textpander .
I would kill for some quick text replacement right about now .

A proposal to add lambda
functions to the C++ standard
Valentin Samko

Project : ISO C++
Date : 2006-02-23
Document no : N1958=06-0028
1. Introduction
A number of languages provide a way of passing code as arguments without having to define a separate named function [ 5 ] .
For example , Algol 68 has downward funargs , Lisp has closures , in Smalltalk this is called “ code blocks ” which can be returned , passed as a parameter and executed later .
Similar functionality is present in C# 2.0 ( closures ) and Java ( anonymous classes ) .
This concept is also not foreign to C++ as it extends the existing mechanisms and there are well known attempts ( Boost .
Lambda [ 9 ] , Boost .
Bind [ 8 ] ) to introduce this functionality in C++ as a library solution .
Closures typically appear in languages that allow functions to be first - class values , in other words , such languages allow functions to be passed as arguments , returned from function calls , bound to variable names , etc. , just like simpler types such as strings and integers .
Wikipedia
C++ has a concept of function objects which are the first class values , can be passed as arguments and returned , bound to variable names .
Also , the well known Boost .
Bind [ 8 ] library which was approved for TR1 was designed to bind parameters to function objects , creating new function objects .
With the recent addition of normalised function pointers ( tr1:: function ) this makes closures a missing logical extension of the C++ language , and in fact lambda functions ES017 , ES062 [ 6 ] are in the list of active proposals of the C++ evolution group .
Many algorithms in the C++ Standard Library require the user to pass a predicate or any other functional object , and yet there is usually no simple way to construct such a predicate in place .
Instead one is required to leave the current scope and declare a class outside of the function , breaking an important rule of declaring names as close as possible to the first use .
This shows that lambda functions would add a great to the expressive power and ease of use of the C++ Standard Library .
We will refer to function objects which represent closures as lambda function objects , or lambda functions .
1.1 . Motivation
· C++ Standard Library algorithms would be much more pleasant to use if C++ had support for lambdas .
Lambda functions would let people use C++ Standard Library algorithms in many cases where currently it is easier to write a for loop .
Many developers do not use function objects simply because of the syntactic overhead .
· A small set of trivial lambda functions can also be created with tr1:: bind , but this proposal introduces a much better syntax which one can easily use ( tr1 : : bind syntax is too complicated in many cases ) .
For example , having
struct A { int foo( int y = 1 , bool b = false ) ; } ; A a ;
compare
tr1 : : function < int ( int , int ) > f = boost : : bind ( &A : : foo , &a , tr1 : : bind ( &A : : foo , &a , 1 , false ) , tr1 : : bind ( &A : : foo , &a , _1 , false ) < tr1:: bind ( &A : : foo , &a , _ 2 , false ) ) ;
with
tr1 : : function < int ( int , int ) > f = int ( int x , int y ) { return a.foo( a.foo ( ) , a.foo( x ) < a.foo(y ) ) ; } ;
· There is also a general understanding that closures are one of the most important missing C++ features , and there were many well known attempts to solve this problem on the library level ( Boost .
Bind [ 8 ] , Boost .
Lambda [ 9 ] , Standard C++ library binders ) , but they introduce a very complicated and unreadable syntax , also leading to code which is very hard to debug and or analyse crash dumps .
For example , in many environments developers are advised not to use these libraries as it takes significantly more time to analyse production problems one you have non trivial Boost .
Bind or Boost .
Lambda expressions in your call stack .
Although the authors of these libraries did the best one can do in the current C++ , and one can learn numerous highly non trivial programming techniques from these libraries , they introduce a new syntax for existing C++ constructs , making them very hard to read and understand .
Another problem is that when one compiles source code which uses these libraries having inlining disabled , the performance is often severely affected .
This again shows that lambda expressions are one of the most important missing features in C++ which can not be emulated in a reasonable way in a library .
· If one defines a function in a header file and needs to create a predicate for use in that function , that predicate class currently has to be defined outside of that function and so it is visible in every translation that includes that header file , although that predicate is supposed to be internal to that function .
· tr1:: bind like solutions can not be used with many overloaded functions .
For example , tr1 : : bind ( &std ::abs , _1 ) does not compile , and one has to write tr1:: bind ( ( Type ( * ) ( Type ) ) &std::abs , _1 ) where Type is the corresponding type name .
Also , tr1 : : bind ( &std :: set < int >:: find , _1 , _2 ) does not compile for the same reason .
This makes it very hard to use tr1:: bind with the standard containers .
· Another problem with tr1:: bind ( although this can be considered to be an implementation detail , but the most popular implementation Boost .
Bind has this problem ) is that all the parameters are passed to the created function object by reference and thus void foo ( int ) {} boost : : bind ( &foo , _ 1 ) ( 1 ) ; fails to compile , since 1 is not a const object of type int , and you can not pass it as a non const int reference either .
· Most users will not use algorithms which require functional objects as long as one has to write more code to construct such function objects than one would write to “ embed ” that algorithm into their code .
This effectively means that many generic programming patterns will not enter the mainstream until C++ supports a simple and efficient way to construct such function objects inline , just like one can construct other expressions .
For example , having
typedef std::set<int > myset ; typedef std::vector<int > myvec ;
the following four examples implement the same functionality in the function foo using lambda functions proposed in this document , using C++ algorithm with a custom predicate , using C++ algorithm with a predicate composed with tr1::bind , and with the algorithm code embedded in the function .
Note , the last one is less optimal than any reasonable standard library implementation , and an implementation with tr1:: bind is non portable as it assumes that myset : : find does not have any additional parameters with default values .
( 1 ) lambda function ( 3 ) custom code instead of the standard algorithm void foo ( myvec& v , const myset& s , int a ) { // ... v.erase ( std::remove_if(v.begin( ) , v.end( ) , bool ( int x ) { return std : : abs ( x ) < a && s.find(x ) != s.end( ) ; } ) , v.end ( ) ) ; } void foo ( myvec& v , const myset& s , int a ) { // ... myvec::iterator new_end = v.begin( ) ; for ( myvec: : iterator i = v.begin ( ) ; i != v.end ( ) ; ++i ) { if ( ! ( std : : abs ( *i ) < a && s.find (*i ) != s.end ( ) ) ) *( new_end ++ ) = * i ; } v.erase ( new_end , v.end ( ) ) ; } ( 2 ) custom predicate ( 4 ) tr1:: bind struct MyPredicate { MyPredicate ( const myset& s , int a ) : s_(s ) , a_ ( a ) {} bool operator ( ) ( int x ) const { return std : : abs ( x ) < a_ && s_.find(x ) != s_.end( ) ; } private : const myset& s_ ; int a_ ; } ; void foo ( myvec& v , const myset& s , int a ) { // ... v.erase ( std::remove_if(v.begin( ) , v.end( ) , MyPredicate(s , a ) ) , v.end ( ) ) ; } void foo ( myvec& v , const myset& s , int a ) { // ... v.erase ( std::remove_if( v.begin( ) , v.end ( ) , tr1::bind ( std::logical_and<bool >( ) , ( tr1 : : bind ( ( int ( *) ( int ) ) &std::abs , _1 ) < a ) , ( tr1:: bind ( ( myset::const_iterator ( myset : : * ) ( const int& ) const ) &myset : : find , &s , _ 1 ) != s.end( ) ) ) ) , v.end( ) ) ; }
In addition to much more readable code ( which example do you prefer to read to understand what foo does ? ) , this example shows that with the current C++ standard the only sensible options are ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , and many developers pick ( 3 ) because it is shorter , and one does not need to define a separate structure which is visible to everyone else .
Still , option ( 2 ) is generally faster than ( 3 ) as mentioned above .
We note that if lambda functions are supported natively by the language , option ( 1 ) would be the most simple and brief as seen from this example .
The size of the predicate functional object is also likely to be smaller with lambda functions as compiler may optimise away the extra reference and only store one pointer to the relevant stack frame in the predicate class .
· With lambda functionality described in this proposal we do not need a set of existing proposals , such as enhanced bindings [ 7 ] , mem_fn adaptor [ 10 ] , callable pointers to members [ 11 ] .
· C++ algorithms are usually more optimal than a user implementation of the same functionality embedded into other functions , as the standard implementation of these algorithms may contain non trivial optimisations and be tailored for specific C++ standard library data structures .
Because of the absence of a simple way to construct necessary predicates inline , many users miss these optimisations .
· One can not use tr1:: bind in a portable manner with functions in the std namespace and member functions of standard C++ library containers as the implementation is allowed to add extra parameters with default arguments to these functions .
There would be no such problem if C++ had a native support for lambda functions .
The same problem exists with any 3rd party library when vendor adds a new argument with a default value to a function which is used in tr1: : bind expressions by a client .
· Recently Scott Meyers raised a question at comp.lang.c++. moderated ( see the thread “ Manual Loops vs STL Algorithms in the Real World ” ) asking whether it 's really reasonable to expect C++ programmers to use STL algorithms instead of writing their own loops .
It was stated that the real life code is usually less trivial than the common examples of using standard library binders , and function objects overcomplicate the code .
This problem would be solved by lambda functions proposed in this document as lambda functions introduce a very short and convenient notation to define function objects inline and pass them to any algorithms .
· A short but a very important note in favour of native support for lambda functions is that with lambda functions the overall quality of C++ code would improve with the new code containing less bugs which very often occur when programmers “ embed ” algorithms into their code .
I.e. lambda functions would give a much needed boost to the reuse of generic algorithms .
1.2 . Required functionality
· Lambda functions must be the first class C++ citizens , i.e. objects .
These objects must have class types , and these classes must have the " result_type , arg1_type , ... " typedefs and the corresponding operator ( ) .
· Lambda objects must be copyable .
When a lambda object is copied , all the objects and references bound to that lambda object must be copied .
· A lambda must have the same access to the names and entities outside of the lambda definition as the scope enclosing that lambda definition .
There is already a similar case for local classes ( 9.8/1 ) where declarations in a local class can use type names , enum values , extern variables and static and global variables from the enclosing scope .
· Lambdas must be significantly easier to read , write and debug than any possible library solutions .
· Lambdas must be compatible with the proposed tr1::bind and tr1:: function libraries , i.e. one should be able to create tr1:: function objects from lambda objects and bind parameters to lambda objects with tr1:: bind .
1.3 . Definitions
Lambda object – A function object of an implementation dependent class type with operator ( ) and result_type , etc. typedefs which can be created by a primary expression .
Declaration of a lambda object – A primary expression which creates a temporary lambda function object .
Definition of a lambda object – A declaration of a primary object is also a definition .
Lambda body – A code block which can be executed , given a set of parameters and context .
Local lambda – Lambda definition in a function , or in a lambda body .
Lambda –
An expression which contains code and refers to certain variables , which is not evaluated immediately , and can be passed to functions which will evaluate it when needed , or stored to be evaluated in the future .
Lambda bound values initialiser – Declaration and definition of variables which are contained in a lambda object , copy constructed when the lambda object is constructed or copy constructed .
They can be used to bind any values to the lambda function by value .
1.4 . Lambda objects and normalised function pointer type
1 . We define normalised function pointers as normalised types for any expressions which can be called with a function call syntax .
A main requirement for such normalised function pointers is that all the normalised function pointers which return objects of the same type and accept parameters of the same type do have the same type and can be copied and assigned and it does not matter whether they refer to plain function pointers , or to complicated function objects .
tr1::function is an example of a library solution for such normalised function pointers .
Some languages support normalised function pointers directly .
2. Lambda functions are not required to be normalised function pointers .
Lambda objects created by different code are not required to be assignable or to have the same layout , even if they return values of the same type and their arguments have same types .
One can always normalise any lambda object using the library solutions like tr1:: function .
Even if normalised function pointers are added to the C++ standard , they will not affect lambda functions in any way since lambda functions are orthogonal to normalised function pointers ( in the same way as the result of a tr1: : bind expression is orthogonal to tr1::function ) .
3 . The fact that lambda objects are function objects and not function pointers is consistent with existing C++ practices as we already have a notion of function objects , which are objects classes with operator ( ) .
Also , normalised function pointers would have the same limitation that any other function pointers have , for example function calls through such pointers can rarely be inlined .
4 . Unlike function pointers , lambda objects are not comparable with 0 and do not have operator !
as they are always valid , one can not have an uninitialised lambda object .
1.5 . Proposed syntax
ret_type( type1 value1 , type2 value2 , ... ) { statements }
All the names and entities visible and accessible in the scope where lambda is declared must be also visible and accessible in the body of the lambda object .
For example
void f( int x ) { std::vector<int > v ; // ... std::remove_if(v.begin( ) , v.end( ) , void ( int& n ) { n < x ; } ) ; }
Optionally , one can bind values to lambda objects which will have the same life time as the lambda object by using the lambda bound values initialiser , such as ( typea boundvalue1 ( x ) , typeb boundvalue2 (y ) , ... ) .
This initialiser can be used to pass variables to the lambda by value , as by default nothing is passed to the lambda , all the variables in the enclosing scope are automatically visible in the lambda function body and it is undefined behaviour if lambda refers to variables whose storage has been released .
The complete lambda definition with bound values initialiser is
ret_type ( type1 value1 , type2 value2 , ... ) : ( typea boundvalue1 ( x ) , typeb boundvalue2 (y ) , ... ) { statements }
For example
void set_callback ( tr1::function < bool ( int ) > ) ; void foo( int t ) { set_callback ( bool ( int i ) : ( int number ( t ) ) { std::cout <<( i + number ) ; } ) ; }
A lambda definition is a primary expression and so it can be used anywhere where any other primary expression can be used .
For example ,
int x = 0 ; struct A { tr1::function < void( ) > f ; A ( ) : f( void ( ) { ++x ; } ) {} void foo ( tr1:: function < bool ( ) > p = bool ( ) {return x < 0 ;} ) { p( ) ; } static tr1::function < int ( bool ) > f2 ; void bar ( ) { throw void ( ) { -- x ; } ; } // can only be caught in (... ) } ; tr1::function < int ( bool ) >
A::f2 = int ( bool b ) { return b ?
1 : 2 ; } ;
2. Specification
2.1. Lambda definition
A lambda definition defines an implementation dependant lambda class with external linkage and a temporary object of that class ( 12.2 ) .
Lambda definitions are primary expressions and have the following grammar
lambda - definition :
type-specifier lambda - declarator lambda - bound - values - declarator opt { lambda - body }
lambda - declarator :
( parameter - declaration - clause )
lambda - bound - values - declarator :
: ( lambda - bound - values - list )
lambda - body :
compound - statement
lambda - bound - values - list :
lambda - bound - value
lambda - bound - values - list , lambda - bound - value
lambda - bound - value :
decl - specifier - seq declarator ( assignment - expression )
decl - specifier - seq abstract - declarator ( assignment - expression )
where parameters in the parameter - declaration - clause are not visible in assignment - expression elements in the lambda - bound - values - declarator .
2.2 . Lambda classes
1. Lambda objects have class types , and expressions
· ret_type ( type1 param1 , type2 param2 , ... ) { statements }
· ret_type ( type1 param1 , type2 param2 , ... ) : ( type3 boundvalue 1 ( v1 ) , type4 boundvalue2 ( v2 ) , ... ) { statements }
create temporary lambda objects of classes with implementation dependent names , where each such expression can possibly result in a different class .
The fact that the type of lambda classes is unspecified is consistent with the proposal for an enhanced binder [ 7 ] which was approved for TR1 , where the type of the returned function objects is also unspecified .
2 . If a lambda is defined within a function template , or a member function of a class template , it is essential that every unique instantiation of the template yields a unique type for the lambda class , just as every unique instantiation of the template yields a unique address for the function in which the local class is defined .
If a local class is defined within a function which is itself a template , or is a member of a template , then instantiations of the template with the same set of template parameters must yield the same instance of the local class , even if the instantiations are performed in different translation units .
3. Lambda classes may have any implementation dependent names , and classes representing different lambda objects are allowed to have different names even if they return values of the same type and have the same set of parameters .
Implementation must guarantee that lambda class names do not clash with any user defined names and the observable behaviour does not depend on names of lambda classes .
4. Lambda classes must have the public " result_type , arg1_type , ... " typedefs and public operator ( ) const without exception specification .
When operator ( ) is called , it must invoke the lambda body .
Also , no “ this ” pointer is declared in the lambda body , but if another “ this ” is visible in the scope where the lambda is declared , that “ this ” is visible in the lambda body , the same stands for the operator ( ) , i.e. the lambda body can not recursively call itself directly .
5 . The implementation is required to define a public copy constructor , and not to define operator =.
6 . The implementation is required to define a public default constructor if and only if the body of the corresponding lambda definition does not refer to anything except global , static and extern variables and enums and does not contain any bound values .
7. sizeof ( lambda_type ) is implementation dependent and is allowed to be different for lambda classes defined by different lambda definitions .
8. Implementation is allowed to add any member variables to the lambda class .
9 . Declarations in the lambda body can use any type names , variables , functions and enumerators from the enclosing scope .
10 .
Types of all the lambda parameters and bound values must have external linkage .
2.3 . Lambda behaviour
We follow the approach used to introduce unnamed namespaces ( 7.3.1.1 ) and define lambda behaviour in terms of the behaviour of existing language constructs in the current standard .
Lambda definition behaves as if
1. Lambda definition is replaced by a simple type specifier of a class followed by a parenthesized expression list ( 5.2.3 ) where that class has a globally unique name is defined prior to the declaration of the function the lambda definition is defined in .
2 . All the enclosing scope variables visible at the point of lambda definition which names are used in the lambda body are passed to the constructor of that class , as well as all the bound values .
3. Constructor of that class accepts the local scope variables by reference , and bound values by types specified in the lambda bound values initialiser .
4 . That class has members variables with types and names specified in the lambda bound values initialiser , and they all are initialised in the member initialiser of the class constructor .
5 . For every local scope variable accessed from the lambda body , that class has a member variable which has the type of a reference to the original variable , or of a reference to the type that variable refers to if that variable is a reference itself .
All these references are initialised in the initializer list of the class constructor .
For example , having
std :: string s = “ test ” ;
the observable behaviour of
tr1 :: function < int ( std :: string , bool ) > f = int ( std : : string x , bool b ) { std::cout << s << x ; } ;
the same as of
class unique_class_name { public : typedef result_type int ; typedef arg1 _type std:: string ; typedef arg2_type bool ; unique_class_name ( std : : string& s_ ) : s( s_ ) {} int operator ( ) ( std : : string x , bool b ) const { std:: cout << s << x ; } private : std:: string& s ; } ; tr1 : : function < int ( std :: string , bool ) > f = unique_class_name(s ) ;
and having
bool b = false ; std :: string t = “ test ” ;
the observable behaviour of
tr1 :: function < double ( int , const std::string& ) > f = double ( int i , const std :: string& s ) : ( bool f( b ) , std :: string p( “test ” ) ) { std::cout << s << p << f << i << t ; }
is the same as of
class unique_class_name { public : unique_class_name ( std:: string t_ ) : t( t_ ) , f( b ) , p( “ test ” ) {} typedef result_type int ; typedef arg1 _type std:: string ; typedef arg2 _type bool ; double operator ( ) ( int i , const std : : string& s ) const { std::cout << s << p << f << i << t ; } private : bool f ; std :: string p ; std :: string& t ; } ; tr1: : function < double ( int , const std::string& ) > f = unique_class_name( b , t ) ;
2.4 . Linkage
1. Lambda classes should have the linkage of the enclosing function ( or of the class if the lambda is defined in a class constructor or destructor , or in the member initialiser in the constructor ) , or of the variable being initialised if lambda class is defined in a simple - declaration in the namespace scope .
2 . If a lambda is defined in a function , all the names defined in that function are visible in the that class with the globally unique name .
2.5 . Access to names and entities from inside the lambda body
1 . The lambda body and the lambda bound values initialiser must have the same access to the names outside of the lambda definition as the scope enclosing that lambda definition .
2 . All the entities visible in the lambda body may actually be references to the original variables , but this must not be observable in the lambda body .
3 . It is legal for lambda objects to refer to local references even if lambda objects outlive these references but not the referenced objects .
4 . Name visibility in a lambda should be the same as if one had a function object class ( in a unique namespace ) with external linkage , which had members with the same names and types ( references ) as all the variables defined in the local scope and accessible from the point where lambda was declared , including function parameters .
Whether types of these " member variables " are references or not is implementation dependent .
5 . It is undefined behaviour if there is a valid lambda object which body refers to a name of an object which storage is released .
2.6 . Where lambda expressions can be used
Anywhere where a primary expressions may be used .
For example ,
1 . In function bodies ( function - body ) of functions
2 . In an assignment - expression of function or operator parameter - declaration - clause
3 . In variable declarations ( simple - declaration ) in global and namespace scopes .
( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are implementable for functions with external linkage .
In case of functions with internal linkage , this may be done , as this is implemented in VC ++ compilers ( v7 , v8 ) .
In case of ( 3 ) , if the variable being declared has internal linkage or is in an unnamed namespace , the implementation must create a different lambda - object in every translation unit .
For example ,
int x ; namespace { int y ; } tr1::function < void( ) > f = void ( ) { x += y ; } ;
is equivalent to
namespace { lambda_class_name lambda_object ; } tr1::function < void( ) > f = lambda_object ;
This would also work with proposal for type deduction N1894 [ 1 ] .
For example one could write
int x ; namespace { int y ; } auto f = void ( ) { x += y } ;
This approach would also result in correct code if a lambda object is used to initialise a variable in an unnamed namespace .
For example
int x ; namespace { int y ; } namespace { tr1::function < void ( ) > f = void ( ) { x += y ; } ; }
2.7 . Impact on existing code
This proposal is only an extension and there is no impact on existing code .
2.8 . Examples
template < class T> void inherit( T t ) { struct X : public T { X ( ) {} // ill - formed , classes generated by lambda definitions which refer to local variables do not have default constructors void foo ( ) { -- k ; // ill - formed , 'k ' is is not declared here , it is only declared in the lambda function body } } ; t( ) ; // valid T t2(t ) ; // valid } void foo( ) { int k = 0 ; inherit ( void ( ) { ++k ; } ) ; }
class B : public tr1::enable_shared_from_this<B> { int n ; B ( ) {} B ( const B& b ) : n( b.n ) {} public : static tr1::shared_ptr<B> create ( ) { return tr1:: shared_ptr<B>( new B( ) ) ; } tr1::function < void( int& ) > callback ( ) const { return void ( int& x ) : ( tr1::shared_ptr<const B> me(shared_from_this ( ) ) ) { x += n ; } ; } // Note , this is not a misprint , x+=n is correct as well as x+=me ->n as this lambda object already contains a shared pointer to this object , so it is not destroyed until the last copy of this lambda object is destroyed .
//
This callback can still be used even if user does not have any direct shared pointers to this object , as this lambda object will get a copy of a shared pointer to this object .
};
namespace { int x = 0 ; tr1::function < void( ) > f = void ( ) { ++x ; } ; tr1:: function <tr1::function<void( ) >( ) > f2 = tr1::function<void( ) >( ) { return void ( ) { ++x ; } ; } ; typedef tr1:: function < int ( int ) > integer_transform ; typedef tr1::function<integer_transform(integer_transform ) > function_operator ; function_operator fop = integer_transform ( integer_transform t) { return int ( int x ) : ( integer_transform original_t (t ) ) { return original_t( x ) % 100 ; } ; } ; // this creates a function object transformer fop which can be used to transform any function object which converts integer to another integer into another similar function object , which executes the original function object and returns the remainder after division of the result by 100 .
integer_transform t1 = int ( int x ) { return x*x ; } ; integer_transform t2 = fop ( t1 ) ; } void foo ( ) { f ( ) ; f2 ( ) ( ) ; t2( 10 ) ; // equivalent to fop ( t1 ) ( 10 ) fop ( t1 ) ( 10 ) ; }
The following would be possible if the proposal [ 12 ] is accepted .
std :: set < int , decltype ( bool ( int x , int y ) { return std ::abs ( x ) < std::abs(y ) ; } ) > s ; struct A { std :: string name ; } ; std::set < A , decltype ( bool ( const A& x , const A& y ) { return x.name < y.name ; } ) > sa ;
3. Protection against accidental misuse
1. Lambda object may outlive local variables used by that lambda object and once these variables are destroyed and their storage is released , even an existence of a lambda function which refers to them results in undefined behaviour .
2 . It a general case , is not possible for a compiler to determine at compile time that lambda will not outlive any variables it refers to .
3 . It is undefined behaviour if there is a lambda object which body refers to a name of an object which storage is released , see 2.5/6 in this document .
For example ,
tr1::function < void( ) > foo( ) { int c = 0 ; return void ( ) { ++ c ; } ; }
and
bool b = true ; tr1::function < void( ) > foo( ) { int x=0 ; return void ( ) { if ( b ) ++x ; } ; } void bar ( ) { b = false ; foo ( ) ( ) ; }
results in undefined behaviour .
4 . A case when a lambda object still exists which refers to local variables after they are destroyed is similar to existing C++ practices , for example
struct A { A ( int& i ) : i_ ( i ) {} int& i_ ; } ; A f( ) { int j=0 ; A a(j ) ; // ... return a ; }
will lead to similar undefined behaviour and no compiler diagnostic is required .
This shows that our case is consistent with the existing C++ practices .
3.1 . Run time error detection
Most of such problems may be detected at run time by the implementation ( many compilers already have options to add buffer overrun and other run time error detection ) .
For example , if a lambda is defined in a function and its body refers to an object defined with automatic storage in that function , then implementation may store a counter of all the lambda objects of that type created by that function call or by copy construction , and if that counter is non zero when storage for local variables in that function is released , then the error may be reported at run time .
So , for
void foo( ) { int a = 0 ; bar ( void ( ) { ++a ; } ) ; }
The implementation will produce the equivalent of
struct lambda_class { lambda_class ( size_t& counter , int& a ) : counter_( counter ) , a_( a ) {} lambda_class ( const lambda_class& x ) : counter_( x.counter_ ) , a_( x.a_ ) { ++ counter_ ; } ~ lambda_class ( ) { -- counter_ ; } int& a_ ; size_t& counter_ ; } ; tr1::function < void ( ) > foo ( ) { int a = 0 ; struct guard { guard ( ) : counter ( 0 ) {} size_t counter ; ~ guard ( ) { if ( counter ) report_error ( ) ; } } g ; bar( lambda_class ( g.counter , a ) ) ; }
which would call implementation internal function report_error ( ) if function bar stores a copy of the passed lambda object .
This run time error detection is possible for variables with automatic storage defined in the function ( or another lambda body ) where a lambda was defined .
Similar run time checks for member variables ( when lambda is defined in a member function ) or for dynamically allocated objects are much harder to implement and will result in significant performance and memory usage overhead .
For example ,
struct A { int member_int ; tr1::function < void( ) > foo( ) { return void ( ) { ++member_int ; } ; } } ; tr1::function < void( ) > bar ( ) { A a ; return a.foo ( ) ; }
will result in undefined behaviour but the error will not be reported at run time .
We also note that when creating function objects with tr1:: bind for member functions , there are no run time checks whether the object which member function is being called was not destroyed yet .
There is no need for the standard to require implementations to detect these errors at run time , as such run time error detection can be optionally provided by an implementation and would be conforming with the standard ( as the error is only detected when an undefined behaviour would occur otherwise ) .
This would be consistent with the spirit of C++ , as similar run time checks are not required when the program uses a reference to an object which storage was released .
For example ,
struct X { X ( const int& x ) : v( x ) {} const int& v ; } ; X foo( int t = 1 ) { return X ( t ) ; } int y = foo ( ) .
v ;
results in undefined behaviour , but no run time error detection is required and it is up to the implementation to detect such errors at run time .
3.2 . Garbage collection
Another approach to avoid problem with lambda objects accessing variables which no longer exist requires garbage collection for all the variables ( even primitives on the stack ) , and this is not achievable in C ++.
Any workarounds would only cover a few useful cases ( i.e. never 100 % coverage ) and it would be against the spirit of C ++.
Also , such workarounds may introduce performance loss and possible memory allocation errors in the most simple cases ( for example , allocation of local variables on the heap if they are used in a closure , as this is done by C# ) .
Also we need to note that even if GC is introduced in C++ , this still will not solve the general problem with local primitives on the stack .
For example there is a similar problem in Java , where closures can not refer to non final local variables .
Therefore , the problems associated with lambda functions in the absence of GC should not stop the introduction of the lambda functions in C++ , as is it very unlikely that such a GC ( even for local variables on the heap ) will be introduced in C++ in a foreseeable future .
3.3 . Copying local scope variables to lambda by default
If objects with automatic storage defined in functions are copied to the lambda object by default ( and not referenced as this is described in this proposal ) the problem with lambda objects outliving the function scope would be less of an issue .
Unfortunately , this approach has other very significant problems .
1. Copying would invalidate iterators if both , container and iterator to that container are copied .
2. Copying will result in slicing .
3 . Copying will lead to unexpected results with pointers and references , as pointers copied from the local scope will still point to the original objects and not to the copied ones .
4. Copying objects of non trivial types will result in performance problems .
5 . Copying will make access to the function scope variables inconsistent with access to the namespace scope variables , as the second will not be copied .
4. Required changes to the standard
1. 1.8/1
An object is created by a definition ( 3.1 ) , by a new - expression ( 5.3.4 ) [ Add by a lambda definition ( 8.6 ) ] or by the implementation ( 12.2 ) when needed .
2. [ Add : 3.3.2/5 – Names declared in lambda definitions are local to these lambda definitions . ]
3. [ Add :
3.3.4/8 – Lambda scope [ basic.scope.lambda ]
1 . The potential scope of a name declared in a lambda definition consists of the declarative region following the name 's point of declaration and of the lambda function body .
2 . A name declared in the lambda definition hides a declaration of the same name in the enclosing scope , which scope extends to the lambda function body . ]
4. 3.9.2 Compound types
-- classes containing a sequence of objects of various types ( clause 9 ) , a set of types , enumerations and functions for manipulating these objects ( 9.3 ) , and a set of restrictions on the access to these entities ( clause 11 ) [ Add or defined by a lambda definition ] .
5. 5.1/3 The keyword this shall be used only inside a non-static class member function body ( 9.3 ) [ Remove : or ] in a constructor mem-initializer ( 12.6.2 )
[ Add or in lambda definition defined in a non static class member function body .
When the keyword this is used in a lambda definition , it refers to the pointer to the enclosing function 's class . ]
6. 7/1 Declarations [ dcl.dcl ]
declaration :
[ Add lambda - function - definition ]
7. 7/2
A declaration that declares a function or defines a class , namespace , template , [ Add lambda function ] or function also has one or more scopes nested within it .
8. [ Add
8.6 “ Lambda definition ”
Lambda definition defines an implementation dependant lambda class with external linkage and a temporary object of that class ( 12.2 ) .
Lambda definitions are primary expressions and have the following grammar
lambda - definition :
type-specifier lambda - declarator lambda - bound - values - declarator opt {lambda - body}
lambda - declarator :
( parameter - declaration - clause )
lambda - bound - values - declarator :
: ( lambda - bound - values - list )
lambda - body :
compound - statement
lambda - bound - values - list :
lambda - bound - value
lambda - bound - values - list , lambda - bound - value
lambda - bound - value :
decl - specifier - seq declarator ( assignment - expression )
decl - specifier - seq abstract - declarator ( assignment - expression )
1 . As lambda - function - definition defines a class and a variable , it can be defined in any scope where a temporary is acceptable .
2. Lambda objects must be copyable .
When a lambda object is copied , all the objects and references bound to this lambda objects must be copied .
3. Lambda objects are temporary objects , created lambda definitions .
4 . As lambda objects are temporary objects , they are destroyed as the last step in evaluating the full - expression ( 1.9 ) that ( lexically ) contains the point where they were created .
[ The contents of sections 2.2 – 2.5 of this proposal should be inserted here ] ]
9 . [ Add 9/6 – Classes can also be defined by lambda function definitions ( 8.6 ) ]
10 . 12.1 Constructors [ class.ctor ]
...
An implicitly - declared default constructor for a class is implicitly defined when it is used to create an object of its class type ( 1.8 ) .
[ Add : If it is used to create an object of a class generated by a lambda definition which refers to anything but static , global and external variables and enum values or has bound variables , the program is ill - formed . ]
11 . 12.2/1 Temporary objects [ class.temporary ]
Temporaries of class type are created in various contexts : binding an rvalue to a reference ( 8.5.3 ) , returning an rvalue ( 6.6.3 ) , a conversion that creates an rvalue ( 4.1 , 5.2.9 , 5.2.11 , 5.4 ) , throwing an exception ( 15.1 ) , entering a handler ( 15.3 ) , [ Add lambda definition ( 8.6 ) ] and in some initializations ( 8.5 ) . ”
12 . A.4
primary - expression :
literal
this
( expression )
id-expression
[ Add : lambda - expression ]
[ Add
lambda - expression
lambda - function - definition ]
13 . A.6
declaration :
[ Add lambda - definition ]
5. Implementation notes
1. Local functions which have access to the local variables are quite similar to the lambda functions and are supported by the GNU C compiler .
It implements taking the address of a nested function using a technique called trampolines .
The downside of this approach is that it requires executable stack .
The upside is that there is implementation experience of a technique similar to what we are proposing .
2 . Once we have local classes with external linkage [ 2 ] , lambdas are much easier to implement .
3 . Many implementation details including generation of the unique external names and to the linkage , relevant to this proposal and explaining how such a functionality may be implemented are explained in detail in [ 2 ] .
4. Lambda functions may lead to a more optimal code than with wrapper - helper classes defined by user .
For example , consider
struct helper_functor { helper_functor ( int& a , std : : string& b , int& c , double& d ) : local_a ( a ) , local_b ( b ) , local_c ( c ) , local_d (d ) int& local_a ; std :: string& local_b ; int& local_c ; double& local_d ; bool operator ( ) ( const MyClass& v ) const { return v.foo( local_a , local_b ) ?
v.bar( local_c , local_d ) : true } } ; void foofoo ( int a , std:: string b) { std::vector<MyClass> v = get_data( ) ; int c = barbar ( ) ; double d = 3.14 ; std::remove_if(v.begin( ) , v.end( ) , helper_functor( a , b , c , d ) ) ; }
Here sizeof ( helper_functor ) is at least the size of 4 references , and this object will be copied by the for_each algorithm , possibly many times .
Now , consider the equivalent with C++ lambdas
void foofoo ( int a , std:: string b) { std::vector<MyClass> v = get_data( ) ; int c = barbar ( ) ; double d = 3.14 ; std::remove_if( v.begin( ) , v.end ( ) , bool ( const MyClass& v ) { return v.foo( a , b ) ? v.bar( c , d ) : true ; } ) ; }
In addition to having simpler and easier to understand source code , this version may be more optimal as implementation is not required to store in the lambda object references to all the variables accessed in the lambda definition body .
For example , implementation may only store one pointer to the stack frame , thus reducing the size of the lambda object , and that will result in a more optimal code .
Annex A – Notes
1 . Although this proposal does not provide any means to pass lambda function objects to functions which require a function pointer parameter , this functionality can be added in the future for lambdas which do not refer to any local variables and do not have any bound variables by adding a conversion to function pointer operator to the corresponding lambda class .
2 . The lambda definition syntax in this proposal does not support lambda classes with template operator ( ) .
As this functionality can be added later and it will not conflict with anything in this proposal ( apart from argX_type typedefs ) this is left out of this proposal for now .
3 . If the proposal for decltype and auto keywords [ 12 ] is accepted then return_type and argX_type typedefs will not be required as one will always be able to deduce the return type and argument types from the operator ( ) .
This will also simplify introduction of lambdas with template parameters , as such lambda classes can not have argX_type typedefs for template parameters .

Technology keeps workers connected 24/ 7 .
If that sounds like an employer ’s dream come true , think again : according to a Rutgers University - Camden researcher , employers who encourage non -stop work connections via technology may wind up with liability for encouraging addiction among their staff .
According to Gayle Porter , an associate professor of management at the Rutgers University School of Business at Camden , the fast and relentless pace of technology - enhanced work environments creates a source of stimulation that may become addictive .
While addiction to work has been a widespread phenomenon for some time , the Rutgers - Camden scholar suggests that employers may face legal liability for these addictions .
“ There are costs attached to excessive work due to technology , ” says Porter .
“ Information and communication technology ( ICT ) addiction has been treated by policy makers as a kind of elephant in the room -- everyone sees it , but no one wants to acknowledge it directly .
Owing to vested interests of the employers and the ICT industry , signs of possible addiction -- excess use of ICT and related stress illnesses -- are often ignored . ”
The results can be devastating for both the individual worker and the entire employing organization .
“ Employers rightfully provide programs to help workers with chemical or substance addictions , ” notes Porter .
“ Addiction to technology can be equally damaging to the mental health of the worker . ”
In a forthcoming study , co-authored by David Vance , an assistant professor of accounting at Rutgers - Camden , and Nada Kakabadse , a professor of management and business research at the University of Northampton in the United Kingdom , Porter offers some crucial perspective for employers and workers alike .
Courts have long recognized the special duty of employers to protect their employees .
That ’s why employers will warn workers of dangers that they might not foresee , and enforce rules for employee conduct that promote a safe workplace .
Porter suggests that the law may evolve to incorporate ICT into that mix .
“ It may be unfeasible to regulate how much people use technology , ” says Porter .
“ However , it is reasonable to imagine a time when policy - makers recognize the powerful influence of employers that sometimes results in harmful excess among the workforce .
The pressure for using technology to stay connected 24/7 may carry employer responsibility for detrimental outcomes to the employees . ”
The Rutgers - Camden researcher cites tobacco litigation in the United States as a model of how the law and legal strategies evolve over time to find harm .
“ Legal scholars describe tobacco litigation occurring in three waves , each of which moved plaintiffs closer to success , ” says Porter .
“ In the 1950s , the theories put forth laid the groundwork for the legal decisions in the 1990s onward . ”
The element of employer manipulation is important to determining liability .
“ If people work longer hours for personal enrichment , they assume the risk , ” says Porter .
“ However , if an employer manipulates an individual ’s propensity toward workaholism or technology addiction for the employer ’s benefit , the legal perspective shifts .
When professional advancement ( or even survival ) seems to depend on 24/7 connectivity , it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between choice and manipulation . ”
While Porter is not aware of any current court cases examining the subject , she submits that employers concerned for the health of their workers and their bottom lines may wish to keep an eye on the matter … and encourage employees to walk away from their Blackberries , email , and cell phones while on vacation .
A resident of Haddonfield , Porter regularly teaches undergraduate and MBA courses in Organization Change and Development , Leadership in Organizations , Social Responsibility of Management , and Organizational Behavior .
She received her doctoral degree in organizational behavior from The Ohio State University in 1992 , and her bachelor ’s ( 1979 ) and master ’s ( 1982 ) degrees from Wichita State University .

On the 9th of January Apple announced the the long - waited iPhone .
Packing up to 8 GB of memory , a 3,5 inch touch screen with a virtual keyboard , Wi-Fi capabilities and running Apple ’s OS X software the device was acclaimed both by the Macworld fanatics and by the general public .
Apple ’s stock price , in fact , soared right after the unveiling , going up by 7 % .
Considering all the buzz that the iPhone generated we can assume that it will disrupt the mobile phone industry and make Apple hit the jackpot again , ca n ’t we ?
Well , I would not be so secure about that .
While I admire Steve Jobs ’ initiative to invade a challenging business such as the mobile phone one , I think that Apple ’s strategy has some flaws , and below I will outline each of them :
1 . The mobile phone market is not the digital music one : Apple did something unbelievable with the iPod , redefining a whole industry ( the digital music one ) and placing its MP3 players in hands of more than 70 million people .
No wonder they are so confident about exporting the iPod success into new segments .
When Apple entered the digital music segment in 2001 , however , there were no dominant players and the segment was relatively immature .
Most of the people purchasing an iPod had no prior experience with MP3 players , meaning that Apple only had to convince them about buying the product ( and not about ditching an existing one ) .
The mobile phone industry represents quite a different situation , where virtually every single person already has a phone , sometimes with complex subscriber plans on the background .
2. Competition will be fierce : do you remember Diamond Multimedia or Sensory Science ?
Probably not , but those were the companies producing the first MP3 players , and they were also the competition Apple faced when it decided to enter the digital music industry .
The iPhone , on the other hand , will face competition from the likes of Nokia , Motorola and Samsung .
Those players do not only have deep pockets , but they are also among the most innovative and design - oriented companies in the world .
3 . Apple ’s user experience will be affected by Cingular ’s user experience : analyze Apple ’s history and you will see that its success was always derived from the ability to integrate hardware , software and services .
Such integration enabled Apple to create an incredible user experience , like in the Mac - iPod - iTunes combo .
The iPhone , however , will enter the market through Cingular , meaning that the service part of the equation will no longer be under Apple ’s control .
This will reduce Apple ’s flexibility and it will also force customers to interact with Cingular , which is not as hassle - free as using an iPod , you can bet .
4 . The touch screen might not be suitable : are we sure that a 3,5 inch touch screen is suitable for a mobile phone ?
If you consider how the average person uses a mobile phone you will see that the object must be somewhat resistant to shocks and scratches , after all it is constantly being handled , getting inside and outside of pockets and bags and sometimes even falling to the ground .
Apple already had trouble some time ago when customers who bought the iPod Nano started complaining about how easily the screen got scratched .
5 . Lack of a keyboard : whether you like it or not most people use the mobile phone to make calls and to send SMS ( Short Text Message ) .
Sometimes you need to make those calls on the run , while walking or driving , and the last thing you would need is to be forced to look at the mobile phone as you dial .
6 . The $ 500 - $ 600 price tag is conflicting with the demand : the iPhone does have a sleek design , a user - friendly interface and a strong orientation towards the entertainment dimension .
Those characteristics will certainly make the device appealing for young people .
That customer segment , however , is not the segment that spends $ 600 for a mobile phone .
If you take a look at the phones from the four major US wireless carrier operators you will realize that there is no single product selling above $ 500 , and in 2006 the percentage of phones that were sold for more than $ 300 account for less than 5 % of the market .
7. Lack of 3G support : the OS X software coupled with the other features included on the iPhone will enable people to use a myriad of Internet application , bringing mobile connectivity to another level .
Well , at least in theory , because in practice Apple will need to solve some issues related to wireless networks .
The iPhone will work with 2.5G EDGE networks and not with the 3G UMTS and HSDPA as the latest mobile phones .
EDGE networks can carry data up to 340 kbits / s while current UMTS handsets have a bandwidth of 3,6 Mbit/s .
8. Battery life : battery life is an important issue for mobile phones .
Apple stated that the iPhone will have up to 5 hours of talk / video / browsing .
However , there is no disclosed specification for standby time , nor any real - life performance data confirming those numbers .
The large number of features included on the iPhone is making some people wonder whether the battery will have enough autonomy for a day - to - day usage .
9 . Lock - in strategy : the iPhone was developed under a lock - in perspective .
Should you buy music on the iTunes it will come with the FairPlay copy protection ( even the music industry is starting to understand the drawbacks of strict DRM ) .
Secondly , unlike with the Treo or other smartphones , you will not be able to touch the software of the device .
Lastly , the iPhone is also locked to Cingular ’s wireless network , meaning that consumers will not be able to switch to another carrier .
10 .
Apple will need to live up to the expectations :
Apple stated that they want to sell 10 million iPhones in the 2008 fiscal year .
That is not an unrealistic number considered that mobile phone manufacturers are expected to ship almost 1 billion units in 2007 .
Should they fail to reach that goal , however , it will become a huge disappointment .
Just for the sake of comparison , Research in Motion sold 5,5 million Blackberries over the past 12 months , and people call them Crackberries …
Fans of Shaun of the Dead rejoice !
Never seen that movie ?
Well , regardless ..
WATCH THIS ONE !!
This movie is definitely “ off the f** kin chain “ !!
2 hours of almost non -stop laughter and action .
A movie that makes you think it ’s taking itself seriously while constantly barraging you with witty one - liners , movie references , and scenes that will have you clapping or crying tears of joy .
A story of an over - achieving London cop who gets reassigned to a little town with no action .. or so it seems .
It includes everything you ’ve ever seen in any other action film ..
explosions , car chases , guns .. lots of guns .. blood , bullets , and bodies .. and the occasional swan ?
Excellent direction , characters , and retakes on scenes introduced in Shaun of the Dead .
Even after two hours we all sat through the credits just hoping that we could have just a little bit more .. we just did n’t want it to end .
I cannot say enough good things about this movie .. you definitely must watch it , and I ’ll definitely be grabbing a copy as soon as I can .

HAYDEN : The president 's authorization allows us to track this kind of call more comprehensively and more efficiently .
The trigger is quicker and a bit softer than it is for a FISA warrant , but the intrusion into privacy is also limited : only international calls and only those we have a reasonable basis to believe involve al Qaeda or one of its affiliates .
. . .
QUESTION : Just to clarify sort of what 's been said , from what I 've heard you say today and an earlier press conference , the change from going around the FISA law was to -- one of them was to lower the standard from what they call for , which is basically probable cause to a reasonable basis ; and then to take it away from a federal court judge , the FISA court judge , and hand it over to a shift supervisor at NSA .
Is that what we 're talking about here -- just for clarification ?
GEN .
HAYDEN : You got most of it right .
The people who make the judgment , and the one you just referred to , there are only a hand .
GENERAL HAYDEN : One , the whole key here is agility .
And let me re-trace some grounds I tried to suggest earlier .
FISA was built for persistence .
FISA was built for long - term coverage against known agents of an enemy power .
And the purpose involved in each of those -- in those cases was either for a long - term law enforcement purpose or a long - term intelligence purpose .
This program is n't for that .
This is to detect and prevent .
And here the key is not so much persistence as it is agility .
It 's a quicker trigger .
It 's a subtly softer trigger .

Not -very - coincidentally , Gonzales will be testifying tomorrow before Leahy 's Senate Judiciary Committee .

UPDATE V
Is there no principle subject to negotiation ?
Is there no course subject to reversal ?
For the Bush administration to argue for years that this program , as operated , was critical to our national security and fell within the president 's Constitutional authority , to then turnaround and surrender presidential authority this way is disgraceful .
The administration is repudiating all the arguments it has made in testimony , legal briefs , and public statements .
This goes to the heart of the White House 's credibility .
How can it cast away such a fundamental position of principle and law like this ?
The New York Times
UPDATE VI
This change of policy will surely raise a few eyebrows .
One of the arguments the Bush administration made was that it could not reach accommodation with the FISA court on expedited authorizations for wiretaps on international conversations with one point inside the US , on phone numbers already flagged as potentially related to terrorists .
It discouraged Congress from drafting legislation mandating a process for such actions , stating that the authorization for the use of military force ( AUMF ) granted them all of the authorization needed for such surveillance .
. . .
On one hand , having this process remain in our counterterrorism arsenal is great news .
However , for those of us who supported the White House on this contentious point , the speed in which they reached accommodation with FISA will call into question that early support .
By my count , we 've had ten entire weeks since the midterms and they 've managed to scale a mountain that they claimed was insurmountable for the previous five years .
Perhaps more explanations will be forthcoming .
I , for one , will be waiting .
Everything I know about the FISA story is contained in this AP article , which I just read , and in this letter from Attorney General Gonzales to Senators Leahy and Specter .
Writing full analytical posts is not something that my put -upon , book - addled brain is going to permit today , so I will rely upon the comment section to learn the answers to these questions :
(1) Why could n't the new rules simply have been instituted years ago , as part of a newly amended FISA ( which the administration requested and obtained from Congress in 2001 and which Congress repeatedly asked to do multiple times both prior and subsequent to revelation of the President 's lawbreaking ) ?
( 2) If , as Attorney General Gonzales claims , they were seeking to develop new rules as early as the Spring of 2005 to enable eavesdropping under FISA , why did n't they say so when the controversy arose over their lawbreaking ?
(3 ) For those who claimed that our national security was jeopardized and that The Terrorists were given our state secrets whenrevealed that the President was eavesdroppingwarrants , did n't Alberto Gonazles just " give the terrorists our playbook " by telling them how we are eavesdropping , , that we are doing so with warrants ?
( 4a ) Could they possible think that this " concession " ( what we call " obeying the law " ) is going to forestall or preclude Congressional investigations into all of the eavesdropping they have been doing over the last five years without anyone watching ?
( 4 b ) And relatedly , is this magnanimous assent to comply with the law supposed to relieve them of the consequence from their lawbreaking ?
( 4c )
And related further , are they now going to tell the Sixth Circuit that there is no reason to bother with figuring out if Judge Diggs Taylor was correct when she ruled that the President violated both the Constitution and the law by eavesdropping on U.S. citizens without the warrants required by law ?
In January , 2006 , current CIA Director and former NSA director Michael Hayden warned that even discussing eavesdropping issues helps the Terrorists because it reminds them that we eavesdrop : Alberto Gonazles said this repeatedly , too -- that merely by raising the issue of eavesdropping , we remind the Terrorists that we eavesdrop .
As a result , the ones who forgot that we eavesdrop wo n't make the calls that they otherwise would have made to talk about their plots , and we wo n't know what they 're doing and we wo n't be able to catch the Terrorists .
That 's how the administration explained how our national security had been so gravely harmed by thearticle that " told " the Terrorists that we were eavesdropping without warrants .
Yet here the administration is -- not just reminding the Terrorists that we eavesdrop but detailing their new eavesdropping procedures in public . :
There is one crucial point ( at least ) that reveals the core falsity behind the administration 's claims today .
Contrary to their central point , their complaints about FISA were most assuredlyconfined merely to procedural obstacles -- i.e. , that the process of obtaining warrants was too slow and cumbersome .
They complained as much if not more about theunder FISA for obtaining a warrant - i.e , they claimed that the requirement to show " probable cause , " rather than mere " reasonable basis " ( the standard under their illegal program ) , meant that they could not do the eavesdropping they needed to do in order to stop The Terrorists .
Here is an exchange from Hayden 's Press Briefing : Identically , a month earlier , when the scandal first broke , Hayden -- in response to a question asking him to explain why FISA was inadequate -- said was supposedly why they had to eavesdrop outside of FISA -- not because warrants took too long to get , but because they did not want to have to show probable cause in order to eavesdrop .
Thus , it would not matter what procedures they changed with the FISA court .
The problem they claimed existed with FISA was that it required too stringent a showing in order to obtain a warrant ( of course , that excuse for lawbreaking never made sense either , since the Senateto lower the standard of proof required under FISA and the administration refused , but that is another story ) .
The point here is that there is no way that any new secret streamlined procedures with the FISA court could possibly fix the problems whichinhered in the law and which prevented them from keeping all of us nice and safe , because the supposed problem with FISA was not the procedures but its substance ( the President 's FISA reversal appears to have rejuvinated my brain temporarilly ) . : Via Marty Lederman , here is part of a statement today from new House Intelligence Committee Chair Silvestre Reyes : Regardless of what the Court Orders say and regardless of what the " new program " provides , we ought to see an emphatic statement that there will still be an investigation into how these powers were used in secret for the past five years , specifically on which Americans they eavesdropped with no oversight .
I do n't know enough about Reyes to know if he will be as diligent as he should be in that regard ( and his statement is slightly vague about his future intentions ) , but I do know enough about Pat Leahy , his Senate counterpart , to preclude real concern about whether needed investigations will occur .
that " Justice officials also released statistics today showing improvements in the amount of time it takes to obtain warrants from the surveillance court , " though presumably that occurredimplementation of these new procedures , so it is unclear what that proves .
Presumably , this will all be much clearer once Gonzales answers some questions tomorrow .
One is constrained to admit that Mark Levin has a valid point here :
If you were a Bush follower , and you were told ( and , of course , by definition , believed ) that the President 's violations of FISA were not just legal but critical to our Survival and Ability to Defeat The Terrorists , and then suddenly one day , the administration , once Democrats took over Congress , announced that they could , after all , comply with FISA , would n't you feel betrayed , too , as though everything the administration was telling you all along about what is vital for our security was . . . . completely false and insincerely expressed ?
For Bush followers who kept insisting that ( a ) " blew the cover " on a vital national security program and ( b ) our ability to stop The Terrorists would be impeded by compliance with FISA , where does this leave them ?
If Levin 's reaction is any indication , they wo n't be happy . : Like Levin , Captain
Ed was a supporter of the administration 's warrantless eavesdropping and apparently believed them when they claimed that security required operating outside of FISA .
As a result , he seems disillusioned It 's worth noting that there are Bush supporters ( like Ed ) who genuinely believe when the administration says that they have to do X because it is necessary to protect Americans , and they then support X in reliance on those representations ( in much the same way that many Americans supported the invasion of Iraq in reliance on the administration 's representations ) .
For those people ( as opposed to the Bush followers who support anything the administration does no matter what and cheer on any expansion of power ) , this is going to be a hard pill to swallow and then digest .
There is simply no way to reconcile ( at least honorably ) the adminsitration 's prior insistence that our security depended upon eavesdroppping outside of FISA with their sudden willingness to comply with it ( now that , as Ed notes , the Democrats control Congress ) . * * * * * * Additional observations are here

The minister said he was shocked by what the files contained
Radoslaw Sikorski said the files , which had remained secret until now , will be open to historians at the state - run Institute of National Remembrance .
The institute investigates war crimes in the Communist era .
The archive reveals details about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981 .
Nuclear strike
During the Cold War , the threat of nuclear conflict constantly hovered over Europe .
For 36 years the Warsaw Pact squared up against the Western military alliance , Nato .
For years Soviet strategists believed war with the West was likely and had a long standing plan to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike .
During a news conference , the new Polish defence minister , Mr Sikorski , described how Poland would have been affected by such a war .
He produced a map showing where the planners thought missile strikes would hit .
He said it had been a shattering experience for him to discover Poland was being asked to participate in an operation which would lead to the nuclear annihilation of the country .
Mr Sikorski said almost all of the 1,700 files would be handed over to historians .
Without going into details , he said they offer valuable knowledge about the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 .
The military alliance was dissolved in 1991 , following the collapse of Communism .
Eight years later , Poland and other former Soviet Bloc countries joined Nato .
Authors of a study published in the latest issue of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy believe that voting behavior should be the result of rational choice based on an informed understanding of the issues .
But using research based on the 2004 presidential election , they found that people may vote with their hearts , rather than their heads .
Their findings demonstrated that registered voters in a psychologically benign state of mind preferred Senator Kerry to President Bush , but Bush was more popular than Kerry after voters received a subtle reminder of death .
Citing an Osama bin Laden tape that surfaced a few days before the election , among other factors , the authors state , " the present study adds convergent support to the idea that George W. Bush 's victory in the 2004 presidential election was facilitated by Americans ' nonconscious concerns about death ... "
The authors believe that people were scared into voting for Bush .
More than 130 registered voters participated in the study .
Split into two groups , the first group was asked to write down a description of their emotions regarding the thought of their own death and , as specifically as possible , write down what will physically happen when they die and after they are dead .
The second group responded to parallel questions regarding watching television .
Within the first group 32 responded that they would vote for Bush and 14 opted for Kerry .
In the second group , the decision was reversed as 34 selected Kerry and 8 selected Bush .
" The best antidote to this problem may be to monitor and take pains to resist any efforts by candidates to capitalize on fear - mongering , " they conclude .

Arctic sea ice that has been dwindling for several decades may have reached a tipping point that could trigger a cascade of climate change reaching into Earth 's temperate regions , says a new University of Colorado at Boulder study .
Mark Serreze , a senior research scientist at CU - Boulder 's National Snow and Ice Data Center who led the study synthesizing results from recent research , said the Arctic sea-ice extent trend has been negative in every month since 1979 , when concerted satellite record keeping efforts began .
The team attributed the loss of ice , about 38,000 square miles annually as measured each September , to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases and strong natural variability in Arctic sea ice .
" When the ice thins to a vulnerable state , the bottom will drop out and we may quickly move into a new , seasonally ice - free state of the Arctic , " Serreze said .
" I think there is some evidence that we may have reached that tipping point , and the impacts will not be confined to the Arctic region . "
A review paper by Serreze and Julienne Stroeve of CU - Boulder 's NSIDC and Marika Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research titled " Perspectives on the Arctic 's Shrinking Sea Ice Cover " appears in the March 16 issue of Science .
The loss of Arctic sea ice is most often tied to negative effects on wildlife like polar bears and increasing erosion of coastlines in Alaska and Siberia , he said .
But other studies have linked Arctic sea ice loss to changes in atmospheric patterns that cause reduced rainfall in the American West or increased precipitation over western and southern Europe , he said .
The decline in Arctic sea ice could impact western states like Colorado , for example , by reducing the severity of Arctic cold fronts dropping into the West and reducing snowfall , impacting the ski industry and agriculture , he said .
" Just how things will pan out is unclear , but the bottom line is that Arctic sea ice matters globally , " Serreze said .
Because temperatures across the Arctic have risen from 2 degrees to 7 degrees F. in recent decades due to a build - up of atmospheric greenhouse gases , there is no end in sight to the decline in Arctic sea ice extent , said Serreze of CU - Boulder 's Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences .
Arctic sea ice extent is defined as the total area of all regions where ice covers at least 15 percent of the ocean surface .
" While the Arctic is losing a great deal of ice in the summer months , it now seems that it also is regenerating less ice in the winter , " said Serreze .
" With this increasing vulnerability , a kick to the system just from natural climate fluctuations could send it into a tailspin . "
In the late 1980s and early 1990s , shifting wind patterns from the North Atlantic Oscillation flushed much of the thick sea ice out of the Arctic Ocean and into the North Atlantic where it drifted south and eventually melted , he said .
The thinner layer of " young " ice that formed it its place melts out more readily in the succeeding summers , leading to more open water and more solar radiation being absorbed by the open ocean and fostering a cycle of higher temperatures and earlier ice melt , he said .
" This ice - flushing event could be a small - scale analog of the sort of kick that could invoke rapid collapse , or it could have been the kick itself , " he said .
" At this point , I do n't think we really know . "
Researchers also have seen pulses of warmer water from the North Atlantic entering the Arctic Ocean beginning in the mid-1990s , which promote ice melt and discourage ice growth along the Atlantic ice margin , he said .
" This is another one of those potential kicks to the system that could evoke rapid ice decline and send the Arctic into a new state . "
The potential for such rapid ice loss was highlighted in a December 2006 study by Holland and her colleagues published in Geophysical Research Letters .
In one of their climate model simulations , the Arctic Ocean in September became nearly ice - free between 2040 and 2050 .
" Given the growing agreement between models and observations , a transition to a seasonally ice - free Arctic Ocean as the system warms seems increasingly certain , " the researchers wrote in Science .
" The unresolved questions regard when this new Arctic state will be realized , how rapid the transition will be , and what will be the impacts of this new state on the Arctic and the rest of the globe . "

Back when he was a Congressman , Bob Barr was at the forefront of a move in Congress to block a referendum in the District of Columbia that would have allowed the use of marijuana for medical purposes .
The referendum went forward , but thanks to the Barr Amendment the public was n’t even allowed to know what the results of the vote were , although it seemed clear that the referendum had passed .
Let ’s just say that times have changed .
Bob Barr is now retired from Congress , he ’s joined the Libertarian Party , and he ’s lobbying for the legalization of medical marijuana :
Bob Barr , who as a Georgia congressman authored a successful amendment that blocked D.C. from implementing a medical marijuana initiative , has switched sides and become a lobbyist for the Marijuana Policy Project .
But that does n’t mean he has become a bong - ripping hippie .
He is n’t pro-drug , he said , just against government intrusion .
Quite the turnaround , but if his advocacy means more people can get hold of wholesale bud to help treat their conditions , surely it will be a move welcomed by the lobbyists .
“ I , over the years , have taken a very strong stand on drug issues , but in light of the tremendous growth of government power since 9/11 , it has forced me and other conservatives to go back and take a renewed look at how big and powerful we want the government to be in people ’s lives , ” Barr said .
(…)
Ironically , Barr said he will help lead the fight to give District residents a say on whether to allow medical marijuana – the very thing the “ Barr Amendment ” denied them in 1998 .
He will lobby for the rights of states to set their own medical marijuana policy without federal interference .
Medical marijuana has already been very successful in Missouri .
It ’s even so simple to search for an online dispensary ( if legal in your state ) than it is visiting one .
What would we do without the internet !
Many people have learnt the process of how to get a medical mj card in Missouri .
As this industry is doing quite well in states where medical marijuana is legal , it comes as no surprise when people want to try and open up their own dispensary .
If this is something you want to do , there is a lot to consider .
From getting a license to open a store of this nature , to ensuring the cannabis packaging on all products follows the rules and regulations , it is important to do your research into how you can turn an idea into reality .
The four - term former Republican congressman will also work to unplug a youth anti-drug campaign which a recent study showed actually increased the likelihood that all teens would smoke pot .
Some of the commentors over at Hit & Run are accusing Barr of “ flip - flopping ” , but , like Radley Balko said , I think it ’s clear that this is a genuine change of mind on Barr ’s part , not a change in position designed to gain votes or political support .
If anything this is likely to make him even less welcome among his former allies .
However , like Glenn Reynolds , I think it would ’ve been nice if Barr had had this change of heart when he actually had the power to do something about the insanity that is the War on Drugs .
BACTERIA cause disease .
The idea that they might also prevent disease is counterintuitive .
Yet that is the hypothesis Chris Lowry , of Bristol University , and his colleagues are putting forward in Neuroscience .
They think a particular sort of bacterium might alleviate clinical depression .
The chance observation that Dr Lowry followed up to arrive at this conclusion was made by Mary O'Brien , an oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London .
Dr O'Brien was trying out an experimental treatment for lung cancer that involved inoculating patients with Mycobacterium vaccae .
This is a harmless relative of the bugs that cause tuberculosis and leprosy that had , in this case , been rendered even more harmless by killing it .
When Dr O'Brien gave the inoculation , she observed not only fewer symptoms of the cancer , but also an improvement in her patients ' emotional health , vitality and general cognitive function .
To find out what was going on , Dr Lowry turned to mice .
His hypothesis was that the immune response to M. vaccae induces the brain to produce serotonin .
This molecule is a neurotransmitter ( a chemical messenger between nerve cells ) and one symptom of depression is low levels of it .
Dr Lowry and his team injected their mice with M. vaccae and examined them to find out what was going on .
First , they looked for a rise in the level of cytokines , which are molecules produced by the immune system that trigger responses in the brain .
As expected , cytokine levels rose .
They then looked directly in their animals ' brains for the effect of those cytokines .
Cytokines actually act on sensory nerves that run to the brain from organs such as the heart and the lungs .
That action stimulates a brain structure called the dorsal raphe nucleus .
It was this nucleus that Dr Lowry focused on .
He found a group of cells within it that connect directly to the limbic system , the brain 's emotion - generating area .
These cells release serotonin into the limbic system in response to sensory - nerve stimulation .
The consequence of that release is stress - free mice .
Dr Lowry was able to measure their stress by dropping them into a tiny swimming pool .
Previous research has shown that unstressed mice enjoy swimming , while stressed ones do not .
His mice swam around enthusiastically .
This result is intriguing for two reasons .
First , it offers the possibility of treating clinical depression with what is , in effect , a vaccination .
Indeed , M. vaccae is considered a bit of a wonder - bug in this context .
Besides cancer , and now depression , it is being looked at as a way of treating Crohn 's disease ( an inflammation of the gut ) and rheumatoid arthritis .
Second , it opens a new line of inquiry into why depression is becoming more common .
Two other conditions that have increased in frequency recently are asthma and allergies , both of which are caused by the immune system attacking cells of the body it is supposed to protect .
One explanation for the rise of these two conditions is the hygiene hypothesis .
This suggests a lack of childhood exposure to harmless bugs is leading to improperly primed immune systems , which then go on to look for trouble where none exists .
In the case of depression , a similar explanation may pertain .
If an ultra-hygienic environment is not stimulating the interaction between immune system and brain , some people may react badly to the consequent lack of serotonin .
No one suggests this is the whole explanation for depression , but it may turn out to be part of it .
The URL will continue to be part of the Web user interface for several more years , so a usable site requires :
a domain name that is easy to remember and easy to spell
that is easy to remember and easy to spell short URLs
URLs easy - to - type URLs
URLs URLs that visualize the site structure
URLs that are " hackable " to allow users to move to higher levels of the information architecture by hacking off the end of the URL
" to allow users to move to higher levels of the information architecture by hacking off the end of the URL persistent URLs that do n't change
In principle , users should not need to know about URLs which are a machine - level addressing scheme .
In practice , users often go to websites or individual pages through mechanisms that involve exposure to raw URLs :
people guess the domain name of sites they have not visited before : if possible , secure the name of your company and main brands as domain names
of sites they have not visited before : if possible , secure the name of your company and main brands as domain names even when people have been to a site before , they will often try to guess or remember the site name instead of using a bookmark or history list : have memorable domain names that are easy to spell
that are easy to spell the social interface to the Web relies on email when users want to recommend Web pages to each other , and email is the second - most common way users get to new sites ( search engines being the most common ) : make sure that all URLs on your site are less than 78 characters long so that they will not wrap across a line feed
when users want to recommend Web pages to each other , and email is the second - most common way users get to new sites ( search engines being the most common ) : make sure that all URLs on your site are long so that they will not wrap across a line feed shorter URLs are better since people often type them manually
do not use MiXeD case text in URLs since people can't remember the difference between upper-case and lower - case characters : all - lowercase URLs are usually preferred ( domain names are less of a problem since they are case - insensitive - usability would increase if webservers would ignore case in resolving URLs )
text in URLs since people can't remember the difference between upper-case and lower - case characters : all - lowercase URLs are usually preferred ( domain names are less of a problem since they are case - insensitive - usability would increase if webservers would ignore case in resolving URLs ) use a spelling - checking webserver to minimize the damage caused by the inevitable typos
Persistent URLs Attract Links
Links from other websites are the third - most common way people find sites ( after search engines and email recommendations ) , so build your site to make it easy to attract inbound links :
Linkrot equals lost business : make sure all URLs live forever and continue to point to relevant pages .
Do not move pages around but keep them at the same URL : it is very annoying for authors of other sites when their links either stop working or turn into pointers to something different because the original page has been moved and replaced by something new .
There can be reasons to reserve a special URL for the current edition of a column or other special content , but the article should be stored at a permanent URL from the start and this URL should be listed on the page that is accessed through the temporary or varying URL .
Should Domains End in .com ?
The most frequently asked question on my recent lecture tour to Iceland was whether it is better to get a domain ending in .com or to use the country 's own domain ( .is ) .
Unfortunately , many users have been trained to view " .com " as the standard ending for commercial websites : this is an artifact of the early American dominance on the Web and of the completion algorithm in several popular browsers which automatically add .com to any name .
Because of this situation , my advice is :
for a site that uses English and is clearly world - wide in its appeal and user base : get a .com domain
and is clearly in its appeal and user base : get a .com domain for a site that uses any other language : use the appropriate country domain ending
: use the appropriate country domain ending for a site that has mainly local appeal , covers mainly local issues , or sells mainly local products : use the country domain , no matter what language is used on the site
I recommend use of the local domain for local sites because it is misleading to use the " international " domain ending .com for such sites .
As ecommerce and other uses of the Web grow around the world , people will start to expect local domains for local sites and they will not think to type .com for local service .
Since the ability to provide great local service is a major selling point , sites are better off by staying with their own country 's domain name unless they deliberately want to be seen as disembodied cyberspace entities .
Domain Names May Die
It is likely that domain names only have 3 – 5 years left as a major way of finding sites on the Web .
In the long term , it is not appropriate to require unique words to identify every single entity in the world .
That 's not how human language works .
The proposals to open up new top - level domains like .
shop are a poor solution from a usability perspective since there is no easy way to remember which domain ending is associated with which site .
The only new TLD that 's useful is .sex which would allow very simple ways of filtering content that 's undesired ( or desired , as the case may be ) .
New addressing schemes are likely to be introduced with better support for ambiguity and the ability to find things without knowing the exact spelling .
Search engines and directories are an early attempt , but we can surely do better .
Because of the conservatism of Web users , we will have to cater to old browsers , old software , and old habits for many years , so good domain names will continue to be important for many years .
The remaining useful life of a domain name may be as much as ten years .
See reader comments on this Alertbox and a sidebar on compound domain names .
Update added 2005 :
Domain names are still in use , and it looks like they may have several more years to go .
But my prediction that they would become a less important way to find sites has come true : it is now much more common for users to type a company name , a site name , or even a domain name into a search engine than it is for them to guess the URL .
Even so , enough users continue to enter their destination directly into the browser 's URL field that it 's still important to have an easily guessable domain name and easily typable URLs .
URLs also impact several of the design guidelines for confirmation email , because these messages often need to refer the user back to the originating website .
Update added 2007 :
Edward Cutrell and Zhiwei Guan from Microsoft Research have conducted an eyetracking study of search engine use ( warning : PDF ) that found that people spend 24 % of their gaze time looking at the URLs in the search results .
MSR used Microsoft 's own search engine ( fair enough ) , but their results match what we found in our eyetracking research which included the current market leader as well as the # 2 search engine in addition to MSN .
Users have evolved a firm model of search behavior which they apply across search engines , which is why it 's probably a lost cause to make a non-standard search user interface .
We found that searchers are particularly interested in the URL when they are assessing the credibility of a destination .
If the URL looks like garbage , people are less likely to click on that search hit .
On the other hand , if the URL looks like the page will address the user 's question , they are more likely to click .
The prospect has alarmed civil liberties groups who fear it represents a ' sea change ' in the state 's relationship with children and one that may lead to juveniles being erroneously accused of crimes .
Under laws being drawn up behind closed doors by the European Commission 's ' Article Six ' committee , which is composed of representatives of the European Union 's 25 member states , all children will have to attend a finger - printing centre to obtain an EU passport by June 2009 at the latest .
The use of fingerprints and other biometric data is designed to prevent passport fraud and allow European member states to meet US entry visa requirements , but the decision to fingerprint children has disturbed human rights groups .
The civil liberties group Statewatch last night accused EU governments of taking decisions in which ' people and parliaments have no say ' .
It said the committee 's decisions were simply based on ' technological possibilities - not on the moral and political questions of whether it is right or desirable . '
' This is a sea change , ' said Ben Hayes , spokesman for Statewatch .
' We are going from fingerprinting criminals to universal fingerprinting without any real debate .
In the long term everyone 's fingerprints will be stored on a central database .
You have to ask what will be the costs to a person 's privacy . '
According to secret documents obtained by Statewatch , the committee will make it compulsory for all children from the age of 12 to be fingerprinted .
However , several of the committee 's member states are lobbying to bring the compulsory age limit down .
Sweden tells the committee it ' could agree with a minimum age of six years for passports ' .
The UK , meanwhile , observes that it has collected the fingerprints of five - year - old asylum seekers with no ' significant problems ' .
Since February the Home Office has been fingerprinting children as young as five at asylum centres in Croydon and Liverpool .
It took the decision amid concerns children were being registered by several families in order to claim more benefits .
Refugee support groups , including the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants , have described the action as ' intrusive ' .
The JCWI also expressed concerns that fingerprints kept on file could be held against children if they tried to return to the UK in later life .
Fingerprinting young children is considered difficult because their fingers have yet to fully develop .
The European Commission notes : ' Scientific tests have confirmed that the paillary ridges on the fingers are not sufficiently developed to allow biometric capture and analysis until the age of six . '
A commission spokesman said initially only member states would have access to their citizens ' fingerprint data .
However , after the Madrid bombings the commission signalled its intention for all fingerprints to be stored on one database that could one day be accessed by each EU state .
' Whether access for third countries will be allowed has to be decided by the EC at a later stage , ' the spokesman said .
' Nevertheless , full interoperability is ensured , should the EU decide to give access to third countries . '
Such a move opens up the possibility that the fingerprints of British children could one day be accessed by foreign intelligence services .
' Secure passports make a lot more sense than ID cards , ' said Shami Chakrabarti , director of the human rights group Liberty .
' But only as long as the information that is kept is no more than necessary and is not shared with other countries . '

Conservatives without Conscience --
My country seems on the verge of making an historic mistake … .
My government is making a case for war against Iraq that is built upon fear and ignorance , as opposed to the reality of truth and fact .
As someone who counts himself as a fervent patriot and a good citizen of the United States of America , I feel I cannot stand by idly , while my country behaves in such a fashion ...
We , the people of the United States , are told repeatedly that we face a grave and imminent risk to our national security from a combination of past irresponsible behaviour on the part of Iraq and ongoing efforts by Iraq to re-acquire chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and long - range ballistic weapons ... which have been banned since 1991 by a Security Council resolution .
The truth of the matter is that Iraq is not a sponsor of the kind of terror perpetrated against the United States on 11 September , and in fact is active in suppressing the sort of fundamentalist extremism that characterises those who attacked the United States on that horrible day .
This is the truth , and once the American people become familiar with and accept this truth , the politics of fear will be defeated and the prospect of war between our two countries greatly diminished ...
The truth of the matter is that Iraq has not been shown to possess weapons of mass destruction , either in terms of having retained prohibited capability from the past , or by seeking to re-acquire such capability today ...
Iraq must loudly reject any intention of possessing these weapons and then work within the framework of international law to demonstrate this a reality .
The only way that Iraq can achieve this is with the unconditional return of UN weapons inspectors , allowing such inspectors unfettered access to sites inside Iraq in order to complete the disarmament tasks as set forth in Security Council resolutions ...

Yes , I agree .
I think that he did n't have any credibility to begin with .
I mean , this is the guy who never really explained , as Jonah said , why he flipped 180 degrees and became a Saddam mouthpiece .
So for me it 's irrelevant .
I never listened to what he had to say on Iraq to begin with .
He 's now just basically joined Pete Townsend on the Magic School Bus. . . .
Pete Townsend of the WHO has also been implicated in child porn and things of that nature .
But as everybody said , Ritter 's credibility , just on the basics of Iraq , was completely shot and now there 's even less reason to listen to him .

In the meantime , Psychology Professor Bob Altemeyer -- on whose research John Dean heavily relied in writing about the authoritarian mindset forhas placed a free copy of his new book , The Authoritarians , online ( or at least Chapter 1 ) .
I have n't had a chance to look at any of it , but based on Altemeyer 's work that I have read , I have no doubt that it is worth reading .
Also , in writing the book , I spent much time reading through the television and newspaper " debates " which our country had in the lead - up to the invasion of Iraq .
That is a very dark period in American political discourse , and reading through it requires a strong constitution in order to endure it .
I offer here but a small sampling of what I found .
A brief unedited excerpt from the manuscript , which I offer in order to expunge this from my system as much as for any other reason :
______________________________________In exactly the way that few people were as consistently wrong as Krauthammer , few people were as right about the Iraq war as Scott Ritter was .
Back in September , 2002 , Ritter was trying to tell anyone who would listen that Iraq had no WMD's .
Ritter is a former U.S. Marine officer , was a top aide to Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf during the first Gulf War against Iraq , and built a reputation as a tenacious weapons inspector working inside Iraq for the U.N .
It is difficult to imagine someone with greater credentials and credibility who ought to have been listened to on those issues .
As George Bush , Charles Krauthammer , and the national political establishment were assuring Americans that Saddam unquestionably had WMDs and that an invasion of Iraq was urgent , Ritter was desperately warning his fellow citizens of the dangers of Bush 's war plans .
In the Fall of 2002 , Ritter went to Iraq in an effort to forge an agreement that would save his country from making a horrendous mistake , and during his trip , he addressed the Iraqi Parliament and warned :
Ritter ’s extremely prescient warnings were all but ignored in the mainstream American press , except when television panels were convened to smear his character and attack his credibility .
On January 26 , 2003 , Wolf Blitzer held a panel discussion on CNN to discuss Ritter ’s war opposition .
Ritter was not present , but Peter Beinert , the pro-war Editor of , and Jonah Goldberg , the pro-war pundit from , were invited to urge the invasion of Iraq , mock Ritter ’s anti-war arguments , and smear him with a series of personal attacks .
Neither of these young , great “ experts ” who were urging the country to war had any experience with the weapons inspection process or with Iraq .
Joining them was Democratic strategist Donna Brazile and Robert George of , both of whom also supported the war and whose level of expertise on these matters was equal to Beinert ’s and Goldberg ’s .
Blitzer began the segment on Ritter by describing him as “ an outspoken critic of a possible war against Iraq [ who ] was arrested in 2001 for allegedly communicating over the internet with an undercover police officer who was posing as a 16 year old girl . ”
Blitzer 's question for the panel : “ Is Scott Ritter 's credibility now destroyed ? ” Brazille ’s answer : “ Absolutely .
It shows that he has poor judgment .
” George went next and accused Ritter of having been paid “ hundreds of thousands of dollars from Saddam Hussein 's regime , ” so everyone could safely ignore anything Ritter said because he was an agent of Saddam – “ a pro-Saddam guy , ” in George ’s words .
George was referring to a documentary produced by Ritter that was financed by an American citizen of Iraqi descent and which contended , correctly as it turns out , that the U.N. inspection process had “ defanged ” Iraq ’s weapons program .
But the fact that Ritter ’s film was financed by an American business man of Iraqi origin – and , more to the point , that Ritter then became an outspoken opponent of the war -- was continuously used by war advocates to smear the former Marine as an agent of Saddam Hussien’s .
Thus , with the smear on Ritter ’s loyalty firmly in place , arguments by Ritter that there was no convincing evidence of Iraqi WMDs , and that Iraq could not pose a threat to the U.S. , could be easily ignored .
Beinert followed George and immediately said :
Once the Great Iraqi expert , Peter Beinert , was done smearing Ritter ’s credibility and making clear that he could be safely ignored on the issue of Iraqi WMDs , Goldberg uttered : “ Yes , I agree with everybody , ” and then added :
The brilliant work of this expert panel complete , Blitzer decreed : “ Let 's move on now . ” Ritter ’s arguments were never engaged by this harmonious panel of war advocates .
His arguments did not need to be engaged because these panelists -- intoxicated by war rhetoric and Manichean imperatives and the smug sense of their own Rightness -- had , in unison , pronounced the ex-Marine so lacking in credibility that he could merely be swatted away , ignored , just as Peter Beinert said he had been doing with Ritter for some time .
Literally in a matter of minutes on CNN , Ritter – one of the nation ’s preeminent experts on the subject of the Iraqi weapons program and one of the most vocal and knowledgeable critics of Bush 's war plans ( who was aggressively questioning the WMD orthodoxy ) -- was quickly transformed by a panel of know - nothing war cheerleaders posing as experts into a grotesque cartoon – a pro-Saddam propagandist , a liar , a child molester and an integrity - free subversive whose loyalty was very much in question .
Moments earlier , though , Beinert gave a stirring explanation of how the war on Iraq was not only necessary for our security but morally right as well , and we therefore must not wait for the inspection process to be complete before invading .
Moments later , Goldberg urged that the “ president needs to make a forceful case for a regime change in Paris , ” and when Blitzer and the jovial , war - crazed panel laughed heartily and good - naturedly at Goldberg ’s war - on - France joke , Goldberg struggled to assure them that he was serious .
That Ritter was right about everything he said , and Beinert , Goldberg and company profoundly wrong and misguided -- and that the latter helped lead the country into the worst strategic disaster in its history -- means nothing .
To this day , it is almost impossible to avoid hearing from Peter Beinert and Jonah Goldberg in the nation ’s most influential media outlets ( Beinert was recently given a column in , and Goldberg went on to become a twice - weekly columnist for ) .
But if one wants to know what Ritter thinks about anything -- say , whether the nation should wage war on Iran , or about anything else -- one would have to search for obscure websites or alternative weekly newspapers .
_____________________________That was how our country debated whether to go to war against Iraq and how it was established that Saddam had WMDs ( a belief which , even today , the establishment pundits and journalists attempting to excuse themselves for their war advocacy will insist was one which " everyone " accepted -- from Krauthammer inJune , 2003 : thought Hussein had weapons because we knew for sure he had them five years ago and there was no evidence that he had disposed of them .
" And , as I have noted before , this is what Dean said following Secretary Powell 's slide show to the U.N. : " Secretary Powell 's recent presentation at the UN showed the extent to which we have Iraq under an audio and visual microscope .
Given that , I was impressed not by the vastness of evidence presented by the Secretary , but rather by its sketchiness .
" I realize that I 've made a few references over the past couple months to the book I am writing without saying much about it ( saying almost virtually nothing about it , in fact ) .
That has apparently created some mild cognitive dissonance ( several e-mails along the lines of " what book are you prattling on about ? " ) I have n't said much about the book due primarily to the fact that I was not entirely sure what it would actually end up being until I was done writing it , and because -- unlike my prior book , which was published by a small , independent publisher and could therefore be published almost immediately after being written ( the manuscript for that book was finished in early April and the book was ready to be shipped from Amazon in mid-May ) -- this book is being published by a large publisher ( Random House 's Crown ) , which means that there is a long pipeline through which the book has to travel before it will actually be available ( June 12 is the release date ) .
In any event , for informational purposes only , the book is listed on Amazon here and provides a little information .
I would request that youpre - order now , because ordering it closer to publication will have a much greater impact in helping to generate visibility and attention for the book .
Its broad theme is the exploitation of " Good v. Evil " concepts and rhetoric ( and the corresponding and insatiable need for an " Enemy " ) in American political " debates " and policy , and how reliance on that framework has destroyed the Bush presidency and damaged the country .
Various topics are examined under that rubric ( Iraq , Iran , media narratives , domestic policy making , executive power abuses , etc. ) .
I 'll write more about the book at some point when it makes sense to do so .
Phyllis Schlafly 's Eagle Forum has started an alternative to Wikipedia called Conservapedia .
Needless to say , the usual " liberal " suspects are having a great deal of ( what passes to them as ) fun ( link , link , link , link ) .
They 're pointing out " errors " in the encyclopedia , and some of those " errors " may actually be vandalism ( link , link , link ) and would be refered to at WP as such .
Did you really expect anything different ?
Of course , those of us with a greater mental age might wonder , " if unthinking ' liberals ' say Wikipedia is n't biased , is n't that prima facie evidence that it is indeed biased ? "
And , we could compare that to the occasional ludicrous statement that the MSM does not have such a bias .
And , we could point to entries at WP such as that on Antonio Villaraigosa , or the press - release - manquee for Media Matters .
Or , something else I just noticed : Art Torres ' 187 quote was added to his entry in April 2006 , removed in May , and then not added back in until August .
Meaning that all during the Summer of 2006 , a very " liberal " POV of Torres was being presented to all those who visited the entry , which turns up at the # 1 spot in a Google search for his name .
Nope , no bias in Wikipedia , which is " normal " and " unbiased " in the same sense that the New York Times is " normal " and " unbiased " .
I note also that WP publishes an / Interwiki_map , which lets you create links to other wikis .
Instead of entering the full , external URL , you use something like [ [ Disinfopedia : Wikipedia ] ] , which would link to the Wikipedia entry at sourcewatch.org .
Unlike almost all other external links , such links do n't have the nofollow tag added , which is certainly of benefit to many sites .
There are interwiki links for commercial sites such as IMDB , and one was briefly added for Youtube ( it was deleted over concerns of linking to copyrighted material ) .
You can suggest adding an interwiki link on its talk page , and no one has so far offered for Conservapedia .
I wonder what would happen if someone did ?
The bottom line is that the " liberal " response to Conservapedia is similar to their response to Rush Limbaugh , the Washington Times , and Fox News , and their push to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine .
They are n't content with having their biases presented in almost all of the wider media , they simply want it all .
VERY SPECIAL UPDATE : Certainly , not all the bias at WP is " liberal " .
In the 06:13 , 26 January 2005 revision of the Asa_Hutchinson article ( a Republican and a former DHS Undersecretary ) , I added four negative links , none of them to any of my sites and all relating to illegal immigration :
" Rounding up all illegals ' not realistic ' "
" Hutchinson ’s Remarks Indicate Cheap Labor Bias of Administration "
Cheers , jeers at immigration town hall meeting
" ( Hutchinson ) slammed for stopping illegals sweeps "
Those links were deleted 10 weeks later ; in August I added them back in twice before giving up .
In its current state , no one would know anything about his involvement in the Temecula sweeps , which is about the only thing ( other than running for Arkansas governor ) he 's known for in the past few years .
DON'T MESS WITH MINILIB UPDATE : My Digg post was buried ; searching for it by name did n't bring it up until I checked the ' show buried stories ' checkbox .
I do n't know exactly how that works , but if you go here and vote for it it might become un -' liberaled ' .
Our mission is to make computer science and digital electronics accessible to students , hobbyists , and the curious public .
Our first interactive exhibit was commissioned by the Intel Museum in 2005 .
Happy 48th Birthday Intel 4004 microprocessor !
The Exhibit Story
Genesis
In 2004 I became intrigued by a new kind of packaging for SSI ( Small Scale Integration ) logic gates , the DSBGA ( Die Size Ball Grid Array ) .
I had been waiting for years to see chips without packages , and this was the closest thing I had ever seen .
A DSBGA " package " is nothing more than a " bare die " with a grid of solder balls welded to the pads so it can be flipped upside down and soldered to a printed circuit board like any other surface - mount device .
But what I found more inspiring was that an entire logic family was now available with one gate per package .
Now a printed circuit could be laid out just like the schematic or ... just like a " standard cell " VLSI chip !
And the end result , not being microscopic , would be easy for anyone to see and better appreciate .
Knowing that robotic " pick - and - place " machines were now the standard way of assembling electronics , and made the whole idea practical to produce , I started thinking .
What could I build out of this " retro , " one - gate - per- chip technology ?
Some sort of microprocessor seemed like a natural .
But modern microprocessors have millions of transistors , so I knew I 'd have to keep the project very modest , like restricting the data - path to 4 - bits .
This meant I 'd have to design my own , or ... go back in history and build a replica of a commercial micrprocessor .
Besides , reproducing a commercial microprocessor , rather than re-inventing my own , would allow me to use existing software and existing manuals , data sheets , wisdom of the ages , etc .
The first microprocessor that came to mind was the Intel 4004 .
It was not nearly as famous as the 8080 , and its 8 - bit progeny , but my late step - father , Joe Robb , worked for Intel in the early 1970's , and I still remember when brought home some MCS - 4 data sheets .
MCS - 4 ( Microcomputer Set 4 ) was the name Intel gave to the 4004 chip family for its commercial introduction in November 1971 .
In search of the circuit
So that was settled , but how to get the schematics ?
Joe , as I called him , had also brought home other goodies from Intel , among them an individually packaged C3102 register file chip -- undoubtedly an engineering sample .
Decades later , in 2000 , I was curious enough about this historical relic I had in my possession , that I wrote a letter to the Intel Archives , and much to my surprise , received a big envelope in the mail a few weeks later with a data sheet and other historical information about Intel 's early days .
During this research spree I also learned that the Intel Archives and the Intel Museum were somehow connected .
This helped me turn a notion into a plan : I wrote to Tracey Mazur , the curator of the Intel Museum , and Rachel Stewart , Intel 's corporate archivist , with a proposition : if you give me access to internal 4004 engineering documents , I will build you a giant , functioning replica of the 4004 suitable for a museum exhibit .
Around the same time I started looking for vintage software to run on the giant 4004 replica .
I wrote to Federico Faggin and to Marcian " Ted " Hoff , two of the four co-inventors of the 4004 ( I was never able to contact the other inventors , Busicom 's Masatoshi Shima or Intel 's Stan Mazor ) .
Both Faggin and Hoff wrote back , Faggin with a general offer of advice , and Hoff with software for a 4004 - based video game design that Intel pitched to a potential customer .
At this time , I was not optimistic about gaining access to schematics or the mask artwork that was used to create the original 4004 wafers , and so I began devising a " Plan B . " I was even starting to wonder if there were any schematics to be found , having read interviews that suggested that no complete logic diagram was ever drawn of the 4004 .
In consultation with Federico Faggin and MIT 's Tom Knight , I mentally prepared myself for reverse - engineering the 4004 " the old - fashioned way , " by photographing the metal layer through a microscope , and then etching that top layer away to reveal the polysilicon layer , photographing that , and using enlargements of these photomicrographs to meticulously transcribe every transistor and wire .
A few weeks later I got word from Tracey Mazur that Intel 's legal department would allow us access to the 4004 engineering documents , and Rachel Stewart was offering encouraging news about her research .
In late July of 2005 I flew to California to meet with Federico Faggin and Rachel Stewart at the Intel archives .
The visit was amazingly brief and nearly a complete success .
Faggin picked up three large engineering drawings on vullum , a translucent plastic sheeting , unrolled them one - by - one , and declared within 30 seconds , " Yes .
This is all of them . "
Rachel and I looked at each other approvingly , as Faggin adds , " See here ?
The drawings are drawn just like the chip layout . "
The Calculator connection
Just before my trip to Silicon Valley , Federico alerted me to the existence of an engineering prototype of the Busicom 141 - PF calculator that he donated to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California .
Besides the fact that there are fewer than a dozen production 141 - PFs known to still be in existence , the significance of this particular relic was that it has socketed ROMs .
This might allow us to recover the original calculator software , if we could construct a custom - mode ROM reader for the unusual 4001 ROMs compatible with the 4004 family .
Federico was able to dig through his house and lend me some test ROMs that I could use to develop my ROM Reader .
Reverse Engineering the schematics
Once back home , I sent the schematics to Brian and Barry Silverman , who immediately started trying to figure out how the 4004 worked in detail .
To aid in their quest for understanding , they entered the schematics using Dia , an open - source diagram editor similar to Microsoft Visio , wrote some scripts to translate the Dia schematics into a simulatable netlist , and built themselves a " zero propagation delay " transistor - level simulator .
The end result was a beautifully animated simulation of the 4004 running a very short test program running at a clock speed of maybe 4 - 10Hz
Meanwhile I continued to develop the ROM reader , periodically sending Brian and Barry my results to see if the binary data I was extracting yielded valid 4004 code .
After some struggles with the unusual voltage levels used by the 4001 ROMs , we succeeded in extracting a significant fraction of the Busicom software from the ROMs Faggin had found in his basement .
The bad news was that there were large strings of zeros in three out of four of the calculator ROMs .
We would have to find another source .
Digital Archeology Expedition
Over Thanksgiving 2005 , Fred Huettig had plans to see his brother in California .
I made arrangements with Dag Spicer for Fred to visit the Computer History Museum to extract the digital contents of their Busicom 141 - PF calculator .
Fred brought with him my 4001 ROM Reader and Sellam Ismail carefully removed the ROMs , including , much to our delight , the rare 5th ROM containing the Square Root function .
He then placed each 4001 in the ROM Reader for Fred to upload to his laptop .
Fred also traced the wiring harness to the calculator keyboard .
Mission accomplished with only a minor casualty , a broken pin on one of the ROMs .
After Fred returned to Boston , I immediately sent the ROM contents to Brian and Barry , who used Fred 's wiring diagram along with printed circuit board photographs I received from Christian Bassow , a German chip collector .
Within a month , they had crafted an instruction - level simulator of the 4004 as well as simulated Busicom hardware , and by January 2006 , they had a completely working simulation of the Busicom 141 - PF printing calculator .
Verilog simulation of the 4004
In parallel , Fred was working on his own schematic capture using a commercial CAD package , and was well on his way to automatically deriving a functional Verilog model of the 4004 to verify that the schematics were correct .
By spring of 2006 , Fred 's simulator was correctly executing the lion 's share of the original 4004 diagnostics ROM Faggin allowed me to keep .
Funding and Exhibit design
This is around the time that the project funding from the Intel Museum was approved , and work began in earnest to design the physical exhibit .
Intel brought in their marketing agency to design the overall look of the exhibit .
After only a few months of behind - the - scenes design work and weekly conference calls , the talented design team turned my back - of - the - envelope sketches into an attractive exhibit worthy of a museum .
I worked closely with a copywriter and the Intel Museum to wordcraft the exhibit's text to explain the historical context , the function of the 4004 , and the calculator software .
Letting visitors " look under the hood "
One of my main goals for the museum exhibit was to allow museum visitors to gain an appreciation for the " machinery under the hood , " the inner workings of the 4004 and the Busicom calculator .
To this end , I specified a large , animated flowchart that shows the path that the microprocessor takes through the calculator software when you press a button on the keyboard .
To show the calculations in - progress , another display shows the calculator 's internal registers .
Exhibit Detail and Construction
Once the design was completed Intel brought in an exhibit fabrication firm to detail the design and construct the non-technology parts of the exhibit .
Together we fashioned a realistic scale model of the chip 's package and the bond wires that connect chips to the " outside world . "
Out of the vaults and into the world
In the Times , Tim Luckhurst compares him - unfavourably - to Leni Riefenstahl .
His new film is a " poisonously anti-British corruption of the history of the war of Irish independence ...
The Wind That Shakes the Barley is not just wrong .
It infantilises its subject matter and reawakens ancient feuds . "
I checked with the production company .
The film has not yet been released .
They can find no record that Luckhurst has attended a screening - and last night he refused to discuss the matter .
At least Simon Heffer , writing in the Telegraph , admits he does n't know what he 's talking about .
Loach , he says , " hates this country , yet leeches off it , using public funds to make his repulsive films .
And no , I have n't seen it , any more than I need to read Mein Kampf to know what a louse Hitler was . "
The Sun says it 's " a brutally anti-British film ... designed to drag the reputation of our nation through the mud " .
Ruth Dudley Edwards in the Daily Mail pronounced it " old- fashioned propaganda " and " a melange of half - truths " .
She has n't seen the film either .
Nor , it seems , has Michael Gove , who told his readers in the Times that it helps to " legitimise the actions of gangsters " .
Are these people claiming that events of the kind Loach portrays did not happen ?
Reprisals by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Auxiliary division are documented by historians of all political stripes .
During the period the film covers ( 1920 - 21 ) , policemen visited homes in places such as Thurles , Cork , Upperchurch and Galway and shot or bayoneted their unarmed inhabitants .
Nor does any historian deny that they fired into crowds or threw grenades or beat people up in the streets or set fire to homes and businesses in Dublin , Cork , Limerick , Bantry , Kilmallock , Balbriggan , Miltown Malbay , Lahinch , Ennistymon , Trim and other towns .
Nor can the fact that the constabulary tortured and killed some of its prisoners be seriously disputed .
It is also clear that some of these attacks were sanctioned by senior officers and politicians .
In June 1920 , in the presence of the commander of the Royal Irish Constabulary , the force 's divisional commissioner in Munster ( Colonel GB Smyth ) told his men : " You may make mistakes occasionally and innocent people may be shot but that cannot be helped ...
The more you shoot , the better I will like you , and I assure you no policeman will get in trouble for shooting any man . "
He advised that " when civilians are seen approaching , shout " Hands up ! "
Should the order be not immediately obeyed , shoot and shoot with effect .
If the persons approaching carry their hands in their pockets , or are in any way suspicious looking , shoot them down . "
Sir Henry Wilson , the director of operations in the War Office , complained that he had warned his minister - Winston Churchill - that " indiscriminate reprisals will play the devil in Ireland , but he wo n't listen or agree " .
There was even a policy of " official reprisals " : the homes of people who lived close to the scene of an ambush and had failed to warn the authorities could be legally destroyed .
Loach 's hero , Damien , as many Irishmen were , is radicalised by a raid by the Black and Tans , who were members of the constabulary recruited from outside Ireland .
As the film shows , they were responsible for much of the police brutality .
The historian Robert Kee , who is a fierce critic of the IRA , remarks that while the police were at first slow to retaliate , their vengeance - exercised against innocent people - " further consolidated national feeling in Ireland .
It made the Irish people feel more and more in sympathy with fighting men of their own . "
The fighter Edward MacLysaght recorded that " what probably drove a peacefully inclined man like myself into rebellion was the British attitude towards us : the assumption that the whole lot of us were a pack of murdering corner boys " .
There is no question that the IRA also killed ruthlessly - not just police and soldiers but also people they deemed to be informers and collaborators .
But Loach shows this too .
( I have seen the film . )
The press hates him because he admits that the people who committed these acts were not evil automata , but human beings capable of grief , anger , love and pity .
So too , of course , were the British forces , whose humanity is always emphasised by the newspapers .
Ken 's crime is to have told the other side of the story .
The other side - whether it concerns Ireland , India , Kenya or Malaya - is always inadmissable .
The torture and killing of the colonised is ignored or excused , while their violent responses to occupation are never forgotten .
The only aggressors permitted to exist are those who fight back .
Does it matter what people say about a conflict that took place 85 years ago ?
It does .
For the same one - sided story is being told about the occupation of Iraq .
The execution of 24 civilians in Haditha allegedly carried out by US marines in November is being discussed as a disgraceful anomaly : the work of a few " bad apples " or " rogue elements " .
Donald Rumsfeld claims " we know that 99.9 % of our forces conduct themselves in an exemplary manner " , and most of the press seems to agree .
But if it chose to look , it would find evidence of scores of such massacres .
In March Jody Casey , a US veteran of the war in Iraq , told Newsnight that when insurgents have let off a bomb , " you just zap any farmer that is close to you ... when we first got down there , you could basically kill whoever you wanted , it was that easy " .
On Sunday another veteran told the Observer that cold - blooded killings by US forces " are widespread .
This is the norm .
These are not the exceptions . "
There is powerful evidence to suggest that US soldiers tied up and executed 11 people - again including small children - in Ishaqi in March .
Iraqi officers say that US troops executed two women and a mentally handicapped man in a house in Samarra last month .
In 2004 , US forces are alleged to have bombed a wedding party at Makr al - Deeb and then shot the survivors , killing 42 people .
No one has any idea what happened in Falluja , as the destruction of the city and its remaining inhabitants was so thorough .
Even the Iraqi prime minister , who depends on coalition troops for his protection , complained last week that their attacks on civilians are a " regular occurrence ...
They crush them with their vehicles and kill them just on suspicion . "
But like the Black and Tans the US troops have little fear of investigation or punishment .
Why should we be surprised by these events ?
This is what happens when one country occupies another .
When troops are far away from home , exercising power over people that they do n't understand , knowing that the population harbours those who would kill them if they could , their anger and fear and frustration turns into a hatred of all " micks " or " gooks " or " hajjis " .
Occupations brutalise both the occupiers and the occupied .
It is our refusal to learn that lesson which allows new colonial adventures to take place .
If we knew more about Ireland , the invasion of Iraq might never have happened .

A lot of flies breed in organic waste which people throw away
Dave Goulson
Houseflies and bluebottles reproduce more quickly in warmer temperatures .
Using computer models , researchers at Southampton University calculated that fly and bluebottle populations could rise by nearly 250 % by the year 2080 .
Writing in the Journal of Applied Ecology , they warn this might lead to a rise in infections transmitted by insects , including diarrhoeal disease .
" The rate at which they reproduce is closely linked to temperature , " said Southampton 's Dave Goulson , " particularly the time interval between an egg being laid and that egg turning into a fly .
" At the optimum temperature of around 32C , it 's about 12 days ; but in cooler temperatures it can take a month , " he told the BBC News website .
" Our modelling shows that a small rise in average temperatures of 2 - 3C would lead to a big increase in the fly population , which is quite alarming . "
The period during which flies are around would also lengthen .
Bottom line
A rise in the fly population could lead to a greater incidence of fly - borne disease , such as stomach upset and diarrhoea .
The most common cause of diarrhoea in Britain is Campylobacter , a family of bacteria .
The rate at which flies reproduce should speed up , according the modelling
Flies are thought to transmit the bacteria , either by carrying small quantities of contaminated material on their bodies or by regurgitating or defecating on to food .
Research published earlier this year showed a strong correlation between the reproductive rate of flies and the incidence of Campylobacter infection .
Nature does provide controls on flies and bluebottles , such as spiders and swallows ; but Dave Goulson does not believe their populations would be able to increase enough to keep the flies down .
" There are things that we can do though , " he said , " such as covering food in the summer , and taking more care with barbecues and so on .
" The other thing is that a lot of flies breed in organic waste which people throw away into their dustbins .
If more people composted , the amount of that waste would be reduced . "
Two years ago a World Health Organization study concluded that , globally , climate change has the potential to affect the health of millions ; for example , through the spread of disease - carrying insects .
Leave it to cowboy capitalism and
Teaxs to come up with an monster energy deal weird enough to make a fly on the wall drop his Lone Star .
On Sunday morning , New York Times editorial page was wringing its hands over a wild - ass proposal by TXU , the state 's number - one power producer , to pay homage to climate - change worries by building a dozen new giant carbon - spewing coal plants .
Love that Texas humor .
Meanwhile out front on the very same paper came late - breaking news :
buyout princes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific were riding to the rescue–they 'd buy TXU !
And scuttle all but three of the proposed new plants .
Just in time for the Oscars Sunday night , TXU 's board accepted a $ 44 billion buyout –the new largest - ever private - equity deal
( a record that at present ratesshould last about two weeks ) .
In what looks like a trend to bet on , green royalty Environmental Defense and the Natural Resources Defense Council were on hand to pre-bless the deal .
They were brought in , the Times reported , by masters of the universe
Goldman Sachs–last seen handing its traders year - end 2006 bonuses of as much as $ 100 million each .
Goldman 's bankers , the Times also reported , now travel in " hybrid limousines , "
whatever those are .
We'd be more impressed if they rode bicycles–or if Goldman alumni
Henry Paulson used his bully pulpit at Secretary of the Treasury to push a carbon tax .
But everyone always said that doing something about climate change would be an incremental affair .
For what it 's worth , even three new coal plants is three too many .
We know perfectly well how to build zero - carbon generating plants big enough to keep the beer cool in Dallas , Houston and the rest of the Lone Star state : clean , green nuclear power .
Indeed , among serious people , the chief objection to nukes is their rather hefty upfront cost .
Maybe Messr
Kohlbert , Kravis & Roberts would like to weigh in there as well –we 're only talking single - digit billions .
Windows Mobile , Palm OS , Linux , and Symbian currently power the world ’s smartphones .
How does each stack up against Apple ’s OS X in the iPhone ?
Here ’s an overview looking at the merits of each , starting with Microsoft .
WinCE , the operating system behind Microsoft ’s Windows Mobile platform , was initially released in late 90s just as Apple was headed toward scuttling its Newton division and Palm OS devices were gaining in popularity .
WinCE was n't Microsoft 's first attempt at delivering software to power a PDA or pen computing device ; once it arrived , it needed to change marketing names rapidly in order to escape embarrassment .
• Windows for Pen intended to provide tablet features for the DOS - based Windows 3.1 in 1991 , but mainly sought to destroy the market for Go's PenPoint OS , which Microsoft identified as a potential rival to Windows .
Pen Computing had exploded into a frenzy of hype in the early 90s , with the media rushing to publish predictions by Bill Gates of big things for the future of the pen and slate .
However , it turned out that handwritten pen input was simply impractical compared to the keyboard .
By 1995 , the idea of pen computers had died .
Existing slate products , such as IBM ’s ThinkPad , morphed into more conventional laptop forms that could sell .
• WinPad Handheld PC was Microsoft ’s vaporware initiative to build a minimally featured Newton clone , involving Compaq , Motorola , NEC and Sharp between 1992 and 1994 .
It was never actually released .
Despite Apple and other manufacturers ’ ability to ship sophisticated PDA products , Microsoft blamed the limits of hardware technology .
• Pulsar was parallel effort by Microsoft to deliver a wireless pager device .
It was a pet project of Gates , but never delivered as a product .
In early 1995 , Microsoft pulled together teams from all these failed projects to take another stab at copying the Newton in a new project called Pegasus .
It was built upon the kernel developed for Pulsar , and hardware work Microsoft ’s WinPad partners had contributed earlier .
Two years later , Pegasus was named Windows CE .
• Handheld PC devices were unveiled with the first version of WinCE in November 1996 .
WinCE 1.0 promised to deliver a new set of advanced , high power 32 - bit devices referred to PC Companions
. Microsoft avoided the term PDA , which was by then associated with the functional and sophisticated Newton from 1993 .
• Palm PC devices were introduced in January 1998 , when WinCE 2.0 took on the Palm Pilot market .
When Palm sued , Microsoft changed the name to Palm - Sized PC .
Meanwhile , the Handheld PC form factor had discovered there was little demand for bulky micro-laptops with scant battery life and minimal functionality .
• Pocket PC was a rebranding of the Palm - Sized PC with the release of WinCE 3.0 in April 2000 .
Microsoft shifted its attention towards Pocket PC as a colorized competitor to the Palm Pilot .
Fortunately for Palm , Pocket PCs were ultra thick battery hogs that made Palm ’s basic offerings look amazing in comparison .
Further , e ven the most Microsoft - bound IT shops had turned up their noses at Handheld PCs , despite the new support for color displays .
By 2001 , the clamshell form factor of the Handheld PC -- the original concept behind WinCE - - was left for dead .
One WinCE fansite observed , “ Unfortunately what looked good on paper for the Handheld PC with [ WinCE 4 ] has , to the largest extent , failed to come through for the platform . ” “... hopes that the device would be noticed were rested [...] bringing one of Microsoft 's most influential journeys , spanning seven years to a quite [ quiet ] and almost unobserved end . ”
Aw bummer .
“ The H / PC will only die if we let it .
Patience , time and experience shows that developers will rise to the challenge if prompted in the right direction .
There are many keen and dedicated users out there who are willing to take the time to campaign for the Handheld PC . ”
But apparently not enough !
After the death of Handheld PC , and finding stagnant sales for Pocket PCs , Microsoft aimed WinCE in a series of new , increasingly desperate directions :
• Stinger , the code name for WinCE powered smartphones , was initially announced in 2000 .
In 2001 , John Morris and Josh Taylor , writing for ZDNet , breathlessly announced “ Finally !
Microsoft 's Stinger gets the phone / PDA combo right , ” in an article comparing the existing Palm OS based phones from Handspring and Kyocera , and Microsoft ’s prototype plans to deliver a competing product .
“ Stinger is nevertheless the most intelligent smartphone design we 've seen to date and it should be a hit right out of the gate , ” they gushed .
Released as Smartphone 2002 , it was n’t .
It still is n’t .
• Windows Powered , an umbrella term for WinCE devices announced at CES 2001 , promised to deliver “ Internet radios , Web pads , and a wearable Internet appliance , ” in addition to the ill fated Ultimate TV set top box and Car.NET , one of several names for WinCE for Automotive carputers .
• Mira , introduced at CES 2002 , was a plan for Windows Powered Smart Displays .
Mira intended to use WinCE to run portable , wireless displays acting as remote terminals for a PC .
It was targeted at home users who might want to buy an expensive LCD panel / low power tablet which would only work inside their home .
As Steve Ballmer explained , " Mira does for monitors what the cordless handset did for telephones . "
The obvious difference being that cordless phones are $ 50 , while Mira cost $ 500 - 800 .
• Media2 Go intended to use WinCE to power video playing iPod killers .
Announced at CES 2003 , Media2Go was delayed until mid 2004 , when its Janus DRM was rebranded under the PlaysForSure logo .
• Gametrac , a handheld gaming platform using WinCE , was introduced at CES 2004 by Tiger .
Later renamed Gizmondo , it was offered for $ 400 , or $ 229 with push advertising .
The company selling it went bankrupt after a wild spree of extravagant spending , fraud , and bizarre criminal conduct .
WinCE : Hasta la Vista
WinCE has followed the pattern of problems common to Microsoft ’s other products .
WinCE 5 was announced in early 2003 , and intended for delivery next to Longhorn [ Vista ] in mid to late 2004 .
It promised to deliver “ a new level of security and robustness , ” as every Microsoft product does .
Repositioned under the brand Windows Mobile 5 , it was actually released in May 2005 , months behind schedule but more than a year and a half ahead of Vista .
It involves three main categories of devices :
• Windows Mobile 5 Smartphones have a subset of WinCE features , and lack a touch screen .
Their limited feature set prevents them from running all apps designed for Windows Mobile 5 .
They can , however , pretend to edit Excel documents on their tiny screens with a quarter the resolution of a typical DOS PC from the 80s .
• Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PC refers to WinCE devices bundled with a specific set of mobile applications and a touch screen .
Pocket PCs are supposed to run all WM5 Smartphone apps as well .
• Windows Mobile 5 Portable Media Center is the rebranding of Media2 Go .
It includes Janus / PlaysForSure players from Creative , iRiver , Samsung and Toshiba , as well as Microsoft ’s own customized , incompatible Zune device .
These typically do not run any other Windows Mobile software .
• Windows Mobile 6 is planned for release in the middle of 2007 , primarily as a way to associate WinCE devices with Windows Vista and its glossy , translucent user interface .
It is still based on WinCE 5 , but is now green :
CE n'est pas bon
After a decade of trying , WinCE has done little to push the state of the art , and nothing to enrich Microsoft .
The company reports having lost over half a billion dollars from its Mobile and Embedded Devices segment over the last four years , which includes sales of both WinCE and Embedded Windows .
In 2006 , the segment brought in 2 million in profit ( partly from pushing some of its losses into the MSN group ) , but Microsoft apparently is n’t impressed .
It has announced that for 2007 , it will start reporting WinCE devices as part of its Entertainment and Devices group , rather than breaking each out separately , as they are above .
That new combined segment , which folds in the failure of the Xbox and Zune , lost a total of $ 607 million in 2005 and a staggering $ 1.337 billion in 2006 .
These losses do not count the $ 5 - 5.9 billion in “ corporate level expenses ” labeled above as Other .
Other includes “ broad - based sales and marketing , product support services , human resources , legal , finance , information technology , corporate development and procurement activities , research and development and other costs , and legal settlements and contingencies , ” including being sued by Real , Novell , Gateway , and IBM , and fined by the European Commission over antitrust violations .
That means that the staggering losses reported for WinCE - - not to mention the Xbox and Zune - - are not the result of huge amounts of technology development or advertising campaigns , but simply because nobody wants to buy them , even when offered at loss leader prices .
How embarrassing !
Sharks with Fricken ’ Laser Beams vs A Rusty Shotgun
Three years before WinCE debuted , Apple ’s Newton was met with initial awe and then disdainful ridicule , when its whole - word handwritten recognition was found to entertainingly compose its own poetry rather than read the subconscious human mind .
Even after Apple improved its ink recognition software , the Newton was derided by Microsoft fans for its “ legendarily unreliable handwriting input system . ”
In contrast , when WinCE appeared it delivered the typical embarrassment of a clumsy Microsoft product launch , and made no effort at all to provide any sort of handwritten recognition .
It was just a PC shoved in a smaller box .
Still , nobody laughed .
A Microsoft press release in 1998 quoted John Hewitt , vice president of equities for Goldman , Sachs & Co. , as saying , " The more we work with Windows CE [ 2.0 ] , the more confident we are that it is the mobile operating system of the future .
Our technology team is impressed with the richness of the system . ”
What WinCE really delivered was an unusable platform which crammed the Windows 95 user interface into a small screen .
It did n’t perform well , had poor battery life , and it was tied to Microsoft ’s own software , particularly Outlook .
However , it was from Microsoft , so the world was assured by leading analysts that it would eventually catch up and overtake any and all competition .
Eventually .
Not Good At Anything
They were wrong .
A decade later , WinCE has only overtaken the competition where there has n't been any competition .
The market abandoned standalone PDAs when the real money turned out to be in mobile phones .
WinCE is n't particularly well adapted for mobile phone use , because Microsoft designed it to suit the needs of a paperback - sized PC .
The mobile phone market is now dominated by Symbian , with Linux in second place .
WinCE only accounts for around 5 % of smartphone mobile sales , which itself is a fraction of the overall mobile market .
Outside of mobiles , there are few other applications well suited to WinCE , and many competing products .
Both Linux and BSD offer free , wide - open alternative platforms , and various commercial embedded systems , such as QNX , offer better performance and specialization for particular purposes .
It ’s no wonder Microsoft is losing so much money down the rat hole of WinCE : it ’s a shotgun approach to solving everything in the " smaller than a breadbox " category with a general purpose solution .
WinCE vs OS X
The previous article OS X vs. WinCE : How iPhone Differs from Windows Mobile compared how Apple ’s approach with OS X differs from Microsoft ’s WinCE .
While the two might look the same on a marketing chart referring to each as a “ scaled down kernel for use in embedded devices , ” the critical difference is that Apple has one portable , universal code base , while Microsoft has to support two entirely different software architectures .
Porting new code to both is a complex task .
For example , to bring .
Net ( the closest equivalent to Cocoa ) to WinCE , Microsoft had to write it from scratch .
For third party developers and users , this may sound like an insignificant detail .
However it matters because managing multiple , differing pools of code is problematic .
That results in shipping delays ( WinCE 5 shipped nearly a year later than planned ) , stability and security problems ( because MS has two entirely different kernels and libraries to bug fix ) , and limits how much new technology MS can deliver at a time .
WinCE is another Windows with all its problems , just in slightly different places .
After a decade of work , it ’s just now approaching the point of being usably complete , and at the same time , entirely obsolete .
In contrast , OS X allows Apple to rapidly port technologies around .
The iPhone jumped out of fantasy land and already incorporates new frameworks Apple has designed for Leopard .
It is n’t a shotgun approach intended to cover any need licensees might imagine , but rather a custom designed , integrated solution for specific applications .
Those advantages are why Apple is able to outmaneuver Microsoft , deliver code on time and with planned features intact , and part of why Apple 's software is n't regarded as a security and stability nightmare .
Inedible Dog Food
Microsoft itself gave up on WinCE after trying to shoehorn it into the Sega Dreamcast and then again in its own Xbox game console .
Further , when putting together Origami , its recent Ultra Mobile PC reference design -- the task WinCE was expressly designed to deliver -- Microsoft also ditched WinCE to use NT .
WinCE does n't even make a particularly good PDA , and has only been able to keep up with the Palm OS because Palm has proven itself to be grossly incompetent .
Just how incompetent ?
The next article will explain : The Egregious Incompetence of Palm

Taiwan 's Quanta , the world 's largest maker of notebook computers , will manufacture an ultra-low - cost laptop developed by Nicholas Negroponte , the chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Media Lab .
Negroponte , who is also chairman of the One Laptop Per Child non-profit group , has said he expects the laptops to be available to governments next year at a price of $ 100 each .
A prototype of the laptop was unveiled at the recent U.N. - sponsored World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) in Tunis .
Under terms of an agreement with One Laptop Per Child , Quanta will devote engineering resources to develop the $ 100 notebook design during the first half of the year , according to a statement issued by the group .
At the same time , Quanta and the non-profit organization will explore the production of a commercial version of the laptop .
One Laptop Per Child did not immediately respond to an e-mail request for additional information .
First Distribution
The first notebooks are expected to hit the market during the fourth quarter of next year , according to the organization .
Representatives say they expect initial orders for the machines to range from 5 million to 15 million units .
Pricing of the Linux - based notebooks is expected to start " near $ 100 " and decrease over time .
One Laptop Per Child said trials of the notebook are planned for China , India , Brazil , Argentina , Egypt , Nigeria , and Thailand , with 1 million notebooks to be shipped to each of these countries .
In addition , the group expects " an additional modest allocation " of the notebooks to be shipped to developers in other countries .
The group did not offer an explanation for the numerical difference between this forecast , which would involve shipments of at least 7 million notebooks , with the forecast that initial shipments could number 5 million units .
Productivity tip : Take more LSD ?!
Matt 78 comments Latest by Reflection
During health class in high school they taught us that taking LSD would make you jump out windows ( y’ know , cuz you think you can fly ) and give you flashbacks .
Here ’s the other side of the story ( from Wired ’s recap of “ LSD : Problem Child and Wonder Drug , an International Symposium on the Occasion of the 100th Birthday of Albert Hofmann ” ) : Steve Jobs told a NY Times reporter that taking LSD was “ one of the two or three most important things he has done in his life . ”
Nobel - prize - winning chemist Kary Mullis told Hoffman that LSD helped him develop the polymerase chain reaction that helps amplify specific DNA sequences .
Kevin Herbert , an early Cisco employee , fought to ban drug testing of technologists at the company because , as he put it , “ When I ’m on LSD and hearing something that ’s pure rhythm , it takes me to another world and into another brain state where I ’ve stopped thinking and started knowing . ”
Hofmann , who ’s still alive , says , “ There is global healing in these compounds which have been used for millennia by indigenous people that have much to teach modern man and modern woman . ”
WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Tuesday that President Bush personally blocked Justice Department lawyers from pursuing an internal probe of the warrantless eavesdropping program that monitors Americans ' international calls and e-mails when terrorism is suspected .
The department 's Office of Professional Responsibility announced earlier this year it could not pursue an investigation into the role of Justice lawyers in crafting the program , under which the National Security Agency intercepts some telephone calls and e-mail without court approval .
At the time , the office said it could not obtain security clearance to examine the classified program .
Under sharp questioning from Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Arlen Specter , Gonzales said that Bush would not grant the access needed to allow the probe to move forward .
This is the first post in my Interviewing the Parallel Programming Idols - Series .
My interview partner today is Joe Armstrong , one of the founding fathers of the Erlang programming language .
He presently works for Ericsson , where he designed the very first version of Erlang ( that was a long time ago in 1986 ) .
He is also co-author of the book on Erlang to date : Concurrent Programming in Erlang .
And soon , we will have the pleasure of having another book from him in association with the Pragmatic Programmers ( this time with him as the main author ) – Programming Erlang : Software for a Concurrent World .
Besides writing books and inventing programming languages , he teaches courses on Erlang , pursued his PhD in computer science , founded one of the first Erlang startups and enjoys his motorcycle .
I wonder where he finds the time to do all that .
😀
But enough with the preface , let ’s start with the interview .
The first five questions are about parallel programming in general :
Michael :
As we are entering the many - core era , do you think parallel computing is finally going to be embraced by the mainstream ?
Or is this just another phase and soon the only people interested in parallel programming will be the members of the high performance community ( once again ) ?
Joe : mainstream yes yes yes – we ’re talking about potentially doubling efficiency on a dual - core quadrupling efficiency on a 4 x core etc .
I have had programs running 18 times faster on a 32 core machine .
This is x 18 – we ’re used to looking for 5 % – 10 % improvements by re-coding parts of our applications not 400 % or 1800 % – this effects all software .
Michael : From time to time a heated discussion evolves on the net regarding the issue of whether shared - memory programming or message passing is the superior way to do parallel programming .
What is your opinion on this ?
Joe : Shared memory systems are impossibly difficult to understand and get right , especially when errors occur .
It ’s bad enough without errors , but with errors it ’s virtually impossible .
If a program holds a lock and is messing around with shared memory and crashes how the heck can the other processes know what it was doing and fix up the errors ?

It ’s bad enough without errors , but with errors it ’s virtually impossible .
If a program holds a lock and is messing around with shared memory and crashes how the heck can the other processes know what it was doing and fix up the errors ?
Transaction memories and pure message passing system suffer from none of these problems .
Michael : From your point of view , what are the most exciting developments / innovations regarding parallel programming going on presently or during the last few years ?
Joe : P2P architectures , distributed hash tables , planet - scale integration of systems things like planet lab etc. P2P architectures , distributed hash tables , planet - scale integration of systems things like planet lab etc .
Things like bit torrent are destroying traditional industries , the spinning jenny destroyed the home yarn spinning industry in the 1770 ’s bit torrent is doing the same thing to the record industry .
It ’s not a question of if it happens it ’s a question of when .
Michael :
Where do you see the future of parallel programming ?
Are there any “ silver bullets ” on the horizon ?
Joe :
Yes – pure message passing infrastructures will solve many problems ( things like amazon simple queue service ) .
This is back to Paul Morisson ’s flow based programming .
Michael :
One of the most pressing issues presently appears to be that parallel programming is still harder and less productive than its sequential counterpart .
Is there any way to change this in your opinion ?
Joe :
It ’s not harder – it ’s hard because the dominant model is locks , threads , shared memory – now that * is* hard .
Pure message passing systems are easy to program and reason about .
It ’s not harder – it ’s hard because the dominant model is locks , threads , shared memory – now that * is* hard .
Pure message passing systems are easy to program and reason about .
The world * is* parallel – we are parallel .
So much for the first part of this interview .
Without further ado , here is the second part about Erlang :
Michael :
What are the specific strengths and weaknesses of Erlang as compared to other parallel programming systems ?
Where would you like it to improve ?
Joe : Strengths :
It was designed for building fault - tolerant systems , so it degrades nicely in the presence of software and hardware failures .
It takes failure seriously .
Processes and failure handling is a defined part of the language and NOT something provided by the OS .
Strengths :

It takes failure seriously .
Processes and failure handling is a defined part of the language and NOT something provided by the OS .
Weakness – distributed Erlang has all - or - nothing security .
It would be better to have different levels of security and capability or trust based security models .
Michael :
If you could start again from scratch in designing Erlang , what would you do differently ?
Joe :
Make modules and code handling higher - order , add introspection .
Add a layer of contracts for asserting properties of protocols .
Make protocols into first - class citizens in the programming language .
Make a trust / capably layer for distributed computing .
Also make layers for weakly - connected distributed systems .
Distributed Erlang is only for cluster - like computing with strong security .
Michael :
Are there any specific tools you would like to recommend to people who want to program in Erlang ?
IDEs ?
Editors ?
Debuggers ?
Profilers ?
Correctness Tools ?
Any others ?
Joe :
No – 95 % of all the fun can be had with the compiler alone .
Then people get very religious about their IDE ’s etc .
Me , I use emacs and make and xterm .
There are pointy clicky things which some people love but I can’t speak about these from personal experience .
Michael : Please share a little advice on how to get started for programmers new to Erlang !
How would you start ?
Any books ?
Tutorials ?
Resources on the internet ?
And where is the best place to ask questions about it ?
Joe : Books – ( shameless plug ) read my Books – ( shameless plug ) read my new book – it will be coming out really soon .
Tutorials : www.trapexit.org
Distribution : www.erlang.org
Questions : erlang mailing list ( sign on at www.erlang.org)
Michael :
What is the worst mistake you have ever encountered in a Erlang program ?
Joe : Programs without documentation – I hate it when people say “ read the code ” – the code is the * solution * to a problem – by reading the code I have to * guess * what the problem was , and this is error prone .
I like to be
told what the problem was , not guess .
Programs without documentation – I hate it when people say “ read the code ” – the code is the * solution * to a problem – by reading the code I have to * guess * what the problem was , and this is error prone .
I like to betold what the problem was , not guess .
So the worst mistake was when I wrote a multi-page comment to explain some particular tricky point in a program only to find that in a later version somebody had removed the entire comment .
Michael :
Thank you very much for the interview !
As a child , I went with my parents , aunts , uncles and cousins to the woods to find our annual harvest of wild mushrooms each spring .
Sometimes we would find one or two – other times , we ’d find grocery bags full .
We ’d soak them in salt water , and fry them in flour and butter .
A true delicacy .
The methods for finding mushrooms could be categorized by certain scientific phenomena .
Yes , there are several natural world phenomenon that occur with the finding of mushrooms – such as :
Â· The lilacs begin to bloom
Â· The dandelions in your yard first begin to go to seed
Â· The oak leaves are the size of mouse ears
Â· The may apples have developed their leaves
Â· The Jack in the pulpit begins to appear
Â· The Dutchman ’s breeches are flowering
Mireille Guiliano refers to gathering mushrooms in her book , French Women Do n’t Get Fat .
Today , you can buy fresh morel mushrooms for over $ 50 per pound .
But buying them is just not the same .
The fun is in the hunt for morel mushrooms .
How do you find mushrooms ?
How do you know what to look for ?
I know that many of you would n’t even dream of trekking out in the woods to collect what could be a poison mushroom .
But I ca n’t imagine letting a yellow sponge mushroom lay there , uneaten .
The taste of a gray sponge mushroom , or a snakehead mushroom is something I can barely live without in the spring .
But finding mushrooms is hard work – they are very difficult to find in the woods under dead leaves , brush , nettles and fallen trees .
Many hours of walking through the woods often leaves you empty - handed .
You would think the frustration of the wild mushroom ’s elusiveness would discourage us from trying to find them .
I think it is their mystery ( and their taste ) , and not the “ agricultural form of gathering ” that makes finding wild mushrooms so appealing .
But , if you ’ve found one once in your life – especially as a child – the mushroom will forever call your name .
I ’m not encouraging you to go out and find them by yourself – take an expert with you .
But first , let me explain that finding them is not an exact science – it ’s still quite a mystery .
But to be honest , I have found mushrooms when none of the above was occurring .
For this reason , I think that finding mushrooms is more mystical than scientific .
Here ’s what I mean :
When I follow a fellow hunter , I usually stay behind about 10 steps .
Sometimes , I find mushrooms that the person in front did not see .
This phenomenon is called “ popping up . ”
The conditions are so right for mushrooms that they are literally popping up in front of your eyes .
At this point , we usually turn around , and head back to search the area we just covered , only to find mushrooms where there were none before .
Every mushroom has a twin – my Mom would find one , and tell me to draw a line from that spot , 360 degrees to find the other one .
There it would be — lined up in a perfectly straight line from the first one .
My family swears by the north facing hills – but I ’ve heard others that only find mushrooms on south facing hills .
Apple trees , for us always yield a strong crop of mushrooms .
And that brings me to “ where to look . ”
We can point to numerous places we identify as where to look :
Â· In old apple orchards
Â· On south - facing slopes
Â· On north - facing slopes
Â· Around dead elms
Â· Near dead trees
Â· Near dead trees that still have bark clinging to them
Â· In sandy soil
Â· In soil with a high Ph value
Â· In soil with a low Ph value
Â· Near old sawmills
Â· Near wood piles
Â· In river bottoms
Â· On high ground
Â· At burn sites
Â· Near railroad beds
Â· Under cottonwoods
Â· Under poplars
Â· Under tulip poplars
Â· Under Douglas fir
Â· Under ash trees
Â· Under oak trees
Â· Under Hawthorn trees
Â· In may apple patches
And once you ’ve found a spot — the mushroom hunters never share it .
It ’s secret they have earned .
However , despite all the logic of the best places to look , my husband found a yellow sponge at the suburban soccer field where our son plays a game every Sunday .
And , I knew it was a match made in heaven when I learned that my husband , too , as a child , found mushrooms .
The ground ’s wet — I see green .
I ’ll be looking for mushrooms today .

Mars rover unperturbed by potential software disaster .
NASA / JPL / Cornell Sprit 's winter panorama of the martian landscape .
Click here to see enlarged image .
Mars rover Spirit has quietly survived its own version of the millennium bug during its winter break .
Spirit 's software ticked over to sol 1000 ( that 's 1,000 martian days — each lasting 24 hours , 39 minutes , 35 seconds ) without a hitch earlier today .
Scientists scrambled to perform emergency software upgrades earlier this year for Spirit and its sibling Opportunity when it looked as if they would overrun their three - digit day - counter .
Opportunity 's software will pass the 1,000 mark in 20 sols time .
Both Rovers were built to last 90 sols .
No one expected them to live ten times as long , says project scientist Bruce Banerdt at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California .
Spirit has enjoyed a vista over the rugged martian terrain while waiting for spring .
As the days get longer it will soon have enough solar energy to start work .
Right now the Sun is between Mars and Earth , making it difficult for scientists to contact the rovers .
To keep the rovers active , they have been set a range of repetitive tasks — storing or transmitting data — until they come back into range .
Not all of Spirit 's software has been used through the winter , but despite their age and potential frailty , there are no plans to pension off the rovers just yet .
Banerdt 's team is still working every day to do as much science as possible .
" I guess it 's like when people get older , " says Banerdt , " Most elderly people I know are n't worrying every day whether they are going to keel over . "

Facebook SEATTLE 
High - security driver 's licenses aimed at letting U.S. citizens return from Canada without a passport could be adopted elsewhere if Washington state 's experiment works , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said .
The pilot project , signed into law by Gov. Chris Gregoire and formally approved by Chertoff on Friday , calls for Washington to begin issuing new " enhanced " driver 's licenses in January .
They will look much like conventional driver 's licenses , but will be loaded with proof of citizenship and other information that can be easily scanned at the border .
Radio frequency ID chips and other advanced security features also would make the enhanced licenses less vulnerable to forgery .
At about $ 40 , they also would be less expensive than a $ 97 passport .
Chertoff 's endorsement of the pilot project comes as border states prepare for new federal security requirements mandating a passport for travelers — including U.S. citizens — who enter the country by sea or land from elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere .
That requirement is expected to take effect between early 2008 and mid-2009 ; a similar rule for air travelers already is in force .
Washington state officials are particularly sensitive to the new rule because of the extensive tourist traffic between the state and neighboring British Columbia , home of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver .
Chertoff praised the enhanced driver 's license project , and said he expects other border states to follow Washington 's lead .
" I 'm quite sure other states that want to use the same technology and the same approach will be welcome to do so , " he told a news conference .
" The whole idea here is giving a series of alternatives , as long as they meet the same basic standards . "
Gregoire , a Democrat , said the enhanced ID 's security features also could help combat identity theft .
" It is security for our nation and our state .
But it 's also security for the individual , " she said .
The enhanced licenses will not be mandatory for Washington drivers .
Those who want to get the enhanced version will go through an in - person interview , and will have to show proof of citizenship , Gregoire adviser Antonio Ginatta said .
State and federal officials are still working out details about whether particular crimes would prevent a person from getting the enhanced license , Ginatta said .
Along with being less expensive , the enhanced licenses will be available faster than the six - to - eight - week wait for a passport , Gregoire said .
Canada does not have similar passport requirements for U.S. travelers heading north .
But Stockwell Day , Canada 's public safety minister , said Canadian officials share the security concerns that prompted the new rules .
" Nine - eleven was an event of horrendous proportions that has certainly galvanized us , " Day said Friday .
" Canadians also died in those towers . "

The War on Terror Is the Leading Cause of Terrorism
The project has caused divisions within the Hualapai tribe
Rising 4,000 ft ( 1,220 m ) from the canyon 's floor and 70ft ( 20 m ) beyond its rim , the Skywalk is being described as an engineering first .
The Hualapai Indians , who own the site , are hoping to attract visitors to a high unemployment area .
But some tribal members say this is a desecration of sacred ground .
Former astronaut Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin was among the first to go onto the walkway to join Hualapai leaders for a brief ceremony .
" I felt wonderful , not exactly floating on air ... but a vision of hope for the future , " he said afterwards , quoted by Reuters news agency .
The BBC's Andy Gallacher , who also went on the Skywalk , says the glass beneath his feet was so clear it was like walking on a cloud .
" It 's going to go down in the history books but I 'm not sure I will walk out on it , " said Joan Stewart , a bookmaker from Las Vegas .
Construction of the Skywalk began in March 2004 - and will open to the public on 28 March with 120 people allowed on the platform at any one time .
Visitors will have to pay $ 25 ( around £ 13 ) to use the gangway , on top of the fee for entering the national park .
The bridge will be able to sustain winds in excess of 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) , as well as an 8.0 - magnitude earthquake within 50 miles ( 80.5 km ) .
Las Vegas businessman David Jin raised the money to build the Skywalk which was given to the Hualapai in exchange for a percentage of the profits .
" When we have so much poverty and so much unemployment , we have to do something , " Sheri Yellowhawk , told the Associated Press news agency .
" It sounded like a good idea . "
Our correspondent says that , for the majority , this is an investment that will bring much needed cash .
But some members of the Hualapai tribe have voiced concerns that the project will disturb sacred lands .
" When that Skywalk came about it hit me like I was being stabbed , " said Dolores Honga , a tribal elder .

Last night , US federal air marshalls shot dead Rigoberto Alpizar on American Airlines Flight 924 in Miami , after he apparently claimed he had a bomb in his bag .
There are a number of remarkable similarities between this incident and the one involving Jean Charles de Menezes , who was shot by police in London in July :
1. Both men are originally from Latin America ( Menezes from Brazil , Alpizar from Costa Rica ) .
Presumably , both men ’s darker skin and hair meant they could have been superficially mistaken for Arabs .
2 . Both men were thought to have been carrying explosives .
3. Neither of them actually were .
4 . Both were killed in areas of public transport .
Menezes in a subway , Alpizar at an airport .
5 . Both were said to have been fleeing law enforcement .
UK officials stated Menezes jumped a turnstile , ran from police and refused orders to stop , so they shot him .
US officials state that after Alpizar exited the plane and ran onto the tarmac , he refused an order to lie down and reached into his bag , so they shot him .
In the case of Menezes , it turned out that UK officials initially lied about several parts of the story .
Menezes paid the fare , descended the escalator normally , and then ran to catch the train to avoid missing it .
He was then captured , pinned down , and killed .
The discrepancies between official statements and actual events , including the false claim he was wearing a heavy jacket too warm for the weather at the time , turned the incident into a scandal for British police .
Will scandal become the next thing these situations have in common ?

In the magazine this month , we have an amazing first - person account of getting deep brain stimulation surgery .
What 's that ?
Well , I 'm glad you asked .
Deep brain stimulation surgery is a relatively new procedure where doctors insert electrodes into the middle of your brain so they can continually give small jolts of electricity to a specific area .
In many brain maladies , there 's just a tiny part of your gray matter that has gone haywire , and is lighting up with all kinds of random electrical flare - ups .
The stimulators target this area and somehow make things better .
They 're not really sure exactly how :
It 's unclear if the stimulation reduces the errant shocks , or if it helps the shocks get bigger and become more normal .
All they know is that it seems to work .
It turns out anything that involves bad brain activity can be treated this way .
Brain stimulators are now being used for everything from epilepsy to depression to eating disorders .
They just spot the neural firestorms with CT scans , run some wires into that area , and zap !
Steven Gulie had this surgery for Parkinson 's Disease , and he recounts the tale like the geek he is ( he 's a technical writer at Apple ) .
It 's a joy to listen to him dissect what 's happening to him .
He even narrated a slideshow of the whole thing .
It 's pretty amazing .
Check it out .
Of course , Wired has a celebrated tradition of stories by and about people getting things jacked into their brains .
Some memorable ones :
John Donoghue created a brian implant that lets paralyzed patients control a cursor with their minds .
Michael Chorost went all experimental with his cochlear implant in an effort to once again be able to hear the masterpiece Bolero .
And of course there 's the story of William Dobelle , who plugged a computer into a blind man 's head , and , well , allowed that man to see again .
Then Dobelle let the man drive his car .
Guy Goma faced questions about the Apple vs Apple court case
Watch the interview
Guy Goma , a graduate from the Congo , appeared on the news channel in place of an IT expert after a mix - up .
But Mr Goma , who was wrongly identified in the press as a taxi driver , was really at the BBC for a job interview .
Mr Goma said his appearance was " very stressful " and wondered why the questions were not related to the data support cleanser job he applied for .
The mix - up occurred when a producer went to collect the expert from the wrong reception in BBC Television Centre in West London .
This has turned out to be a genuine misunderstanding
BBC spokeswoman
After being pointed in Mr Goma 's direction by a receptionist , the producer - who had seen a photo of the real expert - checked : " Are you Guy Kewney ? "
The economics and business studies graduate answered in the affirmative and was whisked up to the studio .
Business presenter Karen Bowerman , who was to interview the expert , managed to get a message to the editor that the guest seemed " very breathless and nervous " .
Mr Goma was eventually asked three questions live on air , assuming this was an interview situation .
It was only later that it was discovered that Mr Kewney was still waiting in reception - prompting producers to wonder who their wrong man was .
' Happy to return '
Mr Goma said his interview was " very short " , but he was prepared to return to the airwaves and was " happy to speak about any situation " .
He added that next time he would insist upon " preparing myself " .
A BBC spokeswoman said : " This has turned out to be a genuine misunderstanding .
" We 've looked carefully at our guest procedures and will take every measure to ensure this does n't happen again . "
The Creation of the UNIX * Operating System
After three decades of use , the UNIX * computer operating system from Bell Labs is still regarded as one of the most powerful , versatile , and flexible operating systems ( OS ) in the computer world .
Its popularity is due to many factors , including its ability to run a wide variety of machines , from micros to supercomputers , and its portability -- all of which led to its adoption by many manufacturers .
Like another legendary creature whose name also ends in 'x , ' UNIX rose from the ashes of a multi-organizational effort in the early 1960s to develop a dependable timesharing operating system .
The joint effort was not successful , but a few survivors from Bell Labs tried again , and what followed was a system that offers its users a work environment that has been described as " of unusual simplicity , power , and elegance .... "
The system also fostered a distinctive approach to software design -- solving a problem by interconnecting simpler tools , rather than creating large monolithic application programs .
Its development and evolution led to a new philosophy of computing , and it has been a never - ending source of both challenges and joy to programmers around the world .

Going Over The Tipping Point
A couple of months ago , as my debut on 3 Quarks Daily , I wrote about my frustrating experience of being the intended victim of an apartment rental scam on Craig 's List .
You can read that piece , entitled Web of Lies , here .
Of course , the crooks have n’t been stopped yet .
Last I heard the other Beth Ann Bovino has moved to Arizona and cut the rent price , since the apartment had been sitting “ empty on the market ’ ” for some time .
That ’s not surprising .
What is surprising , and amazing , is how the story spread so rapidly across the country , enough to catch the attention of regulators .
The morning after it was posted , the Daily News called and asked to interview me about my problem .
I agreed and spoke with a journalist on the phone that day .
She even sent a photographer by to take my picture .
I happened to be dressed up that day , and got ready for my close - up with a big smile .
I was asked to stop , given the seriousness of my situation .
OK , I can do that , and I frowned .
The next morning my frown appeared on the cover of the Daily News .
I thought I ran through my 15 minutes of fame and then some .
But the story reached its boiling point .
It cascaded into huge headlines nationwide .
National Fox News asked to have me on their 8 AM show that day .
Associated Press interviewed me over the phone .
Another TV network came in for an interview .
After over four interviews that morning , I declined local Fox News .
They showed up at my office anyway , interrupted a meeting and pleaded that I comply .
They said I have been on the news all day and that they had to have an interview .
Choosing between sitting in an interoffice meeting or staring in the news , I did the interview .
They sent TV crew to the apartment in question , which was my old home as I recently moved .
Some asked that I leave work so that they could get a picture of me in front of my ( old ) home .
My name even made it to the 1010 WINS ( radio ) news loop , in between traffic updates .
I was told that my name and issue was raised during a Press Conference with Craig ’s List , which was now under investigation because of the event .
Inside Edition both called and wrote asking for an interview to use in their investigation into Craig ’s List .
Ms. Jordan Lite , the Daily News reporter who first covered the story , said that it ’s “ a classic New York story ( real estate , aggressive renters ) with a modern - day ( cyber ) twist ” , and that she would n’t be surprised if it got more attention .
It did .
It was linked to many other web sites , blogs and received countless local and national TV and radio attention , possibly some international press .
People called my office or emailed my office to give advice .
Sitting at a restaurant in the Miami airport , someone asked me if I caught the crooks .
In upstate New York for the weekend I heard “ Oh !
You ’re the girl that ... ”
How did it spread so quickly ?
The surprising impact of Web of Lies was likely an example of a social epidemic proposed in Malcolm Gladwell ’s The Tipping Point .
The word " tipping point " comes from the study of epidemiology , and refers to that moment in an epidemic when a virus reaches critical mass .
It 's the moment where the line on the graph starts to shoot straight upwards .
Web of Lies hit Gladwell ’s tipping point and quickly spread .
It received over 12,000 hits in the first hour posted , and soon after , received about several hundred hits per MINUTE .
It received over 70,000 hits in 3 days .
To give some perspective , a recent PEW / Internet report said that about one in five bloggers ( 22 % ) have fewer than ten hits a day in blog traffic , and 17 % say they have 10 to 99 hits on a typical day .
Just 13 % have more than 100 hits a day .
In contrast , Web of Lies spread so quickly , that within 36 hours it reached national headlines .
In other words , the line on the graph shot through the roof , much like a virus turned epidemic .
Gladwell explains that ideas and behavior and messages sometimes behave just like outbreaks of infectious disease .
He compares it to an epidemic of measles in a kindergarten class , saying how “ one child brings in the virus .
It spreads to every other child in the class in a matter of days .
Within a week or so , it completely dies out and none of the children will ever get measles again . ”
In this sense , they are seen as social epidemics .
The virtue of an epidemic , after all , is that just a little input is enough to get it started , and it can spread very , very quickly .
Even more fascinating was how Gladwell explains the three criteria that diseases must meet in order to become an epidemic .
This lends itself , by analogy , to practically every change initiative , such as social ones .
The three criteria are :
The Law of the Few : A few people doing something different start and incubate the epidemic .
These people , who Gladwell calls “ mavens ” are the ones who rub two sticks together in such a way that they improbably catch fire .
Incubation also requires “ connectors ” .
These are people with contact to a lot of people , enough to get the idea out into other communities and networks .
They are the ones who move in different circles , so that the epidemic reaches escape velocity and spreads , much like HIV or SARS .
The Stickiness Factor :
This allows the epidemic to endure long enough to “ catch ” , or to become contagious or “ memorable ” .
Ways to make something sticky include repetition , hooks and triggers and an understanding of the message , some kind of story , and suspense .
In other words , ways of “ packaging to make it irresistable ” .
The Power of Context :
This requires that the physical , social and group environment must be right to allow the epidemic to then suffuse through the population .
A concentration camp environment , for example , will change human behavior at epidemic speed .
In a less austere environment , harsh rules and codes will not be as effective .
The success Web of Lies had in reaching such a large audience was likely because it met these three criteria .
To begin with , the story had an inherently sticky message that resonated with many .
People who had received numerous emails from scammers with the SUBJECT : URGENT !!!
in the header would undoubtedly identify with the story .
Moreover , given the popularity of “ whodunit ” TV show ; someone trying to crack his or her own case would certainly be very appealing to many .
The audience would essentially be “ hooked ” .
The story caught the eye of a few early enthusiastic readers , likely within the blogospere , who incubated the story .
It spread by connectors , such as digg.com and other web sites , which spread the message to other communities .
Each new group then adapted the message to the group ’s own unique social environment and own social context .
Postings from renters searching for a home in Canada , relay operators handling phone calls for the deaf , or those fighting consumer fraud online indicate that the story reached across social circles .
Together they may explain why the story spread far enough that I could be recognized in a small town a few hours north of New York City .
The original internet real estate scam likely meets the same criteria as well .
What is amazing , and what he makes clear , is how frequently this pattern can be seen .
Gladwell notes a number of positive epidemics , such as Sesame Street that started a learning epidemic in preschoolers , turning them onto reading and “ infected ” them with literacy .
To a much smaller degree , the impact from readers of the Web of Lies would be considered a “ positive ” social epidemic in that readers then pushed for change .
Of course , there are also social epidemics that have destroyed , he mentions the spread of teen suicides in Micronesia , for example , or the rash of mass shootings at schools and elsewhere .
The wave of internet crimes , costing hundreds of millions of dollars yearly , would lie here .
In the end , his book attempts to show people how to start positive epidemics of their own , and , hopefully , help wipe out those that could destroy .

The UK is covertly trying to oust the head of the world 's main anti-bribery watchdog to prevent criticism of ministers and Britain 's biggest arms company , BAE , the Guardian has learned .
The effort to remove Mark Pieth comes as his organisation has stepped up its investigation into the British government 's decision to kill off a major inquiry into allegations that BAE paid massive bribes to land Saudi arms deals .
British diplomats are seeking to remove Professor Pieth , a Swiss legal expert who chairs the anti-corruption watchdog of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , claiming he is too outspoken .
At the OECD meeting in Paris last month , British officials tried to stop Prof Pieth addressing a press conference at which he announced his agency was to conduct a formal inquiry into the government 's decision to terminate the BAE investigation .
They then privately briefed other diplomats involved with the OECD , saying he should be removed .
When that failed , the campaign against him continued unabated with further back - channel complaints .
But concern about the conduct of the British diplomats filtered back to Prof Pieth , who confirmed yesterday that he was aware of the attempts to remove him .
" I am aware that the British ambassador was asking at the time for action to be taken against me , " he said .
Prof Pieth refused to elaborate , but he is understood to be privately furious at the way he has been bad - mouthed .
A source at the OECD added : " The UK 's representatives were sent to Paris to emasculate the [ watchdog ] and ensure they did not say anything publicly .
They failed and were not pleased .
They behaved in a manner that would not have been out of place in a boxing ring . "
In recent weeks the UK has demanded that OECD officials should be prevented from making any future statements about the BAE case while the inquiry is ongoing .
But the request has hit a brick wall .
An OECD source said : " The British do not have support from anyone else on this . "
The director general of the OECD , Angel Gurría , also believes the UK is encouraging a smear campaign against him .
Last Friday he was accused in a British magazine of giving a job to his daughter , getting free football tickets , and spending  733,000 ( £ 500,000 ) to refurbish his Paris flat in what was described as " the poshest bit of the swanky 16th arrondissement " .
The article in the Economist quoted an unnamed north European ambassador expressing fears that " the staid old body [ OECD ] ... may drift into dangerous waters " under Mr Gurría , the former finance minister of Mexico .
Following the allegations , Mr Gurría issued a combative statement , saying that he was under UK media attack by " innuendo , gossip and partial truths " .
" It is no surprise that this attack occurs at this time , " he added .
Britain's ambassador to the OECD , David Lyscom , admitted yesterday that he had talked off the record to the Economist but added : " The UK had absolutely nothing to do with planting the story . "
The UK partly controls OECD purse - strings , and also has the power to veto Prof Pieth 's reappointment , due next January .
Sensitivity over the OECD inquiry has become more acute since its 36 - strong panel announced last month detailed plans to mount a fresh official inspection of Britain because of the manner in which the BAE inquiry had been halted .
It also rebuked the UK for failing to keep its promises to modernise its inadequate corruption laws , under which no one has yet been prosecuted .
The UK also faces a legal challenge in London .
Two campaign groups , the anti-corruption group The Cornerhouse and the Campaign Against the Arms Trade , filed detailed pleadings last week alleging that Britain had broken the treaty banning corrupt payments by companies to foreign politicians and officials .
Evolution and Human Behavior
Changing perceptions of attractiveness as observers are exposed to a different culture
Abstract
Volume 27 , Issue 6 , November 2006 , Pages 443-456 Martin J. Tovée et al .
It has been suggested that certain physical cues can be used to predict mate quality and that sensitivity to these cues would therefore be adaptive .
From this , it follows that in environments where the optimal values for these features differ , the attractiveness preferences should also be different .
In this study , we show that there are striking differences in attractiveness preferences for female bodies between United Kingdom ( UK ) Caucasian and South African Zulu observers .
These differences can be explained by different local optima for survival and reproduction in the two environments .
In the UK , a high body mass is correlated with low health and low fertility , and the converse is true in rural South Africa .
We also report significant changes in the attractiveness preferences of Zulus who have moved to the UK .
This suggests that these preferences are malleable and can change with exposure to different environments and conditions .
Additionally , we show that Britons of African origin , who were born and who grew up in the UK , have exactly the same preferences as our UK Caucasian observers .
These results suggest that humans have mechanisms for acquiring norms of attractiveness that are highly plastic , which allow them to track different ecological conditions through learning .
The next time you log onto a dating site , you might want to add “ mysterious ” to your list of desired traits , because the less you know about a potential mate the better .
A new study of romantic relationships finds that as online daters got to know another person over time , their initially sweet notions turned sour .
The researchers suggest that inflated expectations can lead to major disappointments when daters meet in person .
Once a flaw is spotted , the whole date is tainted .
Fantasies vanishing with knowledge is a process that hits women harder than men , said Michael Norton of Harvard Business School and one of the study 's authors .
“ On online dates , women are much , much more disappointed than men , " Norton said .
Women put more stock in the virtual dating world because they seek a soul mate , he said , whereas men are typically after a more casual relationship .
It 's not that familiarity always breeds contempt , the researchers say .
But on average , as you learn more about any lover , the less likely it is that you will click and get along with them , Norton explained .
The Top 10
Online dating 101
Norton and his colleagues , including Dan Ariely of MIT and Jeana Frost of Boston University , initiated the study with the help of online dating services like eHarmony and Match.com , though he refused to say which specific ones .
“ We were working with a couple of online dating companies who were finding that their users got very unhappy very quickly with online dating .
And the question was why , ” Norton said .
To find out , they showed each of 304 online daters , average age 34 , a grab - bag of anywhere from one to 10 traits randomly culled from more than 200 characteristics gathered from real online daters .
Each online participant rated how much they liked their potential date , as well as which traits they would also use to describe themselves .
Participants gave much lower ratings to potential dates and also perceived less similarity with them when they were shown greater , rather than fewer , numbers of traits .
The results are detailed in the January issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
More evidence
Two additional experiments backed up this finding .
In one , scientists asked each of 190 students to complete a Web - based survey in which they were shown 10 traits , one at a time .
After seeing each trait , subjects would indicate whether that trait also described them .
The first trait had a negative amplifying effect , the scientists found .
If subjects said the first trait failed to describe them , they were more likely to say the same of subsequent traits presented to them .
The opposite was found if the first trait got a positive score .
“ Inevitably , I ’m going to find something we do n’t agree on .
And as soon as I find that one thing , then things start to cascade so everything else I learn about you suddenly now feels like more evidence that we are dissimilar and we do n’t get along , ” Norton said .
“ Once you start this process of saying , ‘ Ah , it ’s not going well , ’ it ’s like an avalanche basically , ” Norton said .
In the second reinforcing experiment , scientists surveyed two groups of online daters .
Subjects in one group answered questions about an upcoming date .
The other subjects answered questions about a past date .
These results also showed that getting to know a person is a real downer for romance .
The scores given to pre-dates were much higher than those for post - dates .
And the perceived degree of similarity between participants and dates also took a dive after face - to - face encounters .
Fantasy date ?
Online profiles inherently provide limited pictures of people , a level of vagueness that is fuel , Norton said , for love - seeking imaginations .
“ Because people so much want to find somebody , we find that they read into the profile .
They kind of see that person as a good match for them , and that they have a lot in common , ” Norton told LiveScience .
“ And when they finally meet in person , they find out it ’s just a regular person like everybody else .
They end up being disappointed again . ”
Little white lies add to the inflated expectations .
“ One of the reasons people are so optimistic when they read these things is because everybody kind of shades their profile a little bit more positive then maybe it should be , ” Norton said .
A separate recent study of four dating sites — Match.com , Yahoo Personals , American Singles and Webdate — revealed common fibs in the name of love .
Profiles were corroborated with real - life measurements of a sample of users .
About half of the men lied about their height , adding at least a half inch to their stature , while more than 60 percent of all participants skewed their weight by five pounds or more .
Match tips
Norton and his colleagues are developing ways for online daters to stay grounded in reality as they navigate the virtual world of romance .
In one study , Frost , the MIT researcher , designed an online interface in which people meet for “ virtual dates . ”
For instance , you and a prospective date would each play an avatar and wander through an art gallery together .
Though it ’s nowhere near an in - person encounter , Norton said you can get a feel for whether the person is funny or a good listener .
“ People also will use their avatars to flirt so you can go a little closer or a little farther away , ” Norton said .
The main message from the group ’s study , Norton said , is that people should realize that the rules for online dating and real - world dating are the same .
In the real world , “ You ’re accustomed to it being difficult to find people ; you ’re accustomed to meeting people and not really clicking , ” Norton said .
“ Do n’t assume that because you log onto a Web site and there are all these options that it ’s going to be any easier . ”

Scientists claim to have developed a male contraceptive that not only offers 100 per cent protection , but also has no side effects .
But what will it do to the body and can it really be compared with the female Pill ?
We investigate .
What 's in it ?
It consists of a synthetic form of the female hormone progestogen , as well as a separate dose of the male hormone testosterone .
How does it work ?
The progestogen shuts down the production of sperm in the testes .
Each sperm has a lifespan of 70 days from production , so the treatment must be taken for three months before it will be effective .
How is it taken ?
In the most recent Australian trials the progestogen is given as an injection every three months .
The testosterone is given as an implant which is renewed every three months .
In the UK , tests have been carried out using testosterone and progesterone - the hormone from which progestogen is made - implants .
So far they have not been combined as researchers are still trying to perfect the dose individually before they unite them in a single treatment , delivered as a pill .
The female Pill is normally given in tablet form that has to be taken at roughly the same time each day .
Does it affect libido ?
Traditionally male ' Pills ' have substantially reduced sex drive which has discouraged many men from wanting to take it .
But in this case it does not appear to be true and the additional testosterone injection or implant helps maintain normal sex drive .
Indeed , volunteers who tried the latest combination treatment reported that they found it actually increased their libido .
How effective is it ?
The latest study in Australia found the contraceptive to be almost 100 per cent effective .
However , studies using similar treatment in the UK last year found that it had a 93 per cent success rate at halting sperm production .
The female version is 99 per cent effective .
What are the side effects ?
The latest trials claim that the treatment is 100 per cent clear of side effects , however further research is needed to confirm this .
Without the added testosterone , men could suffer weight gain , moodiness in addition to a reduced sex drive .
What are the main advantages of taking it ?
The research so far suggests that as well as offering almost complete protection against pregnancy , it is also risk free .
An implant will also help reduce the risk of men forgetting to take a daily pill .
Research also suggests that taking it may keep men more youthful - and therefore more attractive to women - as it cuts the production of testosterone , which is thought to contribute to the male ageing process .
How soon is fertility restored after coming off it ?
During the latest trial , full fertility was restored within seven months of coming off the treatment .
This is the time needed for natural testosterone levels to be restored , and the sperm to be produced and mature .
Some women find their normal cycle returns immediately after they stop taking the Pill - but most will be back to full fertility within six to eight weeks .
Who is it best for ?
The treatment is an ideal alternative for any man who already has a family , especially those considering a vasectomy , which is not reversible .
The female Pill is ideal for any age group .
Who is it not suitable for ?
As with the female Pill , it would not be suitable for any man with hormonal problems .
Unlike a condom it will also not offer protection from sexually transmitted disease so may not be appropriate for sexually active men who are not in a long - term relationship .
When will the male pill be available ?
It is hoped that a pill or implants may be available within three to five years .
Fans eagerly await Steve Jobs keynote speeches to hear about the latest and greatest Apple products .
We ’ve compiled a list of five classic keynotes for your enjoyment after the jump .
First Steve Jobs Keynote
Watch as Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh computer during his very first keynote on January 24 , 1984 .
January 24 , 1984 saw the introduction of the Macintosh , the first commercially successful computer with a graphical user interface influenced by Xerox PARC .
The development of the Mac was started by Jef Raskin , and eventually taken over lock , stock , and pirate flag , by Jobs

iBook
Steve Jobs takes us back to May 7 , 1998 with this iMac introduction , which replaced Apple ’s Performa - series .
At the time , Apple was unique in producing all - in - one desktop computers , in which the CPU and the monitor are contained in one enclosure .
Many other PC manufacturers have tried to imitate this , most of which have met with little success

i Pod
For those who still remember or own a first generation iPod , this video clip — of Steve Jobs at the Apple Music Event 2001 — should bring back a few good memories .
Who would have thought that this brick of an MP3 player would soon evolve into a worldwide phenomenon .

Mac OS 9
Apple officially unveiled Mac OS 9 on October 23rd , 1999 , the “ last version of the ‘ Classic ’ Macintosh Operating System ( Mac OS ) released before being succeeded by Mac OS X . ”
Upon introduction , Mac OS 9 was advertised as having “ 50 new features , ” including 128 - bit encryption capabilities and Sherlock 2 .
Codenamed Sonata and originally intended to debut as Mac OS 8.7 , Mac OS 9 is considered by some the most functional version of the original Mac OS
あるプログラミング言語がスケールするか，と聞かれて，とりあえず3つくらいは評価軸があるよな，と思った．私が名前を知っているプログラミング言語を例に挙げてますが，この評価はタダのイメージですので，他の用途に利用する場合は注意してください．
まとめ
というか，それぞれの軸の関係について．
1の問題は処理系を作る人ががんばればいいんですが，やっぱり広く使われている(3の意味でスケールする)言語の方が，バグは出やすいでしょう．でもまあこれはどの程度の信頼性が必要かという，問題の問題でもあります．Rubyでも問題にならない分野があれば，COBOLじゃないととてもやってられない分野もあるということ．
2と3は微妙なところで，2のスケーリング具合が大きければ，開発者の人数は少なくても良いはずなので，2の意味で十分スケールする言語なら3の意味で多少スケールしなかったとしても，全体としてはスケールすると言えるんじゃないかな，とか．
Lispがスケーラブルかとか考えたら，とりあえずこのくらい思いついた．
Much has been made of the therapeutic promise of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) , especially in the treatment and prevention of aging - associated diseases and age - related decline in tissue function .
ESCs are pluripotent , and are thought to be capable of differentiating into any type ( or at least most types ) of somatic cell .
Unlike differentiated cells , ESCs can divide indefinitely , and they maintain this replicative immortality for as long as they retain their pluripotency .
But how do ESCs escape replicative exhaustion and cellular senescence , the internal “ clock ” that prevents the unlimited division of differentiated cells ?
Telomerase expression certainly helps , but it ’s not the whole story : Zeng and Rao review the evidence that differences in epigenetic modifations , damage - response and checkpoint pathways ( as well as telomerase ) influence the ability of ESCs to retain replicative potential indefinitely .
Unlike normal somatic cells , human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) can proliferate indefinitely in culture in an undifferentiated state where they do not appear to undergo senescence and yet remain nontransformed .
Cells maintain their pluripotency both in vivo and in vitro , exhibit high telomerase activity , and maintain telomere length after prolonged in vitro culture .
Thus , hESCs may provide an unlimited cell source for replacement in a number of aging - related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson ’s disease and Alzheimer ’s disease as well as other neurological disorders including spinal cord injuries .
The ability of hESCs to bypass senescence is lost as hESCs differentiate into fully differentiated somatic cells .
Evidence has been accumulated that differences in telomere length , telomerase activity , cell cycle signaling , DNA repair ability , as well as the lack of genomic , mitochondrial and epigenetic changes , may contribute to the lack of senescence in hESC .
In this manuscript , we will review recent advances in characterizing hESCs and monitoring changes in these aspects in prolonged cultures .
We will focus on the potential roles of several cellular pathways including the telomerase , p53 and the Rb pathways in escaping senescence in hESCs .
We will also discuss the genomic and epigenetic changes in long - term hESC culture and their potential roles in bypassing senescence .
On the subject of the value of stem cell research in combating neurodegeneration : A deep bow of respect to Michael J. Fox , currently working to support candidates who advocate federal support for stem cell research , and striking a blow against the ideologically motivated anti-science stance of the current administration .
When well - seasoned programmers get together to speak of the " good old days " , there are a few persistent topics .
There are always at least a couple of archaic programming languages ... depending on the number of reminiscing participants , there can even be enough to inspire a game of " I had it worse than you did ! " .
Inevitably , this is followed by some form of reference to ancient multi-user operating systems , mainframes , or -- although increasingly rare -- systems involving punched cards .
More often then not , this piece of the conversation will lead to discussions of operating ancient editors via terminals -- with ed nearly always starting that conversation ( and earning several grimaces at its first mention ) .
If you 've heard enough of these discussions , as I have , you 've surely observed that the tone of these discussions suggests that we are now in a golden age of development tools ...
I 've been writing software , and hearing these discussions just long enough to start to wonder if these discussions were any different back then ( it 's all relative , is n't it ? ) .
Me ?
Well , I started this game a bit late relative to most of the " good old days " participants I 've observed .
They had Pascal , I had VB5 -- they had ed , I had ... well , VB5 ... they had libraries , I had BBSes , they had printed manuals , I had CD documentation ... the list goes on .
The Beginning
I stumbled into programming during high school ( I 'm excluding the 10 print " derek " , 20 goto 10 fun that so entertained me in grade school ) .
I was responsible for inputting data penned in by customers entering contests , signing up for mailing lists , etc. into a database .
Every time I re-entered the same postal code three times in a row I could feel my brain shrinking .
Within the friendly environment that was VBA ( in Microsoft Access ' 95 ) , I managed to script a form into filling in a few fields for me when encountered with one of the most popular postal codes .
I was hooked -- entering the addresses had been transformed from mind - numbing boringness to a creative exercise in trying so save as many keystrokes as possible .
My initial fondness for VBA ( and Microsoft 's influence on programming curricula in the greater Puget Sound area ) led me to a Visual Basic programming course at a local community college .
I enjoyed it , and it eventually led me to my first programming job ( which really was a web design job , but nobody seemed to mind -- perhaps because I was still in high school , or perhaps because I was making $ 8 / hour ) .
In these early years of my career ( before it was officially my career , I should add ) , there was never a distinction between language , framework or development environment .
My language was Visual Basic , I called Visual Basic functions , and I did all of this using a product called Visual Basic ... the explosion of Active Server Pages brought Visual InterDev along for the ride , and C++ tasks were handled by Visual C++.
There was always a " right " tool for the job .
A Hot Cup of Java
After a couple of years of making ASPaghetti , I started toying with a language called Java .
I use the word " toying " quite intentionally , because at the time my best description of it would have been " language used to make cool buttons on Web pages " .
I had been quite ignorant of the growing Java juggernaut , but our company had recently bought some Oracle licenses ( it was the Dot - Com era , why not ? ) and it seemed to be the language of choice for folks in that camp .
I quickly moved from " toying " to " using " .
For a Visual Basic programmer , Java was like heaven -- actually , Java was heaven .
After two weeks of using it , I was ready to have the " good old days " conversation about old Visual Basic .
Goodbye class modules , hello beans !
One thing that was very different in the Java world , and it was new to me , was choice in environment .
In the Microsoft world ( and this is still true today ) , there was a supported development environment released with the language ... in Java , the tutorials were telling me to set a CLASSPATH environment variable ( bad advice , by the way -- - cp is much less painful , but I digress ) and use the editor of my choice .
Using Notepad was fine for my " First Cup of Java " , but I knew I 'd be needing auto - completion and a " debug toolbar " before long .
My quest for the perfect Java IDE never really finished -- I started with Oracle JDeveloper ( basically an early version of JBuilder ) , and later dabbled with VisualAge , Webgain , Netbeans , JBuilder itself , and just about everything else that came around ...
I never fell in love with any of them , but most were a pretty nice step up from the development tools I had worked with previously .
They all had the basic features I was looking for -- syntax highlighting , intelligent completion , click - to - run , debugging ... none of them stood out , but they were all Good Enough [tm ] .
The Dark Side
There is a dark side of the programming world .
Some are never exposed to it ... some have only had enough exposure to be scared by it .
The dark side consists of a wide network of programmers , about 1 to 2 for every 10 , who throw away the rules .
They run strange operating systems , they spend free time on weekends experimenting with programming languages you 've never heard of ( Hask - what ?
Eif - who ? ) ... and they do n't use the same tools that you do , to say the least .
I remember the first time I witnessed a member of this " dark side " in action .
I had wandered into the cubicle of one of our recent hires , a long - haired " Unix guy " who was in the midst of a rather furious coding session in a very strange looking editor ( Vim , for the curious ) .
Watching him operate his editor was truly an experience .
He was working at a pace I 'd never seen before , his cursor flying around the buffer like a pinball .
I was like a child seeing a magician for the first time ( that hat was empty ! ) .
I rudely interrupted his session -- in part to marvel at his proficiency , but also to ask some questions about his current project .
He walked me through the code he was working on , and the artistry continued -- he seemed able to will his cursor around the buffer with the power of his stare , as if he was simply " thinking it " there .
I 'd never seen anything like it -- he was n't using his editor -- he was his editor .
I was forever changed .
I had seen what the dark side was capable of , and I wanted a membership card .
Going back to my IDE was a depressing affair -- I tried -- and I tried hard , to replicate the genius I 'd just seen .
He had clued me in to a couple of his tricks , which I tried to emulate .
I took a tour through my IDE playground again , trying to find one that would enable me to perform the magic tricks he executed so effortlessly , but I could n't .
I spent a week or so trying to convince myself that all of that " other stuff " in my IDE made up for what it lacked in the editing department .
I was partially successful -- I mean , my debugger sure looked a lot fancier than his ( gdb , for the still curious ) .
That had to count for something .
And that intelligent completion -- surely I could n't live without that , right ?
Right ?
Not exactly ...
I made a conscious effort that week to think about each feature as I used it .
Intelligent completion ?
Sure , it was helping me code , but how much ?
With this in mind , I noticed that I was doing some really idiotic things , like typing n-e and then waiting a ( brief ) moment for the completion window , in some cases using my arrow keys to find the appropriate completion , and selecting it .
This , as opposed to just finishing the keyword ... x-t ... surely , somebody observing from the dark side would be shaking their head at the sight of this .
I had to do better .
My tools were good , maybe even great , but they still were n't good enough .
I Think I Can ...
With the help of a Unix shell account , I decided to take a tour of the dark side .
I did a bit of research ( Have you heard of this fantastic new search engine called Google ?
No , no -- l-e ... yeah , that 's it -- now search for " cigar ! " ) , and found that the dark side was in the midst of a civil war -- the Emacs - folk vs. the Vi(m ) folk .
Oh boy ... I was going to have to choose .
A bit more reading convinced me that what I was seeking ( magical editor powers , that is ) could be achieved with either .
I 'd seen what Vim could do , how about this Emacs thing ?
My first experience with both editors was a disaster ... in Vi , I did finally stumble into the proper mode for getting characters into the buffer , but it was n't a pretty process ( and it certainly was n't intentional ) .
Emacs started out a little better , but I could n't figure out for the life of me how to quit -- control - s? control -q ?
And yeah , the fact that I kept toggling flow control on the terminal certainly did n't help .
Finally , I figured it out -- control -z!
Pressing that makes Emacs go away , problem solved .
Alright , time for some magic tricks !
Oh , and it took a couple of hours before I realized that I was suspending it rather than quitting .
When you 're accustomed to control - q , \ C - x \C -c is a long ways away .
Fortunately , the tutorial ( \ C - ht ) got that out of the way in a hurry .
Armed with some documentation and a bit more time , I ended up giving each editor a fair shake .
In no time , I was moving around buffers pretty well in Emacs -- not exactly comfortable , but reaching for my arrow keys less and less ( not because it made sense to me , but it had been suggested that this was the path to magic , so I figured I 'd try ) .
Vim was starting to become less painful as well , although the mode switching was really causing me to do some amazingly stupid things ( something tells me Vim users all have rigorous backup schedules ) .
in any case -- I figured that to become a magician I would need to focus on one editor , and my laziness led me to Emacs ( sorry Vim , too much early mode pain ) .
Magic Tricks
It really did n't take too long to reach my goal -- I had to re-train a lot ( OK , nearly all ) of my editing instincts , but before long I was performing buffer magic tricks of my own .
By this time , I 'd found other " dark siders " , and I was extracting as much information as I could from them ( " Hey , how'd to swap those characters ? " ) ... each tidbit I picked up , I would force myself to use for a day , and inevitably , I 'd end up using it 100 times the next week , wondering how I ever lived without it .
That 's really the Zen of Emacs .
When I encounter people who see me using Emacs , they typically assume that I use it because of its customizability .
That 's a nice feature , but it 's not the reason to use Emacs .
The Zen part is all there in the base package -- even without a .emacs file ( a Lisp file read at startup used to customize Emacs ) .
The " magic tricks " that turn you into an editing wizard are n't really tricks at all -- they 're core features .
Once you learn these core features , it 's astounding the magic you can do -- and you can do it everywhere .
You can swap arguments in C the same way you swap words in a text file -- you can autofill your comments just like your paragraphs -- rectangle insertion makes block comments as well as it adds a shared prefix -- dynamic abbrevs ( rich , but unintelligent completion ) work everywhere -- and all of this stuff works whether you 're editing C# , Javascript , CSS , Java , XML , Ruby , Lisp , ... the list goes on .
And trust me , these features only sound exotic until you depend on them .
That 's not to say you can't add useful tricks on top of these core features .
The point is , you do n't have to .
I think a lot of people avoid Emacs because of this misunderstanding .
The truth is that Emacs is n't scary -- you do n't need to know a thing about Lisp , Emacs Lisp , or Unix ( Emacs works wonderfully as a native Windows binary ) .
You do n't need to have a .emacs file , you do n't need a PHD in Parenthesis to be a magician .
You do need to give it some time , but it will pay you back .
Emacs does n't seem like much at first .
It takes an hour or two to get the basics down , at which point a new user can probably use it with almost - Notepad - level efficiency .
It takes a lot more time to get to the next level , but once you do , you can't go back .
I remember explaining to an early Emacs user how much I loved prefixed arguments ( numeric arguments to alter command behavior ) .
He laughed at me like I was joking .
I mean , that 's fair -- prefixed arguments do sound like a silly " border feature " if you 've never worked with them before .
And hey , it took me a while to pick up on them .
But now , I use them many times daily .
Stretch Yourself
Another thing you get with Emacs is flexibility .
Have you ever wanted to experiment with a new technology , but avoided it because you were too comfortable in your existing programming environment ?
Come on -- you saw that Ruby on Rails screencast , right ?
If you 're an Emacs user , you can be writing C# on Windows Monday , Ruby on Mac OS Tuesday , and Python on Linux on Wednesday .
In each case , there are language - specific tools to use , but the place you spend the most time -- your editor -- is consistent across tools and platforms .
Virtually all the time you invested in learning ( and customizing ) the editor comes along for the ride each time .
Emacs lowers the bar .
OK , I know -- you 're not convinced .
You love -- no , you love your IDE .
I 've been there .
How about 5 years ago , though ?
Were you using the same IDE ?
Were you even using the same language ?
Me neither .
How about in 5 years -- do you think you 'll be using the same language ?
The same tool ?
Really ?
If you did switch , how much knowledge from your last development environment transferred ?
You might think that " it does n't matter " -- heck , I probably would have said the same thing reading this 5 years ago ( " bah , I 'll just learn a new IDE when I pick that language up " ) .
It 's difficult to explain how much you can gain from mastering an editor -- you just have to experience it .
Have you ever learned a keyboard shortcut in a program , and wondered how you ever lived without it ?
Gaining proficiency in Emacs is like that feeling times 1,000 .
Emacs is never having to press the same button 5 times in a row .
It 's powerful , even if it does n't sound like it .
After several years of using Java , I needed to switch to C# for a few projects which integrated with native Windows libraries .
My development process hardly changed in the process -- every trick I knew for editing , buffer management , compiling -- it all transferred .
With the recent shift towards standards - based Web- centric applications , and working for a startup , I 'm writing C# , JavaScript , Java , CSS , C++ and XML regularly -- all within the friendly confines of Emacs .
And yes , I 'm writing this blog post in Emacs ( using a custom RELAX NG Compact schema in NXML mode , for the still curious ) .
Emacs Hacks
Getting started with Emacs can be a bit intimidating at first .
It 's a community run by dark - siders , and they have a tendency to assume you 're a rocket scientist .
Wading through the documentation and getting out of the gates is the hardest part ( it was for me -- I 'm not even a model rocket scientist ) .
I 'm going to dedicate a few posts on this blog ( in " hacks " style , sans the book - length depth ) to helping you do just that .
I 'll probably bias it somewhat towards installing and using Emacs on Windows , since it 's quite a bit easier on Linux ( apt - get install emacs21 does n't make for a very interesting blog post ) .
If you 're not convinced -- I understand .
And it does n't bother me at all .
I have nothing against language or environment - specific tools .
I use them all the time -- debuggers , static analysis tools , inspectors , refactorers -- you name it .
You do n't have to dump your IDE -- you can even use them side - by - side if that 's more comfortable for you .
My point is that mastering a flexible editor ( Emacs or otherwise ) can make you a more versatile , more productive developer .
It might even make you a better developer .
No Elisp hacking required .

So it 's the day after the long Thanksgiving weekend and I 'm sitting at my desk at work thinking " Oh man , I wish I was still on vacation " when I hear two of my coworkers discussing Disney women .
Or , more specifically , discussing which Disney cartoon female is the hottest of them all :
And that got me thinking , " you know , there are a lot of hot animated Disney babes !
Surely someone has made a list of them ! " .
But alas , there was no list to be found on the internets .
So yours truly decided to spin some precious cycles trying to crunch the numbers and come up with a list of the finest Disney women of all - time .
The only real requirements for consideration : 1 . She must be a cartoon2 .
She must be , mostly , human ( no cats , mice , etc . ) 3 .
She can not be evil ( only heroines )
So without further ado , here they are .
The all - time hottest Disney babes :

The name you might be looking for is Herman Muller .
Here 's the detail , reworked from a post I wrote at an on - line web forum .
Herman Muller , in 1918 , indicated that an expected result of evolutionary processes was the development of what he called " interlocking complexity " .
Muller was one of the great geneticists of the twentieth century .
He went on to win a Nobel in 1946 for work in mutations .
< http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/1946.html>
Muller 's definition of " interlocking complexity " is exactly the same as the definition of " irreducible complexity " -- a system of mutually independent parts that requires all those parts to be present for the system to work .
However , Muller 's claim is that this is an EXPECTED result of evolution .
Behe took the same definition , and claimed it was IMPOSSIBLE as a result of evolution .
The reason for the difference is basically that Muller was using evolution ; and Behe was using a weird strawman of his own devising .
Behe describes evolution as working by the gradual addition of parts , one by one .
Muller , however , describes evolution as working by gradual modifications of parts .
Muller 's description is the more accurate .
New proteins do n't get added to systems particularly often ; the vast majority of evolution is small modifications to proteins , to alter their amino acid sequence and hence their chemistry .
Behe neglects this entirely ; and hence omits the vast majority of evolutionary change .
The paper is " Genetic Variablity , Twin Hybrids and Constant Hybrids , in a Case of Balanced Lethal Factors " , by Hermann J Muller , in Genetics , Vol 3 , No 5 , Sept 1918 , pp 422-499 .
You can read a scan of the paper online at < http://www.genetics.org/content/vol3/issue5/index.shtml>.
Here is a relevant extract , from pages 463 - 464 of the article :
...
Most present day animals are the result of a long process of evolution , in which at least thousands of mutations must have taken place .
Each new mutant in turn must have derived its survival value from the effect which it produced upon the " reaction system " that had been brought into being by the many previously formed factors in cooperation ; thus a complicated machine was gradually built up whose effective working was dependent upon the interlocking action of very numerous elementary parts or factors , and many of the characters are factors which , when new , where originally merely an asset finally become necessary because other necessary characters and factors had subsequently become changed so as to be dependent on the former .
It must result , in consequence , that a dropping out of , or even a slight change in any one of these parts is very likely to disturb fatally the whole machinery ; ...
The evolution of the blood clotting system can be used as an example to show how this works .
It 's pertinent , as Behe gives this as an example of IC .
A more complete account of how blood clotting cascades can arise is given in The Evolution of Vertebrate Blood Clotting , by Ken Miller , online at < http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/DI/clot/Clotting.html>.
I 'll paraphrase his section " Introducing Complexity " , which gives a simple example of just the process Muller described in 1918 .
First , the core of blood clotting is a " clot - maker " protein , which has a kind of " sticky " section in the middle of the protein , and this is normally covered by smaller chains of amino acids .
Another protein ( a " protease " ) can " activate " the clotting process by clipping off the covering chains of the clot - maker , exposing the central section .
The clot - maker proteins then bind together into a solid mass that makes up the clot .
However , the full process in humans , or any vertebrates , is much more intricate , involving a whole chain of proteins , each of which acts to " activate " the next in a whole chain of activations , ending up with activation of the clot - maker .
The claim of irreducible complexity is basically the claim that removal of any protein from the chain would make the whole process fail .
Here then is an example of how such " irreducible " mutual dependencies can arise by evolution , illustrating the same process described by Muller in 1918 .
Miller 's article goes into more detail and covers stages that I omit in this shorter account .
I am simply focused here on showing the evolution of mutual dependencies , or interlocking complexity .
(A) Start with a system consisting simply of two proteins ; the clot - maker and the protease .
The protease is " activated " by contact with tissue proteins - as would happen when there is a break in a blood vessel .
The activated protease is then able to activate the clot - maker , and the clot is formed .
( B) Now have a gene duplication for the protease .
This is a reasonably common process in evolution ; an entire section of the genome gets doubled ; so that now there are two genes , both producing the same protease protein .
There is no difference to the working of blood clotting ; as all the proteins involved are the same .
(C) Now have a small modification to one of the duplicated genes .
There are now two slightly different forms of the protease .
Call them protease - A and protease - B. Either one would manage fine for blood clotting .
In that sense , the system of three proteins is no longer irreducible ; it has redundancy .
(D) Now suppose that there are mutations to protease - A which give it a capacity to activate protease - B .
That is , both proteins get activated at the break in a vessel by contact with tissue proteins ; but protease - B gets additional activation from the activated protease - A .
This kind of additional activation can have some selective benefits , in speeding up the response of the whole system .
(E) Finally , now that protease - B is activated by protease - A , it no longer depends on activation from the tissue proteins , and further modifications can reduce this activation pathway .
This makes the whole system " irreducible " again , because all three proteins are now required for clotting .
The fundamental point here is that an irreducibly complex core of three proteins can arise from a simpler system by evolutionary changes .
Behe 's argument depends on a strawman of evolution .
Behe ignores the role of modifications to proteins , and bases his argument simply on the problem with getting a system by adding parts one by one .
Miller 's article goes into a lot more detail , describing how the initial two protein system can form , and giving examples of known organisms with functional blood clotting systems that do indeed represent intermediate stages in this kind of development .
Muller did not know the details of blood clotting cascades , but he had already in 1918 correctly anticipated the processes by which a system composed of many mutually interdependent parts would be expected to arise by evolution .

Are you thinking of going seriously green ?
Are you willing to invest some serious money up front in order to reap the benefits in the long run ?
If so , a wind turbine might be the thing for you .
I ’ve installed CFLs and programmable thermostats , but what I ’d really love to do is to be almost exclusively reliant on my own energy production , with the ability to sell excess back to the grid on windy days and pull in a bit of electricity on very still days .
I happen to live in an area where several school districts within an hour ’s drive , as well as a dozen or so individual homeowners , have installed their own Skystream wind turbines for electricity generation .
A Look at the Cost and Benefits of Installing a Windmill
How big are they ?
They stand about forty feet high , tall enough to be well over the roof of a three story home .
In other words , it would roughly be twice as high as the roof on a two story suburban home , for example .
These are tall enough that you have to check around for local zoning issues to see whether or not you can put such a structure in place ( they ’re perfectly fine over almost all of Iowa , for example – I checked ) .
How much power does one generate ?
For a Skystream to be fully functional , you need to live in an area with wind that averages 10 miles per hour or more ; on the Great Plains , this is n’t a problem , as you can see from this wind map of Cedar Rapids , Iowa .
You can easily find wind maps for your own state as well .
Given that , a fully functional Skystream wind turbine produces 1.8 kW of power in a 20 mile per hour wind .
To put that in context , that ’s just under 1,300 kilowatt hours a month .
For comparison ’s sake , we used approximately 600 kilowatt hours of electricity last month – and this included a particularly vicious cold period where temperatures sunk below zero for a period .
What about power excess ?
When you install a home wind turbine , it is hooked up to your power meter directly and power is drawn first from the turbine , then from your normal electricity provider ( the electric company ) .
When the wind is very low , almost all of your power comes from them and your power meter works as normal , recording the kilowatt hours you use from the electric company .
As the wind picks up , more and more electricity comes from the turbine and less and less from the electric company , until a point is reached where all power comes from your turbine .
If the wind blows faster than that ( 10 miles per hour or more ) , then the turbine will produce more energy than your home is consuming .
The rest of it goes onto the electrical grid and helps to power your neighbor ’s homes .
Even better , the electric meter at your home will run in reverse , crediting you for the electricity you supply .
I have a friend who has an electricity credit every single month , more than enough to cover the basic fee of his electrical hookup .
Annually , he receives a small check from the electric company for the credit he has accumulated with them .
Yes , he has no electric bill at all and actually receives a check for it .
What ’s the cost ?
A Skystream 3.7 ( the wind turbine that has been recommended to me and the one I have researched most thoroughly ) costs about $ 8,500 to purchase , install , and set up in my area .
Installation costs in other areas are higher , ranging up to $ 12,000 .
How much can it save a month ?
Let ’s say , hypothetically , that your local rate for a kilowatt hour is $ 0.10 ( the national average is actually $ 0.11 ) .
Let ’s say the turbine works at half - capacity and generates 650 kilowatt hours a month .
Thus , the turbine saves $ 65 per month on your energy bill .
At that rate , you will pay for the turbine with the energy savings in 132 months , or roughly eleven years .
This assumes , of course , no increase in energy rates over that time , it assumes energy costs that are already below the national average , and also assumes a relatively low windspeed compared to what is available to me in northern Iowa .
According to my own math for my area , and also assuming an increase in energy costs that matches inflation , we would be able to pay it off in about seven years .
Are there other benefits ( besides for the environment ) ?
There also may be state tax benefits for installing such a device ; Iowa residents can buy the equipment and pay for the installation with no sales tax and can earn $ 0.01 in credit for each kilowatt hour of energy sold back to the electric company , even if that results in just a reduction of your bill ( please note that this is my understanding of the law – do n’t use this as the basis for an installation ) .
Thus , if you could sell back a few hundred kilowatt hours a month , you would earn a $ 30 or so tax credit each year .
The bottom line is that this is a major step one can take if they ’re really interested in green solutions .
Even better , it can end up paying for itself and more , resulting in not only doing the right thing for the environment , but doing the right thing for your wallet as well .

The Cowen Group reminds me of this piece I wrote about five years ago :
I just got back from lunch with my friend Doug Jacobs .
Doug just got another promotion .
He works for a software company in Indiana , and over the last 14 years , he ’s had a wide range of jobs .
For the first seven or eight years , Doug was in business development and sales .
He handled the Microsoft account for a while , flying to Redmond , Washington , every six weeks or so .
It was hard on his family , but he ’s really focused — and really good .
Two years ago , Doug got a huge promotion .
He was put in charge of his entire division — 150 people , the second - biggest group in the company .
Doug attacked the job with relish .
In addition to spending even more time on the road , he did a great job of handling internal management issues .
A month ago , for a variety of good reasons , Doug got a sideways promotion .
Same level , but a new team of analysts report to him .
Now he ’s in charge of strategic alliances .
He ’s well - respected , he ’s done just about every job and he makes a lot of money .
So , of course , I told him to quit .
“ You ’ve been there a long time , my friend . ”
Doug was n’t buying it : “ Yes , I ’ve been here 14 years , but I ’ve had seven jobs .
When I got here , we were a startup , but now we ’re a division of Cisco .
I ’ve got new challenges , and the commute is great – ”
I interrupted him before he could go on .
I could n’t help myself .
Doug needs to leave for a very simple reason .
He ’s been branded .
Everyone at the company has an expectation of who Doug is and what he can do .
Working your way up from the mailroom sounds sexy , but in fact , it ’s entirely unlikely .
Doug has hit a plateau .
He ’s not going to be challenged , pushed or promoted to president .
Doug , regardless of what he could actually accomplish , has stopped evolving — at least in the eyes of the people who matter .
If he leaves and joins another company , he gets to reinvent himself .
No one in the new company will remember young Doug from 10 years ago .
No , they ’ll treat Doug as the new Doug , the Doug with endless upside and little past .
Let ’s look at it from the perspective of evolution :
Species that evolve the fastest are the ones that do n’t mate for life .
By switching mates , swapping genes with someone new , you continually reshuffle the gene pool , making it more likely you ’ll create something new and neat and novel and useful .
Our parents and grandparents believed you should stay at a job for five years , 10 years or even your whole life .
But in a world where companies come and go — where they grow from nothing to the Fortune 500 and then disappear , all in a few years — that ’s just not possible .
Here ’s the deal , and here ’s what I told Doug :
The time to look for a new job is when you do n’t need one .
The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable .
Go. Switch .
Challenge yourself ; get yourself a raise and a promotion .
You owe it to your career and your skills .
No word back from Doug yet .
How about you ?

President George W. Bush is encouraging Congress to focus on perhaps the most dire issue facing the nation today : the estate tax and its devastating impact on the richest Americans .
Mr. Bush said that repealing the tax could aid tens , even dozens of Americans .
Former FEMA chief and Arabian horse expert Michael Brown has been tapped to reach out to the victims of the tax .

WASHINGTON , DC — President Bush is encouraging members of Congress not to delay in their efforts to improve the fortunes of some of the worst suffering Americans : those devastated by the estate tax .
Mr. Bush said that repealing the tax could aid tens , even dozens of Americans .
A tour of devastated estates planned
President Bush plans to visit Bridgehampton , NY , Aspen , CO and Rancho Santa Fe , CA later this week , where he will tour the mansions of some of the Americans hardest hit by the tax .
Aides to the President say that he will first survey the properties from the air in an effort to assess the impact of the estate tax on landscaping , pool maintenance and fleets of cars .
The death tax earns its name
While the surcharge on wealth is formally know as the “ estate tax , ” over time it has come to be known as the “ death tax ” due to its devastating impact on the nation ’s wealthy .
“ These are people who have been forced to choose between unbelievably expensive works of art and other unbelievably expensive works of art , ” explained one source close to the White House .
“ In the President ’s view , no one should have to do without the necessities of life . ”
A point man appointed
In a sign of just how serious Mr. Bush is about helping victims of the tax , he has tapped former FEMA head Michael Brown to liaise with those most in need of help : the wealthiest 2 % of Americans .
Mr. Brown , known as “ Brownie , ” will join Mr. Bush on the tour of mansions and other properties upon which the estate tax has rained down wrath .
“ He ’s the right person for the job , ” said one source close to Mr. Brown .
“ He feels the pain of these people and he wants to make sure that they get what they need ASAP . ”
On the ground , fois gras and veuve clicquot
Air Force
One will be accompanied by cargo planes loaded with emergency supplies for the mansion occupants .
On its way : individual servings of fois gras , chilled veuve clicquot with champagne flutes and an allotment of truffles for residents who have gone without them for as many as two days .
From Arabian horses to the horsey set
Mr. Brown ’s admirers say that the former rules enforcer of the Arabian horse association should do well in his new position as the Arabian horse is popular among the wealthiest Americans .
Experts say that Mr. Brown will also encounter some similarities between the horses he once oversaw and their owners to whose rescue he will soon be coming .
Both are prized for their gleaming coats and endurance but have suffered mentally as a result of generations of inbreeding .
Has the Bush Administration done enough to ease the suffering of the wealthiest Americans ?

BBC News science and technology reporter in Edinburgh
Recent attempts in the US to try to charge for different levels of online access web were not " part of the internet model , " he said in Edinburgh .
He warned that if the US decided to go ahead with a two - tier internet , the network would enter " a dark period " .
Sir Tim was speaking at the start of a conference on the future of the web .
" What 's very important from my point of view is that there is one web , " he said .
" Anyone that tries to chop it into two will find that their piece looks very boring . "
An equal net
The British scientist developed the web in 1989 as an academic tool to allow scientists to share data .
Since then it has exploded into every area of life .
You get this tremendous serendipity where I can search the internet and come across a site that I did not set out to look for
Tim Berners - Lee
The World Wide Web Consortium , of which Sir Tim is the director , believes in an open model .
This is based on the concept of network neutrality , where everyone has the same level of access to the web and that all data moving around the web is treated equally .
This view is backed by companies like Microsoft and Google , who have called for legislation to be introduced to guarantee net neutrality .
The first steps towards this were taken last week when members of the US House of Representatives introduced a net neutrality bill .
Pay model
But telecoms companies in the US do not agree .
They would like to implement a two - tier system , where data from companies or institutions that can pay are given priority over those that cannot .
This has particularly become an issue with the transmission of TV shows over the internet , with some broadband providers wanting to charge content providers to carry the data .
The internet community believes this threatens the open model of the internet as broadband providers will become gatekeepers to the web 's content .
Providers that can pay will be able to get a commercial advantage over those that cannot .
There is a fear that institutions like universities and charities would also suffer .
The web community is also worried that any charges would be passed on to the consumer .
Optimism
Sir Tim said this was " not the internet model " .
The " right " model , as exists at the moment , was that any content provider could pay for a connection to the internet and could then put any content on to the web with no discrimination .
Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh at the WWW2006 conference , he argued this was where the great benefit of the internet lay .
" You get this tremendous serendipity where I can search the internet and come across a site that I did not set out to look for , " he said .
A two - tier system would mean that people would only have full access to those portions of the internet that they paid for and that some companies would be given priority over others .
But Sir Tim was optimistic that the internet would resist attempts to fragment .
" I think it is one and will remain as one , " he said .
The WWW2006 conference will run until Friday at the International Conference Centre in Edinburgh .
The book I was reading is called “ Unstoppable Global Warming – Every 1,500 years , ” by Singer and Avery , and it is written in rebuttal of some of the issues that are being brought up over Global Warming .
And , since I am not that au fait with the other sides of the argument ( when did you last see a detailed article that looks at the issue from other than ex-Vice President Gore ’s perspective ) , and in keeping with the philosophy that leads me to read CERA articles , I thought it would be informative to see what the other side of the argument is all about .
( Added comment – I was sent a note from Amazon , because of all the books that I buy on that site about peak oil , that this book might be of interest , and I thought why not ? )
I remember walking along the coast of Sardinia , and visiting the ruins of the Roman port at Nora , that stretch out , under the water and into the Mediterranean , and thinking that there must have been a land subsidence between then and now to carry the land down and underwater .
Somehow , until reading my book on the plane traveling here , I could not get my mind around the fact that the sea levels had risen so much since the port was built that it now lies underwater .
And the cause of the sea level rising around the world , as it must have , has been that some of the ice that lies around the poles has melted , as the overall climate and temperature of the Earth has changed .
Normally after a conference this is where I would give you my opinions in a little summary , and I would still like to do that , but the way things have worked out , I would like to preface that discussion with a little story .
I had thought to post what immediately follows as a post on Friday , during the first day of the conference , but there were other pieces , and I was not sure how much on - topic this was .
So I sent it around to our contributors for comment .
And it developed into a little story on its own .
So , since what then happened has some relevance to the conclusions I drew from the meeting , I thought I would combine both tasks .
So let me begin with the original post as I wrote it .
.................
It is , in fact , an interesting , and I thought , worthwhile exercise .
In a comment some posts ago , someone had written that Singer and Avery ’s arguments had been considered , and were either not valid or non-persuasive .
Which is odd , because the book is not actually as much their work , as it is a compilation of the reported results from the work of several hundred scientists worldwide , who have published in quite reputable peer - reviewed journals .
The main thesis of the book 's authors is that , because of changes in solar activity , the Earth goes through periods of heating and cooling .
Since there is considerable evidence for the existence of Ice Ages , this is not something that is likely refutable .
But over and above the very large climate changes there are smaller temperature cycles , which , over the past million years have averaged a frequency of about 1,500 years .
Most recently ( as in the last 3,000 years ) there have been two such cycles .
Depending on where you choose to start the cycle , the cold period before the first was from 705 BC to 200 BC , this was followed by a warm phase ( referred to as the Roman Warming ) between 200 BC and 600 AD ; then a cold phase , known as the Dark Ages , from AD 440 to AD 900 ; then a second warming phase , from 900 to 1300 AD ( The Medieval Warming ) ; followed by the most recent cold phase , 1300 to 1850 AD ( the little Ice Age ) ; which has since been followed by the current warming trend , and which , from that cycle , is likely to continue to get warmer for another 50 years or so , before the temperature crests and starts to decline and we start back into the next cold phase .
The evidence can be quite persuasive , for example the river
Thames froze over in winter until 1814 , and has not frozen since , and there is the evidence that I started with about sea levels .
And so the fundamental discussion that I can relate to in the book is this cycle , and what is interesting relates to the variety of different pieces of evidence that they use to illustrate that it happened .
I did not know , for example , that you could tell climate from the condition of stalactites , and until I read the book I thought that when a coral bleached it was irretrievably dead .
What is troublesome , I gather , to those that espouse the carbon dioxide cause of global warming , is that if the cycle has happened before , and if the world survived ( and the authors suggest – along the lines of “ Minnesotans for Global Warming ” – that in fact the world was , in general , a better place during the warm periods than the cold ones ) then perhaps the current concerns are much ado about nothing .
And , in addition , if the world got warmer , in those periods , than it is now , and all the species survived , and mankind flourished , why are we currently worried ?
This perhaps explains why one sees , for example , in papers that Dr Hansen has given , comments that the Medieval period was not as warm as it has been projected to be .
It also explains recent comments that have cropped up in comments on some posts here on the irrelevance of the presence of vineyards in the UK during Roman times , and in Greenland .
Certainly , since these cycles would appear to be historically valid , one can learn from what did occur ( the weather was nowhere near as catastrophic as some would suggest that it will be as the temperature continues to rise ) , and where problem areas arose ( changes in drought patterns , and the problems in some cases of dealing with excess rainfall ) .
However , that being said , part of the concern that has arisen over the influence of carbon dioxide on the climate relates to the rate of change , and to the accelerating effect on climate change that the increased concentrations of CO2 are having .
And here the book is not very persuasive nor argumentative .
It does point out a controversy over the “ hockey stick ” plots that both a core part of the IPCC 2001 report ( which segment was apparently written by the generator of the hockey stick plot ) , and the consequent basis for the ( pdf ) National Academy review of the problem .
But it implies that the debate on that issue is settled , which does not , at least as the Wikipedia article suggests , reflect the actual situation .
Further it does not consider the most recent changes in climate over the last couple of years .
But the book was well written , easy to read , and I learned a lot from it , so , while I do n’t necessarily agree with some of the conclusions , it is worth reading to understand some of the aspects of the current debate that are not always , otherwise , made clear .
. . . . . . . .
Well that was the post , I thought it ( the post that is ) fairly innocuous , and , as I note it does explain that there is another side of the story to that which is currently getting maximum exposure .
However a couple of responses that I got were somewhat startling .
I got one note back saying that if I posted it there would be a lengthy rebuttal .
Well that is fine , and good debate is what educates us all .
What I was not expecting was to get was a second , more disturbing e-mail and , while it serves no purpose to repeat it , it did cause me to do a relatively quick review of a few facts .
And yes , I still think that it is relevant , so please read on .
So what is all the fuss about – well I thought I ’d have a bit more of a look .
So here is what I did ( the layman ’s validation at its more open ) – I went to the internet and got a look at the International Panel on Climate Control ’s 2001 report ( the third assessment report or TAR ) .
( You just type IPCC on Google and it is on the first site that is listed ) .
And I read through the first bit ( clicking on the Scientific basis button ) until I got to the figure that is now known as the hockey stick , because of the way that the temperature abruptly turns upwards .
Along the way I noted that the graphs showed that the world had been getting warmer since 1860 .
Figures 2.1 a and b from the TAR
And then there was this one , since I had read somewhere that as the permafrost heats up there is a risk that it will release more methane – a GHG .
You will note that it suggests that the ground temperature has been going up for the past 400 years .
Figure 2.19 TAR report of the IPCC
Hmm , and so then I looked at the hockey stick curve again and it did not have any of that .
The results ( as I noted above ) that have got the most attention , and on which a number of reports have been made are those by Mann , and those are the ones with the heavy black line .
They show that the world got steadily colder from 1000 AD , to just after 1900 .
Figure 2.21 TAR report .
Now all the consequent fuss has been about the bit after 1900 and the accelerating upward trend of the last decade .
I was ( vide the book topic ) a little more interested in the bit before 1900 , and it does not show any of the warming that has occurred according to the two graphs from the report that I posted above it .
Now that is a bit more odd , since , as I had noted above , the Thames used to freeze over ( no not from personal memory , from having to read set books while I was in school ) , and a check on Wikipedia for the River Thames gives :
In the 17th and 18th centuries , during the period now referred to as the Little Ice Age , the Thames often froze over in the winter .
This led to the first Frost Fair in 1607 , complete with a tent city set up on the river itself and offering a number of amusements , including ice bowling .
After temperatures began to rise again , starting in 1814 , the river has never frozen over completely
So it looks as though the IPCC report itself is not self - consistent .
So let ’s call this a zero for the Mann group .
So , how about Singer , can I do a quick check to see whether he is similarly challenged ?
And so , since it had been stated in that critical e-mail that the authors cherry picked their data I thought I would try another unscientific experiment .
So I picked a reference ( open at page 25 , first reference down ( number 12 of the 35 scientific references quoted from articles in journals such as Science , Global and Planetary Change , Nature , Paleooceanography etc in that chapter ) .
It related to a study by Lloyd Keigwin and reported in Science in 1996 .
Well in a hotel I can’t likely get into Science without bucks , so I went back to good old Google and typed in Keigwin Sargasso ( the paper related to the oxygen isotopes in organisms in seabed core from the Sargasso ) .
And as it happened Google gave this site which had a bit of discussion on how the data was obtained , and gave
a clear indication of a medieval warming period before the little ice age – just as the book predicted .
So lets give the book authors a one .
So in my little check on the two sides , the book authors win by a score of one to zero .
And , I have explained how I did this in detail , so that you can check me out that I did n't cheat .
But what does that have to do with the Conference ?
Well I think it became very clear , as the conference wore on that the future energy supply ( for at least the next few decades ) will rely on coal , whether as a primary fuel for electricity , or as a feed stock for liquid fuels .
The little that renewables will be able to contribute is not going to be that significant in overall supply terms .
And the public will be unwilling to pay the costs to ensure that the coal is burned cleanly and the CO2 sequestered .
Quick audience check , would you pay double your current electric bill for no visible benefit , but to pump carbon dioxide underground for no change in the global warming progress ?
Did n’t think you would .
Because that is the other side of the problem , no matter what is done locally , the energy needs of the rest of the world are such that coal will be burned , and gas will be generated , and if that is the cause of Global Warming , then what we are going to do is not going to make a difference because it will be too little , too late .
And if the GHG are not causing Global Warming , then as the graphs show , the world is heating up anyway under the next cycle .
And we certainly wo n’t be able to change that .
And so , as one of the speakers said , and as an editorial in Newsweek this week notes , all we can do is adapt .
And that was the other thing I brought back from the conference .
There is an increasing interest in Energy Productivity , in saving through conservation .
There are many ways this can be done , and some of the better companies are already learning this lesson and implementing them , to large cost savings .
I suspect this will become one of the larger themes of the next decade .
But while that may be project profitable , the inertia of the system is such that , globally , it wo n’t make much difference .
Note that , in California , despite universal agreement almost in the room that we had a problem , no - one in the entire conference , that I heard , talked about mandating speed limits again , as was done in the 70’s .
So that ’s my opinion , I do n’t really think that most of the audience grasped the immediacy of the problem , nor did some of the speakers .
It was as though it was a nice intellectual exercise , without the reality of the physical impact that is going to happen .
Oddly , having also carried out this little exercise on global warming , I am not sure if the audience really fully realized what this might mean .
If , as Dr Hansen ’s data suggests , change can be very rapid ( and I apologize if I missed a zero ) then we need to start planning for the coming changes .
( And a clarification of my understanding - I thought that when the Labrador field collapsed we got a tsunami with a height of 8 m and so I may have misunderstood ) .
Now here I differ with many , because I think that the debate of this issue can cause a lot of delays , when we need to learn what we are going to have to do to adapt .
We need to have more studies of what happened the last time since as his example showed , there is physical evidence out there .
Happily there is a greater public awareness , but , as one speaker noted , when the costs of a possible ameliorant are mentioned , the discussion stops .
So it is important now to start looking at what has happened in the past and seeing what those changes will mean .
( Jeepers an engineer is urging funding for historical research , who ’d a thunkit ) and how we can learn to adapt .
We need to implement more of the energy saving technologies , and develop more of them , and while I would prefer that the Federal Agencies got more involved in this , I accept that much of this will be market driven , as the benefits become more obvious .
Not a very encouraging message , I ’m afraid , despite some of the very neat technologies that we heard about .
Now I have been asked to make clear that all this reflects my own personal activities and should be considered to have anything to do with any other contributors to the site .
( I thought you all knew that , but never mind , they want the statement , they got it . )
Unfortunately there is also , occasionally , in rebuttal posts , the occasional ad - hominem attack when a disputed opinion is put forward .
( That means that if you kill the messenger then hopefully no - one will notice or give credence to the message ) .
This is a real and serious crisis .
The reports I gave from the conference ( and there were readers there who can correct my mistakes ) tried to reflect , outside my opinions , what was said .
The community that reads this site is better served by that approach , and by open discussion .
You now have my opinions , I would prefer we discuss the issues .
Well I said my piece , thank you for reading .
I think I ’ll post about what the Saudi ’s are doing with water pumping next time , it might get us back to something we know a lot more about .
( joke ) .
And there are these really neat LED 's that I have to go and buy . . . . . .

The best user manuals EVER
We say users wo n't RTFM , but they do .
Just not the one that comes with the product .
Personally , I hope companies do n't listen to me about making better end - user docs , support , and online help .
If y'all made better FMs , I 'd be out of a job ... along with all the other third - party tech authors and training providers .
David Pogue 's worst nightmare is that all those Missing Manuals will be found .
Until more companies recognize the value ( yes , even ROI ) of helping their users kick ass , there 's an opportunity for the rest of us to help fill in the gaps .
But this post describes a company that actually charges its users big money for high - quality learning materials , and people are thrilled to pay it .
User Documentation Users Pay For
Parelli Natural Horsemanship sells horse - related products including saddles , bridles , ropes , etc .
But you have to pay more to learn how to use them properly .
Much , much more .
Users are paying anywhere from $ 200 to $ 1000 for home - study kits including booklets and DVDs .
Yes , horse training is not the same as using a project management app -- clearly the markets and context are different -- but the main point is the same -- people place an extremely high value on quality learning and support materials .
And I 'd rather see a company make top-quality manuals and charge extra , than turn out the after - thought - barely - functional docs that ship with most products today ( or are posted online for most web apps ) .
( I believe the better approach would be to NOT charge , and exploit end - user training as a competitive advantage - - remember , all things being equal , he who gets his users past the suck threshold and into the kick - ass zone the fastest wins .
FYI : Parelli has one of the largest , most loyal passionate fan bases I 've ever seen ( and it 's what finally motivated me to get back into horses ) .
There are unofficial fan clubs and user groups worldwide , including over 1500 local members just in the little part of Colorado I live in .
Parelli is one of the best possible case studies for Creating Passionate Users .

i.e. users actually learn from it , not just refer to it .
3 ) Motivational
Keeps users willing to push forward to higher " levels "
The following pictures are some examples of how Parelli does this .
The only thing you need to know to understand the examples is that the Parelli system groups a set of skills and knowledge into " levels " .
Founder / creator Pat Parelli designed levels into his program based on the success of the martial arts belt system and video game levels .
In other words , he knew that the levels -- key achievement milestones with clear rewards -- are more motivating than just , " here you go ... keep going . "
In the Parelli system , the physical reward is nothing more than a paper certificate and piece of colored string .
But the mental and emotional reward is enough to keep people sticking with it and -- paying more money for additional training materials ( including , sometimes , live courses ) .
Everything here could be used as a model ( with modifications for a different audience , obviously ) for building brilliant , motivating , passion - inspiring user learning regardless of the product or service .
( And regardless of whether its a physical product or web application . )
Task - based Pocket Guide " job aids " with context - dependent tips , pitfalls , and troubleshooting
Typical user docs are reference .
If users are lucky , they might also get a tutorial or " getting started " guide .
Some user manuals include " job aids " -- in other words , things the user can use just - in - time on the job , but in software , these are nearly always " cheat sheet " cards with keyboard shortcuts rather than " here 's how to do this specific thing ... "
The Parelli system assumes you can't take a frickin ' manual out to the arena with you , so they give you small guides that literally fit into your pocket , so you can use them in real life on the job .
But even in software , why assume that it 's easy for users to have a big manual beside their desk ?
Why not a smaller series of booklets based around specific sets of tasks an end - user might want to do ?
More importantly , the guides group the problems you might hit in a particular task right there with the instruction for that task .
Forcing a user to go to a separate " Troubleshooting " section of FAQ list is just ... wrong .
That does n't mean you should n't have those separate sections , but you should duplicate pitfalls and problems and include them in just - in - time job aids ( physical or online ) .
Context - sensitive FAQs -- done right -- can make a dramatic difference in software , and greatly reduce the user 's cognitive load .
Motivational bridge between levels
Each " level " includes a preview book from the next level , even color - coded to the new level , that helps motivate and prepare you for moving up .
The assumption -- and message to the user -- is , " Congratulations !
You finished level one !
Now look at the cool things you 'll be able to do in level two , and ... let 's get started . "
The motivating message is , " You ca n't stop now ... you have all these new tools and NOW you 'll be able to put them to use in these reallly interesting ways ... "
In other words , they help the user map their level one skills to things they can now use to get new benefits ( but only if they keep going into level two ) .
Skill / Savvy - based " Reminder Aids "
While level one is about completing tasks -- the user is just trying to get something done correctly and safely -- level two is about improving overall skill and knowledge .
In Parelli , level two is more about doing things well regardless of the actual task .
For a software app , this could be general reminders and tips .
For a programmer , this might be design patterns and best - practice idioms , etc .
In the Parelli level two , you get a big pile of these cards , and you can customize your caribiner ( hooked to your belt loop ) each day with the things you want to remember , as well as tasks for that day .
Each card includes a reference pointer for getting more info ( which chapter of the DVD or section of the manual , etc . )
Motivational Progress Map
The best way to keep someone on track is to do two things :
1 ) Show them how far they 've come
2 ) Show them where they can go next
The Parelli system has three different types of progress charts :
Level ONE
You get a wall poster checklist that lets you see the entire set of skills for this level , and over the 30 - 90 days they expect it will take , you can continue to check these off .
The checklists are color - coded , too , so the " bridge " items from the level two sneak peak are in blue , rather than the level one red color .
Level TWO
Although I did n't show it ( mine 's at the barn ) , the level two progress map is much cooler than a simple checklist .
In level two , you can take the cards that are on the caribiner and place them in a big fold - out map - - that has slots -- which you move across depending on where you are with that particular task .
For example , in " riding without a bridle " , I might start with that card in " just starting " and then as I progress move it into the " working on it " slot , and so on .
It gives you a clear visual in one glance for where you are in the entire level two program ( which is much more involved than the simple tasks of level one ) .
The Parelli Official User Group
If you join the monthly - fee official Parelli Savvy Club , you get a " passport " -- a booklet that lists accomplishments from the first three levels , with color - coded stickers to place on those tasks or capabilities as you complete them .
Flipping through this booklet is another easy way to see where you are , and it 's very motivating to want to keep checking off those tasks ( in this case , by writing the dates and placing the stickers ) .
Motivational Practice Game
This learning game costs users an extra $ 100 ... and they 're happy to pay it !
Besides giving you a zillion practice tips and tricks , the game encourages you to get others involved .
And as we know from reverse - engineering passion , the more people connect and engage with others around this activity , the more likely it is to lead to ( or reinforce ) a passion for that activity .
Bottom line : never underestimate the value of providing fabulous training materials in getting -- and keeping -- users motivated to get better .
And the better they are , the more likely they are to appreciate ( and buy ) your higher - end versions , evangelize , buy and create accessories , etc .
And remember -- if you view these pictures as examples of typical user manuals , they look absurd .
But if they were marketing materials for the same product ... they might not look so strange .
Think about that .
( And re-read my previous post on the great gulf between before - and - after the customer pays for something . )
Just imagine ... what would it be like if you had learning materials like that ?
Not in the budget ?
Charge extra .
Why not ?
Look how much money O'Reilly , Wiley , Prentice - Hall , etc. are making thanks to all the missing / useless / painful docs .
Better yet , be the first in your market to blow minds with world - class user learning materials .
How long will it take before the companies that do this can start slashing their marketing budgets ...

Great post , as usual .
I also just made the mistake of forwarding a link to it to my wife and daughter , the real horse - lovers in my family .
Why do I get the feeling this is going to cost me a lot of money ?...
The various components in the Parelli home - study kits are pretty remarkable .
I 'm wondering though ...
Have they been able to charge a premium for all this from the start or was it only after they established their high quality brand name ?
Which came first ... the chicken or the egg ?
Posted by : Joe Wikert | Mar 1 , 2007 6:44:54 PM
Big , big mistake Joe ; )
And you asked an interesting question ... apparently in the early days they did n't charge nearly as much , but the pocket guides were hand - drawn stick figures .
Then they added video tapes and slightly better pocket guides .
The huge jump in quality , production values , and price tag all happened when Linda Parelli and a Ph.D. in Adult Learning
Theory completely rebuilt the first two levels from scratch .
So both the learning ' content ' ( how things were taught , order , pace , etc. ) AND the format ( DVDs + better pocket guides for level one , DVDs and the cards for level two ) AND the production quality all happened at once .
And by then , they already had a huge following .
With the quality they have now , I think they still would have been able to charge like this from the beginning , but they'd have had to ' prove ' it by seeding a large number of users who'd try it and start talking .
And by doing things like encouraging their users to do just what I did -- sent your daughter a DVD !
Here 's something else Pat Parelli told me , though -- the success of their training has allowed them to charge a VERY hefty markup on their actual training gear ( halters , sticks , etc. ) .
Pat said -- being frank -- that while his equipment was of higher quality than anything else , it was really only 20 % better , yet it costs 50 - 100 % more .
And all that * extra * markup , he said , was strictly about the power of the brand .
It 's really about trust , I think ...
I know I can pay less for similar equipment elsewhere , but I trust that I 'll be getting exactly the right thing from them , and their customer service has always been awesome .
I actually tried to do Parelli nearly 10 years ago , just working from a ( poorly done ) book , and I could n't do it .
It was a set of instructions but did n't include all the " but what if my horse does n't do X when I do Y ? " and those were the deal - killers for me .
My horse NEVER did what he was supposed to when I tried to do what was in the book .
It 's shocking how valuable those " Pitfalls " and " Troubleshooting " sections are , and they obviously pulled them from the students who 've been trying to do these things .

It certainly sets the bar for training packages for self - learning courses to a higher standard .
As always I can detect a hint of passion in your post .
Posted by : Peter | Mar 1 , 2007 7:30:42 PM
Peter :
There 's an 80/20 -- just putting context - dependent pieces in one place and including a simple one - page checklist for progress ( and navigation through a set of things to learn ) would be huge .
Forget the cards and the caribiners and the games and the DVDs ... a few simple things could make a dramatic difference .
That the bar has been set so * low * in most user manuals ( Electric Rain 's Swift 3D is a big wonderful exception ! ) means it does n't take that much to shine .
So , the passion showed ? ; )
And here I thought I was being all subtle ...

This was a timely post - as always .
I am about to create documentation to assist a workshop I am giving , and of course I want to make a kick - ass workshop with kick - ass materials so I can help inspire kick - ass people to -- yes -- kickass .
The material is all mind - body ( ' psychosomatic ' ) so the deeper I can reach into the subject matter to create a " manual " , the better for the participants .... this may even be a precoursor project to something completely new - who knows .
THANKS for the kick in MY ass !

If only programming language courses were taught that way , I might actually manage to self motivate beyond " Kind of interested " .
I want to learn a new language to back up my other skills , but trying to motivate myself to spend the hours outside of work learning a new programming language is pretty hopeless , I 'm not a driven career man .
Maybe one day ....

Disclaimer : IANAB ( I am not a blogger ;-)
However , I am a blog reader , and I 've very much enjoyed yours ever since I stumbled upon it a year or so ago .
Your passion for what you do is palpable and genuine .
With that praiseful preamble , I have a tiny nit to pick with this post -- you misspelled the word carabiner .
I did n't know the correct spelling myself , so I looked it up online .
A useful mnemonic for the spelling might be to think of the fondness a mountaineer would have for these devices , which keep her safe from falling ; is she were Italian , surely she would think of it as " Cara " ( dear ) !

Kathy ,
I 'm strongly reminded of a classic of DIY auto repair , John Muir 's How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive .
You can easily tell original copies from the Sixties , because they 've got greasy thumbprints all over them .
Muir groups car - upkeep tasks into three tiers , and created three tier toolkits .
In other words , if you had all the Tier 1 tools , you could undertake any Tier 1 job .
Removing the engine was a Tier 2 job .
He did n't have the range of techniques Parelli uses , but he has excellent mnemonics , job aids , and rules of thumb -- like the mantra " front is front , " meaning , " even though your engine is in the rear , the front of the engine is the part closest to the front of the car . "
Another stellar example is the HTML tutorial begun by Alan Levine back in 1994 .

I 've never had the opportunity to see Parelli , but I 've been to seminars by Richard Shrake as well as both John and Josh Lyons .
They are very organized , and very professional .
Interesting to go to from both as a horse person , and as someone who is in the printing / publishing business .

Kathy ,
I 'm extremely fond of your blog , but there 's one thing that I just do n't understand ...
Horses are big , probably expensive ( how much is a horse ? ) , dangerous ( I hope you 've recovered from you last spill ) , and smelly ( I 'm not fond of shoveling poo ) .
So why do you like them so much ?
Posted by : Johnny | Mar 2 , 2007 9:46:35 AM
Documentation is often written by a group of " technical writers " in a pooled organization .
They often have little opportunity or incentive to develop in - depth familiarity with any particular product , and are also often hamstrung by " style guides " which are seemingly designed to make the document as boring as possible .
I once had to conduct corporate warfare against a doc manager to get him to agree that a manual could use the word " you " ( as in " you should now do X " ) rather than " the user . "

Kathy ,
The training materials are great and certainly people are willing to pay more for quality .
In this example the stakes are also higher .
If you screw up training a horse you end up injured or with a resultant bad behavior .
If you do n't learn to use a camera well you just get bad pictures [ or are stuck using auto mode ] .

Robert 's mention of the 1970's American Red Cross swimming program booklets brought back a flood of happy memories .
During the summer between high school and college , I gave swimming lessons in our family pool using the Red Cross booklet for teaching little children .
There were ten lessons that started with blowing bubbles in the water and ended with swimming laps using the crawl stroke .
My students were mostly 5 to 7 year olds .
After ten lessons , all of them went from not being able to swim to being able to dive in the deep end and swim the length of the pool ( and our pool was not small ) .

An additional value of the level code is to allow people to refer to it , as a language tool , a easy way to answer the crucial question : " How good are you with a horse ? " , a skill convention .

Great stuff -- as a science teacher educator , I 'm reading this thinking about user manuals as curricula .
Generally , science curricula , umm , suck .
It sounds like Parelli is one of the few that would stand up well to the curriculum evaluation framework from the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's Project 2061 .
( Is horseback riding a science ? )
Check out the evaluations here :
http://www.project2061.org/publications/
Pay special attention to the criteria they used for evaluation .
Then think about science textbooks as user manuals for science ( and the teaching of science ) .
And think about what you can do as a parent , a teacher or a learner to fill in the gaps that most curricula have so that you can kick ass .

Quite a coincidence that I should discover your blog the very day you post about Parelli !
I have resisted Parelli at many horse expos over the years simply because he is so commercial , and I was sooo appalled at the sight of all those people carrying carrot sticks who no doubt thought that this one little device might turn them into horse trainers .
But your post is so great and really educated me about how Pat and Linda have integrated educational theory about how people learn into their training materials .
I may be mellowing !
But no , then I read Johnny 's post and was tempted to veer off course to get on my soapbox about horses !
But I 'm resisting the temptation .
I 'm going to be teaching a software class soon and will be thinking of using the levels approach myself !
And no , Don , horseback riding is an ART !

Just one simple comment and addition to your post .
Bonus Tip : Never make a user feel dumb or stupid through a manual .
It 's weird how many manuals I 've seen that make you feel dumb after reading it ... they usually push consumers to do thins their own way .
And probably never buying again from the brand .

Hello ,
this is my first comment on the passionate blog :)
I am amazed and very happy that such a positive , creative and motivating articles and comments are created here almost everyday , this is wonderfull place to visit no matter what industry one is working in .
About the manuals that kick ass :)
I want to give credits and big thanks to the Borland ( Inprise ) software company for the effort they put and the quality they achieve in their integrated help system for the Delphi and C++ builder solutions and even early Pascal and C++
Dos versions .
It has been always inspiring to read their help and remain with the feeling that the guys that created it arehappy if the users kick ass by reading their work .
I do n't have direct relationship with Borland and I hope my opinion does not sound like some kind of advertisement for them ( as far as I know they quitted the development tools business ) , but I trully love their work :)
Best Regards and Wishes ,
Luben

Interesting ..
Just few weeks ago I was thinking about writing an actually useful manual for some graphic calculators to help my fellow students .
The book should be small enough to be carried around , it should be task - oriented and contain troubleshooting next to tasks and stuff ..
And then it hit me ..
" WTF , why has n't the manufacturer done this already ? "
Posted by : Meak | Mar 4 , 2007 2:00:06 AM
Hi Kathy ,
Nice post .
Though if I understood the article , you have to pay to buy the booklet , which means its not really a user manual , but more like an additional guide kind of thing .
There are companies out there that provide training courses for their products .
Should we take this as a sign that they really care about you ( they are willing to send someone over to teach you - at a charge ) , or is it a sign that the product actually sucks and the training is just a tool to mint some more cash ?
Do we really need a 3 level guide with exercises , video tapes and tests just so you can write out a letter on a word processor ?
We can't really do much about horses .
But we can certainly make products easier to use .
I agree with you totally that we need good user manuals - for no extra charge - where good means not just flashy , but people can actually learn from them .
Yet , please make the software easy to use too .

Story Highlights • Israel 's President Moshe Katsav will be indicted on rape charges
• Katsav denies wrongdoing , his lawyer says he is victim of blackmail
• Investigation began after former employee alleged he forced her to have sex
Adjust font size :
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
Israel 's attorney general has determined that there is enough evidence to charge Israeli President Moshe Katsav with sex crimes , including rape , which stem from allegations from four of his former female employees , the justice ministry said Tuesday .
Katsav will have a chance to refute the charges in a hearing with Attorney General Menachem Mazuz before Mazuz can proceed with the indictments .
According to a statement from the ministry , Katsav is charged with raping a woman who worked for him in the tourism ministry in 1998 and 1999 , as well as indecent acts with use of force .
He is also charged with unlawful intercourse and indecent acts against another woman who worked with him while he was president in 2003 - 04 .
Katsav also faces charges of indecent acts with abuse of power against two women who worked for him as president .
He is also being charged with obstruction of justice and harassing a witness .
Katsav has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer has said that he is the victim of blackmail .
Three months ago , Mazuz recommended Katsav temporarily step down as president -- a mostly ceremonial position in Israel 's government -- as he considered the charges .
Criminal investigation
Katsav has said he would suspend himself from office if indicted .
His term ends in July and he is not eligible for a second seven - year term , under Israeli law .
A previous Israeli president and several prime ministers have been suspected of financial misdeeds and a former defense minister was convicted of sexual harassment .
But the charges facing Katsav are the most serious criminal counts brought against a serving Israeli official .
Mazuz launched a criminal investigation of Katsav in July after a former employee alleged he forced her to have sex under the threat of dismissal .
Police repeatedly questioned Katsav at his official residence and seized personal documents .
Katsav was appointed president by parliament in 2000 after President Ezer Weizman resigned amid allegations of corruption .
Though the Israeli president 's role is mostly ceremonial , Razi Barkai , a political journalist for more than 30 years , told CNN these accusations , true or not , will mean an end to Katsav 's political career .
News of a possible presidential sex scandal , which was overshadowed when it broke during Israel 's war with Hezbollah , has recently become the focus of national media coverage .
CNN 's Shira Medding contributed to this report
Imagine an Alzheimer 's patient receiving a vaccine made of specialized blood cells and then showing a much - improved memory .
Also , imagine that vaccine having no side effects and needing to be given only occasionally .
Researchers at the Johnnie B. Byrd , Sr. Alzheimer 's Center & Research Institute in Tampa , Florida , have not only imagined these things , they have actually developed such a vaccine that they show reverses memory loss in Alzheimer 's mice .
In a study published this week in the journal , Neurobiology of Disease , researchers report that tests of the new vaccine on mice shows promise of reversing memory loss and seriously slowing the effects of Alzheimer 's on patients .
The groundbreaking research was done by investigators from the Byrd Alzheimer 's Institute , the University of South Florida , and University of California Riverside .
In the study , researchers took ordinary white blood cells ( immune cells ) from normal mice and exposed those white blood cells to an abnormal protein called " beta- amyloid . "
Beta -amyloid accumulates in Alzheimer 's brains and appears to be the root cause of this devastating disease .
A single injection of white blood cells " sensitized " to beta - amyloid was given to Alzheimer 's mice with impaired memories and Alzheimer 's - like brain pathologies .
When the Alzheimer 's mice were tested several months later , their memory performance was surprisingly improved , even up to the level of normal mice .
Moreover , this single vaccine treatment increased connections between brain cells and reduced brain levels of beta-amyloid in the Alzheimer 's mice .
" This adoptive transfer vaccine approach is important not only for the long - term benefits it provides , but also for what it does n't provide — harmful side effects , " said Gary Arendash , Ph.D , a principal investigator on the study and a Byrd Institute researcher .
Plans for clinical trials with the new vaccine in Alzheimer 's patients are underway at the Byrd Alzheimer 's Center and Research Institute .
" Even if this new vaccine does not cure Alzheimer 's disease , it may significantly slow down the disease process and thus provide years of quality life to individuals diagnosed with the disease , " said Arendash .
Pass your certification exam with testking 646-985 course and become master of latest technology using testking HP0 - S25 lab and testking HP2 - E32 exam simulations .
The new vaccine created by Byrd Institute researchers and their collaborators did not induce an inflammatory response in either the blood or brain of Alzheimer 's mice , said Dr. Douglas Ethell of the University of California , another principle investigator in the study .

The Origin of the Universe
Brief outline of the evolution of theories on the origin of the universe :
Ancient Greeks : the geocentric universe : earth is the centre of the universe , around which the sun & planets rotate this held as the popular view almost to the end of the 18thC !!
Aristarchus ' universe : the only reference remaining is a critic by Archimedes , and this view appears to have been lost sun & stars are fixed , earth & planets rotate around the sun .
Copernicus ( 1543AD ) : published a view similar to Aristarchus but not widely accepted as opposed religious doctrine , removing humanity as the centre of all consideration , until Newton & others to spread it , even so , it was not widely accepted until late 18thC .
( 1543AD ) : Newtonian " classical " physics : Newton in 1687 published his Principia Mathematica , giving us the 1st mathematical model for time and space time & space were a background in which events took place but which were n't affected by them time was separate from space & was considered to be a single line with no beginning & no end & was constant law of gravity : if one changed the distribution of matter in one region of space , the change in the gravitational field would be felt instantaneously everywhere else in the universe , which implied , one could send signals faster than light & in order to know what instantaneous meant , it also required the existence of absolute or universal time whilst Newton regarded light as corpuscular , Huyghens ( 1629 - 95 ) introduced the wave theory of light
Immanuel Kant's " antimony of pure reason " : if the universe was created only a few thousand years ago as most believed , why had there been an infinite wait before the creation ?
on the other hand , if the universe had existed forever , why had n't everything that was going to happen already happened , meaning that history was over ?
why had n't the universe reached thermal equilibrium , with everything the same temperature ???
space as " ether " : by the end of the 19thC , scientists believed they were close to a complete description of the universe , they imagined that space was filled by a continuous medium called the " ether " .
light rays & radio signals were waves in this ether , just as sound is pressure waves in air all that was needed for a complete theory were careful measurements of the elastic properties of the ether , anticipating such measurements , the Jefferson Lab at Harvard University was built entirely without iron nails so as not to interfere with delicate magnetic measurements , however , they forgot that the reddish - brown bricks contain large amounts of iron .
it was expected that light would travel at a fixed speed through the ether , but if you were travelling in the same direction , the speed should appear lower , & the converse if travelling towards the light unfortunately , no daily or yearly differences in speed of light were found in expts in 1887 when comparing speed of light in two beams at right angles to each other as the earth revolved around the sun - it was as if the speed of light was constant relative to where one was , no matter how fast & in what direction one was moving !
Einstein 's theories : photo-electric effect : Einstein won his Nobel prize for his photoelectric theory in 1905 he interpreted results which showed that for each metal there is a critical wavelength above which no photo - electrons are emitted , as meaning that radiation could be regarded as made up of small ' packets ' of energy , known as photons , when a metal is irradiated by such photons , some of the energy was used in ejecting electrons from the metal whilst the remainder was given up to the electrons .
the energy of a photon is dependent on the wavelength , or frequency , of the radiation concerned according to the basic equation of the quantum theory E = hv special relativity : Einstein in 1905 , started with the postulate that the laws of science should appear the same to all freely moving observers , in particular , they should measure the same speed of light independent of their motion .
this required overthrowing the absolutes of 19thC science ( & thus not accepted until mid-20thC ) : absolute rest , as represented by ether , and , absolute or universal time everyone would have there own personal time .
The times of two persons would agree if they were at rest with each other , but not if they were moving .
this has been confirmed by a number of expts such as : two accurate clocks flown in opposite directions around the world would become slightly out of sync by a fraction of a second .
this implied a theory of special relativity & an important consequence is the relation between mass & energy as , if the apparent speed was constant for everyone , then , no - one could travel faster than the speed of light , Einstein managed to then formulate his famous equation ( E = mc 2 ) which showed that as the energy increased so does the mass of the object which would then require an infinite energy to get to the speed of light .
a consequence of this is the realisation that if the nucleus of a uranium atom fissions into two nuclei with slightly less mass , this will release a tremendous amount of energy !
this theory then did not fit with Newton 's law of gravity : nothing could travel faster than light " instantaneous " was meaningless as absolute time was abolished general relativity : in 1912 , Einstein realised that if the geometry of space - time was curved and not flat , as had been assumed , acceleration and gravity can be equivalent only if a massive body curves space - time - this was the basis for his theory of general relativity this was confirmed in 1919 when a British expedition to West Africa observed slight bending of light from a star passing near the sun during an eclipse .
This spurred the greatest change in our perception of the universe since Euclid wrote his Elements of Geometry in 300BC .
one cannot curve space without curving time , thus time has a shape his equations did not allow for a static universe , unchanging in time as was generally believed , so he added a fudge which he called the " cosmological constant " rather than consider the universe was expanding or contracting
hyper-space : hyper - space is space beyond 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time .
ancient Greeks try to prove that hyper - space was impossible in 1860s , Bernhard Riemann ( 1826 -1866 - perhaps Vernhard is alternative spelling ) proves that hyper - space was possible in 1921 , Kaluza showed that universes may exist in hyper - space Einstein 's equations give us the possibility to leap into hyperspace through a worm - hole to reach another universe , but this would require more energy than we have & we do n't know how stable such a hole would be it is now believed that the concept of hyperspace is required to unify the four fundamental forces , as these can be seen as ripples in hyperspace : if the 5th dimension vibrates , the ripples are seen as light if the other dimensions vibrate , the ripples are seen as nuclear force time is like a river , it bends and flows around the Universe & may have whirlpools & may fork into 2 rivers , but for time travel , one would need Plank energy or the energy of a Black Hole 90 % of our Universe is made up of dark matter
the expanding Universe : in 1920's , Edwin Hubble found ( by Doppler Red Shift ) that galaxies far from our own Milky Way are moving away from us , in fact , the further away , the faster they are receding , thus concluding the Universe must be expanding using Einstein 's general theory of relativity , one could then conclude that , tracing the expansion of the universe back in time , at the beginning of time , there would be a point of infinite density ( of either energy or mass as these are equivalent ) which is called a singularity .
quantum mechanics : in the 1920's , Heisenberg , Dirac & Schrodinger developed a new picture of reality called quantum mechanics no longer did tiny particles have a definite position & speed but introduced the Uncertainty Principle which stated that the more is known about the position of a particle , the less can be known about its speed & vice versa these became the foundation of modern developments in chemistry , molecular biology & electronics .
1924 de Broglie suggested that moving electrons had waves of definite wavelength which was demonstrated in 1927 and their wavelength = h/ mv where h is Planck 's constant , m is mass of electron & v is the velocity of the electron & if this is written as momentum x wavelength = h & thus relates the particle - like aspect of an electron ie .
its momentum , to the wave - like aspect , ie .
wavelength .
1927 , Schrodinger postulated based on his intuition without proof , that the wave pattern of an electron could be expressed as an equation relating a wave function , the total energy & potential energy of the system , mass of the electron , Planck 's constant & the coordinates of the system .
1927 , Heisenberg put forward the Uncertainty Principle as a long wavelength can be measured with greater fractional accuracy than a short one , thus according to de Broglie 's equation , a particle with small momentum has a correspondingly large wavelength which can be measured with some accuracy but at the expense of a relatively inaccurate determination of the small momentum .
the Big Bang theory of the 1960's & 70's : based on particle physics : matter consists of fundamental matter particles quarks & leptons ( eg. electron , muon , tauon & neutrinos ) with 6 flavours of each 4 known fundamental forces , each mediated by a fundamental particle ( quantum , known as a carrier particle ) : Force Particle / quantum relative strength range ( meters ) strong nuclear gluon 1 10 - 15 electromagnetic photon 7 x 10 - 3 infinite weak nuclear W+ , W- , Z 10 - 5 10 - 17 gravitation gravitron ( tentative ) 6 x 10 - 39 infinite the cosmic afterglow : in 1963 , Arno Panzias & Robert Wilson detected the afterglow of the Big Bang , known as cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , which revealed that the Universe was once a very hot , hostile place & together with the expanding Universe concept , led scientists to deduce that the Universe began as an infinitely compact fireball .
the Big Bang describes how this fireball grew to form stars & planets , although it is erroneously thought of as being an explosion in one place , while it is is now thought as not forming from one central ignition point , but rather , that space was first created & then stretched .
according to physics , particles of matter & anti-matter should have been produced in equal quantities & if they meet each other , they would annihilate each other resulting in light - strangely we seem to have much more matter than anti-matter - this still has not been answered .
initially , space was jam - packed with particles which prevented light from escaping , but after 300,000yrs , the Universe cooled to the temperature of the Sun 's surface allowing the particles to join to form atoms which do not impede light & thus gradually light started to pour through the Universe the afterglow from this event formed a bright halo , whose light then began to filter down through space & time .
as we look into space we also look back into time , if it would be possible to see this far , the cosmic halo would be the furthest visible point .
Everything beyond this , from the birth of the Universe until this epoch will be invisible to us forever .
Stephen Hawking & Penrose : the beginning of time : spacetime is curved not only by massive objects but also by the energy in it which is always positive , so it gives spacetime a curvature that bends the path of light rays towards each other .
light rays in our past light cone are bent back toward each other creating a pear - shaped light - cone with the base being the Big Bang in 1968 , won 2nd prize in a competition with a paper proving time is dependent on the universe & has a beginning - the Big Bang to understand the origin & fate of the universe we would need a quantum theory of gravity physicists attempted to trace back the universe to the big bang using mathematical equations and determined : Big Bang happened ~ 14 - 15 billion years ago matter was a soup of quarks & leptons at a temperature of 10 16 deg .
C after a nanosecond , temperature fell to 10 12 deg .
C & protons & neutrons began to form the electroweak force differentiated into electromagnetic and the weak force .
if matter and antimatter were perfectly symmetrical , the cooling of the Universe would have resulted in matter annihilation & the result being only photons , but for every 1 billion annihilations , a particle of matter remained forming the matter today , & thus ~99 % of the current photons in the Universe are cosmic rays from these initial annihilations ( photons from stars are a trivial contribution ) .
a plasma of electrons & nuclei existed for 300,000yrs until the temperature dropped to 5,000 deg.C when hydrogen & helium atoms formed took a billion years to evolve into galaxies and stars at about 9 billion years , our Sun exploded into action but became stumped by the questions of the " Cosmic Singularity " : what was the Big Bang ? what made the Big Bang happen ?
did time start at the Big Bang ?
and even worse , our current laws of physics break down at the instant of the Big Bang & thus no single theory could explain all of nature in addition , particles could never be predicted to be where they should be
super - symmetry of the 1970's : a new kind of symmetry was discovered that provides a natural physical mechanism to cancel the infinities arising from ground state fluctuations one way is to say that spacetime has extra dimensions called Grassman dimensions , because they are measured in numbers known as Grassman variables rather than ordinary real numbers .
Grassman variables anti-commute : x times y is same as -y times x. super - symmetry was 1st considered for removing infinities in matter fields & Yang - Mills fields in spacetime where ordinary numbers & Grassman dimensions were flat , not curved .
one consequence of super - symmetry is that every field or particle should have a " superpartner " with a spin that is either 1 / 2 greater or less than its own
Stephen Hawking & Penrose : in 1974 , calculate the entropy of a black hole , thus showing that there is a deep connection between quantum gravity & thermodynamics & suggested that quantum gravity may exhibit holography
the super - gravity theory of the 1980's : applied super - symmetry to ordinary numbers & Grassman dimensions that were curved resulting in super - gravity theories predicted 11 dimensions but was temporarily displaced by the string theory 's 10 dimensions
the inflation theory : Universe was born by a spontaneous quantum energy bubble forming from nothing and then rapidly expanding from a size smaller than a proton to a grapefruit in a fraction of a second which then kick started the Big Bang
the super - string theories of the mid 1980's : an extension of quantum physics using strings ( one - dimensional extended objects that vibrate ) to represent the " particles " at Planck - length ( 10 - 35 meter ) dimensions , Einstein 's equations of general relativity result in such intense fluctuations that " space - time goes haywire " .
if the strings have Grassman dimensions as well as their ordinary number dimensions , the ripples will correspond to bosons & fermions .
thus , instead of boson & fermion particles , the universe is proposed to be made of Planck - length boson & fermion strings which must be stretched under tension to vibrate ( excite ) & unlike particle interactions which occur at a single point of space - time , strings collide over a small but finite distance & can vibrate in 10 dimensions , 6 of which are tightly coiled in on an unmeasurably small scale & 4 of which are conventional space - time thus the basic element of matter is not particles but are super - strings which when vibrate create different types of matter a string has 10 dimensions - 9 spacial + time as string theories do not have infinities , they are good at calculating what happens when a few high energy particles collide & scatter off each other , however , are not good at describing how the energy of a very large number of particles curve the universe or forms a bound state , like a black hole - for these situations , one needs supergravity .
this explained many things but 5 string theories evolved ( types I , IIA , IIB , heterotic - 0 , heterotic - E ) and this was not satisfactory
Townsend 's " p- branes " : it was realized that strings were just one member of a wide class of objects that can be extended in more than one dimension Townsend in late 1980's , named them " p- branes " where p is an integer indicating that it has length in p dimensions p-branes can be of different shapes : 0 - branes are sub-atomic particles and thus form our laws of chemistry 1 - branes are strings 2 - branes are membranes ( rolled up could form a torus ) 3 - branes maybe a universe ( a 3 space + 1 time universe ) all the p-branes could be found as solutions of the equations of super - gravity theories in 10 or 11 dimensions
the Membrane theory or M - theory of the late 1990's : an extension of the string theory whereby strings have 11 dimensions ( the 11th being gravity ? ) this allows for the multitude of string theories and an infinite number of particle types as well as supporting super - gravity theories , thereby it was a duality - a model that shows other models are all essentially equivalent & are just different aspects of the same underlying theory a universe consists of a membrane which connects all its component strings maximum width of the 11th dimension is 1 trillionth of a millimetre but it may be infinitely long there may be an infinite number of such universes , each with its own laws of physics within our " multiverse " eg. a universe may consist only of electrons or only of neutrinos when 2 membranes or strings collide , they create new membranes and new string the Big Bang could then be a collision of parallel " universes " in the 11th dimension as the rippling " walls " of each universe collided with each other resulting in resonation of string creating a new universe this theory finally can explain many previously inexplicable phenomena & thus be at last a single , unifying theory : what created the Big Bang the existence of time prior to the Big Bang the reason gravitational force is so weak may be that it emanates from a distant , connected parallel universe at the end of the 11th dimension tunnel some believe that a new universe could be created in the laboratory by effectively creating a new Big Bang thus creating a rapidly expanding universe by creating its own space , in a different dimension to ours & therefore not affecting our universe each universe " bubble " may form as a quantum fluctuation of Nothing ( quantum theory says that bubbles of energy can appear temporarily out of absolutely nothing !
normally these " pop " , but to survive , it must have an intense outward push ) our universe can be viewed as : the membrane of a 4 dimensional ( 3 space & 1 time ) bubble with the centre filled with hyper - space .
the bubble is floating in 11 dimensional hyper - space it may be connected to a parallel universe to explain the gravitational forces the dark matter and black holes in our universe may actually be out - buddings of ' child ' universes one theory says that our nearest universe bubble may be 1 millimetre away from us
the F - theory : held by only a minority of physicists , adds a 2nd time dimension to M- theory

Until a couple of days ago , my bookshelf was filled with binders with old lecture notes from school .
The truth is that I do n’t think I ever opened one of these binders after I finished the final for the class .
Yet , I did n’t want to throw it all away , since it might come handy some day when I want to refresh my memory .
On the other hand these binders really bothered me .
They took up space in the bookshelf that I could use for something more useful .
So I thought , why do n’t I digitalize these papers ?
This solution includes :
A scanner ( preferably with ADF )
A software called PDFLab
A staple remover
Quite a bit of time
You may want to use this guide for the archiving of old :
Bills
Financial documents
Lecture notes
Receipts
1. Preparing your documents
Prepare the documents you want to scan .
That means figuring out how you want to group your documents and removing the staples .
Since I was scanning lecture notes , the grouping was quite simple .
Removing the staples is a boring job , but it needs to be done .
In the process of scanning …
2. Scanning your documents
This is the time consuming part .
Depending on your hardware , the time the scanning takes varies a lot .
With the scanner I was using ( HP Scanjet 5590 ) , one paper ( front and back ) probably took about 35 seconds in 150 DPI .
If you have a scanner with ADF , it does n’t really matter that much if it takes 10 or 40 minutes to scan a pile of papers , since you can go and do something else in the meantime .
Depending on the software you ’re using , the file - output might differ .
In the software I was using , the name ‘ bus - law_0_0.jpg ’ turned out to be working quite well .
The first ‘ 0 ’ is for the sequence .
If for some reason the scanning aborts , you can just continue with ‘ bus - law_1_0.jpg ’ , and the files will still sort in order .
3. Preview and delete blanks
When you ’ve scanned in one entire group of documents , select them all and drag them to Preview .
Use the arrow - keys to browse through all the documents to make sure they look good .
You might want to rotate some documents , or delete some blank pages .
I found the shortcut ‘ Apple + Delete ’ very handy in Preview , since then I can delete the file from Preview , without having to go out in Finder .
4. Convert your documents to a PDF
Screenshot of PDFLab
Up to this point you just have a bunch of jpeg files in a folder somewhere .
Since this is not very convenient when you browse notes , I wanted to convert every group to a single PDF - file .
When doing my research I found a very handy software called PDFLab .
The software is a freeware and works really well .
Download PDFLab and fire it up .
Now go to the folder where you saved all those jpeg files .
Select them all , and drag them to PDFLab .
This might take a couple of minutes , depending on your hardware .
When the files are imported into PDFLab , sort them by name by clicking ‘ Name ’ .
Now look through the list .
If you have file names that go above 100 ( ‘ bus-law_0_0100.jpg ’ ) , the sorting might not be done properly , since the file ‘ bus - law_0_0103 , jpg ’ is sorted before ‘ bus - law_0_013.jpg ’ .
If you experience this , you need to move around the files manually until they are in the proper sequence .
When you ’re happy with the sorting , hit ‘ Create PDF , ’ and enter an output file - name in the dialog which appears .
If the PDF was generated without any errors , you ’re all set .
If you get an error message when generating the PDF , just hit OK , and try to create it again .
If this does n’t work , try to restart the software .
5. Delete / Backup the image - files
When you ’ve made sure that your PDF is working fine , you can either delete you jpeg files or burn them to a CD just to be safe .
That ’s it .
You can now throw away all those papers into the recycle bin .
The best thing is that you ’re never more than a couple of clicks away from your documents .
Empty binders
6. Drawbacks
This solution is not perfect , but it ’s sure better than having all those binders in the bookshelf or in a box somewhere .
The main drawback of this is that the documents are not searchable .
This could possibly be solved with OCR , but according to my experience , OCR is still not powerful enough to recognize all handwriting .
OCR also tend to mess up documents which mix text and images .
However , if I was able to scan these documents into a PDF with OCR recognition , this would be the optimal solution , since it would both be searchable and consume less space .
When Associated Producers , the production company behind the new documentary The Lost Tomb of Jesus , contacted Andrey Feuerverger , he was , to put it mildly , surprised .
" This is not in the usual run of things one gets to do , " says the University of Toronto statistician , alluding to Associated Producers ' somewhat unusual request that he calculate the odds that a particular tomb in Israel is the last resting place of Jesus Christ .
Despite his previous lack of interest in biblical archaeology , Feuerverger spent two years crunching numbers for what turned out to be a labor of love .
At the end of all of his figuring , he told the documentarians , including director James Cameron of Titanic fame and award - winning investigative journalist Simcha Jacobovici , that there was a one in 600 chance that the names — Jesus , Matthew , two versions of Mary , and Joseph — scribbled on five of the 10 ossuaries ( or caskets for bones ) found in the Talpiot tomb could have belonged to a different family than the one described in the New Testament .
When Cameron and Simcha announced Feuerverger 's calculations along with a package of other evidence ( including forensics , DNA and archaeology ) earlier this week , it sparked a media firestorm .
Some news outlets reported that Feuerverger 's odds had really been as high as one in a million , which the statistician denies .
That " is not a number I would want to ever think originates with me , " he says .
Meanwhile biblical historian James Tabor of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte , the primary historical advisor on the production team , reported on his blog that he calculated the odds were one in 250,000 that another family of that period would have the same names as those scrawled on the bone boxes .
Even the Discovery Channel , which is set to air the controversial documentary on Sunday , March 4 , seemed confused by Feuerverger 's calculations , declaring on its
Web site that that the odds are " 600 to one in favor of this being the JESUS FAMILY TOMB . "
What Are We Calculating Here , Anyway ?
Feuerverger says he was neither asked nor did he attempt to calculate the odds that the Talpiot tomb was the final resting place of Christ , the Messiah .
As Aleks Jakulin , a statistician at Columbia University , points out , " I doubt Professor Feuerverger really estimated ' the odds that these ossuaries were not Jesus 's family 's final resting place . '
Instead & one should say that one in 600 families ( on the conservative side ) would have that particular combination of names purely by chance , based on the distribution of individual names in the population . "
Such a calculation assumes all kinds of things , and is highly dependent on one 's starting assumptions .
For instance , " A Christian would use [ the probability that Jesus is in a coffin ] equals zero , because of ascension , so the discussion stops right there , " Jakulin says .
" Someone else would instead assume that there was a single Jesus , one out of five million . "
A Statistical Analysis Is Only as Good as Its Starting Assumptions
" I have to tell you that a statistician working with a subject matter expert , in this case biblical historical scholars , essentially is obliged to rely on assumptions that come from them , " explains Feuerverger .
" It 's not a secret that the assumptions are contestable .
I tried to stay with things that vaguely seemed reasonable to me , but I 'm not a biblical scholar .
At the end of the day , I went with specific assumptions and I try to make clear what those assumptions were . "
Among the assumptions that Feuerverger made to yield his odds : that the scholarly text he used as a source of names ( to determine the frequency and distribution of Jewish monikers in the era of Jesus ) was a representative sample of the five million Jews who lived during that era .
He assumed this even though the text , called the Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity was published in 2002 and only includes 2,509 names .
Scan The Lexicon of Jewish Names , which includes names from ossuaries , ancient texts and every other source available , and you will learn that the names unearthed in the so - called Jesus Family Tomb were among the most common of that era .
One in every three women listed in the Lexicon was named Mary , for instance , and , at that time , one in every 20 Jewish men was called Yeshua , or Jesus .
Tal Ilan , who compiled the Lexicon of Jewish Names and who vehemently disagrees with the assertion that this could be Jeus 's tomb , says that the names found in the tomb " are in every tomb in Jerusalem .
You can get all kinds of clever people who know statistics who will tell you that the combination is the unique thing about [ these names ] , and probably they 're right - if you want just exactly this combination it 's more difficult to find .
But my research proves exactly the opposite - these are the most common names that you could expect to find anywhere . "
It was only when Feuerverger assumed that some of the names were exceptional , and fit with scholars ' beliefs about the historical family of Jesus , that his calculation became worthy of advertising .
According to Feuerverger , the most important assumption by far was the one that dealt with the inscription that appears on the ossuary that the documentarians assert belonged to Mary Magdalene .
" The extraordinariness of the Mariemene e Mara inscription gets factored into the calculation as a very rare name , " says Feuerverger .
By the logic of the historians and archaeologists enlisted by the production team , this inscription is so rare that Feuerverger could safely assume that this was the only woman who possessed this name out of all of those listed in the Lexicon .
This changed the odds that this tomb belonged to just any Mary Magdalene from roughly one in three to one in 80 .
A Debate Rages Over the Archaeology Behind the Statistics
Other scholars think the assertion that the inscription Mariemene e Mara , written in Greek , refers specifically to Mary Magdalene is ridiculous .
Jodi Magness , an archaeologist with an interest in early Judaism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , argues that any Jews buried in Jerusalem who were not natives would have had their home towns appended to their names when they were inscribed on ossuaries .
( Despite scholars ' beliefs that Jesus 's entire family hailed from outside Jerusalem , none of the inscriptions on the ossuaries in the contested burial cave include other birthplaces . )
Magness also believes that if Jesus 's family were wealthy enough to own a burial cave , it would have been in his home town of Nazareth and not in Jerusalem .
U.N.C. Charlotte historian Tabor , a consultant on the documentary , pooh - poohs the naysayers .
" Mariemene e Mara means ' of Mariemenu , the Master , ' " he says .
" This is a title .
It means ' This is the ossuary of Mariemene , known as the Mara . ' "
His opinion — which is consistent with Feuerverger 's assumptions but clashes with those of many of his peers — is that this is a completely unique name , supporting his hypothesis that this is the grave of the Mary Magdalene .
Tabor also disagrees with critics who dismiss the fundamental premise of his and Feuerverger 's calculations — that the family of Jesus would have been buried in caves typical of wealthier Jews and not in the shallow dirt graves that were common in that era .
To some extent , this is a debate over the nature of evidence .
Many biblical scholars and archaeologists , including Magness , accept that the gospels of the New Testament have some historicity to them , because they are the only direct historical accounts of the death of Jesus .
But Tabor , on his blog , quotes scholars who argue that there is no reason these texts should be given more weight than any other piece of evidence .
Tabor responds to the charges that it is improbable that Jesus and his family had a burial cave in Jerusalem by noting that " if you know anything about messianic movements , the followers provide for their leader — they do n't just throw him in a ditch when he dies .
&
Think of any Jewish sect — they take care of their rabbi .
There 's no evidence this family ever went back to Galilee .
James [ Jesus 's brother ] dies in Jerusalem , Mary and his brothers are there — there 's no indication that anybody went back to Nazareth . "
In other words , Tabor argues that it is not only likely that the family of the Jesus could have afforded a burial cave , but that it most likely would have opted for one in Jerusalem .
Both sides of this debate are extraordinarily difficult to prove given the paucity of historical evidence , something this controversy has in common with nearly all archaeological and historical disputes .
" As archaeologists we are always reconstructing a picture based on incomplete evidence , " notes Magness .
As a result , the calculations made by Feuerverger and others rest on premises that must be decided by historians and archaeologists , who are still far from agreement on even the basics of the Talpiot tomb .
" I did permit the number one in 600 to be used in the film — I 'm prepared to stand behind that but on the understanding that these numbers were calculated based on assumptions that I was asked to use , " says Feuerverger .
" These assumptions do n't seem unreasonable to me , but I have to remember that I 'm not a biblical scholar . "
How To Insert TrustInfo into Manifest to Identify the Application Security Requirements on Windows Vista
Developers need a way to deploy the same build of the application on both Windows Vista and Windows XP .
However , a new feature of Windows Vista , User Access Control ( UAC ) causes processes to run as standard user even if you are logged in with a user that is the member of the Administrators group .
If your application needs administrative privileges , and you want it to run elevated as an administrator , you have to create and embed an application UAC manifest for your application that identifies the privilege level and tells Vista to run the application elevated .
Resource Tuner allows you to patch a pre-existing binary exe to inject the Require Administrator info into it so that it would be forced to run as Administrator on Windows Vista , providing the application the same operational behavior as in Windows XP .
A modified exe should still work correctly on prior Windows operating systems .
 I tried using mt.exe [ from MS Visual Studio ] to manifest my files .
It worked on some but not on others .
It seems your method of parsing the .EXE is more robust than the one that mt. exe uses .

Manifests were used in Windows XP to help application developers identify which versions of ComCtl DLLs the application was tested with .
The Windows Vista application manifest schema has been enhanced with attributes that allow developers to mark their applications with a requested execution level .
These new attributes indicate to the system that you have a legitimate administrative application .
The system will automatically ask for approval from the user to launch the application with full privileges .
Microsoft has implemented an extension to the trustInfo section of the current Windows XP application manifest schema .
The following is the format for this :
<requestedExecutionLevel
level= " asInvoker|highestAvailable|requireAdministrator "
uiAccess =" true|false " />
where
level
asInvoker —
The application runs with the same token as the parent process .
— The application runs with the same token as the parent process .
highestAvailable —
The application runs with the highest privileges the current user can obtain .
— The application runs with the highest privileges the current user can obtain .
requireAdministrator —
The application runs only for administrators and requires that the application be launched with the full token of an administrator .
If only a small number of features in an application will require administrative privileges ( for example , an application needs to configure a firewall ) , the main process of the application must still be run as a standard user .
The administrative features must be moved into a separate process that runs with administrative privileges .
uiAccess
false —
The application does not need to drive input to the UI of another window on the desktop .
Applications that are not providing accessibility should set this flag to false .
Applications that are required to drive input to other windows on the desktop ( on - screen keyboard , for example ) should set this value to true .
— The application does not need to drive input to the UI of another window on the desktop .
Applications that are not providing accessibility should set this flag to false .
Applications that are required to drive input to other windows on the desktop ( on - screen keyboard , for example ) should set this value to true .
true —
The application is allowed to bypass UI protection levels to drive input to higher privilege windows on the desktop .
This setting should only be used for UI Accessibility applications .
Applications that request uiAccess=true must have a valid , trusted digital signature to execute .
Six Easy Steps to Add the TrustInfo Section
1. Download Resource Tuner , open your file , and expand the Manifest folder that ’s found in the Resource Tree view ; select the Manifest resource to be edited in the Resource Tree .
Note :
If your file has no manifest at all , skip all these steps and use Manifest Wizard instead .
2 . You will see the XML script .
It may look something like this :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " standalone = " yes " ?>
< assembly xmlns=" urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1 " manifestVersion = " 1.0 " >
< assembly Identity
name= " Microsoft .Windows.MyCoolApp "
processorArchitecture= " x86 "
version = " 5.1.0.0 "
type=" win32 " />
< description > Application description here </ description >
< dependency >
< dependentAssembly >
< assembly Identity

</assembly >
3 . The important thing to note is that there should be no trustInfo statement in this manifest at this time .
4 . Now we are going to insert the trust info into this manifest .
Press the Resource Editor button to edit the selected manifest .
Or simply double - click the manifest item directly .
5. Insert the TrustInfo section into the manifest :
<!--
Identify the application security requirements .
-->
<!-- level can be " asInvoker " , " highestAvailable " , or " requireAdministrator " -->
< trustInfo xmlns=" urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2 " >
< security >
< requested Privileges >
<requestedExecutionLevel
level=" requireAdministrator "
uiAccess = " false " />
</requested Privileges >
</security >
</trustInfo >

" Good times , noodle salad " is essentially a designation for envy .
In one of the most extraordinary movies of the 90s , As Good as It Gets , there is a scene where Helen Hunt ’s character , Carol , expresses sympathy for her gay friend , played by Greg Kinnear .
He tells the story of how his childhood was made wretched by being gay and having a father who would not accept his lifestyle and thus rejected him .
Jack Nicholson plays Melvin , a most unsympathetic oaf who averts empathy in favor of his usual callousness :
Carol ( to gay friend ) : “ OK , we all have these terrible stories to get over , and you — “
Melvin : “ It ’s not true .
Some have great stories , pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad .
Just no one in this car .
But , a lot of people , that ’s their story .
Good times , noodle salad .
What makes it so hard is not that you had it bad , but that you ’re that p***ed that so many others had it so good . ”
Envy is certainly a terrible evil , and it brings forth the consequences of government intervention , redistribution , and a socialist framework for societies .
Instead of exploring the phenomenology of envy , however , I want to raise a question that is worth contemplating : what happens when the State concocts the noodle salad and provides for the " good times " ?
The Roman poet Juvenal coined a phrase , panem et circenses , translated as " bread and circuses " .
It described how the ruling elite kept the masses docile by providing them with State offerings — parcels of food and mass entertainment — in order to keep their minds off society and State and avoid unrest amongst the citizenry .
“ Now that no one buys our votes , the public has long since cast off its cares ; the people that once bestowed commands , consulships , legions , and all else , now meddles no more and longs eagerly for just two things — bread and circuses . ”
In modern times , here in America , the ruling elites consider themselves to be blessed by a representative democracy and a collection of constitutional amendments that allows them free range to direct the entire economy on a whim , as surely as the sun rises each morning .
The bread and circuses , in the modern sense , are monetary , and the device that supplies the clownery and acts as the rolling pin flattening the collective dough is the Federal Reserve System .
The Fed is the ace - in - the - hole for the State ’s charmed circle in their quest for rule over the nation ’s economy — and thus control of the individuals that comprise the market system .
Patrick Brantlinger , in his book Bread and Circuses , points to them as being a necessary narcotic for the masses .
Conversely , instead of providing public games of carnage and free grain and olive oil , as did the Romans , the modern State , through its monetary monopoly , has been providing two principal narcotics for the public at large : the housing bubble and a system of easy , almost unlimited credit .
Americans are stepping up to mainline this new kind of drug known as debt .
Instant money , after all , is something that satisfies their craving for on - the - spot gratification and pacifies their anxieties about their status in the social order .
Indeed , one can have it all , at the drop of a ( fiat ) coin , and without the standard save - and - wait period which earlier generations experienced .
For instance , the starter home is no longer a viable concept for many young home buyers .
The 2,000 + square foot newlywed manor — with the obligatory swanky zip code — is a must - have for many middle - class shoppers .
Even the " previously - owned " home carries with it a ho - hum connotation .
Many young couples , in their thirties , are already on new construction home number three , or even four .
Oddly enough , home buyers are never quite happy with each successive purchase , and thus every few years will find them buying bigger and better .
Extravagant home purchases are oftentimes justified on the grounds that " it ’s a good investment . "
Not so .
Speculators who flip houses while seeking profit and managing risk are attempting an " investment . "
A home for living purposes , however , is never an investment — it ’s a durable consumer good that provides shelter , utility , and a piece of the " good life " that we seek for ourselves and our loved ones .
What ’s noteworthy is that household debt , bank card delinquencies , and bankruptcies have reached all - time highs in recent years .
Depending upon whose statistics are the most precise , the rate of household savings , as a percentage of disposable income , has fallen to almost a half of one percent , down from as high as 3.4 percent in 2001 and 7.9 percent in the early 1990s .
Lower savings are due to a spending frenzy following years of tumbling interest rates , thanks to the Federal Reserve ’s policies .
Borrowing to buy cars , furniture , electronics , clothes , homes , and even plastic surgery has become the norm .
Retail America is riding this roller coaster of cheap money , and not surprisingly , even while retailers endure the higher costs of staying in business and lower revenues and / or profits , they take to offering every breathing consumer the opportunity to " have now , pay later , " courtesy of the Fed ’s discounted lending rates .
Here in 2006 we are awash with big - ticket retailers offering terms of no payments and no interest until distant points in the future — sometimes as far away as 2010 .
By taking advantage of the centrally - planned , economic environment thus can retailers take to the illusion of profitability by making sales and moving inventory , even though the risks involved in deferring the collection of cash payments can be enormous .
The lending banks , however , enabled by the Fed , absorb the risk of non-payment of interest .
But with government - supplied insurance and / or bailouts covering their backs , where ’s the incentive to maintain sanity - in - lending ?
Additionally , the auto industry in Detroit has been riding the same lively rollercoaster , and it ’s been hard times for all involved as the bottom has started to fall out on that industry ’s illusion of profitability .
For example , when cars are cheaply financed , even the " poorest " among us can own them without encountering much opposition from the credit structure .
Thus , cheap money means that financing a new automobile results in payments nearly as low — or lower — than leasing it .
This drives out the lease option , in many cases , because owning a $ 30,000 SUV becomes a reality to even the barely - above - minimum - wage crowd .
Statistics show that leases accounted for just under 30 % of all retail auto sales in 2001 , but as the interest rates steadily dropped for the ensuing four years , buyers on the margin — who otherwise could not afford an auto purchase — became empowered by cheaper financing .
Therefore , leasing rates dropped from " 29.2 percent of retail car sales in January 2001 to 21.7 percent in October 2004 . "
Meanwhile , purchasing incentives , or rebates , have risen " from $ 2,295 per vehicle in January 2001 to $ 3,521 in April 2003 and $ 4,249 in November 2004 . "
Moving cars and counting sales , however , is not necessarily equated with profitability .
On the other hand , when money becomes less available , and the Fed tightens its grip on the printing presses and interest rates , the market tends toward leases as the auto industry seeks to keep line workers working , and inventory moving , as they offer up one unprofitable lease deal after another .
For the auto companies , jumping from the " no profitability " lease stage to the giveaway purchase incentive phase has not been a profitable venture .
Many significant auto industry manufacturers have filed for chapter 11 bankruptcies in the last two years , and countless other manufacturers are pursuing out - of - court or international restructuring plans .
Delphi , formerly a $ 30 billion dollar supplier will likely emerge from bankruptcy two - thirds that size or less .
Visteon has turned to Ford for bailout assistance .
Other big - time auto suppliers running to bankruptcy court are Tower Automotive , Dana Corp. , Collins & Aikman , Venture Industries , and Federal Mogul .
ArvinMeritor has restructured its debt and is doing exactly what it needs to do to avoid calamity : planning for plant closings and diversifying its business far beyond Detroit and all of its problems .
Not surprisingly , Ford and General Motors have balance sheets that look like a sharpshooter ’s target at 50 yards .
In addition , the public is being saturated with countless announcements of accounting scandals , snafus , or restatements , as public companies scramble to keep up with quarterly earnings expectations from bearish Wall Street zealots whose philosophical underpinnings are in sync with the Fed ’s money - pumping , inflationary schemes .
In the housing sector , one city after another is experiencing bubble mania , until suddenly , bubble meets pin .
Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanly notes ( in a June 2005 article ) :
Today , nationwide US house - price inflation is at a 25 - year high in real terms .
That does n’t mean every home in the country has hit bubble - like valuations .
But in the first quarter of 2005 , double - digit house - price inflation was evident in 23 states plus the District of Columbia .
In 25 of the top 100 metropolitan areas , the rate of home price appreciation was at least 20 % .
Investors — not owners — are currently accounting for 11.5 % of newly - originated conventional mortgage loans ; that ’s up from a 2 % low in late 1995 .
And mortgage financing has shifted dramatically in recent years into exotic and risky floating rate obligations such as interest - only and negative - amortization loans ; moreover , as Tom Lawler of Fannie Mae notes , this shift into floating - rate borrowing cannot be explained by the factors that traditionally drive such trends — the level of mortgage rates and yield curve spreads .
Something else must at work .
… The US is very much in control of its own destiny insofar as coping with the excesses in asset markets .
In that important respect , America ’s equity and property bubbles have one key ingredient in common :
The principal blame for both bubbles , in my view , lies with the Federal Reserve .
Once again , marginal buyers enter into the housing market — lured by easy money , bountiful lending practices , and the opportunity to purchase overpriced , fantasy homes on " buy now , pay later " terms .
According to press releases from Merrill Lynch , America ’s hottest housing markets — read : housing bubble areas — are seeing the ARM ( adjustable rate mortgage ) account for over half of all home sales .
Most people still do n’t think there is any such thing as a housing bubble , so they continue to spend and " invest " in housing .
An ARM still ca n’t afford you a fool ’s paradise ?
Then disregard paying your principle and go for broke with an interest - only mortgage , once a luxury financing alternative that private banks offered to wealthy individuals that has now become a financial hustle marketed for the housing bubble and the dupes that ply within .
In an article titled " Our Credit Crunch , " The Motley Fool tendered some hard facts :
A long time ago , we were a nation of cash - rich , house - poor people .
Then , we became house rich and cash poor .
Today , we ’re a nation that ’s credit dependent and cash broke .
That ’s right : Broke .
Completely bust .
According to a Business Week report , total household debt — including car loans , mortgage , and student loans — topped 100 % of disposable annual income last year for the first time ever .
Contrast that to 20 years ago when the nation ’s debt stood at just two - thirds of our disposable income .
On average , we carry eight cards per person and have a balance of $ 8,400 in credit card debt .
Twenty percent of our cards are maxed out , reports CardWeb.com , which tracks the lending industry ’s machinations .
And just 40 % of Americans pay off their accounts in full at the end of the month .
… It ’s not just that we ’re borrowing more money and paying it back more slowly ; it ’s that we ’re spending money we used to consider off - limits .
Home equity loans are more popular than ever as people borrow against their home to feed their spending binge .
Today , average homeowners owe nearly 50 % of their home ’s value .
Twenty years ago that figure stood at 30 % .
Ca n’t you just picture the modern - day needlepoint plaque ?
“ Home , Sweet Credit Line . ”
The " have pulse , will loan " approach brought forth by the Fed ’s loose monetary policy is akin to a " No Adult Left behind " policy for the credit - intoxicated masses .
With real wages being near stagnant — after factoring in the government ’s inflation figures , which are likely low — it comes to bear that Americans are losing ground through inflation , and thus are financing their continued extravagant standard of living through debt .
The problem is that as these individuals become more highly leveraged , long - range planning ceases to progress , and in fact it abruptly retards as the debtors become more focused on daily survival .
They abstain from long - term strategy in order to sustain current , day - to - day operations .
Hence the government - coerced shift of time preferences from low to high as we move from an economy of saving and capital investment to one of spend - and - consume .
Consequently , we witness the decline of savings , wealth , and legitimate entrepreneurial investment — all of which are necessary for the advancement of a free market economy .
However , in order for the State to maintain its kingmaker ’s turf , the good times and noodle salad must go on , and in as veiled a manner as possible .
In a stunning move by the Federal Reserve , in late 2005 it announced that it was going to stop publishing the numbers for the M3 money supply — this means that the public will not know the total amount of money circulating in the United States at any one time .
M3 is the combination of the four following measurements : M0 ( all coins and paper currency ) , M1 ( M0 + all checking accounts ) , M2 ( M1 + savings accounts , money market accounts , and CDs < $ 100 k ) , and M3 ( M2 + all other CDs , deposits of euro dollars , and repurchase agreements > $ 100 k ) .
A Federal Reserve spokesperson , when asked about the discontinued published figures , replied :
The decision to discontinue publication of the M3 monetary aggregate was based , in part , on a determination that the M3 does not appear to convey any additional information about economic activity that is not already embodied in the M2 aggregate .
In addition , the role of M3 in the policy process has diminished greatly over time .
Consequently , the costs of collecting the data and publishing M3 now seem to outweigh the benefits .
M3 , in fact , has risen much faster than M2 over the last year .
Since M3 is no longer public information , it is evident that the Fed can hide its numerous market manipulation activities under the guise of a " cost - benefit " approach .
However , since government entities cannot calculate a profit , such an approach is irrational — if not impossible .
Instead , what the Fed achieves is a lack of transparency in regards to creeping inflation and a looming market crash .
Let the legal counterfeiting begin .
One congressman , Ron Paul of Texas ( who else ? ) , has introduced legislation to counter the Fed ’s move and require the reporting of M3 statistics .
It ’s unlikely , however , that this peoples ’ hero can run over an entire division with a standing Army of only one .
Eventually , unstable conditions within the economic environment — such as we are beginning to experience with inflation , the stock market , housing bubble , and Federal Reserve coming unhinged — render the good times unsustainable , and thus the consumer shopping and debt frenzy tanks and takes with it the wealth of individuals .
Bubbles , you see , occur by government design , and they have the effect of pacifying the masses into docile state as they get to experience a pseudo - luxury lifestyle that is not a genuine step ahead in the fiscal pecking order , but rather , is wholly of the " live now , pay later " variety .
The government is good at creating the illusion of wealth and profitability through centrally - planned policies that corrupt the monetary system and skew the markets .
The result is a euphoria among the masses that leads to the binge buying of consumer goods , leaving the populace with a delusion of " sound economic times " and enhanced personal wealth .
On the contrary , the government ’s bubbles — of both the asset and credit variety — have left America well - supplied with members of the " Two - Thousandaires Club " : those with oversized , luxury homes ; the BMW and the Hummer ; vacations to exclusive resorts overseas ; gas , groceries , Starbucks , and dance lessons purchased on plastic ; and $ 2,000 in the bank .
So , like powder up the nose , fiat dough up the wazoo becomes the stimulation that provides the entertainment — or rather , the bread and circuses — that keeps Americans fat and happy , and far from a state of unrest .
With the masses driving cars they otherwise could n’t afford , living in dwellings far beyond their means , and furnishing their house and lifestyle through plastic and unsustainable debt - to - income ratios , the ticking time bomb is getting louder and louder .
William Bonner and Addison Wiggin , in Financial Reckoning Day , wrap up their exceptional 2003 book with these words of wisdom :
The trends that could not last forever seem to be coming to an end .
Consumers cannot continue to go deeper into debt .
Consumption cannot continue to take up more and more of the GDP .
Capital investment and profits cannot go down much farther .
Foreigners will not continue to finance Americans ’ excess consumption until the Second Coming — at least not at the current dollar price .
And fiat paper money will not continue to outperform the real thing — gold — forever .
America will have to find a new model , for it can no longer hope to spend and borrow its way to prosperity .
This is not a cyclical change , but a structural one that will take a long time .
Structural reforms — that is , changing the way that an economy functions — do not happen overnight .
The machinery of collectivized capitalism resists any change of sort .
The Fed tries to buoy the old modal with cheaper and cheaper money .
Government comes forward with multibillion - dollar spending programs to try to stimulate real demand .
And the poor lumpeninvestoriat — bless their greedy little hearts — will never give up the dream of American consumer capitalism ; it will have to be crushed out of them .
In 1854 Henry David Thoreau said , " It is said that the British Empire is very large and respectable , and that the United States are a first - rate power .
We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind every man which can float the British Empire like a chip , if he should ever harbor it in his mind . ”
Unfortunately , it ’s likely that Americans overall are too fat and happy with their daily dose of the State ’s noodle salad to ever stop , think , and challenge the status quo , let alone take on a role of insurgency against the entrenched establishment when they can instead delight in Fed - induced , ostensible luxury .
Subsequently , let the games begin .

ComputerWorld has an article about how recruiters use web anonymity to find more information out about job applicants .
In a 2006 survey by executive search firm ExecuNet in Norwalk , Conn. , 77 of 100 recruiters said they use search engines to check out job candidates .
In a CareerBuilder.com survey of 1,150 hiring managers last year , one in four said they use Internet search engines to research potential employees .
One in 10 said they also use social networking sites to screen candidates .
In fact , according to Search Engine Watch , there are 25 million to 50 million proper - name searches performed each day .
They go on to list some tips like starting a blog , joining open source communities , building a web page , creating web profiles .
Andy pads it out with some more helpful suggestions like getting a domain name , tips for getting the number one spot for your name and controlling what appears in search results for your name .
I ’ve written about privacy , internet usage and real name searches a few times with my Facebook tips , guide to pseudonyms / identity hiding and tips on hiding your Linked In profile from searches outside of your Linked In network .
When I started this blog a year ago it was with the idea that it could help with the job hunt , but then the slew of articles I read about people losing their jobs because of blogging convinced me otherwise .
Building up an online profile * is* important factor in job hunting but the one lesson I ’d like people to remember is that the internet is archived and once something is published you lose control over it .
My current “ like - watching - a- car - crash ” fixation is reading the cyber - drama that can happen between women who have dated the same man and have both become mutually obsessed to some degree ( not linked because I respect their desire to let it go ) .
I ’d hate to have that kind of high school BS showing up as the number one search result when a stranger tried to find out more information about me .
Blogging and building an online identity around your real name can help you create a trail of expertise for people to find .
It definitely can be a good tool for networking with people in your business niche .
But it also can be littered with personal information that people are so quick to publish these days that should n’t be part of a job search ( like appearance , political beliefs , religion , and sexual orientation ) .
I ’ve run into this dilemma myself when I ’ve wondered if I should release code or a tutorial under my real name for potential future job searches or leave it under // engtech .
This would be less of a dilemma if my career had any sort of benefit from the activities I do blogging ( other than I ’m getting better at organizing my thoughts into the written form ) .
There is also a wide disparity between talking the talk and walking the walk when it comes to blogging .
Like Matt , I notice that most bloggers who are producing software do n’t have a lot of time to blog when they ’re also working on a project .
I think Dan was right when he said the best answer to the whole question of online identity impacting job search is to work for yourself so you do n’t have to worry about what future employers might think about you .
You only have to worry about what your customers think .
Identity Search Tips

Woolmer 's post mortem proved inconclusive
Woolmer , 58 , died on Sunday after collapsing at his hotel hours after Pakistan 's World Cup loss to Ireland .
Deputy commissioner Mark Shields said there was " now sufficient information to continue a full investigation " .
That investigation will be " into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Woolmer which we are now treating as suspicious , " added Shields .
There has been considerable speculation about the cause of Woolmer 's death .
Shields was asked directly at his news conference whether Woolmer was murdered , to which he responded : " No , we 're not saying that . "
Obviously ' suspicious ' could be anything at this moment
Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman
Asked if it was suicide , Shields said it would be " inappropriate to comment further at this time " as the police were still waiting for the final pathologist 's report .
Shields added : " It 's the old adage - we have to keep an open mind and that is exactly what we are doing .
We are conducting an investigation .
" It means that any sudden death will be treated as suspicious until we can show otherwise and that is what we will do .
" When we get the results back from the pathologist we 'll go to the coroner and then we can decide what to do next . "
The deputy commissioner said Woolmer 's family , the Pakistan team management , the Cricket World Cup and the International Cricket Council were being " kept informed of the ongoing investigation " .
Woolmer 's wife Gill has told an Indian news station she had received an email from him on the morning of his death .
She said : " He did mention that he was really depressed and could not believe how this could have happened . "
Pakistan 's final World Cup group match against Zimbabwe went ahead on Wednesday after a minute 's silence as a mark of respect for Woolmer .
When the investigation is completed , Woolmer 's body will be taken back to his home in Cape Town , South Africa , accompanied by team trainer Murray Stevenson .
Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman Pervez Mir told a news conference that further investigations were being carried out by medical experts .
Everybody is shocked because he was a good coach and a much better human being
Inzamam -ul - Haq
" Obviously ' suspicious ' could be anything at this moment , " Mir said .
" It could be something serious , it could be something not serious .
We have a man who is down and we do n't know the reason why . "
Woolmer , who appeared in 19 Tests for England during his playing career , had diabetes and there were reports he had recently complained of breathing difficulties .
His family say he had been suffering from stress and believe this may have brought on a heart attack .
Woolmer enjoyed great success as a coach in county cricket , winning four trophies in two seasons with Warwickshire , and also coached South Africa .
Joshua Bloch at Google ( formerly at Sun ) has an excellent presentation entitled How to Design a Good API and Why It Matters .
For each major point , he does a good job of showing both good and bad design examples from the Java APIs .
I ’ve recently been reading Framework Design Guidelines which provides guidance on designing class libraries for .
NET .
It also provides insight into the design and creation of the .NET class libraries .
Coming from Java , it ’s interesting to see how the two development cultures are reaching similar conclusions about library design .
For example , the Framework Design Guidelines provides a strong case for using classes rather than interfaces for exposing abstractions .
( You can read the details here ) .
After being in the factory / interface camp for a long time , I ’ve come around to this point of view as well .
That ’s not to say that I do n’t believe in using interfaces , just that they tended to be overused .
And as mentioned in the article , “ class - based APIs can be evolved with much greater ease than interface - based APIs ” .
Joshua ’s presentation favors unchecked exceptions over checked exceptions .
To many Java programmers this may sound like sacrilege but it ’s consistent with .NET exception handling .
In an interview with Anders Hejlsberg , Bruce Eckel indicates that he used to think that checked exceptions were really great .
But often , they felt like handcuffs .
After working in C# for several months I do n’t miss them at all .
Obviously I still use exceptions , just not exceptions that have to be declared in method signatures .
In Java we often cheated — declaring that a method threw the most general type of exception and then documenting the specific exceptions that the caller might be interested in handling .
If we had declared the specific exceptions instead then we ’d have to change the method signature if we needed to add more .
That , in a nutshell , was the major disconnect with checked exceptions .
Rights of first refusal are contract clauses common in such industries as entertainment .
In 2001 , Paramount Studios and the National Broadcasting Company negotiated the broadcasting rights for the hit show " Frasier . "
NBC held a right of first refusal that seemingly would give it an incumbent advantage .
But did it really ?
As Harvard Business School professor Alvin E. Roth and Texas A&M professor Brit Grosskopf demonstrate in recent research , the devil is in the details .
And the devil gave Paramount , not NBC , the true upper hand .
Likewise the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1987 was written to protect renters in Britain when their landlord put their flat up for sale .
Renters had a right of first refusal to purchase the property .
In the end , however , the right worked against the renters .
The issue in both contracts , says Roth , who specializes in game theory , experimental economics , and market design , was that the right was structured as what he terms a Before and After Right of First Refusal ( BA - ROFR ) .
The right holder is offered an initial deal by the asset owner — the landlord offers to sell the flat to the renter for $ 100,000 , probably a relatively high price .
If the tenant rejects the deal , the landlord is free to offer the property to a third party .
But the tenant is still in the game .
If the owner and a third party agree on a price below the $ 100,000 originally offered to the tenant , the tenant has the option to acquire the property for that lower price .
Seems like a sweet opportunity for the tenant .
But the timing of the deal works in favor of the landlord , who can now present an ultimatum to the third party saying that if the third party offers a price below $ 100,000 the renter has a right to match the offer .
The BA - ROFR not only strengthens the bargaining position of the owner with the third party , but it also allows the initial offer to the tenant to be set high .
To explore the question of who actually benefits from this particular right of first refusal , the researchers conducted an experiment by designing two bargaining games that modeled a network / studio negotiation .
The resulting paper " If You Are Offered the Right of First Refusal , Should You Accept ? " is scheduled to be published later this year in the journal Games and Economic Behavior .
Sean Silverthorne : Rights of first refusal come in many forms , but your study focuses on BA - ROFR .
Why are these agreements a fertile ground for your research ?
Alvin Roth :
We noticed those because they are unusual , and because they appear to be mistakes .
Sometimes you get increased insight into how something — in this case a contract clause — works by studying the ones that do n't work so well .
( That 's a line of thought that has led me and my colleagues to study many failed markets — some of which we 've helped fix . )
Q : Your work demonstrates that before and after rights actually work to the disadvantage of the holder .
Why is this so , and is it always true ?
A : Most rights of first refusal give the right holder a last - mover advantage .
As we discuss in the paper , that conveys a lot of benefits :
It allows the right holder to move in and take good deals if they become available to third parties .
And if , as is often the case , the right holder is the incumbent user of the asset , the fact that he has such a last mover advantage may discourage third parties from investing in trying to purchase the asset .
But all that is turned upside down by the before and after rights we studied , since in those , the right holder has to exercise his right at a high price before a third party has a chance , but retains the right for any lower price .
This allows the asset owner to present any third party with an ultimatum offer :
Buy at the high price , or not at all .
By increasing the bargaining power of the asset owner in this way , the right works to the disadvantage of the right holder .
Q : How did the traditional ultimatum game and reverse ultimatum game help explain the dynamics of BA - ROFR ?
A : You might as well ask how experiments helped explain the BA - ROFR .
Contracts exist in a complicated world , and there 's a lot more going on in the renegotiation of the " Frasier " deal , or in British landlord - tenant law , than just the form of the right of first refusal clause .
So , in the laboratory , we can look at simpler situations in order to isolate the effect that particular clause has .
The ultimatum game is one of the workhorses of experimental economics , and we invented the reverse ultimatum game to allow us to study situations just like this one .
Together they allowed us to study how the clause influenced outcomes in situations in which the right holder starts off in a powerful position , or a weak one .
Q : Where BA - ROFR has been implemented , has it met the objectives of the sponsors ?
A : We doubt it .
This allows the asset owner to present any third party with an ultimatum offer :
Buy at the high price , or not at all .
Q : Why are these types of rights still used though they clearly benefit one party over another ?
Why do the parties that do n't benefit , such as the tenants cited in your study , agree to these arrangements ?
A : Contracts are big , complicated things with lots of clauses , some of which get exercised rarely if at all .
So it 's sometimes hard for bad clauses to be eliminated on the basis of experience , since the experience comes only rarely , and then too late .
Also , there are lots of parties to these contracts , e.g. , in the case of British landlord - tenant law , the clause is in national legislation .
So the correct people have to notice that it's a bad clause , and they may be concentrating on other , more immediately important clauses .
Also , it was n't obvious that this was a bad clause — that was something that Brit and I showed .
( That is n't to say that right holders may have noticed the clause was no good once it was too late . )
But there 's a good chance clauses like that have been eliminated in more recent entertainment contracts .
Q : What should managers and executives who deal in contracts take away from your study ?
A : Details matter .
What turned out to be the problem for the rights of first refusal we studied was that the order of events that the clause specified worked to the disadvantage of the right holder .
If the right holder had instead retained the right to move last , and pick up the contract at any price agreed on with a third party , the bargaining power would have gone to the right holder , as it appeared to , but did n't .
Q : What are you working on now ?
A : Lots of problems of economic design .
Not only do contracts need to be designed , but also markets as a whole .
( Details matter there , too , and the wrong details can lead to bad outcomes . )
My colleagues and I have recently helped redesign the labor market for gastroenterologists , the high school choice system for New York City , and the school choice system at all levels for Boston .
And we 've helped set up the New England Program for Kidney Exchange .
And I 'm the chair of a committee of the American Economic Association to recommend changes that we should make in the marketplace for new Ph.D. economists .
As is the case with the study of contracts , we learn a lot about how to design successful markets by examining failures .
The market for law clerks for appellate court judges is one we 're watching closely in that regard .
First things first , exactly what is guerrilla marketing ?
The term now covers a plethora of different marketing techniques but I rather like Marketing Terms ' definition , which says " unconventional marketing intended to get maximum results for minimal resources . "
Now , does n't that sound like a great approach for cash strapped online businesses ?
Take the magazine FHM , who projected a 60 - foot high image of Gail Porter 's backside onto the Houses of Parliament to promote its 1999 poll to find the world 's sexiest women .
Then there was IBM who employed a graffiti artist to paint pavements and walls in San Francisco and Chicago with the words ' Peace , love and Linux ' .
The site About.com sent out fake hitchhikers onto Highway 101 in the States to give out promotional masks to any kind driver that stopped to pick them up .
These campaigns all focus on creating a buzz around a product or service ; it 's then passed on by word of mouth as people talk about in pubs .
Ketamine proved effective in under two hours
The study involving 17 patients found ketamine - used as an anaesthetic but also taken as a recreational drug - relieved symptoms of depression .
Most existing treatments for depression take weeks or even months to relieve people 's symptoms .
But the team , writing in Archives of General Psychiatry , said ketamine would need to be altered so it lost its existing hallucinatory side - effects .
This is the first report of any medication or other treatment that results in such a pronounced , rapid , prolonged response
Dr Thomas Insel , NIMH
Scientists from the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) injected 17 patients with either a very low dose of ketamine or a placebo of saline solution .
The participants were all depression sufferers who had tried an average of six treatments that had failed .
The researchers then measured their levels of depression minutes , hours and days after the dose was given .
Lead researcher Dr Carlos Zarate Junior , head of the mood and anxiety disorders programme at NIMH , said : " Within 110 minutes , half of the patients given ketamine showed a 50 % decrease in symptoms . "
By the end of day one , he added , 71 % had responded to the drug .
And at this point the team found 29 % of these patients were nearly symptom free .
The researchers also discovered one dose lasted for at least a week in more than one - third of the participants .
Brain pathways
Dr Thomas Insel , director of NIMH , commented : " To my knowledge , this is the first report of any medication or other treatment that results in such a pronounced , rapid , prolonged response with a single dose .
" These were very treatment - resistant patients . "
Many antidepressants target levels of brain chemicals , such as serotonin and dopamine , and , over time , the accumulation of these chemicals can affect a patient 's mood .
But this can take several weeks .
But the team believes ketamine is having a faster effect because it is targeting a different brain - protein , called the NMDA receptor , which is thought to play a critical role in learning and memory .
The team says ketamine , in its current form , would not be appropriate for medication because of side - effects at higher doses , which include hallucinations and euphoria .
Dr Zarate said : " This study is a tool to help us understand what part of ketamine is causing this effect so we can refine and develop better drugs .
" We are also looking at ways that we could use ketamine maybe in lower doses or with drugs that block its perceptual effects so we could perhaps use it clinically . "
Professor John Henry , a clinical toxicologist at St Mary 's Hospital in London , said : " This is a very interesting piece of work , very neatly done , with promising results .
" More studies need to be done to see if ketamine would work over a longer period given in repeated doses .
" The benefit of having a fast - working drug would mean people could return to work quickly , and it could reduce risk of self - harm or suicide that could happen during the time - lag that occurs with other drugs . "
The agency [ CIA ] is not blameless , and no president on my watch has had a spotless record when it comes to the CIA .
But never before have I seen the manipulation of intelligence that has played out since Bush took office .
As chief of Europe I had a front - row seat from which to observe the unprecedented drive for intelligence justifying the Iraq war .
Larry Johnson reviewed Drumheller 's new book , On The Brink , at his No Quarter blog in October .
Larry wrote :
[ B] eyond a look back at what went wrong with Iraq from an intelligence perspective , Tyler offers a devastating critique of how the Bush Administration has engaged in an unprecedented politicization of the CIA .
In corrupting the intelligence community the Bush Administration has put the nation at greater risk and hobbled an important government resource .
Here 's more from Drumheller 's interview reprinted in Salon ( questions are in italics ) -- note how he tried to warn the administration against using Curveball 's dubious claims -- and , below , there are his observations of Condoleezza Rice during an important meeting :
One of the crucial bits of information the Bush administration used to justify the invasion was the supposed existence of mobile biological weapons laboratories .
That came from a German BND source who was given the code name Curveball .
An official investigation in the United States concluded that of all of the false statements that were made , this was the most damaging of all .
I think it is , it was , a centerpiece .
Curveball was an Iraqi who claimed to be an engineer working on the biological weapons program .
When he became an asylum seeker in Germany , the BND questioned him and produced a large number of reports that were passed here through the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Curveball was a sort of clever fellow who carried on about his story and kept everybody pretty well convinced for a long time .
There are more than a few critics in Washington who claim that the Germans , because of Curveball , bear a large part of the responsibility for the intelligence mess .
There was no effort by the Germans to influence anybody from the beginning .
Very senior officials in the BND expressed their doubts , that there may be problems with this guy .
They were very professional .
I know that there are people at the CIA who think the Germans could have set stronger caveats .
But nobody says : " Here 's a great intel report , but we do n't believe it . "
There were also questions inside the CIA 's analytical section , but as it went forward , this information was seized without caveats .
The administration wanted to make the case for war with Iraq .
They needed a tangible thing -- they needed the German stuff .
They could n't go to war based just on the fact that they wanted to change the Middle East .
They needed to have something threatening to which they were reacting .
The German government was convinced that " Curveball " would not be used in the now - famous presentation that then U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell gave in 2003 before the United Nations Security Council .
I had assured my German friends that it would n't be in the speech .
I really thought that I had put it to bed .
I had warned the CIA deputy , John McLaughlin , that this case could be fabricated .
The night before the speech , then - CIA director George Tenet called me at home .
I said : " Hey , Boss , be careful with that German report .
It 's supposed to be taken out .
There are a lot of problems with that . "
He said : " Yeah , yeah .
Right .
Do n't worry about that . "
But it turned out to be the centerpiece in Powell 's presentation -- and nobody had told him about the doubts .
I turned on the TV in my office , and there it was .
So the first thing I thought , having worked in the government all my life , was that we probably gave Powell the wrong speech .
We checked our files and found out that they had just ignored it .
So the White House just ignored the fact that the whole story might have been untrue ?
The policy was set .
The war in Iraq was coming , and they were looking for intelligence to fit into the policy .
Right before the war , I said to a very senior CIA officer : " You guys must have something else , " because you always think it 's the CIA .
" There is some secret thing I do n't know . "
He said : " No .
But when we get to Baghdad , we are going to find warehouses full of stuff .
Nobody is going to remember all of this . "
In your book , you mention a very high - ranking source who told the CIA before the war that Iraq had no large active WMD program .
It has been reported that the source was Saddam Hussein 's foreign minister , Naji Sabri .
I 'm not allowed to say who that was .
In the beginning , the administration was very excited that we had a high - level penetration , and the president was informed .
I do n't think anybody else had a source in Saddam 's cabinet .
He told us that Iraq had no biological weapons , just the research .
Everything else had been destroyed after the first Gulf War .
But after a while we did n't get any questions back .
Finally the administration came and said that they were really not interested in what he had to say .
They were interested in getting him to defect .
In the end we did get permission to get back to the source , and that came from Tenet .
I think without checking with the White House , he just said : " OK .
Go ahead and see what you can do . "
So what happened ?
There were a lot of ironies throughout this whole story .
We went on a sort of worldwide chase after this fellow , and in the end , he was in one place , and our officer was in another country asking for permission to travel .
I called up people who were controlling operations , and they said : " Do n't worry about it .
It 's too late now .
The war is on .
The next time you see this guy , it will be at a war crimes tribunal . "
Should you have pressed harder ?
We made mistakes .
And it may suit the White House to have people believe in a black - and - white version of reality -- that it could have avoided the Iraq war if the CIA had only given it a true picture of Saddam 's armaments .
But the truth is that the White House believed what it wanted to believe .
I have done very little in my life except go to school and work for the CIA .
Intellectually I think I did everything I could .
Emotionally you always think you should have [ done ] something more .
Claim : Albert Einstein predicted that if something eliminated bees from our planet , mankind would soon perish .
Status : Undetermined .
Examples :
[ Higgins , 2002 ]
Berry stuck up a quotation attributed to Albert Einstein : “ If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left . ”
Origins :
One tried - and - true method for getting people to pay attention to words is to put them into the mouth of a well - known , respected figure whom the public perceives as being an expert in the subject at hand .
To make a point about whether our current political leaders are taking us down the right path , dig up an analogous quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln .
Or , to comment on the nature of war ( e.g. , when it should be fought , how it should be fought , or the consequences of fighting it ) , find a relevant example credited to Robert E. Lee or George S. Patton .
Thus is it that recent concerns over a significant and mysterious decline in the population of pollinating
honeybees ( a phenomenon attributed to everything from global warming to insecticides to radiation from cell phone towers , and now thought to be the result of a fungus ) have seen a resurgence in repetitions of a quote attributed to Albert Einstein , citations claiming the noted scientist once said “ If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth , man would have no more than four years to live . ”
This truly sounds alarming :
Bees are disappearing for reasons we can’t yet explain , and a certified genius such as Einstein noted long ago that if all the bees disappeared , we ’d soon be following them into extinction .
If the intent of propagating this quote is to get our attention , it ’s certainly been working .
Did Einstein sagely foresee an environmental crisis we ’re only just now beginning to notice ?
To answer that last question ( without denying the importance of the honeybees ) , we have to consider the related question of “ Did Einstein really say this ? ”
First off , searches of Einstein ’s writings and speeches and public statements , as well as of ( scholarly ) compilations of Einstein quotations reveal nary a reference to the “ four years ” phrase or any other statement mentioning bees ( save for a brief comparison between humans and colony insects such as ants and bees ) .
The compiler of The New Quotable Einstein also found no Einsteinian source for this quote and lists it as “ Probably Not by Einstein . ”
Secondly , even though Einstein died in 1955 , assiduous searching of a variety of databases of historical printed material ( e.g. , books , newspapers , magazines ) has so far failed to turn up any mention of this quote ( attributed to Einstein or anyone else ) antedating 1994 , when it suddenly started popping up in newspaper articles reporting on a protest in Brussels staged by beekeepers :
A pamphlet distributed [ in Brussels ] by the National Union of French Apiculture quoted Albert Einstein .
“ If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth , man would have no more than four years to live .
No more bees , no more pollination … no more men ! ”
A pamphlet distributed [ in Brussels ] by the National Union of French Apiculture quoted Albert Einstein .
“ If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth , man would have no more than four years to live .
No more bees , no moreno more men ! ”
The beekeepers ’ warnings had some heavyweight expert support .
A pamphlet distributed by the National Union of French Apiculture quoted Albert Einstein .
“ If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth , man would have no more than four years to live , ” Einstein was quoted as saying .
“ No more bees , no more pollination … no more men ! ”
Finally , Einstein was , of course , a physicist and not an entomologist or botanist ( or any other form of biologist ) .
It ’s puzzling to imagine a context in which he would have made the statement about bees now attributed to him , or why he would have been perceived as saying something noteworthy that was unknown to his fellow scientists .
The best answer probably lies in examining the context in which the earliest citations of this putative quote ( that we ’ve found so far ) appeared : a January 1994 political protest staged by European beekeepers over the issues of competition from lower - priced honey imports , artificially high prices for sugar ( used as winter feed for bees ) , and a proposed reduction of tariffs that would make imported honey products even cheaper .
A key part of that protest was beekeepers ’ issuing dire predictions that as beekeepers go , so go the bees — and as bees go , so go the food crops and other plants on which we depend :
The beekeepers claimed that if they were forced out of business , the honey bee could be eradicated in Europe since wild hives were already being decimated by a parasitic mite called varroa .
The beekeepers claimed that if they were forced out of business , the honey bee could be eradicated in Europe since wild hives were already being decimated by a parasitic mite called varroa .
So far Scotland has escaped the devastating pest , but the threat elsewhere remains .
“ Within a few years all the wild colonies will die out , ” warned John Potter from Norwich .
“ The honey bee is threatened with a rapid decline . ”
If the bees became extinct , the protesters said the impact would go well beyond the livelihoods of the EU ’s 16,000 full - time beekeepers and the some 430,000 part - timers .
Crops such as apples , pears , beans and oilseeds need bees for pollination .
British beekeepers estimate that 85 per cent of Europe ’s wildflowers are pollinated by bees and the death of the flowers could have a major impact on wildlife .
“ It ’s going to be a chain reaction , ” said Mr Potter .
All in all , this looks like a classic case of a useful quote ’s being invented and put into the mouth of a famous person for political purposes .
Sightings : Political comedian Bill Maher used the Einstein “ bee ” quote to begin his closing essay on the 20 April 2007 episode of HBO ’s Real Time with Bill Maher .

This comes as close to saying that we 're at war ( in a new cold war , anyway ) as can be found , and that we should use NATO to fight it - which is quite a significant policy step , I 'd say ...
And , as Lugar pointed out : " The use of energy as an overt weapon is not a theoretical threat of the future .
It is happening now . "
NATO , Lugar said , should resolve to treat " an attack using energy " the same way it would a land attack by conventional military forces
The belligerent rhetoric gained more volume in recent weeks with NATO , the military organisation , coming into the game , first to analyse the " threat " , but now as well to offer ways to solve it .
And over the holidays , a particularly aggressive article signed by Senator Lugar ( outgoing chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee ) was printed in the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal in its editorial pages ( sub .
only link ) .
As many of you have probably noticed , there has been an increasingly confrontational relationship between the West and Russia on the issue of gas deliveries to Europe .
Over the past year , I have traced this increase in tensions not to Russia 's behaviour , but to a clear policy choice made by the UK and the USA to demonize others ( continental Europe , for not liberalizing enough , and Russia , for supposedly being an unreliable partner ) in the face of their abrupt switch from gas self - sufficiency ( counting Canada in the case of the US ) to gas importer .
This year began with a European energy crisis caused by Russia 's cutoff of gas supplies to Ukraine , where a democratic government not to the liking of Vladimir Putin had taken power .
Because Russian gas passes through Ukraine on its way to Western Europe , the pressure also dropped in Paris and Vienna and Rome -- and Europeans suddenly realized they were dependent for electricity and warmth on an autocracy that was prepared to use energy as a tool of imperialism .
As my regular readers will know , this is a highly partial description of what happened .
I wrote at length about last year 's crisis , so I can only encourage you to go read again the following detailed posts :
Russian - Ukrainian gas deal - what 's behind it ?
( Jan. 4 , 2006 )
Russian gas cuts - why there is no need to worry ( Jan. 2 , 2006 )
Ukraine vs Russia : Tales of pipelines and dependence ( Dec. 30 , 2005 )
but I 'd note the following :
We all forget that Yuschenko was preferred to Yanukovich for the 2005 election by Putin until the West started supporting Yuschenko very obviously and Putin decided , for some reason , that he thus needed to support Yanukovich .
It is the West that made that election a West vs Russia contest , not Russia ;
The gas dispute between Russian and Ukraine had very little to do with the victory of Yuschenko in the Ukrainian election - it was a inside fight between oligarch clans that spilled over in public view .
As soon as it did become public , Gazprom reasserted its strategic interests ( to be seen as a reliable supplier ) and restored supplies before the conflict was solved .
If that conflict demonstrated anything , it is that Gazprom cares more than anything else about its reputation as a supplier , and was really unhappy to see it trashed by internal conflicts ;
.
If that conflict demonstrated anything , it is that Gazprom cares more than anything else about its reputation as a supplier , and was really unhappy to see it trashed by internal conflicts ;
Most importantly , it is not " Europeans " that discovered their gas depended on Russia .
France , Italy , Germany and Austria ( not to mention the former Soviet satellites ) have acutely been aware of that dependency for years , and have all taken steps to mitigate it , via long term contracts negotiated with high level political intervention , and a general policy to diversify of supplies .
No , those that discovered the issue were the British and the Americans , who experienced gas shortages last year because of declining domestic production , and , being self - sufficient until then , had not worried at all about the issue .
So let 's stop to make this a " European " issue , and let 's call it what it is : an Anglo - Saxon panic attack .
as someone who has long been critical of Putin 's autocratic tendencies , I 'll continue to point out the stunning hypocrisy of those that cheered Putin on when he " restored order " in the early years by fighting the evil oligarchs , but suddenly became " autocratic " when that same fight took on Western - friendly oligarchs like Khodorkhovski .
But anyway , the stage is set : " we " are fighting for our very survival against a ruthless , dictatorial regime .
It looks like the year will end the same way .
Georgia and Azerbaijan , two other Russian neighbors that have chosen not to kowtow to Putin , are scrambling to find gas supplies by Jan. 1 to make up for Russian cutbacks or to avoid a huge and predatory price increase .
So , oddly , is Belarus , which until now has been a Kremlin client -- but which has resisted a Russian demand that it turn over ownership of a key gas transit pipeline .
I am sure that a lot of people would be surprised to learn that market driven price increases are " predatory " .
Let 's all remember that the issue is that these countries are getting gas at subsidized prices - because Russia chooses to do so in exchange for political advantage .
If it feels that it is not getting the political gains it was seeking or expecting , why would it be abnormal to switch back to market conditions ?
Actually , papers like the WaPo or the WSJ , if they were consistent , should berate Georgia and Azerbaijan for selling out politically to Russia for market - distorting , and fleeting , benefits .
Paying the market price for gas sends the proper signal to their consumers and investors , and increasing prices will lead , by market mechanisms , to lower gas demand and a better allocation of resources .
Right ?
So why argue that these countries should get subsidized gas ?
From Russia ?
Western energy companies that have invested in Russia are meanwhile reeling from a crude campaign of bullying designed to force them to give up majority stakes in oil and gas fields to Kremlin - controlled companies .
Shell has already caved , allowing Gazprom to take a 50 percent stake in a huge offshore gas field .
The only country in the world where oil companies have not been " bullied " into more favorable terms for the host country is the USA - that reflects the changed balance of power between oil companies and host countries in each case - and suggests that the US government is the weakest and the least able to face oil companies .
Of course , the word ' bullying ' is used not to acknowledge that oil companies are agreeing to terms that still make sense to them under current market conditions and a balance of power which is highly unfavorable to them , considering that they are shut out of most countries that still have promising hydrocarbon reserves and that they are happy to take the terms set by those that do tolerate them .
As has been noted , Shell got a pretty good price for its stake in Sakhalin and have very little to complain about , as they 've always stated that bringing Gazprom in would be a good thing , and they were properly compensated for that act .
It would be nice to report that in the intervening months Western governments have taken steps to ensure that Russia , which supplies anywhere between 30 and 100 percent of the gas consumed by European Union countries as well as much of their oil , is not able to use this leverage for political or economic extortion .
Sadly , the opposite is true : Though " energy security " has become a favorite topic for discussion at E.U. and transatlantic summits , next to nothing has been done about it .
What blatant manipulation of numbers .
Russia supplies anywhere between 30 and 100 % of the gas consumed by countries that import Russian gas , but many European countries do not actually import gas from Russia , and Russian gas only makes up 19 % of EU consumption .
And to say that next to nothing has been done is just as false .
The fact is that the war - mongering solutions has not been approved by those countries that actually import Russian gas .
Instead , they have focused on extending their contracts with Gazprom , as ENI and GDF recently did - thus extending the solid long term contractual relationship with Gazprom they 've already had for decades and which has worked well for both sides so far .
That 's partly because solutions are n't easy .
Weakening Russia 's hold over European energy supplies requires measures that would be costly and difficult , such as building new terminals for importing liquefied natural gas or new pipelines to carry oil and gas from Central Asia and the Caucasus to Europe .
The easiest , and never mentioned , solution , of course , would be to lower our gas demand instead of continuing our mindless policies to burn ever more of the stuff .
In particular , we could focus on changing our electricity sector policies , which seem to have a single goal in mind : build more gas - fired power plants .
But no , as always the focus is on finding MORE SUPPLIES .
There 's a less excusable problem , however : the failure of European Union governments to agree on either a common energy strategy or a policy for responding to Russia 's growing aggressiveness .
Some politicians , like German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , propose a new Ostpolitik that would entice Russian cooperation with offers of economic and strategic partnership .
Others say the E.U. should refuse to renew an expiring economic pact with Russia unless it stops trying to monopolize European energy supplies .
This is extraordinarily ironic coming form people that relentlessly push market deregulation and monopoly busting within the EU .
We should set up a monopsony with respect to Russian gas ??
And who would run that body ?
The European Commission ?
EU governments ?
pro rata their gas consumption ?
Their gas imports ?
Their Russian gas imports ?
Utilities ?
Gas buyers ?
And would it onsell that gas to EU players on the market ?
At what price ?
Who would get the benefit of the presumably lower prices that this body would manage to extract from Russia , taking advantage of its monopsony position ?
I have yet to see the beginning of any proposal in that respect .
Until the practical aspects of this proposal are reconciled with the ongoing market liberalisation that the same people peddle with abandon , I have to call utter and absolute bullshit on them .
Though it has a vital stake , the United States has been mostly missing from the discussion .
That 's one reason a recent speech by Sen. Richard Lugar ( R - Ind. ) , the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , was intriguing .
Lugar has been a pioneer of some of the most farsighted U.S. policies toward the countries of the former Soviet Union , including the Nunn - Lugar program for securing and dismantling nuclear weapons and materials .
I will note here that indeed , the Nunn - Lugar program has been one of the smartest things done with respect to Russia in the past 15 years .
Now he 's proposing that the NATO alliance formally adopt " energy security " as one of its central missions .
NATO , he told a German Marshall Fund conference alongside the recent NATO summit in Riga , Latvia , is " used to thinking in terms of conventional warfare between nations .
But energy could become the weapon of choice for those who possess it .
" A natural gas shutdown to a European country in the middle of winter , " he added , " could cause death and economic loss on the scale of a military attack . "
This is , again , false and vicious scaremongering .
The countries that import most gas , in volume , ( France , Germany , Italy ) are also those that have the biggest storage facilities , the most diversity of supplies , and the most connections to other countries .
The countries that are most dependent on Russian gas , as a percentage of their supplies , are also , for the most part , located on the gas transit routes to Western Europe , and could not be cut off without the rest of Europe being cut off as well .
And that would be a pretty stark act by Russia , considering that 100 % of its exports go to Europe ( not to mention that almost all its oil exports go to the Baltic or Mediterranean Seas and are de facto under the control of European navies ) , that these exports represent the biggest chunk of its hard currency income and that they have - physically - no alternatives to sell them .
NATO , Lugar said , should resolve to treat " an attack using energy " the same way it would a land attack by conventional military forces -- that is , an attack on one country would compel a response by all .
That does n't mean military action , he said ; " rather , it means the alliance must commit itself to preparing for and responding to attempts to use the energy weapon against its fellow members . "
Lugar pointed out that NATO used to hold exercises to prepare for the logistical and supply challenge of responding to a Soviet attack .
A new exercise , he said , " should focus on how the Alliance would supply a beleaguered member with the energy resources needed to withstand geo-strategic blackmail . "
This would n't be easy , he acknowledged :
In fact , " the energy threat is more difficult to prepare for than a ground war in Central Europe . "
Guarding against an energy cutoff by Russia will mean massive investments in new supply lines and reserve supplies , as well as the means to distribute them in a crisis .
It is ironic that those countries that do have reserves , alternative supply routes and means to distribute them in a crisis are precisely those countries that have been importing gas ( not just Russian gas ) the longest , and have worried about these issues for a long time - and acted accordingly .
But now that suddenly the UK feels itself naked - with its domestic supplies disappearing fast , no storage capacity to speak of , and no long term contracts in place -- it calls for European solidarity - after years of mocking the gas importers for their lack of faith in market solutions .
Again , that same criticism applies to the WaPo and the WSJ .
Are they admitting to market failures ?
Are they saying that there are circumstances where markets do not provide for all demand at the right price ?
Why else would they need military action - i.e. State intervention ?
But if they recognize that markets can fail , should n't we reconsider the whole deregulation of energy markets ?
After all , brownouts could also " cause death and economic loss on the scale of a military attack " - and failed deregulation has caused a number of these in recent years .
Surely NATO - or at least public - intervention should be useful there as well , no ?
That sounds daunting at a time when NATO has its hands full trying to fight a war in Afghanistan .
But the energy threat goes to the alliance 's historic purpose : defending democratic Europe from attack by the autocratic and belligerent power on its Eastern frontier .
And , as Lugar pointed out : " The use of energy as an overt weapon is not a theoretical threat of the future .
It is happening now . "
Yeah , better to posture , hector and say we 're at war with an Evil Empire than actually think about real solutions - you know , those that involve abandoning ideological blinders , a blind trust in " markets " , and focusing on things like governments setting long term priorities and imposing regulations or - gasp - spending money to get there .
If energy is a strategic issue , then it requires public intervention and it should not be left to the narrow short term interests of market players .
And a note to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal : there is more to government than the military .
Britische Folterlager nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg Florian Rötzer
Dokumente und Fotografien belegen , dass britische Militärs in geheimen Lagern in Deutschland und Großbritannien nach 1945 verdächtige Kommunisten gefangen hielten und folterten
Das britische Militär hat nicht nur gefangene deutsche Soldaten in Gefängnissen wie im Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre in London gefangen gehalten , verhört und gefoltert , sondern diese Praxis auch nach dem Krieg in Verhörzentren in Großbritannien und Deutschland fortgeführt .
Dann ging es nicht mehr nur gegen vermeintliche Nazis , sondern gegen die neue Bedrohung : mutmaßliche deutsche Kommunisten , die misshandelt und gefoltert wurden .
Der Guardian hat aufgrund des britischen Informationsfreiheitsgesetzes bislang vom Verteidigungsministerium geheim gehaltene Dokumente und Fotos erhalten , die dies belegen .
Der Guardian hat die Dokumente über das Verhörzentrum in Bad Nenndorf bei Hannover – in Deutschland nur eines von mehreren anderen Zentren , von denen man wenig weiß - bereits vor vier Monaten vom britischen Außenministerium erhalten , das Verteidigungsministerium hatte aber durchgesetzt , dass die Bilder entfernt wurden .
Nach einem neuen Antrag erhielt die Zeitung schließlich die Fotografien , die ein britischer Soldat 1947 von einigen Gefangenen gemacht hatte – offenbar mit der Absicht , damit die Folter zu beenden .
Andere Dokumente , die der Guardian ebenfalls erhalten hat , zeigen , dass die britische Regierung die Dokumente nicht an die Öffentlichkeit kommen lassen wollte , um zu verbergen , „ dass wir angeblich auch Gefangene auf eine Weise behandelt haben , die an die deutschen Konzentrationslager erinnert . “
Viele der einst vorhandenen Fotografien sind überdies verschwunden .
In dem Verhörzentrum wurden nach einem Bericht von Inspector Tom Hayward , der aufgrund der Fotografien die Vorwürfe über die Misshandlungen untersuchen sollte , zwischen 1945 uns 1947 insgesamt 347 Männer und 44 Frauen festgehalten .
Darunter SS - Angehörige , mutmaßliche Nazis und sowjetische Agenten , aber eben auch Menschen , von denen man Informationen über das russische Militär und den russischen Geheimdienst zu erlangen hoffte .
Nach dem Sieg war der frühere Alliierte schnell zum nächsten Feind geworden und hatte der Kalte Krieg begonnen .
Mindestens zwei Häftlinge , die als Kommunisten galten , verhungerten , einer wurde zu Tode geprügelt , andere erlitten Verletzungen oder wurden schwer krank .
Auf den Bildern sieht man einige Opfer des geheimen Programms des britischen Militärs .
Sie waren nach Erkenntnissen des Guardian 1946 festgenommen worden , weil man sie verdächtigte , die russischen Kommunisten zu unterstützen .
Die Männer sind ausgemergelt und haben „ Monate lang Schlafentzug , Schläge und extreme Kälte “ aushalten müssen .
Einige sind verhungert und wurden zu Tode geprügelt , manche wurden mit Werkzeugen aus einem Gestapo - Gefängnis gefoltert .
Auf einer der Fotografien ist der halbverhungerte 23 - jährige Student Gerhard Menzel zu sehen , der als verdächtig galt , weil er 1946 aus der Kriegsgefangenschaft in Sibirien in die britische Verwaltungszone in Deutschland reiste .
Hayward berichtete er , dass man ihm 16 Tage lang die Hände auf den Rücken gefesselt hatte und ihn dabei immer wieder ins Gesicht schlug .
Er musste auch zwei Wochen in einer kalten Zelle verbringen , in die man jede halbe Stunde von vier Uhr früh bis Mitternacht kaltes Wasser spritzte .
Menzel wurde mit 8 weiteren Gefangenen daraufhin in ein anderes Lager gebracht und medizinisch behandelt .
Er sei nur noch Haut und Knochen gewesen , habe nicht mehr sprechen , gehen und stehen können , sei verwirrt gewesen und habe unter Gedächtnisverlust gelitten .
Aufgrund des Berichts von Hayward wurden vier britische Offiziere vor das Kriegsgericht gestellt , allerdings fand der Prozess im Geheimen statt , angeblich um die Russen nicht darauf aufmerksam zu machen , dass die Briten auch russische Spione gefangen hielten , aber auch um zu verhindern , dass die Existenz von weiteren Verhörzentren bekannt wird .
Nur einer der Offiziere wurde belangt .
Man entließ ihn aus dem Militär .
Offenbar weiß man im Verteidigungsministerium und in der Regierung noch nicht , wie man sich nach der Veröffentlichung der Dokumente zu dieser Praxis stellen soll , die man wohl weiterhin gerne verschweigen würde .
Das zeigt der Umgang mit Dokumenten über das geheime Verhörzentrum in London , das unter dem Namen „ London Cage “ bekannt ist .
Der Guardian hatte Ende 2005 Informationen über das Gefängnis publiziert , das 1940 eröffnet und erst 1948 geschlossen wurde .
Auch hier wurden nicht nur deutsche Soldaten und Nazis gefoltert , sondern offenbar auch nach Ende des Krieges Zivilisten .
Das Verteidigungsministerium suchte nach dem Krieg das Rote Kreuz von der Inspektion des Gefängnisses abzuhalten , da hier keine Kriegsgefangenen , sondern Zivilisten und Kriminelle eingesperrt seien .
Nachdem die Kritik stärker wurde , hat man Gefangene in Verhörzentren in Deutschland gebracht , wo man noch unkontrollierter mit ihnen umgehen konnte .
Dokumente , die weiteren Aufschluss über das Verhörzentrum in London geben könnten , werden nach dem Guardian weiterhin vom Verteidigungsministerium unter Verschluss gehalten .
Man könne sie angeblich deswegen nicht freigeben , weil sie mit Asbest kontaminiert seien .
Ebenso unbekannt ist das weitere Schicksal der Häftlinge auf den Fotografien und wann die Folter und Misshandlungen eingestellt wurden .
Nick Harvey von den britischen Liberalen forderte das Verteidigungsministerium auf , zumindest das anzuerkennen , was geschehen ist , und sich zu entschuldigen .
Persönlich oder politisch könne man niemanden mehr zur Verantwortung ziehen .
Auch Sherman Carroll vom Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture verlangt von der Regierung , dass sie sich der Tatsache stellt : “ Die Behauptung , dass Großbritannien während des Zweiten Weltkriegs und kurz danach keine Folter anwendete , weil sie als ‘ untauglich ’ betrachtet worden sei , ist ein Mythos , der Jahrzehnte lang propagiert worden ist . ”
Das Verteidigungsministerium meint allerdings nur , dass das Außenministerium für Fragen über die Verhörzentren zuständig sei .

The Difference Between Crowdsourcing and Exploitation
by David Cohn on February 15 , 2007 - 10:11 pm .
By now you ’ve probably heard about the recent Zogby Interactive poll on the importance of citizen journalism :
A majority of Americans ( 55 % ) in an online survey said bloggers are important to the future of American journalism and 74 % said citizen journalism will play a vital role …
Most respondents ( 53 % ) also said the rise of free Internet - based media pose the greatest opportunity to the future of professional journalism and three in four ( 76 % ) said the Internet has had a positive impact on the overall quality of journalism .
That citizen journalism will be important in the changing media landscape should be nothing new .
That it poses “ the greatest opportunity to the future of professional journalism ” is probably a relief to those who are n’t aware it yet .
The imputes to realizing this is seeing real working models ( something we are working on at NewAssignment .
Net ) .
In the meantime , here ’s a new project from Personal Democracy Forum called techPresident .
Run by a motley crew of journalists and bloggers the site will monitor how the 2008 presidential candidates are using the Web .
And it will include the following crowdsourced features .

The most famous journalist to be jailed is probably Judith Miller .
But on Feburary 6th a young independent citizen journalist in San Francsico , Josh Wolf , became the longest incarcerated journalist in U.S. history for refusing to comply with a court subpoena .
Below is a timeline of the events leading to Josh Wolf ’s arrest and into the future .

Top Picks of Citizen Journalism Databases
In a world where large volumes of information can be produced in the blink of an eye , citizen journalists need tools to access and cross-reference information .
Several online database applications have sprouted up to fill that need .
Here is a run-down of sites that are making it easier for citizen journalists to connect the dots :
Footnote : A repository of historical documents in a sleek Web 2.0 interface ( think Flickr for documents ) .
Footnote provides access to the original versions of millions of scanned historical documents , many of which are available on the Web for the first time .
Here ’s the Gettysburg Address ( now tell me that ’s not cool ) .
Users are invited to share , discuss and annotate documents collaboratively to increase the ways they can be referenced .
They have also partnered with the National Archives to bring millions of pages of historical documents never before available online .
Diplomacy Monitor : St. Thomas University School of Law produced Diplomacy Monitor to be a one - stop shop for diplomacy - related documents .
It crawls hundreds of government and other diplomatic sources to index documents by nation , region and issue .
This makes it easy for the user to see where countries stand on a given issue .
They also boast near real - time indexing of documents , which makes it a good source for material which is usually filtered and edited by the mainstream media .
Davos Questions Crowdsourced -- No Need to Panic , It's Normal
by Kelly Nuxoll on February 8 , 2007 - 9:30 am .
You would n’t think a non -profit ’s annual meeting in Switzerland in the middle of January would be a big draw .
Yet , since the World Economic Forum started the Davos Symposium in 1971 , it has attracted an all - star line up of political , business , and social leaders , gathering to discuss global issues too big to be tackled by only one sector .
This year German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the opening address , and Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin threw the must - go party of the week .
But what was truly different at Davos this year was that the public was also invited , and rightfully so .
You were Person of the Year , after all .
“ At last year ’s symposium , some of the attendees were already blogging about it , ” said Mark Steckel , a software entrepreneur speaking on behalf of the Huffington Post .
“ With that understanding , the symposium decided to open things up .
The thinking was , ‘ we ’re not going to be able to stop this , so let ’s interact , participate , and be part of it . ’“
Nudged by the Huffington Post , the World Economic Forum , BBC , BuzzMachine , Guardian , and Daylife created the Davos Conversation .
As Steckel explained it , the Conversation is a Web page that aggregated news stories and blogs posts about the symposium , posted videos of discussions , and hosted blogs for journalists and symposium participants .
The public was invited to comment on the blogs and submit video questions .
Attendees ’ responses were videotaped and posted online .
“ It was a collaborative effort among all the partners , ” said Steckel , who coordinatored two Columbia School of Journalism students to moderate blog comments .
If all of this sounds a bit ordinary , that may be the point .
The Blurring Lines Between Media and Politics
by John McQuaid on February 9 , 2007 - 6:20 am .
The lines between traditional media , new media , and politics continue to blur .
Bloggers are covering the MSM reporters testifying at the Scooter Libby trial .
After the Edwards blogging dispute , bloggers thinking about careers in politics are now scanning their archives , wondering what hidden time bombs they may contain .
We ’re on the cusp of something new , especially with a presidential campaign getting underway that will produce unprecedented amounts of online coverage and chatter .
With the formerly clear dividing line between “ media ” and the rest of us rapidly disappearing .
Rick Perlstein has a piece in TNR
Online in which he notes the rough treatment that Jay Carney received when he made some mistakes in a post on Time.com ’s new political blog , Swampland .
A swarm of commenters , many directed his way by Atrios , quickly pointed out the errors .
Though they were right on the facts , Carney lashed back at them .
The Swampland blog is interesting in part because you can see the journalists adjusting , at times awkwardly , to the demands of blogging .
I hear people saying “ JSON is great , XML is over ” , but I do n’t hear XML partisans saying anything bad about JSON .
There are two arguments that are over , though .
It seems to me that the great thing about JSON is that it exists for one purpose : to put structs on the wire .
With XML , on the other hand , it ’s assumed that you might want to stream it in by the gigabyte , or load it into one of a many different in - memory data structures , or run a full - text indexer over the contents , or render it for human consumption , or , well , anything .
Given JSON ’s single - purpose design , generating and parsing it ought to be faster than with XML ; but on the other hand , there are n’t that many apps where parsing and unparsing are a significant part of the workload .
XML ’s internationalization is more thorough ; it requires you to think about how you ’re encoding the characters , and lets you use ISO - 8859 or JIS or whatever if that ’s your world .
Also , while it ’s not in the spec , every XML parser I ’ve seen says “ I ’ll figure out the encoding in the incoming doc , and take care of it , and all you ’ll ever see is UTF - X ” , where “ X ” is 16 for Java and C# , 8 for almost everything else .
I look at the Ruby JSON library , for example , and I see all these character encoding conversion routines ; blecch .
Use JSON · Seems easy to me ; if you want to serialize a data structure that ’s not too text - heavy and all you want is for the receiver to get the same data structure with minimal effort , and you trust the other end to get the i18n right , JSON is hunky - dory .
Use XML ·
If you want to provide general - purpose data that the receiver might want to do unforeseen weird and crazy things with , or if you want to be really paranoid and picky about i18n , or if what you ’re sending is more like a document than a struct , or if the order of the data matters , or if the data is potentially long - lived ( as in , more than seconds ) XML is the way to go .
It also seems to me that the combination of XML and XPath hits a sweet spot for data formats that need to be extensible ; that is to say , it ’s pretty easy to write XML - processing code that wo n’t fail in the presence of changes to the message format that do n’t touch the piece you care about .
The Arguments Are Over ·
There used to be an argument about whether platform - neutral , language - neutral data formats were important , or whether distributed objects were the right answer .
That ’s over : HTML , XML , JSON .
There used to be people who argued that network interchange formats should n’t be text - based , but use binary where possible , for efficiency .
That ’s over : HTML , XML , JSON .
There is , apparently , consternation in the world of tie manufacturers .
The proportion of men in professional jobs who buy ties , a report says , has dropped from 70 % in 1996 to just 56 % today .
And , to break that down ( pay attention at the back , please ) , only 28 % of office managers have bought a tie in the past 12 months .
It is , however , floppy - collared architects and surveyors who are the biggest slackers : last year only a paltry 16 % of them bothered to purchase a thin string of fabric to tie around their necks at 7 o'clock every morning .
These architects and surveyors are doubtless responding to the realisation that the tie is the sartorial equivalent of an appendix - an entirely redundant bit of kit left over from a much earlier phase of evolution .
Just as it is several millennia since our digestive systems were required to deal with grass , it is at least a couple of centuries since men felt it necessary to protect their throats in the street from anyone making a lunge at the jugular with a sword ( although nostalgia freaks will be queasily pleased to note that those times may be returning in certain parts of our inner cities ) .
Rejecting the tie , then , takes a man out of the symbolic combat zone and places him permanently in a " stand down " position .
This might be a disadvantage in a court of law , which is why solicitors and barristers buy more ties than anyone else .
However , in the team - based environment of an advertising agency , or even a call centre , it 's probably a good idea if individuals do n't feel permanently poised to fight a duel ( at one point in history merely touching another man 's tie knot was an invitation to trek out to a heath and start trading pot shots , which must have played havoc with staffing rotas ) .
What 's more , by rejecting the tie , architects , surveyors and engineers ( only 13 % of whom managed to buy one last year ) are also making a strong statement about not wanting to be defined by class .
Ever since 1880 , when the jaunty rowers of Oxford 's Exeter College removed the ribbon bands from their hats and tied them round their necks , the tie has become a virtual microchip of information about where you come from and , by implication , where you are going .
Schools , clubs , regiments and colleges all signal their specialness with a complicated pattern of spots and stripes that can only be decoded by those in the know .
By refusing to be tied down in this way , members of what might be termed the post - industrial professions ( financial advisers are also low on the tie- buying scale ) signal that they hail from a world of flattened hierarchies and democratic interaction .
There is , finally , another very good reason for men to reject the symbolic freight of a tie .
For while the necktie started off as a dandified bit of kit ( as near as dammit to tucking a lace hanky into the top of your shirt ) , from Victorian times onwards it became austerely and dominatingly male .
As a result , any woman wearing a tie in the 20th century was either very obviously in drag for her own pleasure or was being forced to send a slightly humiliating signal to the world that she wished to be viewed as a neuter ( it 's for that reason , surely , that disturbingly luscious adolescent girls are still obliged to wear a tie to school ) .
In these metrosexual days , however , for a man to insist on wearing a tie does not speak of a casual and unforced masculinity , but suggests instead a nagging worry about where the proper markers lie .
For , viewed against a crisp white shirt , the classic dark tie forms an urgent pointing finger , dragging the viewer 's eye straight towards the wearer 's genitals .
" Look , " the tie seems to shout , like an embarrassing drunk in the pub , " there 's no doubt about it , he 's definitely all man . "

Durex says the scheme has been very successful in France
The condom maker wants a panel of 5,000 people who are single , married , or in couples to report their experiences of using its condoms and lubricants .
Men and women of all ages , ethnic groups or sexual orientation have been asked to apply on its website .
Durex was inundated with 14,000 applicants on the first day it started a similar scheme in France .
' Massive panel '
UK panellists will be expected to report online on how enjoyable the condoms and lubricants were to use and whether their sex lives have improved .
" The idea is to create a massive panel of testers who can try Durex condoms , have sex and then give us feedback about their experiences - in strictest confidence , of course , " a Durex spokeswoman said .
" It is n't some crazy kind of ' 60s love - in , " she added .
Durex sales in the six months until September 2006 increased by 7 % compared with the same period in the previous year , driven by a surge in sales of personal devices and lubricants .
Is it any cooler ?

More than 1 million children in global sex trade each year , U.S. State Dept. says
• 50,000 to 100,000 women and children involved in Cambodia 's sex industry
• Gang rape , AIDS , torture afflict the women and children in this field
Adjust font size :
PHNOM PENH , Cambodia ( CNN ) --
At an age when most children might be preparing for their first day of school , Srey , 6 , already has undergone trauma that is almost unspeakable .
She was sold to a brothel by her parents when she was 5 .
It is not known how much her family got for Srey , but other girls talk of being sold for $ 100 ; one was sold for $ 10 .
Before she was rescued , Srey endured months of abuse at the hands of pimps and sex tourists .
( Watch where freed girl is found upon reunion with reporter )
Passed from man to man , often drugged to make her compliant , Srey was a commodity at the heart of a massive , multimillion - dollar sex industry in Phnom Penh , Cambodia .
" It is huge , " said Mu Sochua , a former minister of women 's and veteran 's affairs who is an anti-sex trade activist .
The precise scale of Cambodia 's sex trade is difficult to quantify .
International organizations -- such as UNICEF , ECPAT and Save the Children -- say that anywhere from from 50,000 to 100,000 women and children are involved .
An estimated 30 percent of the sex workers in Phnom Penh are under the age of 18 , according to the United Nations .
The actual figure may be much higher , activists say .
Global sex industry
Around the world , more than 1 million children are exploited in the global commercial sex trade each year , according to the U.S. State Department .
The State Department believes Cambodia is a key transit and destination point in this trade .
" Trafficking for sexual exploitation also occurs within Cambodia 's borders , from rural areas to the country 's capital , Phnom Penh , and other secondary cities in the country , " the State Department wrote in a 2006 report .
" The Government of Cambodia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking ; however , it is making significant efforts to do so . "
Sochua said that with millions of Cambodians struggling to live on less than 50 cents a day , many women turn to the sex industry .
Poverty is also often what drives parents to sell their child or themselves on the streets .
" Always a child is left behind , often a girl , who is preyed on by traffickers , " Sochua added .
An unlikely savior
Srey was rescued from the life of a sex slave by Somaly Mam , a former prostitute who runs shelters for the victims of Cambodia 's sex trade .
Somaly has rescued 53 children , so far .
Many of them have profound psychological trauma .
Some clearly are mentally ill .
( Watch how one woman has saved dozens of children from brothels )
" A lot of them , when they arrive , have psychological problems ... very big problems .
...
And they never have love by the people , by their parents , " Somaly said .
One girl at Somaly 's shelter appears especially disturbed .
She was rescued after being imprisoned for two years in a cage , where she was repeatedly raped .
She needs psychiatric care , but there is none available .
Somaly says she does her best to give this girl love and support , but that it 's not easy with so many other needy children around .
Somaly herself suffered terrible ordeals when she worked the streets , including seeing her best friend murdered .
She is determined to build something positive out of so much despair .
Her work has caught the attention of world leaders , celebrities and religious figures .
Her office in Phnom Penh is adorned with photos of her meeting Pope John Paul II and messages of support from governments and charities .
Despite the attention , Somaly said the situation on the street is not getting better .
Gang rapes of prostitutes are becoming more common , she said , and many of the attackers do n't use condoms .
Instead , they share a plastic bag .
" Poor women , they have been raped by eight , 10 , 20 , 25 men ... they hit them .
They receive a lot of violence , " she said .
HIV - AIDS also remains a persistent , though declining , problem among Cambodia 's female sex workers .
About 20 percent of Cambodia 's female sex workers are HIV - positive , according to Cambodia 's Ministry of Health .
This compares with the 39 percent of sex workers who tested positive in 1996 , according to the Health Ministry .
To help sex workers transition to a more normal life , Somaly is hoping to expand her refuge in the countryside outside Phnom Penh , where former sex workers attend school and learn skills like weaving and sewing .
Asked what the future holds for Srey , Somaly stroked the girl 's hair and paused .
Srey is HIV - positive , she said .
In such a poor country , without decent hospitals or medical care , Srey 's future is bleak .
Somaly just hopes she can make this girl 's life bearable for as long as it lasts .

The way product owners and teams should work together
The place that product owners and teams come from , using Waterfall
How Scrum falls apart if these habits persist
How organizations have fallen apart because of these habits
How to undo these habits .
Core Functionality
Most significant new functionality builds on it ;
It is fragile , it does n’t have test harnesses ;
Few people still know how to ( or are willing to ) touch it ; and ,
It requires more time to work on ( lower velocity ) than new code .
Sometimes called infrastructure or legacy software .
We have to be courageous .
The intention of this conversation is to make you aware that it's not just a phrase , " be courageous " , but it 's a professional responsibility which , if you follow up on it , not only will you feel better when you come to work , but it is for the good of your company .
And if you do n't do it ... it 's going to kill your company .
This is not just a trivial little thing , " let 's not refactor because ... " , this is a sacred trust ... to drop quality is a catastrophe for our company .
Worse yet , our pattern is not to tell anyone , right ?
So a classic thing we do now is : if you are in a release and the customer absolutely has to have it earlier and the quality has to be dropped ... that is not a Product Owner decision , that is not a Customer decision , that is a drop in the value of a core asset of the company , and it has to go in the books .
That is a CFO , COO , CEO type of decision .
Apprise the CEO of this problem : that this is the root cause that the company cannot build new software to meet competitive threats .
Why ?
Because the only time I 've succeeded in getting engineers over the fear of actually standing up and saying " I know that you really want to do that , but it 's not a velocity that 's sustainable to us at the quality that the company expects , " is when the CEO comes into the room and says " If anyone tries pushing you or bullying you into something you can't do , you come to me , " because now everyone knows the consequences .
InfoQ video of Ken Schwaber 's Agile 2006 presentation :
.
Ken Schwaber , co-creator of Scrum and head of the Scrum Alliance , spoke at Agile2006 on code quality as a corporate asset , controversially telling conference - goers that " a drop in code quality is a drop in the value of a core asset of the company , and ... that [ makes it ] a CFO , COO , CEO type of decision . "
InfoQ presents exclusive video of his talk , along with Schwaber 's slides , in This presentation covers :
When people try to use Scrum as a silver bullet , that is , to solve the unsolveable ( for example , delivering 14 months ' work in 9 months ) , Schwaber says he commonly hears it expressed as " Scrum does n't work , " but he knows that the flip side of this is : " Scrum has exposed an organizational problem , which runs really deep . "
Experienced practitioners recognise these unwelcomed revelations as opportunities - they provide management and developers the chance to adjust direction early , and take aim toward success .
But it 's not easy - Schwaber reminded listeners that courage is required to reap the benefits of of these uncomfortable moments of truth .
One uncomfortable truth that Scrum can surface is the existence of a culture that produces unmaintainable , cobbled - together legacy code , or as Schwaber called it in this presentation , " Core Functionality " .
Schwaber described it as follows : Schwaber talked about system maintenance as a key indicator of poor - quality core software , the extreme case being what he called " design - dead code " , which paralyses development whenever integration of new code depends on changes to core code , where development is painfully slow and risky .
He pointed out that quality is n't some intangible thing : it can actually be measured by the amount of time the team spends maintaining the system .
This becomes critical when it impacts delivery of software that could offer competitive advantage , giving the example of Microsoft 's long product delivery cycle versus Google 's very short cycles .
Even when teams use Agile methods , their " Agile advantage " can be more than negated if code quality slips , progressively reducing velocity until the team , and the company , are unable to respond rapidly to change .
We 've all seen teams come up with creative solutions to deliver despite heinous quality problems in existing core software - including recreating core functionality inside their own application .
This is just one way that systems become fragmented and difficult to maintain , hampering subsequent projects , until a complete system rewrite looks cheaper than continuing to work with the degraded core codebase .
How do teams find themselves in this all - too - common position ?
If IT has been acquiescing to unreasonable demands , we continually reinforce the idea that we 're goofing off , since we always seem able to squeeze out more when push comes to shove .
Doing so builds up a perception that cramming in extra features is free !
Whereas , in fact , we 're fitting it in by dropping quality .
Schwaber 's point : " By dropping quality to save our jobs , our customers have come to believe that this ' magic ' has no cost , whereas in fact we 're severely damaging our companies in the process .
" Schwaber says : " As long as we fold , they will continue to ask us to fold . "
Schwaber 's solution : Schwaber proposed strategies for disengaging from the vicious downward spiral , including building models and tracking delivery cycle time against competitors to evaluate the impact of decreased velocity due to poor quality , to allow executives to make informed strategic decisions .
He also proposed : Schwaber is an informative and entertaining speaker , even while he 's tackling these uncomfortable truths .
Watch the
Yesterday , the Supreme Court heard argument in what has come to be known as the “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” case .
The facts of the case are pretty straightforward , but it ’s led to some interesting political alliances :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
The Supreme Court Monday debated the case of a high school principal who suspended a student over a “ Bong Hits 4 Jesus , ” banner displayed at a school - sponsored event .
Considering the student did n’t actually use a bong of any kind , such as these you kind that you find produced by gravlabs and other smoking accessory producers , this was purely a case pertaining to freedom of speech .
The free - speech case tests the limits of student messages officials could try to suppress .
Joseph Frederick , then 18 , unveiled the 14 - foot paper sign on a public sidewalk outside his Juneau , Alaska , high school .
Principal Deborah Morse confiscated it and later suspended the young man .
At issue was whether Frederick ’s free - speech rights were violated and the discretion schools should be allowed to limit messages that appear to advocate illegal drug use .
A large part of the school board ’s argument , which was made before the Supreme Court by none other than Kenneth Starr , was that the Principal should be allowed to regulate speech that disrupts the educational atmosphere of the school .
As several Justices pointed out , though , that argument does n’t stand up to the facts of this case where the banner was unveiled on a public sidewalk away from school grounds while the students watch the Olympic Torch pass through Juneau :
“ There was no classroom here , ” said Kennedy .
“ This was education outside a classroom , ” replied Starr of the torch relay observation .
“ What did it disrupt on the sidewalk ? ” asked Souter of Frederick ’s banner .
“ The educational mission of the school , ” was Starr ’s answer .
“ The school can make any rule that it wants on any subject restrictive of speech , and if anyone violates it , it ’s disruptive ? ” asked Souter .
Justice Samuel Alito , alone among his conservative bench mates , appeared sharply critical of the school ’s position “ I find that a very , very disturbing argument , ” he said , “ because schools have and they can define their educational mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of political speech and speech expressing fundamental values of the students , under the banner of getting rid of speech that ’s inconsistent with educational missions . ”
And , more importantly , that they can do so outside of school grounds during what is essentially a sanctioned recreational activity .
Law Professor
Ann Althouse sums up how this case ought to turn out quite nicely :
This case is about something that happened on the street and not in a classroom .
The banner was , of course , silent , and the occasion was a parade .
It ’s quite different from disruptive speech during a lesson .
Scalia offered a distinction between “ disruptive ” and “ undermining . ”
The school ’s real objection is that a pro-drug message undermines the message it endorses .
That is , they do n’t want disagreement and debate .
They still convey their anti-drug message all the time , and this student is n’t interrupting them or even distracting anyone from hearing that message .
He ’s just delivering a counter - message on another occasion , and they object to the argument .
That should be held to violate the First Amendment .
The Supreme Court held long ago that students do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door , although they have recognized some limits on those rights that take into account both their status as minors and the need for school authorities to maintain order and discipline in the school .
Clearly , if students have rights inside the school , they have rights outside it even while under the supervision of school authorities .
“ Bong Hits 4 Jesus ” may not be the most eloquent political statement in American history , but the school authorities had no right to punish Frederick for saying it .
By
[ T ] hey label the argument and the person making it " leftist " and " liberal " and - presto ! - no more need to address the arguments or consider its substance because it ’s all been shooed away with one fell swoop of name - calling cliches .
The name - calling technique links a person , or idea , to a negative symbol .
The propagandist who uses this technique hopes that the audience will reject the person or the idea on the basis of the negative symbol , instead of looking at the available evidence .

Godless
Only a society that has ceased to value that reasonable context of discussion ( in other words , only a society that no longer really cares about itself ) could enthusiastically make significant room for someone like Coulter , who rakes in profits by making up lies and " entertaining " people by demanding the deaths of those she hates .
And American society today makes room not only for her , but also for an entire right - wing movement for which eliminationist rhetoric has become the norm .
This is a society that no longer trusts itself , that is incapable of seeing its citizens as citizens and therefore as worthy of respect .
Correction - I had previously said Malkin wrote for VDare .
That 's not the case , they run her syndicated column .
UPDATE
The last few years have witnessed the emergence of a new class of pundits .
Many , regrettably , are prodigies in the aggressive political jargon that pervades our political discourse .
Why is Coulter so important ?
Even though most people have n't heard of her , she and other relatively young jargon - slingers like David Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin are gaining stature .
As a result , the rise of aggressive political jargon is likely to continue , with predictable and pernicious consequences for American political discourse .
They say that the devil is in the detail and to always read the small print .
Well , if your ISP happens to be Verizon and you 're on the EVDO Wireless Data Service , this is great advice .
Read their Terms of Service and you will see ; P2P is banned , as are streaming services such as YouTube .
And the ' Unlimited ' transfers you were paying for ?
Forget those too , 5gig a month is the limit .
Verizon customers on the EVDO Wireless Data Service are in for a surprise if they read the Terms of Service ( TOS )
The Unlimited Data Plan is – yes , thats right limited to 5 gigs of transfers each month but do n’t worry , you wo n’t need anywhere near that amount because your internet multimedia experience is about to be ruined by the banning of your favourite activities ;
There is to be no continuous uploading nor downloading , no streaming ( that means no YouTube for you to enjoy and no internet radio ) and no playing games either , they ’re banned too .
No P2P is allowed whatsoever .
If you get caught going over your ‘ Unlimited ’ service ’s cap of 5gig in one month , Verizon say that you will be “ presumed to be using the service in a manner prohibited above , and we reserve the right to immediately terminate the service of any such person without notice ”
So what is allowed then ?
Well Verizon says that you may still check your email and browse the Internet .
Have fun !

最近、緩和ケア病棟への入棟を拒否する患者さんが続いた。患者さんの言い分は概ね以下のようなものである。
「あの病院へ入院したら退院できない。入院した知り合いはみな、１ヵ月もせずに亡くなってしまった」
まあな。そもそも余命が1ヵ月以下の人が入る病棟だからな。私が余命1ヵ月なら迷わずホスピスに入る。私が勤務している病院は地方の中核病院で、癌に対して積極的な治療を行うというのなら、この界隈では一番いい病院であろう。しかし、緩和ケアという点では、当院でもやれないことはないが、専門にやっている病院の方が質の高いケアを受けられるに決まっている。
これが、当院でずっと治療を受けてきた患者さんなら、いまさら緩和ケア病棟に移りたくないという気持ちはよく分かる。医師や看護師との人間関係ができているのだから、「ここで最期まで看て欲しい」というのは自然な感情である。だから、そういうケースでは、一応は緩和ケア病棟への入棟を勧めるが、当院での治療を希望されればその希望に沿う。だけど、「緩和ケア病棟に入ると死ぬから嫌だ」というのは理由になってない。当院に入院したって死ぬときは死ぬ。だいたい、緩和ケア病棟で働く医療者に対して失礼だ。
たいそう困るのが、他院で緩和ケア病棟を勧められ、本人が納得せずに当院への入院を希望して受診したケースである。しかも告知されていないというからなおさらやっかいである。付け加えて、「緩和ケア病棟に入ると退院できない」と本人に吹き込んだ善意の素人がいるというのもムカつく。外来で延々と話を聞いているうちに、もう面倒くさいから入院させちゃおうかという気分になってきたが、前医の立場*1や、急性期病院としての当院の立場*2、入院後に起こるであろうトラブル*3を考えて結局は断った。
家族はよく理解してくれたが、患者さん本人は多分納得していない。どうすれば納得していただけるのか私には分からない。結局、自宅で家族が看るか、説得されて渋々緩和ケア病棟に入るか、前医の病院（小規模の個人病院）に入院するかになりそうである。どれもあまりよい解決策ではない。夜間に救急車で当院に受診しそのまま入院するという可能性もある。これは本人にとっては（一時的には）ハッピーだが、「救急車だと入院させてくれる」という前例ができてしまうのでよろしくない。どうすればいいのか。
How to Cheat the Mumbai Train System
A blogger named Ganesh Kulkarni discovered that the commuter trains of Mumbai serve six million passengers daily but the system is n’t equipped to check everyone ’s ticket .
Instead , Kulkarni writes , ticket agents conduct random ticket checks .
This has given rise to a form of cheating that is elegantly called “ ticketless travel . ”
Although it ’s probably not very common to get busted for traveling ticketlessly , there is a significant fine if you are .
And so , Kulkarni writes , one clever traveler has devised an insurance policy to make sure that ticketless travelers who are caught can lay some of the expense .
Here ’s how it works .
You pay 500 rupees ( about $ 11 ) to join an organization of fellow ticketless travelers .
Then , if you do get caught traveling without a ticket , you pay the fine to the authorities and then turn in your receipt to the ticketless - traveler organization — which refunds you 100 % of the fine .
Do n’t you wish that everyone in society was as creative as the cheaters ?
But , more important : would n’t there seem to be a big financial upside in investing in enough ticket - takers to make sure that the train system actually makes everyone pay ?
If I ran a swift little private - equity firm , I ’d think about taking over the Mumbia train system , pronto .
Online auction house eBay has decided to halt all PlayStation 3 auctions for the time being .
According to a post in the eBay Trust & Safety forum , those listing PlayStation 3 systems for sale have had their listings pulled .
In addition , eBay is putting very stringent requirements in place for any future listings of the next - gen consoles : sellers need to provide eBay with a copy of their drivers license or other ID , copy of a credit card statement or utility bill with their current address , an invoice or receipt showing " purchase or posession " of the consoles , and written acknowledgement of agreement with eBay 's policies .
Last week , preorders for both Sony 's and Nintendo 's consoles began .
Allocations for the PS3 were very limited , and the GameStop / EB Games chain went through their entire preallocation of systems in a matter of hours .
Wii preorders began on Friday , and once again , the retail outlets went through their anticipated stock very quickly much more quickly than some gamers expected .
As was the case last year with the launch of the Xbox 360 , a number of early adopters appear to be capitalists first and gamers second , hoping to flip their systems quickly on eBay for two or three times what they paid for them .
As a result , within hours of the preorders starting , PS3s and Wiis began showing up on eBay .
In some cases , eBay allows users to sell items that they do not physically have in their possession .
However , any item offered as a " presale " must be within the seller 's possession within 30 days of the auction ending .
eBay 's subsidiary PayPal has an even more stringent policy , forbidding any sale where the seller cannot guarantee or " reasonably expect " the item to be shipped within 20 days of the purchase date .
A search of eBay 's listings found a handful of PS3s in the search results , but clicking on individual auction listings returned a message that the item had been removed or is no longer available .
In contrast , auctions for preordered Nintendo Wiis are being allowed to proceed for the time being .
That may change if eBay believes the Wii will be as difficult to come by as the PS3 is anticipated to be .
The PlayStation 3 launch expected to echo that of the Xbox 360 in terms of the supply of consoles available , with only 400,000 allocated for the North American launch next month .
Last year , eBay was inundated with Xbox 360 listings , with many sellers who had preordered systems unable to deliver their consoles to auction winners in a timely fashion .
It made eBay look bad , and the auction house appears eager this time around to avoid the kind of problems experienced last year .

爆笑問題の太田光は新作*1「トリックスターから、空へ」の前書きの中で、最近はよく周りから「お前は何者で、何になりたいのか？」と問われると書いている。
相変わらず、生放送等で 「タモリさんを助けようと思ってやってるんだけど、逆に困らせてしまう」ような危うい暴走を繰り返したりする一方、お笑い芸人にも関わらず「太田光の私が総理大臣になったら……秘書田中(以下「 太田総理 」 ) 」 や「スタ☆メン」など数多くの番組で政治的発言を繰り返したりし、文化人的な立ち位置を見せることが多くなった。
そこでは今どき恥ずかしいくらいの青臭い正論を吐くことが多い。
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKgUeQWZWl8
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsdp5S5tVdU
そんな時、太田は 「お前は何者で、何になりたいのか？」と自らにも問いかけ、「まいったな」と思うのだという。そんなこと自分でも分からないと。
" 何になりたい か " どころか、自分 が " 何者なの か " もわからない 。
自分では漫才師のつもりであるが、「アイツはもう、芸人とはいえない」とい
う声も随分聞いた。言われてみればそんな気もする。今まで胸をはって「俺は芸
人だ」と言える気持ちになったことは一度もない。
「 太田総理」の大ファンだという伊集院光との「ＴＶブロス」での対談で、太田はこの番組について以下のようなことを語っている。
太田は伊集院に対して、この番組に「引っ張り込んでやろうという思惑が最初からあった」というが、個人的には最もこの番組で、太田に対抗する論客としてふさわしい芸人は、水道橋博士ではないかと思う。
その博士 は 「 ＷＥＢ ダ･ヴィンチ」の連載「本、邪魔か？」のいじめ問題をテーマにした回で、太田の「たけしの日本教育白書」での発言を引用している。(引用された全文はリンク先を参照のこと)
太田は、漫才ブーム以前は青春ドラマに感動していた、と語り、しかしビートたけしが出現し、それは綺麗事だとつっこんだ。そして彼は「世の中は綺麗事じゃなくて、熱血の青春ドラマの世界じゃないんだ、っていうことを教えてくれて僕らは開眼した」という。しかし、今の子供はその綺麗事を知らずに最初から本音しか知らない。だから危険なんだという。
「 そこからもっと追求していけばいいのに、知恵の入り口って凄く危険なんですよ。たけしさんがやったことは逆説なんだってことを気がつかないと、それをそのまま受け入れちゃうと、それで良いんだと思っちゃうじゃない？」と。
この発言に博士は共感を示しつつ、現在の太田の立ち居地の理由を考察している。
これは僕が常日頃、抱く思いと、全く持って共通する。
この世界に入ってから、俺より下の世代の芸人のたけしイズムの解釈が“ 嘲笑”でしかないことを何度も戸惑ったし、ビートたけしの逆説が分らない若者の多さには本気で呆れている。
それはサブカルチャー論にも共通する。
いつの間にか、サブがメインにあり、カウンターで発言すべきサブカルチャーが正論の如く流通している。
昨今の太田光が、実にお笑いにあるまじき、まともな正論をぶつ論客となっているのも、本来のメインカルチャーの方が脆弱すぎて、立ち居地としては、正論をぶつ方が、むしろ異端であり、カウンターであるからだろう。
これらのことを裏付けるように、太田自身も「hon-nin vol.01 」で松尾スズキとの対談で語っている。
WASHINGTON -- A Pentagon investigation found yesterday that four senior Army officers -- including a three - star general now in charge of the military 's most elite man-hunting units -- committed " critical errors " in judgment in handling the " friendly fire " death of Corporal Pat Tillman , a former pro fessional football star .
A separate Army probe found no criminal wrongdoing in Tillman 's death on April 22 , 2004 , in a barrage of fire from fellow Rangers on a craggy mountainside near Afghanistan 's border with Pakistan .
The report by the Pentagon inspector general recommended that four Army generals , as well as five lower - ranking officers , face " corrective action " for serious violations , including making false and misleading statements about what they knew about the Tillman fratricide , as well as inaccuracies in recommending Tillman for a Silver Star , the Army 's third - highest combat award .
The high - level mistakes prevented Tillman 's parents and wife from learning for at least five weeks that he was killed not while charging up a hill against the enemy fighters , but in a confused gun battle with elements of his Ranger platoon .
" We as an Army failed in our duty to the Tillman family , " acting Army Secretary Peter Geren told reporters at the Pentagon yesterday .
He announced an immediate review of the actions of all nine officers , to be led by General William S. Wallace , commander of the Army 's training command , with a preliminary report due in 30 days .
Possible disciplinary actions range from no action and written reprimands up to courts - martial , said Colonel Daniel McCallum of the Army 's Judge Advocate General Office .
Wallace will have " the full range of disciplinary options " available to sanction the officers , Geren said .
Some of the most serious failures were committed by Lieutenant General Philip R. Kensinger Jr. , now retired , who at the time served as commander of the US Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg , N.C. Kensinger " provided misleading testimony " to Army and Pentagon investigators " when he denied that he knew friendly fire was suspected before the memorial service " for Tillman , according to the inspector general 's report .
Brigadier General James C. Nixon , then a colonel in command of the 75th Ranger Regiment , failed to take steps to initiate investigations of suspected friendly fire , the report found .
Brigadier General Gary M. Jones , then chief of staff of special operations command and now retired , conducted a faulty follow - up investigation in which he failed to interview all Rangers present , or to scrutinize the mishandling of evidence , it said .
Soldiers burned Tillman 's uniform and body armor the day after his death .
Nixon , along with Lieutenant General Stanley A. McChrystal , who was the joint task force commander , were responsible for submitting a Silver Star recommendation for Tillman that included " inaccurate information and a misleading citation that implied CPL Tillman died by enemy fire , " the report found .
McChrystal is now a forward commander for the Joint Special Operations Command , which includes Army Delta Force operatives and played a key role in killing Abu Musab al - Zarqawi in Iraq in June .
Despite finding several errors , the inspector general 's report did not find evidence of a coverup .
" There was a series of mistakes made .
We never decided that there was any attempt to cover up " because the friendly - fire investigation was started quickly , said Thomas F. Gimble , acting Pentagon inspector general .
Tillman 's family members have said the military 's investigations into Tillman 's friendly - fire death in Afghanistan were a sham , and that the military and the government created a heroic tale about how their son died to foster a patriotic response across the country .
They have said they are certain they will never get the full story .

A single prenatal dose of methamphetamine – commonly known as speed – may be enough to cause long - term neurodevelopmental problems in babies , say University of Toronto researchers .
In research published in the August issue of Free Radical Biology and Medicine , U of T pharmacy and pharmacology professor Peter Wells and his colleagues determined that exposing pregnant mice only once to methamphetamine led to delivery of offspring with long - term neurodevelopmental problems , including reduced motor co-ordination .
Methamphetamine is a potent and addictive stimulant .
" We 've known for a while that meth abuse during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight , cleft palates and other malformations but this is the first research demonstrating that even a single exposure can cause long - term damage , " says Wells .
" It 's pretty remarkable that a single low dose can have such an effect .
" It 's an important finding , given the increasing use of club drugs among women of childbearing age .
It has clinical implications , because it shows that the fetus is exquisitely sensitive . "
The developing fetus appears to be vulnerable to DNA damage from methamphetamine exposure because it has n't yet developed the enzymes that protect it against free radicals – highly activated , destructive oxygen molecules that have been implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases , says Wells .
This vulnerability lasts from the embryonic stage through the later fetal period , times when organ structures and mental functions develop .
" People usually think the last trimester of pregnancy is when developing brain function is most susceptible to damage , but in this case the brain is also affected by methamphetamine even in the earlier embryonic period , " says Wells .
Wells ' next step will be to study women and their babies who have been exposed to drugs like methamphetamine that enhance free radical formation to see if the human damage is consistent with his mouse findings .
He will also try to determine whether the methamphetamine causes other lasting damage in mice , such as impacts on learning and memory .
" Methamphetamine has very different toxic effects in the fetal brain than in adult mice , which surprised me , " says Wells .
" In adults , you can see actual structural degeneration of the brain . "
U of T doctoral candidates Winnie Jeng and Andrea Wong and undergraduate Ryan Ting - A - Kee were also involved in this study .
The research was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) .
The doctoral candidates received awards from the CIHR / Rx&D Health Research Foundation , the American Society of Toxicology and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .

I ca n’t speak for schools outside the United States , but for those readers who went to school in America , I think you ’ll agree that the American education system is in sore need of an upgrade .
The world is changing at such a rapid pace and it ’s my strong opinion that there should be more classes dedicated to helping students prepare and cope with the real world once they graduate .
If you look at this generation of students , you ’ll find that most are “ shell shocked ” once they graduate because they had little or no preparation for what was to come .
High school mostly teaches you to memorize information and to regurgitate it back to your teacher , only to completely erase the information from your mind the moment you walk out after taking the test .
When you go on to college , you do a bit of the same things , but you also learn to think analytically , critically , and to broaden your mind so to speak , but even people who graduate from college will learn lessons from the real world the hard way as well .
The sad part is all of this could ’ve been prevented with some proper education beforehand .
Below are five things that I firmly believe should be taught in every school in America so that students do n’t get railroaded when they enter the real world .
If you ’re still in school and reading this , consider it your lucky day as mastering these five skills will give you a great head start and help separate you from the rest of the pack as well .
# 1. Personal Finance
Every week or so , there always seems to be a new article in CNN , USA Today , or Yahoo about young adults struggling with debt , whether it be from credit cards or loans in general .
High interest rates , hidden fees , not consolidating debt – these terms and concepts are mostly unknown to young adults and because of that ignorance , they tend to make big errors in judgment .
A prime example is thinking that they just have to pay the minimum on their balance and not realizing that by doing so , they pay 2 - 3 times as much in the long run .
Alongside that , most young adults do n’t have a clue on how to invest their money .
They do n’t know what a Roth IRA account is , or a 401k , or the magic of compound interest , the tax benefits associated with investing in these types of vehicles , etc .
There ’s a lot of specialized knowledge out there that young adults are not aware of on when it comes to how they can invest their money and as a result , they frivolously spend it away .
Credit score is another big thing .
A lot of young adults do n’t bother to check up on it to make sure there are no errors with it .
Your credit score is your report card in the real world and it comes into play when you ’re buying a car , renting your first apartment , and even when you ’re getting a job ( most employers are now checking credit scores to determine how responsible the candidate is ) .
Protect that at all costs .
Learn what drives your credit score down .
Learn what drives your credit score up .
Check up on it every now and then to ensure nothing is wrong with it .
Even something as basic as creating a simple budget is beyond the grasp of some young adults and it simply amazes me that a lot of people do n’t do this and some do n’t even know how ( you ’d be surprised ) .
Figure out your income after taxes , pay yourself FIRST ( this is a big one – most people pay the bills and frivolously spend the leftovers until next payday ) , see what you can cut out if things are tight , look to see where you can bring in more income if you need to do so , etc .
Another important subset regarding personal finance are those “ intangible ” things , such as learning to differentiate between need and want , delaying the gratification , and having an inner sense of value .
These concepts ca n’t be taught in the classroom but only taught through oneself via self discipline .
We live in a materialistic society where unfortunately , many young people grow up with the “ have ” then “ be ” mentality .
If I have _______ , then I ’ll be ____________ .
Blame it on the media , advertising , or the impressionable minds of young people , but you ’ll frequently see that a lot of people get stuck in this mentality and as a result , needlessly pile themselves in a mountain of debt .
One thing that I want to point out to students is that you ’ll find as you get older , that a lot of people “ fake ” financial success .
Not all , but a pretty big chunk .
The neighbor or co-worker you see with the fancy car and nice clothes are most likely knee deep in debt while you ’ll find the people with the average car and clothes have little or no debt and a nice big cushion of savings to that as well .
And the ironic and sad part is that most people do n’t really care about other people because they ’re so busy with themselves , so all that effort to impress others is really all in vain .
The inherent danger in trying to accumulate expensive things to feel good about yourself is that you ’re telling yourself that you need something outside of yourself to validate you , when everything you need to validate yourself is already within you .
Stop looking for anything outside of you because there will always be something new and better to purchase .
It ’s like a dog chasing its tail .
You ’ll never catch it .
Learn to simplify your life and to be content and grateful for the things you have .
Do n’t get caught up in the materialistic chase because once you do , it ’s hard to get out .
# 2. Communicating Effectively
By this , I ’m not necessarily talking about giving speeches and presentations , although that certainly falls in this category .
I ’m mainly talking about being able to clearly take what ’s in your head and to put it into words so the other person clearly understands what you ’re saying the first time .
I know that sounds simple , but I ’m sure you ’ve met people in the workplace who do n’t take the time to prepare when they speak with you and as a result , waste your time talking in circles when all you want to say to them is : “ Can you take some time to think through what you want to say and come back to me later with that ? ”
Communicating effectively is one of the most underrated , yet most powerful skills you can develop .
The biggest part in communicating effectively is preparing what you want to say beforehand .
Keep it simple .
What ’s my point ?
Why ?
Prepare a good example .
Your best friend in communicating effectively are these two words : “ For example ” .
Whenever you see a confused look on people ’s faces , your best response is leading with those two words :
For example .
When you do that AND follow up with a relevant example , it allows the other person to “ frame ” what you ’re talking about to get a better idea of what it is .
Communicating effectively is one of THE MOST underrated and MOST valuable skills a person can have .
And let me tell you on a personal level , there ’s nothing more refreshing than dealing with people who take the time to prepare what they have to say and back it up with clear examples .
It ’s a very rare skill nowadays .
# 3. Social Skills
Closely related to communicating effectively are social skills in general .
After you graduate , you ’re not going to be dealing with your high school or frat buddies anymore .
You ’ll be dealing with many people from different backgrounds , countries , and more importantly different age groups , so it would be wise to learn how to socialize outside your own group .
Cut the slang .
Learn to respect customs from other countries .
Learn how to listen – few people do .
Learn when to speak and when NOT to .
Build rapport .
Learn the art of networking – that ’s key .
Networking is a big skill that ’s not taught enough in schools .
Learn to compliment .
Mingle .
Make small talk .
Learn to approach people – that ’s another big skill .
Most people do n’t have the guts to take the first initiative and introduce themselves .
Be the big man .
Take the first step .
Learn to make the other person feel good and important .
Dale Carnegie is your best friend in this area ( Google his name if you do n’t know what I ’m talking about )
# 4 . Sales
Obviously I ’m not advocating people becoming a salesman after school , but learning the art of selling is what I ’m advocating .
If you think about it , we all sell everyday .
We sell ideas to our boss .
We sell to our friends when we pitch ideas on what to do this weekend .
We sell ourselves in job interviews .
You could say that sales is a great combination of social skills and communicating effectively , but with some other components you should pick up that will be useful .
Listen .
Really listen .
Actively listen .
Learn how to be convincing .
Be persuasive .
Think of objections and counter them ahead of time .
Stress benefits instead of features .
Listen to the other person .
( yes I know it ’s a repeat , but it ’s for emphasis )
Develop empathy .
Think in terms of how you can help serve the other person .
Selling is one of the few skills that can be utilized in any job or career .
It ’s one of the most important cross marketable skills you will ever develop .
# 5 : Time Management
Speaking of other skills that can be utilized in any job and career is time management .
The majority of students never really learn to value their time and manage it while in school .
Procrastination is all too rampant ( studying right before class , doing homework and essays the day it ’s due , partying the night before the exam ) .
This lack of time management often carries over into adulthood , which becomes a major liability .
Learn to make a to do list .
Learn to prioritize .
Learn to break things down into 30 minute blocks of time .
Learn about actionable items .
David Allen ’s GTD system is your best friend here along with Dan Kennedy ’s No B.S Time Management .
Again if you ’re unfamiliar with these people , Google is your best friend , but I ’m sure the majority of readers will know what I ’m talking about .
+ 1. Health
It ’s not enough to make students run a mile and play sports .
Education is needed now more than ever .
Education on the dangers of consuming too much fast food .
Education on what diets in high sugar and fat can do to the body .
Education on proper nutrition .
Education on the importance of exercising regularly as well .
I think if schools start teaching these kinds of things , we could nip so many problems in the bud because most teenagers will not research this material on their own .
The few that do have a head start in life but if we can’t teach them , schools should at the very least raise some sort of awareness and have an introductory class that talks about them – Real World 101 .
If you have any friends or family who are still in school , please forward them this article .
Think of it as a cheat sheet for the real world .
You ’ll be doing them a great service and they will most definitely thank you after they graduate .
I guarantee it .
int nlz2 ( unsigned int x ) { unsigned int y ; int n = 32 ; y = x >> 16 ; if ( y != 0 ) { n = n - 16 ; x = y ; } y = x >>
8 ; if ( y != 0 ) { n = n - 8 ; x = y ; } y = x >>
4 ; if ( y != 0 ) { n = n - 4 ; x = y ; } y = x >>
2 ; if ( y != 0 ) { n = n - 2 ; x = y ; } y = x >>
1 ; if ( y != 0 ) { return n - 2 ; } return n - x ; }
[ Editor 's note :
What you are about to read is a true story of an industry veteran and loyal Destructoid reader who has been in the business for some time .
Names have been left out to protect the identity of those involved , but everything said here is the true experience of this tester .
-- Robert Summa ]
Most everyone in the gaming community is aware of the long hours put in by developers and testers .
They whine and complain about 60 , 70 , even 80 hour weeks .
Amateurs .
Before I begin , I would like to point out that the following scenario is NOT TYPICAL of the game industry .
This is a tale of a truly epic clusterf *ck that simply went out of control due to way too many factors .
No one is to blame in my opinion , and no blame shall be placed .
The following is not to discourage anyone from the gaming industry , nor is it to condemn anyone involved .
It is simply a history of two of the oddest months in my life .
A few years back I worked for a certain video game company in the San Francisco bay area .
I 'm not giving away which one , because almost every large game company 's testing facility is in the San Francisco bay area .
In fact , I 'm not going to give away any names of anyone involved .
This is because I do n't want any nasty letters sent , subpoenas served , or hired goons dispatched .
That is not my intention , I mean no harm to any parties involved .
I just want to share my story .
Regardless , the following is to the best of my spotty memory , all true .
This particular video game company hired me as a tester earlier in the year .
Anyone who 's had any contact with a game tester will explain the general malaise of the profession , so I 'll leave that to them .
This is about one particular couple of months that I will never forget .
In early May , I was asked to go off - site for a game currently in development by an established company in southern California .
Everything would be taken care of -- hotel , transportation , food , anything I could want short of hookers and blow .
And if I wanted those , they also offered a per diem check on top of my regular pay .
It sounded good , so I agreed .
I packed up , said my goodbyes , and got on the plane .
In the Hero's Journey , this is known as Crossing the Threshold .
Of course , the Hero's Journey also involves hot chicks , but there ain't none of that here , so you can toss that assumption out the window .
Me and several other testers arrived in SoCal and proceeded to the hotel .
Now , no matter how dark and brutal this story might get , I have to say that this hotel was swank .
Comfy beds , HBO , free breakfast , two free drinks at happy hour , and they sold cigarettes and beer at the little hotel store .
Plus , everyone got their own rooms .
I half - expected it to be some sort of dorm situation with us sharing rooms , since most testers are between the ages of 18 and 25 , but the company was very professional and put everyone up in their own rooms .
God knows how much that cost them .
I did n't bring a computer with me , but I did schlep along my PS2 which I promptly plugged into the TV , assuming I 'd have time to play it .
I also brought a selection of DVDs and games .
And yes , I brought porn .
The next Monday we strolled out , had a very nice breakfast of ham and cheese omelettes , bacon , and Pepsi , packed into the cars and drove to the developer 's office .
It was a fairly small , inconspicuous section of buildings in a purely commercial area .
You 'd never guess they made games there .
We were introduced to the producers .
There were three of them .
Two worked for the publisher , the company I worked for , and one worked for the developer .
If you do n't know what producers do , they 're the ones that make sure sh*t gets done .
They crack the whip .
And with three producers , that 's a lot of whips .
Like in that Passion movie .
We were set up in a small conference room , lined up with PS2s , Xboxs , and PCs as this particular title was cross-platform .
The reason we were down in SoCal was so we could immediately get to work on the current build instead of waiting for it to be uploaded through the intarweb tubes up north .
Time is of the utter essence in the game industry .
The first week or so was perfectly fine .
We worked from 9 to 6 with an hour lunch , same as every other testing job I 've ever had .
This gave us ample time to have breakfast at the hotel , get to work on time , and get back to the hotel in time for drinks and relaxation .
We was big pimpin ' just chillin ' out in front of the pool with spirits in hand , shooting the sh*t with the crew .
The first week was fine .
We even had that weekend off .
Things took a turn the following Monday .
We started getting a little bit of overtime .
This is to be expected as a tester -- 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. , perfectly normal tester 's schedule .
The game continued to be refined and changed , and we took it all in stride .
It sucked that we did n't get back for happy hour anymore , but liquor in California can be sold until 2 am .
We were fine .
During this week I believe , some more testers were shipped down , plus the European testers arrived from all over those little countries across the mighty Atlantic .
So we were moved to a larger conference room next to the old one .
Well , slightly larger is an exaggeration .
The size increase was approximate to taking a shaved poodle and letting its hair grow in .
In a room about the size of a standard human living room , we had 20 people , 20 computers , 20 LCD screens , 20 PS2s , 20 Xboxs , plus ALL the cables necessary to plug each and every one of these pieces of equipment into the wall .
I swear if an electrician had seen this , he would have shat himself .
Now I do n't know if you 've been to SoCal in May , but it 's just like being in SoCal in August .
It 's hot .
90 degrees hot .
Now even with the meager AC running , you still have 20 nerds and 80 pieces of heat - producing appliances humming along in this space .
They gave us fans , which was like tossing a bucket of water on the surface of the sun .
It was fine most of the time , but after several hours of all this crap pumping out God knows how many BTUs , rooms will heat up .
Things continued to go south .
Let me describe the game in question that had us all sweating .
All you really need to know is that it had levels and had a designer that people had heard of .
This is all you need , and all you get .
The game itself was passable , but if you ask any tester , the longer you 're on a game the more you despise it .
I do n't care if you 're testing the greatest game in the history of mankind .
If you 're on it for 10 - 12 hours a day for months on end , you will eventually not want to sit within 90 feet of it .
It 's a fundamental law of testing .
Here 's a tip : do n't ever ask a tester for their opinion on a game they worked on .
It will be skewed .
Slowly the deadline approached .
The title had to be finished .
Two weeks passed .
Hours were adjusted .
8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 6 days a week .
Tensions rose .
This was no one 's fault , really .
Put a bunch of people in a room for a long enough time and problems come up .
Little things start to pick at you , like someone forgetting to apply deodorant , or someone talking just a bit too loudly .
Things do n't change , just your perception of them .
The occasional room - emptying fart stopped being so funny .
Gay jokes began to be recycled .
The stale scent of sweat , cigarette smoke , and flat soda began to dig into everyone 's senses .
There was very little room on the tables for food , so adjustments were continually made to accommodate .
The food .
The food started to get to us as well .
As with most developers , sodas are free , and once the trenches are dug to kill a game on time , dinner is brought in .
But on a long enough timeline , nothing tastes good anymore .
A pattern emerged of Chinese , Mexican , Italian , Indian , American in the form of burgers and fries , and whatever the hell nationality you want to put pizza in to .
Eventually it stopped tasting good and became something you did to break up the monotony of testing the title .
I ate salad , for Christsake .
SALAD .
Life was separated into two sections : testing the game , and everything else .
Occasionally we'd get a shorter day , but after so much time on the job , we had no goddamn clue what to do with the time .
No one was from the area , and developers and testers very rarely intermixed , so we did n't know any cool places to go .
In the downtime I 'd either watch TV in someone 's room , read a book , or play PS2 .
We went to Fry 's a couple times , and I picked up some games I had n't had the opportunity to try .
Yes , I know , playing a video game after all this sounds odd , but you 're missing the point .
It was a different game , one devoid of bugs .
It entertained .
It distracted .
I bought a DS game that probably saved me .
More on that later .
At the beginning of June , we were met with some bad news .
I had seen it coming .
The title was supposed to be done , but as with most big titles , it was pushed back .
So we were stuck for two more weeks .
Just two more they said .
June also brought another schedule .
Every Tuesday a build would be checked and sent to the main office .
Our job was to check every level and make sure it was playable so it could be thoroughly tested .
The real trick was getting the build out the f*cking door and into the intertubes .
The PS2 only has 32 megs of memory .
If it attempts to load a level that is larger than this , it will crash and the level becomes untestable , not to mention a million other tiny coding errors that could come up .
Sh*t , you could forget a semicolon and the world comes crashing down .
So we would receive a build , run through it , and if it worked , we passed it on .
The problem was we often did n't receive a build until 8 or 9 p.m .
If there was a crash , a new build would have to be fixed and recompiled .
This can take hours .
Regularly we were at the office until 2 , 3 , even 4 in the morning to check and recheck builds until it was enough to send off .
Then we went back to the hotel and slept until 8:30 in the morning to get back to it .
We were allowed leeway those mornings , but we soldiered on .
We had to get paid , son .
During those wee hours of darkness , the place was almost empty .
At least one producer was always present , along with the lead programmer and one or two others .
They did their best , I know , but there 's only so many hours a person can stare at something without going off their rocker .
Except maybe boobs , but I have no proof of that .
It was at about this point when the dreams started .
With so many hours spent looking at the same title on the same screen , I began to have incredibly vivid dreams of the game itself .
Sometimes they were accurate , perfect reincarnations of certain scenes within the game .
For some , my brain gave itself a little dancing space and went ga-ga .
But for many of those few hours of sleep , the game stayed with me .
I almost demanded to be paid to sleep if I was testing in my dreams .
At one point some of us got sick .
It may have been the food , or someone had brought a cold in , or God decided to punish us , but whatever it was several of us were knocked out , including myself .
The strong ones delivered medication to the weak for a few days .
But the deadline fast approached , so we willed the disease away and continued .
The game changed , and changed , and changed again .
They were n't fixing bugs , I thought , they were actively changing the game .
This should not happen once a game is in beta .
It always does no matter where you are , but whatever .
For the life of me I cannot remember the details of the second week of June .
It was supposed to be the last week .
We could finally end this chaos and go home .
But before that , we had to pass through the belly of the beast .
Every day we would submit a new build to the home office .
That meant every day we were in the office until 3 in the morning .
Once until 5 , and another until 7 a.m .
The developers that had left at 7 the previous night greeted us that morning .
I can only imagine how we looked .
Nearly two dozen zombies toying away with controllers , numb from everything , even the slowly rising sun .
Twenty - four hour days are not unheard of in testing land , but rarely are there several in a row .
I clocked over 110 hours that week .
Consider that .
110 hours .
Let 's stop and run the numbers .
There are 168 hours in a week .
168 minus 110 is 58 .
Subtract the lunch breaks , dinner breaks , and commutes , and you end up with 44 .
That 's 44 hours that week not spent in the office , near the office , going to the office , or leaving the office .
Even if I had spent every single second not at work sleeping , which did n't happen due to basic hygiene , that 's only 6 hours a day to sleep .
Plus , I 'm an insomniac .
So that 's why I do n't remember it .
It was because of that week that once , just once , the first time in five years and the only time since , that I smoked pot .
I know I 'm not supposed to say this , but it helped .
I had visions from when I was a 3 - month old baby , but it helped .
Then the news came .
We were to stay down in SoCal for another two weeks .
I could almost feel my psyche shatter in my skull and tiny little pieces of my personality fall out of my ear .
After a month of incredible hours on a title that threatened to open its maw and swallow reality , I was about to lose it .
I smoked three cigarettes after hearing that news .
That 's a lot for me .
There was n't another 110 hour week , but they came close .
More late nights , more of the same food , same levels , same faces , same room , same routine , same same same .
We had no Internet connection .
There was Internet at the hotel , but I had no computer .
There was HBO , but no Skinemax .
The only porn I had I brought with me was my DVDs , and I had used them all up .
There was no masturbation .
I always thought if I had nothing else , I 'd have that .
Then I lost that .
If that 's not losing the last vestige of humanity , then I do n't know what is .
Those last two weeks I simply became numb to everything around me .
I had no sense of humor , no sense of propriety , no sense of style .
I stopped showering and shaving .
My clothes were dirty .
I came in , sat at my station , and just ... was .
The hours eased back , but I was gone far before that .
I sat back and accepted my fate .
Bugs were fixed , and the game was changed and changed again .
The bug count continued to swell .
It had gone far , FAR beyond anything I had ever seen or have seen since .
I lost track of days .
I stopped watching a show on HBO that I had discovered and liked .
In fact , in those last couple weeks , the only thing that kept me from going off the deep end was that certain DS game I mentioned before .
It made my brain spark just enough to keep me going .
Finally , on the last day , late in June , we finally sent off the last build and finished our task .
The stations were stripped down , and everything was returned to its place .
The producers took us out to lunch to a fancy restaurant , and later to a barbecue .
It was a nice attempt .
When I returned back home up north , I did n't go into work for a week .
I had n't had a haircut since I left for SoCal .
I had n't washed my clothes for weeks and I apologize to whomever I sat next to on the plane .
The night I returned I got fall - down drunk and passed out on my cold , abandoned bed , not giving a shit about anything or anyone .
My e-mail was so full I just got another account .
In essence , for those two months , I did not exist in the real world .
And once I got back , it took over a week for everything to really go back to the way it was before I disappeared .
Once I got back to work , I found out that the game had been delayed .
The famous lead designer apparently did not like the final product and wanted more work on it , so they needed some people to go back to SoCal .
I politely declined .
I did recover , and I was perfectly fine after a week off .
And to further clarify , this debacle was no one 's fault in my eyes .
It was a product of impossible expectations .
Things just ... happen .
Perhaps that 's the lesson to be learned , if anything should be learned at all .
Sh*t happens , and everyone has to roll with it .
You can have the best intentions , the finest crew , and the best equipment , and sh*t 's still gonna go south .
The magic , you see , lies in surviving the twists , rolling with the punches , and bringing it all together .
Also , bring more porn than you think you need .
Because you 're gonna need it .

The Second Intellectual Property Enforcement Directive ( IPRED2 ) , which we last covered earlier this month , came another step closer to passage yesterday , as it was approved by the European Parliament .
The final version of the legislation removed some of the most controversial provisions , but critics still questioned why it was necessary to criminalize an area of law that has long been handled by the civil court system .
The new directive mandates that those violating copyrights , trademarks , or certain other rights " on a commercial scale " or " inciting such infringements " be subject to fines up to € 300,000 and up to a four years in jail .
" Today , ' inciting ' is only criminal in some member states , and in exceptional cases such as hate speech .
Elevating IPRs to the same level is a scary development , " noted Jonas Maebe , an analyst with the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure , in the wake of the vote .
" The inciting clause is also reminiscent of the US ' Induce Act ' , which threatened to make MP3 players such as the iPod illegal . "
The directive is ostensibly designed to crack down on commercial piracy and counterfeiting operations , but critics warned that , thanks to the vague terminology of the directive , it could apply much more widely .
They note that no definitions are offered for the terms " incitement " or " commercial scale , " opening the possibility that the courts could interpret them to include innovators building new media products .
Those terms could be interpreted , for example , to hold ISPs liable for the infringing activities of their users .
Critics did succeed in removing some of the original proposal 's most egregious problems .
The final directive excluded patent infringement from criminal penalties .
Given the murky and inconsistent state of European patent law , critics worried that entrepreneurs could find themselves facing jail time for accidentally infringing upon an obscure patent .
An amendment was also adopted ensuring that fair use of copyrighted works would not be considered a criminal offense .
However , most other intellectual property rights in Europe would be enforced with criminal penalties .
For example , the penalties could be applied to violators of geographic indication rights .
That would seem to mean that a winemaker from outside the Champagne region of France could not only be sued but thrown in jail for selling his sparkling wine as " champagne . "
Ren Bucholz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes that the relatively close vote — 374 to 278 — points to growing opposition to the directive across Europe .
The directive will now go to the Council of the European Union , which is made up of representatives of the governments of each of the EU 's member countries .
Several member countries , led by the UK and the Netherlands , have expressed concerns about the directive .
Bucholz notes that if the Council disagrees with the Parliament 's decision , IPRED2 would go back to the European Parliament for further consideration .

` Proximated Emacs Powered by Python .
-- an XEmacs - like editor in Python .
Eventually .
Latest version : 0.7.1.1 " The Winchester " .
Download here
This is the code name for my editor project , started as the project for my graduate school thesis and built as an educational experiment to attempt to demonstrate the modern software development process using the ReadySET project management templates .
A quick summary of features currently provided :
Multiple top - level windows
Multiple views of the same file ( edit in one view and it shows up in the others )
Extensible file loading module ( current support to load from http as well as file protocols )
Minibuffer ala XEmacs , including tab completion
Multiple language support : currently baseline implementations of Python , Makefile , C/ C++ major modes
Other interesting major modes : Hyperspectral image view mode Music Player Daemon mode for controlling an MPD server
Development features :
Pure python source based on the wxPython widget toolkit
Most features coded as plugins - can enable or disable individual features at will
Scintilla styling code borrowed from Editra and I will continue to track Editra as more language lexers are supported
So , you 're probably thinking that the world does n't need another editor , and you might even be right .
In fact , a really good editor does already exist , but as I describe in my vision document , I 'm looking for a way to move beyond XEmacs .
So , anyway , it 's my itch to scratch , and besides : I 'm learning as I 'm writing this thing .
I do think it will be useful at some point , and to avoid NIH syndrome , I intend to borrow from existing projects as much as I can .
The more you can use code that someone else developed , debugged , and tested means less code that you have to support yourself .
Currently , I 'm still mostly working on the framework , despite a recent diversion into a music playing major mode .
You can check out the status page for more info and downloads .
The architecture is solidifying , so I suspect that I 'll be focusing on adding more features to the Python editing mode in this next iteration .
John and Nina Swanson run a business selling vintage postcards on eBay .
To keep customers happy , the Swansons reply to buyers promptly and ship on time .
This policy is reflected in their eBay feedback score — a rating based on responses to prior transactions .
Positive comments are scored as one point .
Neutral and negative remarks are recorded as zero and negative one , respectively .
The Swansons have a score of over 2,000 .
Six years ago , University of Michigan information studies professor Paul Resnick asked the couple to participate in an experiment .
Resnick wanted the Swansons to continue selling postcards through their established profile , but also to offer the same goods and services through seven fake identities .
Initially these bogus profiles would have no reputation ; later they would be given negative scores .
The Swansons agreed .
After 470 auctions , Resnick found that the Swansons ’ main account , with its high customer rating , earned an average of 8.1 percent more per transaction than the fakes .
It was the first hard proof that a feedback score — a number generated by a collection of unrelated people — carries quantifiable real - world value .
“ What we ’re seeing here is a new kind of trust , ” Resnick says .
“ It ’s a kind of impersonal trust geared to situations with lots of interactions among strangers . ”
In other words , the crowd matters .
Today we harness the masses for everything from choosing the next pop star on American Idol to perfecting open source software and assembling Wikipedia articles .
But perhaps the most widespread and vital uses for group input online are in scoring systems .
In addition to eBay feedback , these are the customer ratings that Amazon.com and Yahoo Shopping post with product reviews .
They ’re the feedback scores that Netflix tallies to help subscribers decide which movies to order .
And they ’re the up - or - down votes that sites like Digg and Reddit ( part of the Wired Media Group , which also includes WIRED magazine ) rely on to determine which stories to feed Web surfers .
But as rating systems have become more popular — and , as Resnick shows , valuable — there has been what some would say is a predictable response : the emergence of scammers , spammers , and thieves bent on manipulating the mob .
Call it crowdhacking .
In some cases , crowdhackers are looking to boost sales or increase traffic to their Web sites .
In other instances , they ’re simply ripping off unsuspecting consumers .
Either way , the more we base decisions on the wisdom of crowds , the greater the incentive to cheat .
The feedback system on eBay was the first widely used community - scoring program .
Launched in 1996 , it was a way for people to feel comfortable buying things from strangers .
Under eBay ’s rules , only people involved in a given transaction can rate it , and eBay wo n’t remove remarks once they ’re posted .
This scheme quickly became the gold standard , serving as a model for user - rating systems everywhere from Amazon to Yelp .
But people soon realized that the setup was easy to manipulate .
Cheats on eBay typically work like this : A scammer builds up a positive profile by selling hundreds of low - end items , then uses that high score to burn customers on big - ticket sales .
That ’s what police say an Arizona woman named Nancy Dreksler did in 2003 .
According to police reports , once Dreksler had acquired positive feedback by peddling inexpensive CDs and DVDs , she sold over $ 100,000 worth of nonexistent items and fled with the money , leaving more than 500 buyers empty - handed .
Arizona authorities say they may yet file charges ; meantime , Dreksler has pled guilty to theft and securities fraud charges in a separate Nevada case .
John Morgan , a professor at UC Berkeley ’s Haas School of Business , says reputation gaming is surprisingly common on eBay .
Morgan recently published a study in which he found more than 6,000 examples of buyers and sellers engaging in transactions solely to boost one another ’s scores .
These auctions frequently had titles like “ 100 + Feedback ” and a price of 1 cent .
Often , the item for trade was a booklet explaining how to increase feedback by reselling that same booklet .
“ We saw a number of sellers who used sham transactions to build reputation , laid low for a period of time , and then reentered high - value markets as apparently ‘ reputable ’ sellers , ” Morgan says .
e Bay says it constantly hunts for cheaters .
According to spokesperson Catherine England , the company uses sophisticated fraud - detection tools to spot suspicious activities and “ individuals who may be attempting to inflate their feedback . ”
She declines to identify these tools but concedes that they are “ not 100 percent perfect . ”
Other commerce sites have even fewer controls .
Yahoo Shopping , for instance , lets anyone post a review , making it easy for merchants to boost their ratings by submitting multiple reviews under false names .
A glaring example of this was disclosed last year , when then VP of Yahoo Shopping , Rob Solomon , admitted to Forbes that the company ’s merchant - rating system had been “ rigged ” by a Brooklyn - based company called PriceRitePhoto .
Somehow this shop had managed to get stellar Yahoo ratings , despite many negative reports from disgruntled customers .
Blogger Thomas
Hawk wrote a post detailing how he ’d been threatened by PriceRitePhoto ’s owner after writing negative comments about his experiences ordering a camera .
Yahoo finally banned the store , but it returned within months under the name Barclays - Photo , according to the Better Business Bureau .
After several more complaints , Yahoo removed Barclays Photo from its listings .
As of late January , it continues to operate ( with suspiciously excellent ratings ) on eBay .
Over the past few years , crowd scoring systems have made their way to news and article aggregators .
Instead of recommending products or services , these sites solicit community rankings to help steer readers to interesting online stories and postings .
The biggest and best known of these is Digg .
Members submit articles , along with a short description and link , to the Digg system .
Other members can then look through these articles and choose either to “ digg ” or “ bury ” the stories .
Articles with the most diggs make it onto the site ’s widely read front page .
But just as an eBay seller ’s reputation can be falsely inflated , so , too , can the popularity of an article on Digg .
The method of choice is the so - called Sybil attack .
Named after the famous case of a woman with 16 personalities , a Sybil attack occurs when an individual opens multiple accounts and has them all recommend the same thing .
With enough votes , the story makes it to the front page .
The payoff can be huge .
Getting fronted on Digg means millions of readers and has the potential to catapult a story to the top of a Google search .
If the dugg site has advertisers , it ’s a financial windfall .
If the site sells something — say , a gadget or a funny T - shirt — the rewards can be even greater .
These attacks work — so well , in fact , that several organizations have sprung up to help people launch them .
A Web site called User / Submitter charges $ 20 , plus $ 1 per digg , to boost a story to Digg ’s front page .
The site accomplishes this feat by paying an army of digg users 50 cents every time they vote for three User / Submitter - selected articles .
Speaking anonymously , the operator of User / Submitter says that in just two months of operation the site has garnered more than 100 clients , many of whom are “ writers or representatives from high - traffic news sites . ”
Then there ’s Spike the Vote , a sort of Digg - based pyramid scheme in which members earn one point every time they digg an endorsed story .
Once members have enough points , they can submit stories of their own to be dugg by the network .
Recently , Spike the Vote ’s owner , known only as Spike , sold the site on eBay .
A Digg user named Jim Messenger bought the site and gave it to Digg , which promptly shut it down .
But Messenger was n’t just being altruistic .
He bought Spike the Vote because he knew Digg ’s followers would put a story about what he had done on Digg ’s front page .
This , he figured , would attract customers to his search engine optimization business .
Another way to game Digg is to focus on the site ’s heaviest users .
The top 100 users on Digg account for as much as 50 percent of all the stories that make it to the front page .
Realizing this , a company called JetNumbers approached several of these users and asked if they would promote its VoIP service on the site .
At least one agreed .
And last August , a top 100 Digg user known as Geekforlife sold his account on eBay for $ 822 .
Digg founder Kevin Rose says he ’s working to root out the dishonesty .
Digg ’s watchdogs understand the legitimate ways that stories become popular .
Using that model , they ’re constantly tweaking algorithms that seek out nonstandard voting patterns .
“ Flags go up if , for instance , you ’ve created a bunch of new accounts and they all do one thing , ” Rose says .
The alarm also sounds if all the votes for a particular story come from one referring site , or if votes for a story come from people who do n’t click through to read it before giving the thumbs - up .
There are a number of other antihacking techniques that Rose says he can’t talk about .
One of these , according to Messenger , involves a “ friends macro ” tool that Messenger acquired ( and later gave to Digg ) with the purchase of Spike the Vote .
This tool lets users amp up their friend lists — which can be valuable in getting votes for your stories .
Understanding how it works , Messenger says , has undoubtedly helped Digg find cheaters .
Del.icio.us , the social bookmarking service , also allows users to vote on the most popular articles of the day ; a link to a story counts as a vote .
Like Digg , the site , owned by Yahoo , is ripe for crowdhacking .
Last September , Fred Stutzman , a PhD student at the University of North Carolina , followed a link on del.icio.us to an identity - management startup called my : eego .
Curious , Stutzman began checking out the users who had recommended the service .
The first 16 all had exactly the same linking pattern — they had bookmarked two other startups , and their accounts contained no other information or links .
Hours after Stutzman blogged about the Sybil attack , del.icio.us deleted the accounts of the link spammers .
Had the Sybil gone unnoticed , however , my : eego ’s scheme might have worked .
Legitimate users like Stutzman would have visited my : eego and possibly bookmarked it , creating more buzz on del.icio.us until the misled crowd had provided the link swarm my : eego was after .
Similar tricks have worked on other occasions .
Last November , a story titled “ Geek ’s Guide to Getting in Shape : 13 Surefire Tips ” quickly tallied more than 100 del.icio.us links before blogger Niall Kennedy outed the article as geek bait .
Turns out the story was planted on several aggregators by a Web site loaded with advertising for cheap dental plans .
( Yahoo and del.icio.us declined to comment for this story . )
So we have an arms race : the crowd - hackers manipulating eBay and Yahoo and Digg and del.icio.us versus the crowd defenders — developers and other users who scrub scams out of the system .
The University of Michigan ’s Resnick is optimistic that the good guys will prevail , so long as they continue to build algorithms that smoke out the cheaters .
“ A good reputation system makes people more trustworthy , ” Resnick says , “ because word gets around if they ’re not . ”
Tell that to Jakob Lodwick .
In July , Lodwick , CTO of the company that owns the Web site CollegeHumor , wanted to see how many people on del.icio.us would be willing to link to something for money .
He started a contest in which he promised to pick , at random , one del.icio.us user who linked to the contest site and give that person $ 100 .
He had nearly 2,700 links when he awarded the check to “ NedOne . ”
As for the thousands who provided meaningless links for nothing ?
They ’re proof that the crowd ca n’t always be trusted .

A New Power Rises in Iraq
by Michael J. Totten
ERBIL , IRAQ – What a difference a year makes .
Fourteen months ago I flew to Erbil , the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan , from Beirut , Lebanon , on the dubiously named Flying Carpet Airlines .
Flying Carpet ’s entire fleet is one small noisy plane with propellers , cramped seats , and thin cabin pressure .
Only nineteen passengers joined me on that once - a - week flight .
Everyone but me was a Lebanese businessman .
They were paranoid of me and of each other .
What kind of crazy person books a flight to Iraq , even if it is to the safe and relatively prosperous Kurdistan region ?
I felt completely bereft of sense going to Iraq without a gun and without any bodyguards , and it took a week for my on - again off - again twitchiness to subside .
Last week I flew to Erbil from Vienna on Austrian Airlines to work for a few weeks as a private sector consultant with my colleague Patrick Lasswell .
This time I did n’t feel anything like a fool .
Almost half the passengers were women .
Children played on their seats and in the aisle with toys handed out by the crew .
We watched an in - flight movie and ate the usual airline lunch fare served by an attractive long legged stewardess .
The cabin erupted with applause when the wheels touched down on the runway .
The pilot announced the weather ( sunny and 60 ) in three languages and cheerfully told us all to have a great day .
Have a great day may seem an odd thing to say to people who just arrived in Iraq , but this is Kurdistan .
I did , indeed , have a great day .
A man named Hamid picked up me and Patrick just beyond the passport control booth .
He was kindly sent by a friend on the Council of Ministers .
“ Here is your car , ” he said as he led us to his vehicle out in the parking lot .
New construction near Erbil ’s international airport
As he drove us into the city I felt none of the fear and apprehension I experienced the first time I came here .
Instead I saw considerable signs of progress .
The first time I drove from the airport into Erbil I felt that I had arrived in a dodgy and ramshackle backwater .
This time I felt – properly , I must say – that I had arrived in the capital of a serious and rising new power in the Middle East .
Nation - building is a hard and violent slog in the center and south of Iraq , and it might not ever work out .
But in Kurdistan , in the north , it already is a reality .
Massive new construction projects are literally everywhere .
Most of those that had started when I arrived for the first time are finished , and ambitious new projects are well underway .
New apartment towers next to the Dream City project .
The Dream City , which only existed on paper when I first got here , is now partly constructed .
Fancy new homes in the new city – designed on the New Urbanist model – are everywhere under construction .
The Korek Tower will be the tallest building in Iraq
The Korek Tower will be the tallest building anywhere in Iraq when it is finished .
It will more resemble a tower in Dubai or the United States than anything down south in Baghdad .
Old road signs are replaced with new ones
Dingy and banged up road signs were replaced in the last couple of months with crisp shiny new ones .
It may not seem like much , but the new signs give the city a more serious and modern look and heft .
The so - called Naza Mall recently opened to much fanfare in Erbil , and it made me wonder if the Kurds even know what a mall is .
Naza Mall is a store , and it is n’t a particularly large one .
But a new Western - style mall under construction next to the old souk downtown will be home for 6,000 stores and offices when it is finished .
Erbil ’s new mall takes shape next to the souk

Some of the stores in the mall are already open
A whole new town called “ American Village ” is under construction next to the luxurious Khan Zad hotel on the road between Erbil and the resort town of Salahadin .
Foreigners and locals alike are snapping up the properties well in advance .
A castle just down the road from the up and coming American Village
Iraqi Kurdistan is still a Third World country in many ways – there is no sewer system , for instance , and the electricity fails every day .
Unemployment is high .
But it ’s a Third World country with hope , and it is rapidly moving upscale .
New houses cost more in and around Erbil than they do in some parts of the United States .
An average sized 200 square meter lot can cost as much as 150,000 dollars – and that ’s before a house is built on it .
There are literally thousands of brand new houses here in this city , and the population is still just a little bit shy of one million .
Arabs are moving up here from the center and south – when they can , and as long as they are cleared by internal security – and they ’re hired to do menial jobs the Kurds no longer want .
Sunni Arabs were once the oppressors of Kurds .
Now they are reduced to the same low status as migrant Mexican workers in the United States .
The outer walls of ancient Erbil
The ancient old city walls next to downtown are an impressive sight , but inside the walls is a vast slum .
Well , it was a vast slum until recently .
A few months ago the residents were moved out so the city government can fix it up and restore it .
Erbil is n’t pretty , as Paris and Vienna are pretty .
Some of it is aesthetically brutal , and much of it is still rough around the edges .
But it ’s stimulating and interesting all the same .
The go - go - go and build - build - build attitude is infectious .
Every time I come here it looks cleaner , and richer , and more like a normal place .
Most of Erbil is still a bit ramshackle and rough around the edges
I ’m less prone to boredom here than I am in Europe ’s splendid capitals even though there is little in the way of entertainment culture .
Erbil is the most ramshackle of Iraqi Kurdistan ’s cities , but there is real raw power rising in this city and land .
This is what nation building looks like
I have never seen so much construction going up so quickly anywhere .
( There is more in Dubai , but I have never been there . )
The Hilton hotel chain is building a massive full - service tourist resort that will take five years to construct .
It may seem dumb to build a tourist resort in Iraq of all places , but this is Erbil Province , not Anbar Province – there is no war , no insurgency , and no terrorism here whatsoever .
The Middle East is a funny place .
One part of a country may be consumed by blood , fire , and mayhem , but that rarely means the whole country is dangerous -- even when that country is Iraq .
*
I met two old friends for dinner and embraced them both .
We knew we would see each other again , but it was nice to confirm it with another actual visit .
This trip is my fourth to Iraqi Kurdistan in just fourteen months .
A year and a half ago I could not have imagined that anywhere in Iraq would become a part of my life , let alone a pleasant part of my life .
Iraq is strange , though , and more complex than it appears from far away .
The civil war and the insurgency in Baghdad are real .
But the civil war and the insurgency are not all there is .
“ So much has changed since you were last here , ” one of my friends said at dinner .
“ Kurdistan is a different place now . ”
“ What changed ? ” I said .
Of course I had to ask , but this was a social dinner and not a formal interview .
So I ’ll leave their names out of this and paraphrase what they told me .
Understand that they are in a position to know exactly what they are talking about .
Iraqi Kurdistan is de-facto independent already .
The three northernmost provinces exist as a liberal - democratic state - within - a - state with their own parliament , their own laws , their own immigration policies , and their own military , border guards , and police .
That much was already known .
The region now , though , is even closer to formal sovereignty and actual independence than it recently was .
The United Nations does n’t recognize the existence of Iraqi Kurdistan because the United Nations is hung up on state sovereignty .
But the individual governments that make up the United Nations are coming around .
More diplomats from all over the world are coming here now , and this is exciting to the people who live here .
Foreign dignitaries who meet with local officials recognize there is a government in Iraq that is n’t in Baghdad .
99.8 percent of Iraqi Kurds voted to secede from Iraq in a non-binding referendum , and recognition of their de - facto independent country is as welcome as love letters .
Both the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States have sent people here recently .
One of my Kurdish dinner companions , who never wants to be quoted by name but is in a position to know , says the Democratic officials who come here support Kurdish interests as staunchly and reliably as the Republicans .
High tech equipment is now as easy to find in Iraqi Kurdistan as it is in Israel and the United States .
I still hear complaints about the Kissinger Betrayal in the 1970s , when Secretary of State Henry Kissinger summarily abandoned the Kurds to Saddam Hussein after promising them support for their resistance and liberation .
But I do n’t get the sense that too many Kurds are bracing for another round of that kind of statecraft even if the U.S. does withdraw its forces from south and central Iraq .
Three major obstacles to independence remain .
The first is Iraqi Kurdistan ’s relationship with Turkey .
That relastionship is bad but improving despite the Turkish military ’s well - publicized threats to invade Northern Iraq to eject the ( Turkish ) Kurdistan Worker ’s Party , the PKK , from using Iraqi soil to launch attacks against military and civilian targets in Turkey .
Relations between the ( Iraqi ) Kurdistan Regional Government and the Turkish government have quietly improved at the same time .
Iraq ’s Kurds genuinely want a civil relationship with Turkey because they can’t safely declare independence without it .
The Turks fear nothing more than Turkish Kurdistan declaring itself independent and attaching itself to a free Iraqi Kurdistan .
A bitter civil war is still simmering in Turkey between the PKK and the Turkish state .
Ethnic Kurds make up almost 25 percent of Turkey ’s population .
If they leave and take their land with them , the Turks will lose a huge amount of the eastern part of their country .
A truly independent Kurdish state in Iraq would likely embolden Kurdish militants in Turkey – or so the Turks fear .
Iraqi Kurdistan is land - locked and surrounded on all sides by hostile people and states .
They cannot survive on their own without first building a physical infrastructure that will allow them to survive border blockades as well as military invasions .
Kurdistan , unfortunately , is still connected to Iraq ’s main electrical grid .
And that means , as often as not , there is no power .
If you want 24 - hour electricity , buy a generator .
And keep it topped off with fuel .
( Generators are everywhere , and the large ones are louder than lawnmowers . )
A new electrical grid is under construction
Erbil Province is building a brand - new electrical grid that should work 24 hours a day and ca n’t be shut down by sabateurs in the Sunni Triangle or by a hostile government in Baghdad .
As soon as all of Iraqi Kurdistan is electrically severed from Baghdad , the Kurds ’ only remaining physical need is an oil refinery of their own .
The Kurds have enough oil .
Huge new fields near Zakho were just discovered .
Gasoline is expensive here , though , because oil has to be exported and then reimported .
Even without reliable electricity , Erbil is fairly well lit up at night thanks to ubiquitous generators .
The Kurds of Iraq may not need to bother with a declaration of independence .
It may fall from the sky , my source said , if the Sunni and Shia Arabs break Iraq in the course of their civil war .
“ What would we do , decide if we want to remain with the Sunni Arabs or the Shia ? ” he said .
“ We do n’t want to remain with either of them . ”
Businessmen without bodyguards or guns check email in the lobby of the luxurious Khan Zad resort hotel just outside Erbil .
The Kurds could n’t stick with the Shia if they wanted to .
The Shia and the Kurds are on the opposite side of the country , with the Sunni Arabs wedged in between from Baghdad north to the southern portions of Kirkuk and Mosul .
The Sunni Arabs are the Kurds ’ principal enemies , and there is no way the Kurds ( who also are Sunni Muslims ) will stick with the Sunni Arabs if the Shia Arabs decide to go their own way .
If the Arabs break Iraq , as they seem hell - bent on doing , the Kurds will be freed by default .
There will be no more “ Iraq ” for them to stay shackled to .
The gate to a Turkish - style mosque .
Mosques never get blown up around here
In the meantime , the Kurds are doing their best to cultivate civil relations with the Sunni Arabs while digging a massive trench on the Green Line to keep the insurgents , the car - bombers , and the suicide - bombers out .
The trench is more like a castle moat , really .
It ’s 5 meters wide , 5 meters deep , and it drops straight down .
Anyone trying to cross it without building a bridge will find themselves in a free fall .
It ’s an inverted version of the wall that separates Israelis from Palestinians .
Walls and trenches can be still be crossed , to be sure , but they ca n’t be crossed quickly , and they certainly cannot be crossed with any vehicles .
My dinner companions were shocked when I told them I ’m going to Baghdad next month with the American military .
( I ’m going , that is , unless the Department of Defense delays my trip yet again . )
“ Are you sure you want to go down there ? ” one of them said .
“ The Sunni militias cut throats and the Shia militias drill holes in people ’s heads .
That ’s Baghdad . ”
Recently some terrorists from one of the militias dumped three dead bodies on a street and broadcasted an announcement for the neighbors :
Anyone who tries to bury one of the bodies will join them .
For three weeks everyone walked past decomposing corpses as dogs tore at and ate the flesh .
Innocent children who do not yet understand the cruel ways of their terrible city asked their parents why those people were sleeping so long in the street .
A residential neighborhood in peaceful Erbil
Kurdistan is safe even without its anti-terrorist trench , and that ’s not because it is protected by American soldiers .
Only 50 or so troops remain in this part of Iraq .
There is no anti-American insurgency ( because there is virtually no anti-Americanism ) and there is no terrorism .
If the Arab Iraqis were as peaceable as the Kurds , the American military could have folded its tents a long time ago .
Iraqi Kurdistan is technically occupied by a foreign power , but this occupation surely ranks among one of the most absurd in human history .
Dr. Ali Sindi , advisor to Prime Minister Nechervan Barzani , told me that South Korea is the official occupier of “ Northern Iraq . ”
Korean soldiers are stationed just outside Erbil in a base near the airport .
He laughed when he told me the Kurdish military , the Peshmerga ( “ those who face death ” ) , surround the South Koreans to make sure they ’re safe .
Every couple of weeks another government somewhere in the world drops their travel advisory for Iraqi Kuridstan .
The regional government sends me an email every time it happens .
It is always seen as yet another milestone passed on the road to independence from Baghdad .
Not only is Kurdistan recognized as separate from Iraq , it is also recognized as different from Iraq .
Iraq is dangerous , but the north really is n’t .
New houses in Erbil
Kurdistan ’s rise flips Iraq on its head .
The Kurds are ahead , but they started from nothing .
Under Saddam ’s regime they had the worst of everything – the worst poverty , the worst underdevelopment , and worst of all they bore the brunt of the worst violence from Baghdad .
200,000 people were killed ( out of less than four million ) and 95 percent of the villages were completely destroyed .
The Kurds seem happy and well - adjusted .
Scratch the surface , though , and any one of them can tell you tales that make you tremble and shudder .
Everyone here was touched by the Baath and by the genocide .
If living well is the best revenge , the Kurds got theirs .
A bookseller in the souk in Erbil
“ You see this place now with its government , its democracy , and its system of laws , ” my guide Hamid said .
“ It was n’t like this even recently , believe me .
Before , it was a jungle . ”
Baghdad , the Sunni Triangle , and Shia South are still jungles .
No one I know here thinks the Sunni and Shia Arabs will be able to reconcile and live with each other in peace – there is too much bad blood between them .
I do n’t know if that ’s true or if it ’s not .
The Middle East is an unpredictable place , and I ’ve made a fool of myself often enough by thinking I know what will happen .
What I do know for sure is that Baghdad is burning and Kurdish power is rising .
The question up north is n’t whether Iraq will come apart , but only when , how , and into how many pieces .

Colors vary in character according to their environment .
This phenomenon is called simultaneous contrast .
Achromatic borders increase the luminescence of a color .
Seen against a dark background , color appears lighter than seen against a pale background .
A pale background will force a color to the foreground , while a darker background will cause it to recede again .
A cold color , if enclosed by a warm colored border , will appear cooler than it actually is , whereas the same color , instead set within a cold border , will appear warmer .
A color code taken from a position consecutive on the color wheel to that of the foreground color will , if used as a background , decrease the prominence of the foreground color .
The more complementary the background color code , in terms of its position on the color wheel , the purer and more luminous the foreground color will seem .
A couple months back , I mentioned that I ’d like to try out something new on this site , specifically , a programming contest .
After a lot of thinking and a little bit of coding , I finally put one together : The Olympiad of Misguided Geeks at Worse Than Failure Programming Contest .
Unlike other programming contests , the goal of the OMGWTF contest is not to flex your algorithmic muscles and solve some abstract computational problem like you might in an ACM contest .
Nor is it like the International Obfuscated C Coding Contest ; in fact , writing code like that would be a surefire way to lose this contest .
Instead , the goal of the OMGWTF contest is to solve an incredibly simple problem using the most obscenely convoluted way imaginable .
And for this first contest , the simple problem is to build and implement the logic for a four - function calculator .
Defining “ Bad Code ”
One of the bigger challenges in figuring out the contest details was coming up with a way to make purposely “ bad code ” fun to write and , most importantly , fun to look at .
Thinking about the different types of “ bad code , ” we have :
Ugly Code , which is unreadable , unmaintainable , and difficult to understand .
We ’ve all seen it plenty times ( both at work and on this site ) : single letter variable names , no subroutines , and so on .
It ’s like building a bench out of rough timber .
, which is unreadable , unmaintainable , and difficult to understand .
We ’ve all seen it plenty times ( both at work and on this site ) : single letter variable names , no subroutines , and so on .
It ’s like building a bench out of rough timber .
Buggy Code , which simply riddled with bugs .
Null pointers , memory leaks , divide by zeros , etc .
It probably works most of the time when used exactly as intended , but any deviation will cause it crashing to a halt .
It ’s like building a bench using finishing nails and scotch tape .

It ’s like building a bench using finishing nails and scotch tape .
Clever Code , which is unconventional and solves a problem that may or may not be solvable with conventional means .
Duff ’s
Device is a good example of “ clever code , ” as are many of the samples seen on this site .
It ’s like building a bench by planting and grafting several small trees together .
Since the fine folks over at the IOCCC have already compiled some of the most beautiful Ugly Code ever created ( seriously – a C - based flight simulator with code shaped like an airplane – that ’s impressive ) , and since looking at Ugly Code is more or less what many of us do each day at work , I ’ve decided to exclude Ugly Code as an option altogether .
In other words , entries for this contest will need to focus on clean and human - readable code that is , first and foremost , Clever and , if desired , Buggy .
Building The Calculator
I ’ve chosen C/C++ as the language for this first contest .
Not only do most of you ( 85 % , last reader survey ) seem to know it , but I think C/C++ will give you more than enough rope to hang not only yourself , but the poor end user who runs your calculator .
Which , I guess , would be me .
For the UI challenged , I created a Win32 skeleton solution that you may use .
Having not touched C++ in nearly a decade and having only dabbled in Win16 programming once or twice ( using an IDE , no less ) , I figured I ’d be the perfect person to put it together .
And after several hours of hacking and remembering the doh’s of pointers , I finally got something mostly working .
Hopefully .
The idea is that anyone should be able to download the skeleton solution , fill in the “ TODOs ” in the code , and simply compile it .
The TODOs look like this :
double DoAdd ( double op1 , double op2 ) { //TODO : return the sum of op1 and op2 }
Of course , you do n’t have to use my skeleton solution , but it ’s there for you if you ’d prefer .
For the Linux folks out there , you may use the mostly equivalent GTK skeleton solution .
Judging the Entries
I asked some of my favorite bloggers to pick out the winning entries , and being the nice guys that they are , they agreed .
The OMGWTF contest judges will be Raymond Chen , Joel Spolsky , and Jeremy Zawodny .
However , before I hand off the submissions to the judges , I will go through and make sure that each one passes the requirements :
Meets the Tech Specs ( C/C++ , Win32/GTK , etc )
Meets the UI Specs ( allows entering of numbers and displaying of answer )
Passes all of Test Cases
An Added Bonus : Static Analysis
If you have n’t heard of Static Analysis before , it ’s definitely something you should check out .
It ’s a good weapon in the battle for Quality Software that sits somewhere between code review and test cases .
A good Static Analysis tool can understand execution paths , user - defined types , APIs , security implications , multi- threading issues , etc. – and make sure that they ’re programmed safely .
As for the Added Bonus , entries will be run through a Static Analysis tool ( Coverity ’s Prevent to be specific ) for an objective look at how Buggy the code is or is n’t .
This will present a fun opportunity to shoot for a perfect score ( zero defects – how hard could that be ? ) or the most obscenely Buggy code ( extra points for those who exceed a defect / line - of - code ratio greater than 1 ) .
Winning The Contest
Although you ’ll find plenty more details over at the OMGWTF contest site , the author of the winning entry will be awarded a High - Resolution JPEG of an Official Olympiad of Misguided Geeks at Worse Than Failure First Prize Trophy .
In addition , if you ’d like , I ’ll toss in a brand new laptop ( choice of a 15 ” MacBook Pro or Sony VAIO VGN - SZ430N / B ) so you can view this JPEG .
There will also be some runner up prizes , but they wo n’t be nearly as cool the High - Resolution JPEG ( or the new laptop ) .
Good luck to all , and make sure to check out the OMGWTF Contest Site for more details .
I ’ll be back tomorrow with a regular feature article .
UPDATE : Contest is long over , but please check out the winning entries .
Although many physicists remain skeptical about the Los Alamos findings , the new experiment has attracted wide interest .
The Fermilab auditorium was filled with about 800 people , and talks were given at the 16 additional institutions by other collaborating scientists .
That reflected in part the hope of finding cracks in the Standard Model , which encapsulates physicists ’ current knowledge about fundamental particles and forces .
The Standard Model has proved remarkably effective and accurate , but it cannot answer some fundamental questions , like why the universe did not completely annihilate itself an instant after the Big Bang .
The birth of the universe 13.7 billion years ago created equal amounts of matter and antimatter .
Since matter and antimatter annihilate each other when they come in contact , that would have left nothing to coalesce into stars and galaxies .
There must be some imbalance in the laws of physics that led to a slight preponderance of matter over antimatter , and that extra bit of matter formed everything in the visible universe .

Fermilab
The imbalance , some physicists believe , may be hiding in the dynamics of neutrinos .
Neutrinos come in three known types , or flavors .
And they can change flavor as they travel , a process that can occur only because of the smidgen of mass they carry .
But the neutrino transformations reported in the Los Alamos data do not fit the three - flavor model , suggesting four flavors of neutrinos , if not more .
Other data , from experiments elsewhere , have said the additional neutrinos would have to be “ sterile ” — completely oblivious to the rest of the universe except for gravity .
As soon as you decide to become a professional nerd , either via a university degree or simply because you sit up all night writing Python to scratch your particular technical itch , you think you absolve yourself of having to stand up in front of a group of people make a presentation .
And you might be right .
Then there ’s a chance you ’re going to build or think something brilliant , and no mailing list , weblog , or wiki is going to be able to contain this brilliance .
Those who want to hear about your brilliance are going to insist that you stand in front of them and explain this bright thing that you did or thought .
Conflict .
Yes , you want to explain your brightness , but , um , the last time you stood in front of people and told a story was Ms. Randall ’s 11th grade English class , and you stumbled through an incoherent ramble about Henry David Thoreau and some pond .
Unlike that pond , you are immensely qualified to talk about your topic , but you ’re totally unqualified to present in front of a group of people .
It ’s not just that you have n’t had the practice , but that lack of practice has given you the erroneous impression that there ’s a good chance you might throw up if you have to stand up and tell a story in front of 500 people .
Not Throwing Up is a Two - Phase Process
This article is about presentations , not content .
Both are equally important , but I ’m not here to help you write your content , I ’m here to transform that content into a presentation that does n’t suck .
Let ’s say you ’ve written your 30 slides .
A rookie presentation move is to : a ) have too many slides , and b ) stuff your slides with clutter , like wordy bullet points .
Filling each slide with as much content as possible .
This is your feeble attempt to get out of actually presenting .
Your thought is , “ Fill the slides with information and read the slides ” .
This makes sense to you , since I know you ’re nervous , but my question is , “ Why are you nervous ? ”
“ I ’ve never presented in front of 500 people . ”
“ So , you ’re not confident you can do it ? ”
“ Right . ”
“ Ok , so let ’s focus on the confidence rather than creating more horrible slides . ”
Phase 1 : Practice endlessly .
Confidence is going to come not when you memorize your slides , but when you move the content from one side of your brain to the other .
Right now , your slides are sitting in the linear left side of your brain , the practical side .
This is a fine place for the slides to be while you ’re creating them , but before you get up on stage , you need to move them to the right side of your brain , the creative side .
You need to be able to feel your slides .
Your presentation is storytelling .
It ’s a performance .
It ’s you on stage telling me and 499 of my friends a story about why you ’re brilliant .
That ’s not a comforting thought since I know you ’re already nervous about standing in front of 500 people and bumbling through your slides .
And now you ’re saying it ’s a performance ?
My presentation regarding huge performance wins in garbage collection is NOT a performance .
Of course it is .
Why else would there be 500 people sitting here wanting to hear about it ?
I promise there ’s some art , some performance , in your presentation , and the best way to find it is to practice endlessly .
The best way to do that is to stand up , walk around your office , and give your presentation to no one .
Over and over again .
It takes some getting used to — pacing around your office or hotel room listening to your own voice — but that ’s exactly what your audience is going to hear .
You need to figure out how to listen to yourself tell a story while also critically listening to the story .
You ’re the presenter and the audience .
Yeah , it takes practice .
Start with those three slides there about that one specific topic :
Talk through it and listen to how it sounds .
Does it make sense ?
Does it flow ?
Are you reading the slide or are you telling a story ?
How does it transition into the next point ?
After you ’ve heard yourself verbally walk through a topic a few times , you start to hear what you ’re trying to say , and you make discoveries like , “ Uh , I ’m making no sense ” and “ This is supposed to be funny , but it ’s lame ” , or “ This topic does n’t have any relation to anything near it . ”
We ’re talking hours of practice here , but you ’ll slowly start to notice that you ’re not just memorizing the content , you ’re also memorizing the flow .
You ’ll start to notice where you ’re repeating yourself , you ’ll find key points in the strangest places , and you ’ll stop to reorder and rewrite slides … a lot .
Good .
Keep practicing .
When you can sit at your desk with your eyes closed and talk through any one of your slides , you ’re going to stop worrying about what you need to say and focus more on how you ’re going to say it .
This intimate knowledge of your content is going to give you confidence .
But you still might throw up .
Phase Two Throw - up Avoidance
A few years back , I gave a recruiting presentation at two different universities on the same day .
Same presentation , same general age group of students , morning versus evening .
The morning presentation was in front of a packed room .
Just after 10 am .
I was three cups of coffee into the day and so was everyone else .
Three slides in and I knew this was going to be an easy presentation .
Heads were nodding , laughs were coming from the least expected slides , and folks were actually taking me up on my offer : “ Stop me if you have a question ” .
Captivated . 40 minutes of slides .
20 minutes of intense , engaged questions and answers .
Mission accomplished .
5 hours later .
I ’m in another conference room 50 miles away in another university and everyone ’s coffee has worn off .
The room is half full and I ’m a little tired , but I ’ve done this presentation 30 times in my head , so when I start on slide # 1 , it ’s on .
I know this presentation , so why is everyone falling asleep on slide # 3 ?
There ’s no laughing and , by slide # 10 , someone gets up and walks out .
Ouch .
Hopefully , this is normally when you considering throwing up .
I say hopefully because there are a great many presenters who do n’t have a clue when the presentation is going badly .
This is certainly a rookie mistake , but I ’ve sat through a fair share of presentations by seasoned managers where they just flopped and did n’t have a clue .
You need to stop and listen to what your audience needs .
If your presentation is n’t going swimmingly , stop five minutes in and look around the room .
Is the audience looking at you ?
Or are they staring at their laptops ?
Has there been nodding ?
I know it ’s been 10 seconds now and you ’re still looking at the audience saying nothing — it ’s ok , they ’re just sitting there wondering if you ’re about to throw up .
You ’re building tension .
More importantly , you ’re figuring out the most important part of your presentation : which audience showed up ?
Here ’s the rub : you can write brilliant , compelling slides , you can practice your slides 40 times , but you can never predict who is going to show up , and your presentation must be tailored to those who show up .
Ok , now throw up .
Phase 2 : Improvise .
This is hard and this is where our senior managers , with hundreds of presentations under their belts , screw up .
First , they ’ve stopped fretting , which means their presentations lack any sort of energy .
Consequently , they do n’t listen to the audience , so when the audience asks for something , they do n’t give it .
This is why they sound like bad used car salesmen ; they ’re just reciting the sales pitch and they do n’t care what you think .
How do you need to improve ?
What is your audience going to ask for ?
They want one thing : they want to participate .
No , they do n’t want to get on stage and present your slides ; they want to be included in this presentation — in this performance .
I ’m not talking about waves of applause , I ’m talking about taking looking at a sea of people and knowing these people are listening to your every word .
It ’s a constructive silence directed squarely at you , and when you learn how to read it , it ’s a high .
So , what are you going to do ?
How are you going to adapt ?
Maybe this crowd wants you to wake them up ?
How about accentuating your points loudly ?
How about a bit more walking around the stage waving your hands furiously ?
Perhaps you ’re too amped and they want you to slow and pause between your words .
Give them time for your words to soak in .
When someone walked out of my university presentation , I immediately stopped .
I began reminiscing about my college years and the complex protocol I ’d worked out for when it was ok to walk out of a lecture .
This 5 - minute irrelevant segue did two things : first , it reminded my semi-lucid audience that I was one of them , and second , since my segue was timely ( person walking out ) and humorous ( maybe ) , we reconnected .
They woke up and I dove back into my slides with my new college buds who were now clear that I cared about what they thought .
Fret
No lying .
The ability to improvise takes experience and you ’re going to have to live through and recover from a couple of horrific presentations in order to build up your improv repertoire .
For these early disasters , I have three pieces of advice :
When you ’re presenting , talk like you ’re talking to one person who happens to have a thousand eyeballs .
Do n’t get lost in the sea of faces , pick a person and tell them the story .
Not for the entire hour , just a few seconds .
Then move on .
Use silence as punctuation .
My favorite trick in the book especially since I ’m a fast talker .
When you hear yourself gaining verbal momentum , stop .
Count backwards from 5 . Walk across the stage .
Resume .
These breaks are going to give both you and your audience a chance to mentally regroup .
They want you to succeed .
This piece of advice is in every presentation guide out there — because it ’s true .
Your audience is expecting you to rock their socks .
They ’re expecting an A +.
That ’s where you ’re starting in their heads and walking on stage knowing this helps .
I do n’t want you to throw up .
I want you to fret about this presentation , and if you ’re not losing a little sleep , you do n’t care .
You ’re not going to be motivated .
You ’re going to end up perpetuating the idea that nerds ca n’t tell a story .
If you ’ve been handed the responsibility of a presentation and are n’t the least bit concerned , give it to someone who is going to sweat this thing and then be prepared for that person to end up as your boss .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Defense demanding expedited information on how the US Army monitors soldiers ’ blogs , after the previous failure of the Department to comply with Freedom of Information requests lodged by the Foundation .
According to the EFF , a US Army unit called the Army Web Risk Assessment Cell ( AWRAC ) reviews hundreds blogs every month , notifying Army bloggers when it sees information it finds inappropriate .
EFF ’s suit demands records on how the AWRAC conducts its monitoring , as well as any orders to soldiers about revision or deletion of web posts .
It also demands expedited processing , as the information is urgently needed by the public .

The machine sits in the corner of the ward
Consultants at Wythenshawe Hospital found that using a vaporiser to spray essential oils into the atmosphere killed off micro-organisms .
Airborne bacterial counts dropped by 90 % and infections were reduced in a nine - month trial at the burns unit .
The recipe of oils used in the machine was refined by microbiologists at Manchester Metropolitan University .
Scent Technologies , the Wigan - based company which makes the machine , developed the device to mask smells on wards but found it had a beneficial effect on infections .
The study was started after the recipe of oils was modified by the university team , in conjunction with Wythenshawe consultant Ken Dunn .
It has to be in conjunction with everything else - it can't just be a machine on a ward
Bev Hurst , MRSA campaigner
" Many people will be aware that there are decades of experience with the use of essential oils to control infection , " said Mr Dunn .
" I think the novelty of this is putting the two researched technologies together and being able to affect a really surprisingly large area of the ward with a single machine . "
There were no MRSA infections in the burns unit while the machine was being used with the recipe of oils .
In the final two months the natural essence blend was removed from the machines and MRSA levels in the air increased - and there was an MRSA outbreak in the ward .
More tests
But despite the apparent success of the trial , MRSA campaigners have urged healthcare professionals to continue with strict cleaning regimes .
Bev Hurst , whose mother Margaret died from an MRSA infection , said : " If this is something that is going to help then that 's brilliant .
" But it has to be in conjunction with everything else - it ca n't just be a machine on a ward . "
The National Audit Office estimates hospital - acquired infections contribute to some 5,000 deaths annually .
Further tests are now being carried out .
The city ’s unexpected withdrawal from a public - private partnership for the troubled rail project means that the incoming mayor and the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation likely will have to seek yet another extension from federal officials to keep the project moving .
Do Like Me. Sit Down To Pee .
I have recently begun sitting down to pee .
I know what you 're thinking .
That I 'm a pussy .
Well , you 're wrong .
I 'm smart and resourceful and completely comfortable with my ( hetero ) sexuality .
Before I go into the amazing benefits of sitting while peeing , let me say that I do not sit down to pee in public restrooms , for personal hygeine reasons , and so I will not be murdered in the bathroom at a Celtics game .
Let 's also take a look at the overrated phenomenon of standing while peeing .
First of all , it 's a bunch of macho posturing .
You know , " Hey , check me out , I have a cock , and I 'm standing up and I 'm pissing . "
But then look beneath the urinal and tell me that it 's clean and dry .
It never is .
It 's fucking filthy .
Standing up and peeing works really well outdoors , and , as I mentioned above , in public .
But when it comes to the sanctity of your own home , you 'd be a fool not to sit .
Allow me to illustrate the benefits of sitting down to pee :
1. Rest : Say you awake at 3:47 am , and you have to pee .
You 're so sleepy you can hardly keep your eyes open .
Why stand and pee ?
Give me one good reason .
Sit down , close your eyes , rest .
You do n't have to lean against the wall to brace yourself .
You might even get in 20 - 30 seconds of shuteye .
2. Cleanliness : I do not care who you are , how long your penis is , or how great your aim is , more often than not , urine will end up in places other than the water .
It may hit the toilet seat or the rim ( especially at night ) , you may miss altogether ( that first spurt can be hard to gauge ) , and even a clean shot into the toilet can send tiny droplets of spatter onto the seat , the walls , or the leg of your significant other who is brushing his / her teeth at the sink next to you .
When you pour your coffee , do you hold the coffee pot three feet above your mug ?
I doubt it .
3. Ease : Some of us wear glasses .
If you 're like me , you can't even see two feet in front of you without them .
When I need to pee at night , I do n't even have to put my glasses on before going to the toilet .
I can find the seat .
I can sit my ass down on it and rest assured that I 'm not pissing on the floor .
I can rest my tired head in my hands at the same time , if I want .
4. Multi-tasking : How many of you standers can read a magazine , brush your teeth and pee at the same time .
That must look pretty funny , and I 'm sure that you 're making a mess .
Not me .
I sit down , I pee , and at the same time , I can brush my teeth and read a short article .
I can pee while blowing my nose , and the change in internal pressure is not an issue , as it would be if I did this while standing .
Try using both hands to blow your nose while you pee standing up .
With your hands occupied and unable to act as a guide , your penis may do some weird , totally independent stuff , and the stream may make a detour you may not be ready for .
Once you start peeing while sitting down , you can do whatever you want with that 20 - 30 seconds of your life .
Work a crossword puzzle , learn Russian , make a grocery list , write a poem , pet your cat .
Men , do n't be a victim of generations of macho bullshit gender stereotyping .
You can sit down to pee .
And if you do it in the privacy of your own home , nobody will laugh at you .
You may find that you 're more a more well - rested , more relaxed , and more well - rounded man , and you most certainly certainly will have fewer pee stains on your pant leg .
Pay a visit to the Biologic Institute and you are liable to get a chilly reception .
“ We only see people with appointments , ” states the man who finally responds to my persistent knocks .
Then he slams the door on me .
I am standing on the ground floor of an office building in Redmond , Washington , the Seattle suburb best known as home town to Microsoft .
What I ’m trying to find out is whether the 1 - year - old institute is the new face of another industry that has sprung up in the area – the one that has set out to try to prove evolution …
Back on the boat we managed to coerce the captain to drop anchor away from the other boats for the night so we could enjoy the peace and quiet a bit of solitude might provide from the obnoxious tourists aboard the other boats .
We did stop away from the rest of the boats , but not quite far enough away .
As everyone was standing on the roof of the boat contemplating whether or not to jump the whopping 20 or 25 feet , I got a running start from the other side of the boat and launched myself into the warm night air landing in even warmer water .
Besides feeling like I was swimming in pee , it was extremely salty , so I became incredibly buoyant .
I ’m a terrible back floater usually but in this bay I could lounge around for hours on end without so much as an arm underneath me to keep pushing myself up .
A few others followed in suit and finally jumped in , most of which were doing the stereotypical - one arm over their head , the other hand plugging their nose - dive , and a couple even screamed the whole way between roof and water .
We all jumped and swam around for a solid 20 minutes when a couple of the people we were trying to stay away from came swimming over and asked if they could jump off of our roof .
I assured them it would be fine , so they climbed up and jumped off , well , two of the three jumped off , the third one climbed down because she got scared .
They were around my age and had American accents , so when the guy jumped off he swam over and we started talking .
We rifled through the obligatory questions , “ where are you from ” being the key one here .
As it turns out , when we cycled through the country , state , county and city that we were born and raised in , we both grew up in Huntington Beach , CA and knew a couple of the same people .
I was absolutely blown away .
I know it ’s a “ small world ” , but holy shit .
I was swimming in a bay half way around the world and I run into probably the only other Huntington Beach native in the country at the time .
We spent a few minutes treading water , talking about our respective purposes in the country , mine , of course , was just to see it whereas he was working for the American embassy in Hanoi and he was living there for six months .
He offered to buy me a drink when I came back through Hanoi , which I was fully entertaining the idea of , and then I got out of the water to climb up and jump off again .
Growing up in Huntington Beach was interesting .
There are a great number of really cool people I grew up with who I still hang with on a regular basis ; my very best friend is from Huntington Beach , however , the cool ones are definitely the exception rather than the rule .
There is a very large concentration of “ bros ” in Huntington who have a bad reputation for being obnoxious , loud , pious , and tactless , driving raised white trucks with “ SRH ” stickers on them , wearing flat - billed baseball hats turned 45 degrees to one side with oversized dickies shorts , black socks pulled up and puffy skate shoes despite the fact that the vast majority of them ca n’t skateboard to save their lives .
I ’ve spent the better part of my youth doing everything in my power to not be a part of this uniquely grotesque subculture , and am perplexed every time I run into one of them by their demeanor , their lack of appreciation for things other than fake boobs and lifted trucks , and their rhetoric .
The Malay import had a very comprehensive appreciation for all things Western , including a lot of the slang and jokes used profusely in my hometown .
He , like myself , was not a fan of the aforementioned type of people , and jabbed countless jokes at me about being American , especially being Californian , albeit his admittance that I was by no means a stereotypical Orange County guy .
That said , The Malay and I are standing on the roof of the boat , getting ready to jump , when the three roof jumping mooches from across the way announce that they will be swimming back over to their boat now , so we say farewell , and as a parting act of idiocy , my fellow guy from OC sticks a fist up in the air and yells , “ Later man ! Represent H.B. bro ! ” , which he said with absolute conviction , like , he is n’t just from H.B , he is FROM H.B. and it literally summed him up in one statement for me and innately placed him in the demographic which I just described .
I was in shock for a second that he so quickly lost my respect , and I gave him a , “ Will do , bro ” from which he did n’t catch even five percent of my sarcasm .
As the three of them swam off , I hung my head with shame and my Malay buddy nudged me and mimicked the guy , “ Yeaaaaahh , H.B. bro ! ”
Again , he had a very in - depth understanding of the jokes and slang from my part of the world , so he caught on to how shitty the call was .
Having just spent the last few hours trying to convince this guy and the two Australian girls on board that all Californians are n’t like the kids in the show The OC , the one guy we run into in the middle of the ocean in Vietnam totally proves my point wrong .

fromdusktildawnさんの分裂勘違い君劇場「
Ruby の作者松本氏がありもしない錯誤をでっちあげて批判している件 」を読んだ 。
こうして議論が膨らんで、何が何でもRubyとか、何が何でもCLOSとか、そういう誤読を防止する仕組みができあがっていくことは喜ばしい。それ以上に、これを機会にRubyに関心を持つ人がでてきたり、JavaScriptを再発見したりする人がでてくるようなことがあったならば、喜ばしい。「騒げ騒げ、もっと騒げ」
のだけれども、取り合えず言うべきことは言っておこう。
getter / settterネタ
これは実はちょっと心外。 「実務上、メタプログラミングは便利だよ」と言いたくてその一例たるattr_accessorの説明の直後に
ですから，このようなメソッドを自分で作ることもできます
... 少しでも似たようなコードの反復があるならばメタプログラミングによって実装や保守の手間を軽減できます\ getter/setterのようにあまり変化する余地のないものであればまだよいですが，仕様に応じて変更の必要が出てきた場合，その変更をコードに漏れなく反映するのは大変です
と書いた私としてはgetter/setterという例がやはり良くなかったなーと。getter/setterに注目して、そこだけに注目する議論は、私の説明不足が原因とは言え嬉しくないなーと。
長すぎて削られてしまったRuby/AJPのクラス群自動生成の例を、やっぱり何が何でも紙面に出してもらうべきだったかなぁと。
getter/setterはC#ではわざわざブロパティ定義構文を作って楽にしてるわけだし、そもそもIDEがあればJavaでも全然問題ないというのはおっしゃる通り。なんだけれども、分裂勘違い君劇場「
Ruby の生産性の高さはどこまで本当か？ 」において
Rubyのシンプルなプロパティ定義として、以下のようなサンプルがあり、setterとgetterをわざわざ記述しなければならないJavaの冗長さと比較していますが
という風にメタプログラミングの文脈から切り離してわざわざこれをクローズアップするのは「Rubyの作者松本氏がありもしない錯誤をでっちあげて批判している件」で自身が指摘している引用トリックそのものだろうと。
まあ、3点断りを付けると、
これは分裂勘違い君劇場の次のネタかもしれなくて、そうだとしたら申し訳ない。突っ込みどころを残してあとで自分で突っ込んで読者の視点を多様化/深化させるのはあの人の芸風だから。
あちこちで同様のgetter/setterにフォーカスした読み方をしている人がいることから、そもそも「
なぜ仕事で使うとうれしいのか 」における私の説明が至らなかったのは確実だろう。
getter/setterをメタプログラミングの文脈から切り離すのがアンフェアだとしても、fromdusktildawnさんの「『メタプログラミングが強力だからRubyが生産性が高い』というのはどこまで本当か？」という指摘のほうは否定されたわけではない。
「 Rubyの生産性の高さはどこまで本当か？」は、私が期待していた突っ込みそのもので、しかもそれを分裂勘違い君劇場がやってくれたというのは嬉しい限りなんだけれども、getter/setterネタだけじゃなく「その他、細々とした部分」の節だけはどうにも不満がいっぱいで。
という記述も、だから私は脚注にそう書いてるじゃん。とか。これも引用のトリックだぁな。
Matzは特殊条件を外しているか
Matzにっきの記事 の引用部だけ見れ ば「 Rubyの作者松本氏がありもしない錯誤をでっちあげて批判している件」が指摘するように、「誤読を招く」「本来よりもあまりに強い主張をしているようによませる」アンフェアな引用だなぁ。引用トリックだなぁ。
でも、じゃあ、まつもとさんの言ってることは無効なのかというとわからない。
それは結 局「 Rubyの生産性の高さはどこまで本当か？」でfromdusktildawnさんが指摘する、(メタプログラミングによるエレガントな解決は)
というのが真かどうかに掛かるかなぁと。もしこれが偽だとすれば、まつもとさん言うfromdusktildawnさんが「(メタプログラミングを必要とする局面において)些細な文法の違いから来る記述力を無視しすぎ」と言う指摘は、「研究室レベルで」というコンテキストを外しても有効となる。
私の実感では偽なんだけど、客観的根拠を示せないからなんとも。
それから、たぶん、まつもとさんの発言はブロック構文にも掛かっている。何しろ私がブロック構文を最初に理解したときにまず思ったのが「何でlambdaじゃダメなの?」だし、fromdusktildawnさんの主張も分かる。匿名クラスでできるのは分かってる。delegateでできるのは分かってる。というか、lambdaかわいいよlambdaの一言に尽きる。
でも、使ってみて思ったのは、Rubyのブロック構文がメソッド呼び出しの括弧を省略可能というところと結び付いて「記述力」をもたらしてるということ。いつも似たような例で恐縮だけれどもRakeとか。Rakeを見るまで、私ゃRubyの記述力がそれほど優れていると思ってなかったし。それから、その種の記述力の差は大きいと思えばこそ、（どうも私が当初、良く吟味せずに舞い上がった程簡単な話ではない模様だけれども) 矢野勉さんの発想 は素晴らしいと思ったのだ。

Timothy Naftali , a University of Virginia historian who has looked through the newly released documents , said yesterday they showed that West German intelligence had told the CIA that Eichmann was living in Argentina under the pseudonym
Clemens two years before he was abducted by the Israelis - but the Americans did not want him captured because they feared what he might say that could compromise Hans Globke , who supported America 's anti-communist goals in Europe .
Globke served as national security adviser in the postwar Bonn government of Konrad Adenauer , but had worked in the Jewish affairs department of the Nazi regime , and helped write laws excluding Jews from Germany society .
" The CIA , which worked closely with Globke , assisted the West Germans in protecting him from Eichmann , " Mr Naftali said .
The alias the Germans provided may not have been exact .
When Eichmann was seized in May 1960 , he was living under the name Klement .
Israeli agents smuggled him to Israel , where he was tried and convicted for his role in the Holocaust .
He was hanged in 1962 .
The case is one of several examples of compromises and deals the CIA made with Nazis after the war in the interests of competing with the Soviet Union for influence in Europe .
Those post - war dealings with Nazis are the subject of 27,000 newly declassified documents , one of the biggest declassification projects in CIA history .

Deception remains one of the enduring hard problems of the community , and its ever varying forms are testament to the creativity of the human mind , and the capacity of the human soul to lie .
This item at Defense Tech caught our eye .
The concept of using holograms for tactical deception in the urban environment is an interesting one , and quite familiar to readers of science fiction ( and their movie - going counterparts ) .
The potential instantiation of such technology could be quite useful if executed properly .
A more comfortable sniper hide , if nothing else , could make our lives much nicer … .
Outside of the cutting edge and onto the more prosaic realities , we note the proliferation of deception tactics into the ordinary , for purposes of beautification .
We note the following item on urban architecture , and the spread of buildings more integrated into the surrounding landscapes .
These challenges present serious questions for future intelligence problems .
However , it is an excellent chance to begin integrating these types of problems from the very start into new analyst training programs , using such publicly available examples in the modern arena ; and something outside of the hoary old World War II examples so often re-used .
( As brilliant as they were for their day , such cases were highly situated examples which occurred in a technological and social context , and in a conflict environment , we are likely never to see again and thus of more limited utility to the instructor and student . )

Little over a week after this mostly white suburb became a symbol of callousness for using armed officers to seal one of the last escape routes from New Orleans -- trapping thousands of mostly black evacuees in the flooded city -- the Gretna City Council passed a resolution supporting the police chief ’s move .
“ This was n’t just one man ’s decision , ” Mayor Ronnie C. Harris said Thursday .
“ The whole community backs it . ”
Three days after Hurricane Katrina hit , Gretna officers blocked the Mississippi River bridge that connects their city to New Orleans , exacerbating the sometimes troubled relationship with their neighbor .
The blockade remained in place into the Labor Day weekend .
Gretna ( pop. 17,500 ) is a feisty blue - collar city , two - thirds white , that prides itself on how quickly its police respond to 911 calls ; it warily eyes its neighbor , a two - thirds black city ( pop. about 500,000 ) that is also a perennial contender for the murder capital of the U.S .
Advertisement
Itself deprived of power , water and food for days after Katrina struck Aug. 29 , Gretna suddenly became the destination for thousands of people fleeing New Orleans .
The smaller town bused more than 5,000 of the newcomers to an impromptu food distribution center miles away .
As New Orleans residents continued to spill into Gretna , tensions rose .
After someone set the local mall on fire Aug. 31 , Gretna Police Chief Arthur S. Lawson Jr. proposed the blockade .
“ I realized we could n’t continue , manpower - wise , fuel - wise , ” Lawson said Thursday .
Armed Gretna police , helped by local sheriff ’s deputies and bridge police , turned hundreds of men , women and children back to New Orleans .
Gretna is not the only community that views New Orleans with distrust .
Authorities in St. Bernard Parish , to the east , stacked cars to seal roads from the Crescent City .
But Gretna ’s decision has become the symbol of the ultimate act of a bad neighbor , gaining notoriety partly from an account in the Socialist Worker newspaper by two San Francisco emergency workers and labor leaders who were in a crowd turned back by Gretna police .

Numerous angry e-mails to Gretna officials accuse them of racism .
( Harris and Lawson are white . )
New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin said Thursday that Gretna officials “ will have to live ” with their decision .
“ We allowed people to cross ... because they were dying in the convention center , ” Nagin said .
“ We made a decision to protect people ....
They made a decision to protect property . ”
Paul Ribaul , 37 , a New Orleans TV - station engineer from Gretna , said New Orleans and the suburbs have a complicated relationship .
Advertisement
“ We say we ’re from New Orleans , but we ’re a suburb , ” he said .
“ The reason we do n’t live there is we do n’t like the crime , the politics . ”
Ribaul was among Gretna residents who praised the decision to close the bridge .
“ It makes you feel safe to live in a city like that , ” he said .
Critics suspect a racial motive for the blockade .
City officials heatedly deny any such thing .
Among black residents of Gretna , some say that although they get along with most of their white neighbors , a few of the neighbors harbor strong prejudices .
Advertisement
Some black Gretna residents also speak fearfully of New Orleans .
“ We do n’t have as much killing over here as in New Orleans , ” said Leslie Anne Williams , 42 .
Nonetheless , Williams ’ mother , a lifelong Gretna resident who is also black , disapproved of the Police Department ’s decision .
People fleeing New Orleans “ probably had a better chance of survival over here , ” said Laura Williams , 70 , “ especially with all that shooting ” across the river .
When Katrina hit , about 5,000 of Gretna ’s residents were still in town .
Police zigzagged the trim streets of ranch houses and older wooden buildings , checking on those who had not evacuated .
Like New Orleans , Gretna lost power and water .
Town officials pleaded unsuccessfully for help from the state and the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Then they learned that New Orleans officials had told the thousands trapped in that city ’s downtown , similarly deprived of food and water but also dodging gunfights and rising floodwaters , to cross to Gretna .
Advertisement
Not sure how to feed even their own residents , Gretna officials were overwhelmed by New Orleans ’ evacuees .
They organized bus caravans Aug. 31 to take the arrivals to Metairie , 16 miles away , where a food and water distribution center had been set up .
The evacuees waited for rides out of Gretna at the foot of the bridge , across the street from Oakwood Mall .
As the hours ticked by and the crowd swelled , trouble began , Gretna authorities said .
Sometime on Wednesday , Aug. 31 , a fire broke out in the mall , next to the local branch of the sheriff ’s office , and police chased suspected looters out of the building .
Mayor Harris had had enough .
He called the state police .
Advertisement
“ I said : ‘ There will be bloodshed on the west bank if this continues , ’ ” Harris recalled .
“ ‘ This is not Gretna .
I am not going to give up our community ! ’ ”
The following morning , Gretna ’s police chief made his decision : Seal the bridge .
The San Francisco paramedics said in an interview and in their article that there were gunshots over the heads of people crossing the bridge from New Orleans ’ convention center -- many of them elderly -- where they were stuck for days without food , water and working toilets .
Nagin , New Orleans ’ mayor , said that he ’d heard similar reports about gunfire , as well as people being turned back by guard dogs .
Advertisement
Chief Lawson said that he was unaware of any of his officers shooting over the heads of evacuees on the bridge but said that one black officer did fire a shot overhead to quiet an unruly crowd waiting to board a bus .
Harris said Thursday that closing the bridge was a tough decision but that he felt it was right .
“ We did n’t even have enough food here to feed our own residents , ” Harris said .
“ We took care of our folks .
It ’s something we had to do . ”

Times staff writer James Rainey contributed to this report .
A developer perspective :
Most project managers , program managers , product managers , development managers are not pointy haired bosses , most are trying to do a good job , but :
The factor that most controls the development is not the management , it is the developers , there is a massive range in the ability of developers , it is difficult for another programmer to gauge this difference and nearly impossible for a non-programmer .
Unhappy developers are unproductive , especially the good ones .
Nearly all developers are highly motivated to produce good software , a lot of management activity negatively affects this , so a light hand is good .
Almost all developers know more about the software and what they are doing with it than anyone else .
( this is the details of the stuff they are buried in every day ) .
The best thing that a software manager can do , is get the best developers he ( sometimes she ) can get hold of and remove as many obstacles as possible from them getting the job done .
There is nothing you can do to make it work , you have to help it work .
To many managers , getting rid of the arrogant , undisciplined , over - paid , technology - obsessed , improperly - dressed etc. programmers would appear to be a significant added benefit .
Bjarne Stroustrup The C++ Programming Language 3e , section 24.2.4
2 . You know less than the people you are managing .
Detailed software knowledge has a half - life of about 3 years , if you are a manager you out of date .
When someone is working all day everyday in the details of the product , when they run the software time and again during the day , when they are thinking in real detail about how it works day in day out , they know the software .
Management simply cannot apply this level of attention to every part of the product .
Software development has chaos theory as its in - laws , you often need to know the details to make the right decision .
3 . You are not in control .
Management and developers are motivated by different things , some managers do not understand this .
Software developers are motivated more by problem solving , intellectual challenge , technical development , being proud of their work than they are directly by money or promotion ( Nine Things Developers Want More Than Money ) .
Many developers are positively averse to office politics .
Think maslow ’s hierarchy of needs .
Think self - actualization .
4 . You do n’t get to do the fun stuff .
Every single , ex- developer I have ever spoken to misses development .
Every single one .
You may be better , you may be interested , you may want to keep your hand in , but you are not available , you need to focus on being a good manager .
It is regrettable , but you need to live with it .
Some mangers eventually go back to development , most do not .
True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done , the zest of creating things new .
Antoine de Saint - Exupery
5 . You are not in control .
You cannot really tell what developers are actually doing , if you say do it this way and they agree , how do you know what they actually do .
If you work “ with ” the developers , then they will work “ with ” you .
6 . Saying something is so , does not make it so .
For a lot of management you can say something is so , and proceed with the assumption that it is , even when it is n’t it is unlikely to be provable , so it can simply be asserted .
It is not so in software , if the estimate for development is nine months then it is nine months .
If a customer absolutely positively must have it in six months , then it wo n’t happen , you either have to remove a lot of functionality ( perhaps half , things being non-linear ) or convince the client it will take nine months .
The most likely outcome from this clash of timetables is that the developers ( and prior to that the manager ) will cave in , accept the new date , rush the development which will end up taking nine months anyway ( if your lucky ) and be in a worse condition because its been rushed .
7 . You are not in control .
Developers are analytical & critical thinkers , they are far more concerned with actually correct than politically correct .
They are going to argue and discuss things and sometimes disagree with you and each other .
The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it .
Flannery O’Connor
8 . You can not estimate how long things will take .
Estimation should be performed by the people who are going to implement the functionality .
However most estimates are produced by management or marketing and typically adjusted by politics , rather than prudence .
This is just lying to yourselves , do n’t do it .
Estimates are frequently determined before requirements , they are aspirations or at best guidelines .
Estimates have to be based on requirements ( and may require significant investigation , such as functional specifications , use cases , prototypes etc ) , in any case it is likely that either requirements will have to slip or the overall schedule will .
You can either explain this to the customer at the beginning of a project or the end , its up to you .

We know software management is hard , because there are so few good software managers .
In my time I have worked with the many and varied of the software world and this is how it measures :
Developers :
36 % Good
32 % Average
32 % Poor
Software Managers :
13 % Good
23 % Average
64 % Poor
In the case of the software managers , that 13 % good figure translates to three people out of nearly 15 years of experience .
My three good managers have been :
Mike Bates ( BJSS )
Boyd Moffat ( Three - X Communications )
Don Kavanagh ( Morse )
I know software management is hard , because there are so few that are good at it .
If you think your management does n’t know what it ’s doing or that your organisation turns out low - quality software crap that embarrasses you , then leave .

Die Anordnung erinnert eher an ein Haus als an ein Windrad : zwei halbzylinderförmige Rotorblätter , die von drei festen sternförmig angeordneten Blechen umstellt werden .
Sie fangen den
Wind ein und erzeugen durch ihre tragflächenähnliche Form einen Unterdruck hinter den Rotoren , was den Umlauf beschleunige .
Ein „ technologischer Durchbruch “ , wie Erfinder Ron Taylor kurzerhand erklärt .
Mit seinen seltsam anmutenden Windkrafträdern plant Taylor , Chef der US - Firma TMA , den Generalangriff auf konventionelle Windkraftwerke .
„ Die Stromgestehungskosten unserer Turbine liegen bei 2,5 bis 3,5 Dollar - Cent pro Kilowattstunde “ , behauptet Taylor .
Zum Vergleich : Selbst an guten Standorten liegen die Stromkosten großer herkömmlicher Windräder bei wenigstens vier Cent .
Windräder bis zu 67 Meter hoch und mit einem Megawatt Leistung will TMA einmal bauen .
Theoretisch ginge es auch noch größer , meinen die Amerikaner : Der Anlagentyp sei leicht skalierbar .
Ende Mai sollen die ersten Fertigungsprototypen mit 25 Kilowatt ( kW ) Nennleistung in Betrieb gehen .
Männer wie Taylor wirbeln derzeit die Windkraftbranche durcheinander .
Den Jungunternehmern ist gemein , dass sie auf ein neues Designprinzip setzen : Ihre Rotoren drehen sich um eine vertikale Achse im Wind .
Die Newcomer preisen ihre Anlagen vor allem mit drei Argumenten : Die Vertikalachsenläufer seien billiger zu produzieren und sie liefen auch dann noch , wenn normale Windräder wegen zu starken Windes abgeschaltet werden müssten .
Vor allem aber ließen sich die Maschinen fast beliebig vergrößern , wogegen die herkömmlichen Windräder langsam an ihre Grenzen stießen .
Doch der forsche Auftritt der jungen Wilden sorgt in der Windkraftszene nicht nur für Begeisterung .
Der renommierte Stuttgarter Windkraftexperte Heiner Dörner etwa bezweifelt die Wirtschaftlichkeit solcher Projekte , nennt die TMA - Anlage gar eine " Totgeburt " .
Derartige Kritik ficht Bend Scheffer nicht an .
Der Vertriebsleiter der Energy - Age - Wind aus dem münsterländischen Telgte ist von seinem Vertikalachsenläufer überzeugt .
Sein Unternehmen verwendet ebenfalls tragflächenförmige Bleche , die allerdings den Rotor bis auf Ein- und Auslassöffnung völlig ummanteln .
Dadurch strömt die Luft am Rotor dreieinhalb Mal schneller als der umlaufende Wind .
Bis November will Scheffer der Öffentlichkeit einen 150 - kW - Protoyp präsentieren .
Weil die Vertikalläufer früher anlaufen und auch mit starken Winden besser klarkommen , können sie längere Zeit Strom produzieren als herkömmliche Windräder .
Scheffer zufolge genügt eine Anlage , die nur ein Drittel so hoch sei , mit einem ein Drittel so großen Generator , um dieselbe Strommenge im Jahr zu produzieren .
„ Wir waren im Windkanal : Unsere Anlagen sind besser “ , sagt der Vertriebsdirektor .
Wer mehrere 300 - kW - Elemente auf einem
Mast oder einem Dach kombiniere , könne problemlos in den Megawatt - Bereich vorstoßen .
In diesen Dimensionen denkt Steven Peace , Geschäftsführer der britischen Eurowind Developments .
Er will gewaltige Zehn - Megawatt - Anlagen für die Offshore - Windnutzung auf See entwickeln .
Dazu hat er ein großes Konsortium um sich geschart , zu dem die Schiffsbauer VT Group und die Queen Mary ’s University of London gehören .
Zwar glaubt Peace nicht daran , eine energieeffizientere Anlage konstruieren zu können als Weltmarktführer wie Vestas oder Enercon .
Aber eine deutlich preiswertere .
Das Eurowind - Design kommt ohne Hülle aus .
Es beruht auf dem so genannten „ H - Rotor “ : Ein Mast mit einer aufgesetzten H - förmigen Konstruktion , deren Seiten die Rotorblätter darstellen .
Peace ergänzte einen dritten Rotor , weil bei den zweiblättrigen die Drehgeschwindigkeit zu sehr schwankt – während eines Umlaufs drehen nämlich immer wieder beide Rotoren gleichzeitig aus dem Wind .
All diese Vertikalläufer sind noch Prototypen – ganz im Gegensatz zu den mehr als 17 500 Propellern in Deutschland , die sich um die vertraute Horizontalachse drehen .
Die Turbinen sind inzwischen in der Fünf - bis Sechs - Megawatt - Klasse angekommen .
Die Rotoren der REpower „ 5 M “ etwa sind 62 Meter lang und wiegen 18 Tonnen .
Allein die Wirkung der Erdanziehung setzt die Flügel unter hohen Stress : Die Lasten wechseln extrem , je nachdem , ob ein Rotor oben steht oder unten hängt .
Weil die Drehgeschwindkeit zum Ende der Flügel immer größer wird , brauchen sie eine ausgefeilte Struktur .
Die Flügel müssen an einem Stück gefertigt , transportiert und angebracht werden .
Ein erheblicher Kostenfaktor .
Bei vertikalen Achsen dagegen lastet die Gravitation stets gleichförmig auf den Rotoren .
Eurowind könne seine Rotoren „ maschinell in Zehn - Meter - Abschnitten aus normaler Glasfaser herstellen “ , erklärt Peace .
Die müssten erst vor Ort zusammengefügt werden .
„ Wenn man doppelt so große Windräder bauen kann , die weniger kosten pro produzierter Kilowattstunde , spielt die Windausbeute keine so große Rolle mehr . “
Die Windenergiegemeinde reagiert äußerst skeptisch auf die Ankündigungen – nicht weil die vertikale Achse so neu wäre , sondern weil sich schon so viele daran versucht haben .
In den 80er Jahren experimentierte der Flugzeugbauer Dornier mit einem dreiflügeligen Darrieus - Rotor .
In Kanada testete der Energieversorger Hydro Quebec in Cap Chat einen zweiblättrigen Schneebesen namens Éole mit vier Megawatt Leistung , der von 1988 bis 1993 Strom ins Netz speiste .
Doch die Unternehmen hatten Probleme mit der Materialermüdung in den flexiblen Rotoren .
Und die Firma Heidelberg tüftelte zuletzt am H - Design .
Fünf „ Megawatt - Heidelberg - Rotoren “ wurden 1994 auf dem Kaiser - Wilhelm - Koog an der Nordsee aufgestellt .
Sie liefen bis 1997 – dann wurden sie wieder abmontiert , um ihre Fundamente für die üblichen Propeller zu räumen .
Ursprünglich hatten die Ingenieure die vertikale Achse sogar favorisiert , weil sie – im Gegensatz zu den Propellern – nicht ständig der Windrichtung nachgeführt werden muss .
Doch die vertikale Anordnung ist deutlich ineffizienter , weil ja immer mindestens ein Rotor gegen den Wind anläuft .
Besonders schlecht ist der Savonius - Rotor mit einer theoretischen Windausbeute von 23 Prozent .
Ein ideales Windrad kann dagegen 59 Prozent der Windenergie aufnehmen .
TMA behauptet nun , seine weiterentwickelte Savonius - Anlage erreiche im Windkanal eine Effizienz von 45 Prozent .
Wie ist das möglich ?
Für Nicolai Cosack , wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter am Stiftungslehrstuhl Windenergie der Universität Stuttgart , hat das einen einfachen Grund : Die einrahmende Konstruktion fängt zusätzlichen Wind ein und lenkt ihn auf die Rotoren .
Das erhöht rechnerisch die Ausbeute , weil sich dieser
Wert auf den Rotorquerschnitt bezieht .
Anlagen mit dem herkömmlichen Propellerdesign ernten freilich bis zu 50 Prozent der Windenergie – ganz ohne solche Tricks .
„ Die Horizontalläufer haben so große Vorteile , dass wir nicht glauben , dass sich der Trend umdreht “ , urteilt Cosack .
Windkraftingenieur Rainer Klosse vom Deutschen Windenergie - Institut ( DEWI ) nennt die TMA - Effizienzangaben in einer ersten Reaktion gar „ Bauernfängerei “ .
Für den höheren Wirkungsgrad müsse man schließlich „ viel zu viel Material “ in die Rahmenkonstruktion „ verbraten “ .
Der DEWI - Experte glaubt denn auch nicht an eine Zukunft solcher Anlagen .
„ Dass sich das rechnet , können Sie gleich vergessen . “
Das spricht nicht gerade für die hochtrabenden Pläne der forschen Jungunternehmer .
Wahrscheinlicher ist da schon , dass die Vertikalläufer bislang ungenutzte Nischen erobern .
Etwa die Dächer von Hochhäusern .
Mit den dort recht turbulenten Windströmungen kommt das Vertikaldesign nämlich besser klar als die Propeller .
„ Wir brauchen nicht auf die grüne Wiese “ , sagt denn auch Energy - Age - Wind - Vertriebsleiter Scheffer .
„ Dieser Standortvorteil ist enorm . “ ( nbo )

Lieutenant Colonel Paul Yingling said US generals had failed to prepare their troops properly and had misled Congress about the resources needed for the war .
Writing in the Armed Forces Journal , he said the US had repeated the mistakes of Vietnam and so faced defeat in Iraq .
Such criticism from a serving officer is rare , analysts say , although several retired generals have spoken out .
Lt Col Yingling 's remarks come a day after the top US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , described the situation in Iraq as " exceedingly complex and very tough " .
Acknowledging that the US effort " clearly is going to require an enormous commitment over time " , he asked Congress to give the new " surge " strategy , of pouring more troops into Baghdad , time to take effect .
Congress , meanwhile , passed a war funding bill setting a timetable for the withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq , despite the threat of a veto by President George W Bush .
' Diminishing hope '
Lt Col Yingling , who is deputy commander of the 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment and has served two tours in Iraq , said the military leadership had entirely failed to grasp what would be needed for success in Iraq .
The intellectual and moral failures common to America 's general officer corps in Vietnam and Iraq constitute a crisis in American generalship
Lt Col Paul Yingling
" For reasons that are not yet clear , America 's general officer corps underestimated the strength of the enemy , overestimated the capabilities of Iraq 's government and security forces , and failed to provide Congress with an accurate assessment of the security conditions in Iraq , " he wrote .
The generals had gone into Iraq in 2003 with too few soldiers and no coherent plan for post - war stabilisation , having spent a decade " preparing to fight the wrong war " , he said .
" The intellectual and moral failures common to America 's general officer corps in Vietnam and Iraq constitute a crisis in American generalship . "
Lt Col Yingling has not singled out any individual for criticism but has urged Congress to take a greater role in monitoring officers ' performance and holding them accountable .
He said the US military had done too little to prepare for the kind of intense insurgencies they had encountered in Iraq and Afghanistan , and had then tackled them in the wrong way .
" Given the lack of troop strength , not even the most brilliant general could have devised the ways necessary to stabilise post - Saddam Iraq , " he wrote .
" In 2007 , Iraq 's grave and deteriorating condition offers diminishing hope for an American victory and portends risk of an even wider and more destructive regional war . "
US military spokesman Lt Col Christopher Garver in Iraq told the Associated Press news agency that Lt Col Yingling had written expressing " his personal opinions " .
" We of Multinational Force Iraq are focused on executing the mission at hand , " he said .
On 3 October last year , the distinguished British - born historian Tony Judt was preparing for a public lecture when the telephone rang .
He was due to give the talk , entitled ' The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy ' , at the Polish consulate in New York in less than an hour .
The caterers were already there .
But when he picked up the phone he was informed that his lecture had been suddenly cancelled .
He was also told that Abraham Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) was on the phone to the Polish consul .
Whether the call from the ADL was the cause of the cancellation would become the subject of heated debate in the days and months to come .
Foxman labelled such accusations ' conspiratorial nonsense ' ; however , the Polish consul , Krzysztof Kasprzyk , later acknowledged that he had been contacted by a number of Jewish groups - including the ADL and the American Jewish Committee ( AJC ) - who were concerned about Judt 's anti-Israel message .
' The phone calls were very elegant but may be interpreted as exercising a delicate pressure , ' Kasprzyk said .
It did n't take him long to see how it might look for Poland , given its history , to be fostering arguments that in certain spheres of American intellectual life have been conflated with anti-Semitism .
' They do what the more tactful members of the intelligence services used to do in late Communist society , ' Tony Judt says of the ADL when I speak to him from his home in New York .
' They point out how foolish it is to associate with the wrong people .
So they call up the Poles and they say : Did you know that Judt is a notorious critic of Israel , and therefore shading into or giving comfort to anti-Semites ? '
In the New York Jewish press , the episode was dubbed - with a debatable degree of sarcasm - ' l ' Affaire Judt ' .
Certainly , not everyone felt Judt was a latter - day Dreyfus .
The New York Review of Books published an open letter to Abraham Foxman in Judt 's defence , which was signed by 114 intellectuals , many of whom disagreed with Judt on the Middle East yet felt that his right to free speech had been indefensibly curbed .
But Christopher
Hitchens , reminiscing about an occasion when a talk of his own was cancelled for similar reasons , cried out : ' What a chance I missed to call attention to myself ! ' - not the sort of opportunity Hitchens is in the habit of passing up - ' Once again , absolutely conventional attacks on Israeli and US policy are presented as heroically original .'
In the past two weeks , the Judt Affair has entered an entirely new gear .
In an essay written by the Holocaust scholar Alvin Rosenfeld and published by the American Jewish Committee , Judt 's views - and those of other ' progressive Jews ' such as the American playwright Tony Kushner and the British academic Jacqueline Rose - were expressly linked to anti-Semitism .
That row was reported in the New York Times , giving it an unprecedented prominence , and since then the story has opened the floodgates of a debate that until now has been shrouded in fear .
Americans have long been in the grip of a cultural taboo that is characterised by Judt as follows : ' All Jews are silenced by the requirement to be supportive of Israel , and all non-Jews are silenced by the fear of being thought anti-Semitic , and there is no conversation on the subject . '
Philip Weiss , a bold polemicist whose New York Observer blog , MondoWeiss , has been besieged by posts on the subject since he addressed it last week , has even gone so far as to declare a new movement .
His account of it embraces the new forum for dissent , Independent Jewish Voices , which was launched in Britain last week by an eminent group that includes Eric Hobsbawm and Harold Pinter .
In launching its manifesto , Independent Jewish Voices has taken the 40th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an occasion to create ' a climate and a space in which Jews of different affiliations and persuasions can express their opinions about the actions of the Israeli government without being accused of disloyalty or being dismissed as self - hating . '
One of its founding principles is : ' The battle against anti-Semitism is vital and is undermined whenever opposition to Israeli government policies is automatically branded as anti-Semitic .'
' A lot of people , like Tony Judt , have been doing brave work here in the US for a while , ' Weiss tells me .
' What has happened specifically is that for once , the mainstream is paying attention . '
He dates the beginning of this back to last March , when an explosive article about the influence of the Israel lobby on American foreign policy , written by two American political scientists , Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer , was published in the London Review of Books ( having originally been turned down by the Atlantic Monthly ) .
The response to the piece was so overwhelming - and so coloured by accusations of anti-Semitism - that the LRB decided to host a debate on the subject in New York last September .
That debate was sold out ;
Tony Judt , one of the speakers , gave an exceptionally eloquent performance , in the course of which he said it was significant that the event had been hosted by a London publication .
Public conversation on the issue had been so absent in America , he suggested , that it could only be opened up by importation .
' When Walt and Mearsheimer were published in London , ' Philip Weiss continues , ' I said : something 's changing . '
Since then , the publication of former president Jimmy Carter 's book , Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , and the attention given to Rosenfeld 's accusations in his AJC article , have proved , in Weiss 's view , that ' there 's no question that something has changed .
One of the excitements of what 's going on right now is that people who have had feelings about this and have not expressed them are popping up all over .
It 's personally very stirring to me that this is happening .
I can't believe it .'
In fact , the debate is so current that the online magazine Slate has come up with a quiz entitled ' Are You A Liberal Anti-Semite ? '
( Sample question : ' Which state 's offences against humanity bother you most ? a) Sudan b) Israel c ) Massachusetts '.)
One of the prizes is dinner with Tony Judt .
Tony Judt is , in the words of a fellow historian , ' one of our most dazzling public intellectuals ' .
As a prominent professor at New York University and a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books , the New York Times and The Nation , he has a strong and widely heard voice .
His latest book , Postwar - a magnificent , opinionated and vast history of Europe since 1945 - was voted one of the 10 best books of last year by the New York Times .
A talented forger of links between thinkers from countries all over the world , Judt worked tirelessly after 1989 to bring together eastern European and American intellectuals , and he solidified these efforts by founding the Remarque Institute at NYU in 1995 to promote the study and discussion of Europe in America .
A natural polemicist , he brought with him to New York an Oxbridge tradition more pugnacious than is generally characteristic of American academic life , and found himself - after years spent concentrating on European history - drawn back into an engagement with the Middle East .
In 2003 , Judt wrote an articulately provocative piece for the New York Review of Books entitled ' Israel : The Alternative ' , in which he argued , among other things , that Israel was ' an anachronism ' that was ' bad for the Jews ' and should be converted into a binational state .
The offices of the New York Review were inundated with letters as a result .
Last year , Judt wrote an op - ed piece for the New York Times in which he argued that America 's fear of anti-Semitism when discussing Israel wrought tremendous damage .
As the page was about to go to press , the editor rang him up .
' Just one thing , ' he said , ' You are Jewish , are n't you ? '
Judt was born in London in 1948 .
Growing up Jewish in 1950s Britain , as he has said , he came to know a thing or two about anti-Semitism .
His mother was from London and his father , who was born in Belgium , had come there as a stateless person .
Judt was brought up in what he describes as ' a fairly standard left - wing Jewish secular political environment ' , but with close links to his Yiddish - speaking grandparents , all of whom were eastern European Jews , from Romania and Russia and Lithuania and Poland .
As a teenager , he joined a left - wing Zionist organisation and became very active in the kibbutz movement , living in Israel on and off for a large part of the early 1960s .
' What changed for me , ' he says now , ' was that in 1967 I went out as a volunteer at the time of the Six Day War ; after the war was finished I volunteered for auxiliary military service and I ended up as a sort of informal translator for other volunteers up on the Golan Heights .
And there for the first time I began to see another face of Israel that had been camouflaged from me by my enthusiasm for the idealism of the kibbutz movement . '
He became , he recalls , quickly very detached from Israel .
' And in fact when I was a student in Paris I became involved in 1970 with Palestinians and young Israelis , trying to organise groups to talk about peace settlements and ending the conflict . '
Last week , as he looked over the list of signatories of the new British network , Independent Jewish Voices , Judt says he was struck by how many of them are people who have not in the past identified themselves publicly as Jewish .
' Of course they 're Jewish , ' he clarifies , ' but it was not part of their public identity tag .
And now they feel - and I would share this sentiment - a need to say , look : if it helps you understand just how bad things have got in the Middle East , I am willing to act not as a freestanding historian but as a Jew .
I do n't normally like to act as though being Jewish was who I am , but it 's a kind of inverse moral blackmail that forces you to go the other way . '
Speaking from Bloomington , Indiana , where he is a director of Indiana University 's Jewish Studies Program , Alvin Rosenfeld tells me that his essay ' does seem to have struck a raw nerve ' .
' I 've been accused of wanting to shut down debate and stifle free speech , ' he says , ' and none of that is true .
I stand strongly for vigorous debate and open discussion .
What in the past was said behind the hands and on the margins of society has been coming into the mainstream of discourse , ' Rosenfeld adds , echoing the sentiments of those he attacks , ' Now one can deal with it .
And that 's one of the things I set out to do . '
Though Rosenfeld is careful not to say in his essay that anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are identical , he does state that ' Anti-Zionism is the form that much of today 's anti-Semitism takes , so much so that some now see earlier attempts to rid the world of Jews finding a parallel in present - day desires to get rid of the Jewish state . '
He labels the work of Judt , Rose , Kushner et al ' This Jewish war against the Jewish state . '
I ask him if he would say that an increase in anti-Zionist sentiment might be caused by Israeli policy .
' I doubt it , ' he replies .
' As I read these people , it strikes to the heart , not of particular policies , but the idea of a sovereign Jewish state in the Middle East .
I think it goes to the question of Israel 's origins and essence . '
' Oh that 's nuts , ' Judt counters , ' I 've never said Israel does n't have a right to exist .
I 'm not actually sure that anyone in what we would call the respectable political mainstream ever has . '
' He says that , ' says Rosenfeld , ' but it 's not true .
In his writings he calls not for a two - state solution but for the dissolution of the state of Israel and a one - state solution , and everyone knows that in no time at all , were such a scenario to come about , Jews would be a minority within this newly configured state , and would be at the mercy of a population that 's not likely to treat them gently .
Tony Judt is a kind of political fantasist , it strikes me . '
' The issue is not whether Israel has a right to exist , ' Judt says plainly , ' Israel does exist .
It exists just like Belgium or Kuwait or any other country which was invented at some point in the past and is now a fact .
The question is what kind of a state Israel should be .
That 's all .'
Anti-Zionism has , like Zionism itself , a long and complicated history .
' The thing that we tend to forget , ' Judt explains , 'is that until the Second World War , Zionism was a minority taste even within Jewish political organisations .
The main body of European Jews was either apolitical or integrated , and voting within the existing countries they lived in .
So to be anti-Zionist , at least until the late 1930s , was to be lined up with most Jews .
It would make no sense to think of it as anti-Semitic .
' After the Second World War , for a fairly brief period - from let 's say 1945 to about 1953 - the overwhelming majority of Jews who were politically thinking were Zionists , either actively or sympathetically , for the rather obvious reason that Israel was the only hope for Jewish survivors .
But then many of them , like Hannah Arendt or Arthur Koestler , both of whom were Zionists at various points , took their distance , on the grounds that it was already clear to them that Israel was going to become the kind of state that as a cosmopolitan Jew they could n't identify with .
' Ever since then , there has been an unbroken tradition of non-Israeli Jews who regard Israel as either unrelated to their own identity or something of which they sometimes approve , sometimes disapprove , sometimes totally dislike .
This range of opinion is not new , ' Judt concludes .
' The only thing that 's new - and it's a product of the post - Sixties - is the insistence that it 's anti-Semitic . '
Judt tells a story about an Israeli journalist who was in Washington in the 1960s .
' The Israeli ambassador was retiring , and the journalist asked him what he thought was his biggest achievement .
The ambassador said : " I 've succeeded in beginning to convince Americans that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism . "
There has been a progressive emergence of a conflation , ' Judt explains .
' It did n't just happen naturally .
And it was pushed quite actively in the Seventies and Eighties , to the point at which it became so normal in this country that it was for a while the default assumption .
It 's really only in the last five to eight years that it 's started to be questioned . '
The actions of very pro-Israel Jewish organisations - for instance , making carefully placed phone calls relating to certain public speakers - are , Judt believes , now born of panic rather than confidence .
' They 've lost control of the debate , ' he says .
' For a long time all they had to deal with were people like Norman Finkelstein or Noam Chomsky , who they could dismiss as loonies of the left .
Now they 're having to face , for want of a better cliché , the mainstream : people like me who have a fairly long established record of being Social Democrats ( in the European sense ) and certainly not on the crazy left on most issues , saying very critical things about Israel .
They 're not used to that , so their initial response has been to silence people if they could , and their second response has been to ratchet up the anti-Semitic charge . '
Judt thinks it 's telling that the New York Times 'is willing to report these issues and let reporters quote both sides .
In the past , you would have had silence . '
Whether this will have any effect in Washington is another matter .
The political influence of AIPAC ( the pro-Israel lobby , American Israel Public Affairs Committee ) is as strong as it ever was , and Judt argues that since it's not worth going out on a limb on Israel from Congressmen 's point of view , change has to happen at a presidential level .
Hillary , he says , 'is pretty gutless on this ' ; she has already given two gung - ho speeches to AIPAC .
It 's not a topic Barack Obama has yet picked up on , Judt adds , but Obama was brave enough to oppose the Iraq war from the outset , so it 's possible that he would take a courageous stance elsewhere in the Middle East .
' A presidential candidate has to feel that once he or she gets into office - they would n't dare open their mouths while they 're running for election - they do n't stand to lose very much in public opinion if they put pressure on Israel , ' Judt says
In Postwar , Judt writes of Europe that ' After 1989 , nothing - not the future , not the present and above all not the past - would ever be the same . '
Is there a moment like that , I ask him , in this situation ?
' I think so , ' he replies .
' It 's not as tidy a moment as 1989 in Europe .
But I think one could say that after the Iraq war , for want of a better defining moment , the American silence on the complexities and disasters of the Middle East was broken .
The shell broke and conversation - however uncomfortable , however much slandered - became possible .
I 'm not sure that will change things in the Middle East , but it 's changed the shape of things here .
Even five years ago , I do n't think it would have looked the way it does now . '
He sounds almost optimistic .
' Well , ' he sighs , ' I do my best . '
By the middle of December , expect to spot a new type of robo - cop at the AquaCity shopping mall in the Odaiba neighborhood of Tokyo .
That 's what Sohgo Security Services told a crowd on Monday when it debuted the Reborg - Q , its new security bot , which has four video cameras and will alert its human masters when it detects the the presence of unauthorized persons , water leaks , or fire .
But do n't think that this is just a cold stack of metal , as the Reborg - Q has a chest - mounted touch - screen that can display information about missing children , the time , and weather , just like a real police officer or security guard .
Each bot will cost its human security outfit ¥ 380,000 ( $ 3,200 ) , and Sohgo 's already contracted to deploy 10 robots around Japan next year .
Although it 's programmed to protect and serve , we 're pretty sure that when partnered with the webslinging cop iRobot and the Intelligent Surveillance and Guard Robot , that fearsome fivesome might possibly assemble Voltron , or at very least become the Justice League of bot servants .

FOR most of the Earth 's history , the planet has been either very cold , by our standards , or very hot .
Fifty million years ago there was no ice on the poles and crocodiles lived in Wyoming .
Eighteen thousand years ago there was ice two miles thick in Scotland and , because of the size of the ice sheets , the sea level was 130 m lower .
Ice - core studies show that in some places dramatic changes happened remarkably swiftly : temperatures rose by as much as 20 °C in a decade .
Then , 10,000 years ago , the wild fluctuations stopped , and the climate settled down to the balmy , stable state that the world has enjoyed since then .
At about that time , perhaps coincidentally , perhaps not , mankind started to progress .
Man -made greenhouse gases now threaten this stability .
Climate change is complicated and uncertain , but , as our survey this week explains , the underlying calculation is fairly straightforward .
The global average temperature is expected to increase by between 1.4 °C and 5.8 °C this century .
The bottom end of the range would make life a little more comfortable for northern areas and a little less pleasant for southern ones .
Anything much higher than that could lead to catastrophic rises in sea levels , increases in extreme weather events such as hurricanes , flooding and drought , falling agricultural production and , perhaps , famine and mass population movement .
Nobody knows which is likelier , for the climate is a system of almost infinite complexity .
Predicting how much hotter a particular level of carbon dioxide will make the world is impossible .
It 's not just that the precise effect of greenhouse gases on temperature is unclear .
It 's also that warming has countless indirect effects .
It may set off mechanisms that tend to cool things down ( clouds which block out sunlight , for instance ) or ones that heat the world further ( by melting soils in which greenhouse gases are frozen , for instance ) .
The system could right itself or spin out of human control .
This uncertainty is central to the difficulty of tackling the problem .
Since the costs of climate change are unknown , the benefits of trying to do anything to prevent it are , by definition , unclear .
What 's more , if they accrue at all , they will do so at some point in the future .
So is it really worth using public resources now to avert an uncertain , distant risk , especially when the cash could be spent instead on goods and services that would have a measurable near - term benefit ?
If the risk is big enough , yes .
Governments do it all the time .
They spend a small slice of tax revenue on keeping standing armies not because they think their countries are in imminent danger of invasion but because , if it happened , the consequences would be catastrophic .
Individuals do so too .
They spend a little of their incomes on household insurance not because they think their homes are likely to be torched next week but because , if it happened , the results would be disastrous .
Similarly , a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the risk of a climatic catastrophe is high enough for the world to spend a small proportion of its income trying to prevent one from happening .
And the slice of global output that would have to be spent to control emissions is probably not huge .
The cost differential between fossil - fuel - generated energy and some alternatives is already small , and is likely to come down .
Economists trying to guess the ultimate cost of limiting carbon dioxide concentrations to 550 parts per million or below ( the current level is 380 ppm , 450 ppm is reckoned to be ambitious and 550 ppm liveable with ) struggle with uncertainties too .
Some models suggest there would be no cost ; others that global output could be as much as 5 % lower by the end of the century than if there were no attempt to control emissions .
But most estimates are at the low end — below 1 % .
The technological and economic aspects of the problem are , thus , not quite as challenging as many imagine .
The real difficulty is political .
Climate change is one of the hardest policy problems the world has ever faced .
Because it is global , it is in every country 's interests to get every other country to bear the burden of tackling it .
Because it is long term , it is in every generation 's interests to shirk the responsibility and shift it onto the next one .
And that way , nothing will be done .
What Kyoto did
The Kyoto protocol , which tried to get the world 's big polluters to commit themselves to cutting emissions to 1990 levels or below , was not a complete failure .
European Union countries and Japan will probably hit their targets , even if Canada does not .
Kyoto has also created a global market in carbon reduction , which allows emissions to be cut relatively efficiently .
But it will not have much impact on emissions , and therefore on the speed of climate change , because it does not require developing countries to cut their emissions , and because America did not ratify it .
The United States is the world 's biggest producer of greenhouse gases , though not for long .
Every year China is building power - generating capacity almost equivalent to Britain 's entire stock , almost all of it burning coal — the dirtiest fuel .
It will shortly overtake America , and India is not far behind .
Developing countries argue , quite reasonably , that , since the rich world created the problem , it must take the lead in solving it .
So , if America continues to refuse to do anything to control its emissions , developing countries wo n't do anything about theirs .
If America takes action , they just might .
Two measures are needed .
One is an economic tool which puts a price on emitting greenhouse gases .
That could be a carbon tax or a cap - and - trade system , such as Europe 's Emissions - Trading Scheme , which limits how much producers can emit , and lets them buy and sell emissions credits .
Ideally , politicians would choose the more efficient carbon tax , which implies a relatively stable price that producers can build into their investment plans .
The more volatile cap - and - trade system , however , is easier to sell to producers , who can get free allowances when the scheme is introduced .
Either of these schemes should decrease the use of fossil fuels and increase the use of alternatives .
In doing so , they are bound to raise energy prices .
To keep down price rises , and thus ease the political process , governments should employ a second tool : spending to help promising new technologies get to market .
Carbon sequestration , which offers the possibility of capturing carbon produced by dirty power stations and storing it underground , is a prime candidate .
Although George Bush now argues that America needs to wean itself off its dependency on oil , his administration still refuses to take serious action .
But other Americans are moving .
California 's state assembly has just passed tough Kyoto - style targets .
Many businesses , fearing that they will end up having to deal with a patchwork of state - level measures , now want federal controls .
And conservative America , once solidly sceptical , is now split over the issue , as Christians concerned about mankind 's stewardship of the Earth , neo-cons keen to reduce America 's dependency on the Middle East and farmers who see alternative energy as a new potential source of energy come round to the idea of cutting down on carbon .
Mr Bush has got two years left in the job .
He would like to be remembered as a straightshooter who did the right thing .
Tackling climate change would be one way to do that .

As lumps of rock go it looks much like any other , unexceptional despite the deep red of its cool , smooth surface .
The pieces range in size from pea-sized lumps to larger fist - sized chunks .
But today , scientists will announce this is no ordinary stone .
Prised from a frozen lake in northern Canada , it has become a prime candidate for the oldest known object on Earth .
The chunk came from a meteorite that scored an arc of fire across the skies before slamming into Lake Tagish in British Columbia in 2000 .
It has been pored over by scientists ever since , and is today revealed to contain particles that predate the birth of our nearest star , the sun .
The Tagish Lake meteorite was already regarded as exceptional because its mineral composition linked it to the earliest days of the formation of the solar system , more than 4.5 bn years ago .
The fragments of meteorite that still exist are among the most pristine in the world , as they were protected from contamination when they became wedged in blocks of lake ice .
The latest research shows that peppered throughout the meteorite are grains that formed even earlier , in a frigid cloud of molecules , possibly at the edge of the swirling disc of dust that ultimately collapsed to form the sun and all the planets of the solar system .
The discovery suggests that while the first light from the sun fell on the fledgling Earth , as the dinosaurs rose and died out and humans gained dominance , the meteorite was hurtling around the heavens on a billions - of - years - long journey destined to terminate with a thud in Yukon territory .
Researchers at Nasa 's Johnson Space Centre in Houston examined a two gram fragment of the meteorite and focused on tiny , hollow , carbon spheres embedded within it .
Each " globule " measured just a few thousandths of a millimetre across .
Using electron microscopy and isotope tests , the scientists looked at the chemical make - up of the grains and discovered they had unusual ratios of different forms of nitrogen and hydrogen .
Ratios of the isotope nitrogen - 15 to nitrogen - 14 were nearly twice those on Earth , while the ratio of deuterium , a heavy form of hydrogen , to normal hydrogen , was between 2.5 and nine times higher than usual .
Reporting in the journal Science today , a team lead by Keiko Nakamura - Messenger and Michael Zolensky show the levels of the isotopes in the meteorite could only arise from chemical reactions taking place in an extremely cold climate , where temperatures were as low as - 260C .
Those conditions would only be found in remote molecular clouds before the formation of the solar system , or at the very edge of what is known as the protosolar disc that was later to coalesce into the celestial bodies of the solar system .
" These little particles within the meteorite seem to predate everything else .
We do n't know exactly how old they are , but they could be billions of years older than the rest of the meteorite , " said Dr Zolensky .
Between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes of meteorite matter is believed to land on Earth every year , and around 90 % of this rains down steadily as fine particles that are rarely even identified .
Much of the material immediately disappears beneath the waves , and significant amounts are lost in the world 's deserts and forests .
Only a few tens of kilograms , in larger chunks , are usually recovered from any year 's fallout .
Fragments of the Tagish Lake meteorite were recovered after locals spotted the fireball it created as it tore through the atmosphere at 20 miles per second .
Large clumps of the meteorite were collected from the surface of the frozen lake , but other chunks were removed later embedded in blocks of ice , and transported to research labs .
Around one tonne of fragments from the meteorite is now held in the Natural History Museum in London and at other sites in the US , Canada and Germany .
" These are the real time machines , the material that goes back to the earliest formation of the solar system , " said Caroline Smith , meteorite curator at the Natural History Museum .
The meteorite is known as a carbonaceous chondrite and contains what many scientists regard as the building blocks for life : carbon , myriad clay minerals and even amino acids .
Scientists say the clay layers , principally silicates , can form protective pockets around the organic chemicals and act as reaction chambers where more complex molecules can form .
The possible role of these pockets in the ultimate emergence of life has lead some scientists to refer to them as " wombs " .
" These things tell us what kind of chemicals are out there in interstellar space .
They could have been the original seeds for life to get started , " said Dr Zolensky .

The # 2 Homeland Security official for Prince George ’s County , Maryland recently shot two furniture delivery guys who brought a new bed to his house .
The headboard had a scratch , according to local news reports .
Since one of the delivery guys died a few days ago , the story wo n’t vanish , regardless of how many times the local government changes its story .
The shooter is also a long - term employee of the Prince George ’s County Police Department .
This police department has long had one of the worst records in the nation for gunning down innocent civilians .
( Prince George ’s is next to the District of Columbia ) .
Here ’s a piece I did on the P.G. Police that Playboy published in December 2001 .
( The piece was written before 9/11 ) .
The response from the police chief and the local union chief follows after the article .

KILLER COPS : a case study in callousness ; Maryland law protects corrupt police in Prince Georges County
by James Bovard
In the last decade , they killed and maimed more unarmed people than the Unabomber and the Aryan Nation combined .
They have a worse human rights record than the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
If they were a foreign - based entity classified as terrorists ( such as Hamas ) , * and you contributed to their cause , you would face up to 10 years in jail for supporting terrorism .
Instead , they are supported with your tax dollars .
They are the 1400 members of the Prince George ’s County police department .
Prince George ’s County , adjacent to Washington , D.C. , is home to thousands of federal bureaucrats .
In a series published in July , The Washington Post highlighted some of the police department ’s accomplishments : “ Since 1990 , Prince George ’s police have shot 122 people , killing 47 of them .
Almost half of those shot were unarmed , and many had committed no crime . ”
Among the shootings the police department ruled as justified : “ An unarmed construction worker was shot in the back after he was detained in a fast - food restaurant .
An unarmed suspect died in a fusillade of 66 bullets as he tried to flee in a car from police .
A homeless man was shot when police mistook his portable radio for a gun .
And an unarmed man was killed after he pulled off the road to relieve himself . ”
Some local police practices appear to be borrowed from South Africa in its police - state days .
“ No one knows how many people have died while in the custody of Prince George ’s officers , ” the Post noted .
“ Police said they do n’t keep track of such deaths .
By examining autopsy reports and other documents , however , The Washington Post was able to identify 12 people who have died in police custody since 1990 . ”
The Post discovered the death of one person in police custody from a workers ’ compensation filing by a policeman who requested disability payments because he suffered “ emotional ” problems after permanently subduing an arrestee .
At least one suspect died after being severely beaten while wearing handcuffs .
Medical examiners have ruled two of the deaths in police custody to have been homicides–yet the department has not disciplined a single officer in an incustody death .
The system is scrupulous and idealistic when it comes to respecting the rights of killer cops .
Police are protected by the “ Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights ” –a Maryland law ( similar to laws in many other states ) that prohibits the questioning of a police officer for 10 days after any incident in which he or she used deadly force .
In Prince George ’s County , there is no greater offense than prematurely asking a cop why he gunned down a citizen .
The Post noted that “ a lawyer or a police union official is always summoned to the scene of a shooting to make sure no one speaks to the officer who pulled the trigger . ”
A toothless citizen police - oversight panel complained that the 10 - day rule “ invites abuse and raises serious concerns about collusion and the code of silence among officers . ”
Even after the 10 - day muzzle expires , police enjoy their version of the Miranda warning .
Nothing they say can be used against them in any criminal proceedings .
They enjoy the privilege of confidentiality –all statements to internal affairs investigators are kept from public scrutiny .
This bizarre policy might be unnecessary .
One homicide detective who looked into the suspicious death of a man in police custody explained that he did not try to question the two policemen involved “ because he did n’t want to violate their constitutional rights against self - incrimination . ”
In some cases , police are not questioned about shooting civilians until months after the victim has died .
Prince George ’s seems devoted to covering up official killings .
County lawyers refused to provide internal police records of police shooting investigations because it would be “ contrary to the public interest ” –even though state law seems to require that such information be revealed .
Wayne Curry , the first black chief executive officer of Prince George ’s County ( which is the nation ’s most affluent majority - black county ) , revels in the bad - boy record of his police , declaring last year that “ people do n’t want no pansy police force . ”
Many other professions keep records of lethal mistakes , although reluctantly .
Ford and Firestone issued a recall after a flurry of accidents .
Medical errors cause tens of thousands of deaths every year .
Since 1990 , in an effort to protect us from incompetent practitioners , a national data bank has tried to track iatrogenic , or “ doctor - caused , ” fatalities .
We do n’t have a word for “ police - caused ” deaths .
In 1994 Congress passed a law requiring national record keeping on police shootings , justified or otherwise .
However , neither the Justice Department nor most local police departments have bothered to keep track .
As a result , it is difficult to know how many other police departments may have cops as trigger - happy–and as legally untouchable –as those in Prince George ’s County .

HEADLINE : READER RESPONSE ; Letter to the Editor
March 2002
BODY :
DEADLY FORCE
“ Killer Cops ” ( The Playboy Forum , December ) , which alleges abuses by the police force in Prince George ’s County , Maryland , is loaded with incorrect information .
Six years ago , I came to Prince George ’s County to lead one of the largest police forces in the region .
The department had a history of high - profile incidents involving allegations of brutality and excessive use of force by some officers .
The county was experiencing a high level of crime .
Things have changed .
Today , crime is down in the county , excessive - force complaints are at a 16 - year low and police use of deadly force is at a 15 - year low .
These reductions in complaints and shootings become even more impressive when one considers that the department has 512 more officers and handles 150,000 more calls for service than it did 16 years ago .
PLAYBOY ’S report relies on accounts in The Washington Post .
Regrettably , the Post reporter , who , along with his editor , spent hours reviewing our training changes and reductions in use of force , left out all references to the significant progress that has been achieved .
In fact , the majority of shootings he referenced occurred five to 10 years ago .
My first full year as chief was 1996 .
Since that year , officer use of deadly force has been reduced 69 percent .

Response from Playboy editors :
Chief , thanks for writing .
The Washington Post did mention your order that officers be retrained in the use of deadly force .
It also noted that cops face difficult situations when deciding whether to fire their weapons .
But since 1996 , your officers have shot and killed suspects at four times the national average .
Not a single officer has been demoted since 1990 for the unjustified use of his or her weapon .
That ’s hard to believe given other incidents the Post recounted , such as the 1997 case in which your officers claimed they had killed a distraught college student because he attacked them with a knife .
When his family sued , the officers admitted under oath that the weapon had been a butter knife sitting on the counter , and that the student never touched it .
A year later , two of your officers said they had killed a teenager in self - defense after he tried to grab their guns .
But medical records indicated that the teen had been shot 13 times in the back while unconscious and lying facedown on the floor .

Bovard sits in his cushy little office while I , along with 1399 other officers , patrol the second most dangerous and violent county in the country ( behind Los Angeles ) .
That “ innocent ” man mentioned in the article –the one police shot at 66 times –was a suspected burglar and under the influence of cocaine when he stole an idling police car after a foot chase .
As a transit officer reached into the driver ’s side door , the suspect put the car in reverse .
Police shot him to prevent the officer from being dragged under the car .
As for the unarmed man who was killed while relieving himself , he was intoxicated and reaching into his waistband after being ordered to show his hands .
As an officer , would you have waited to shoot until after he shot you ?
How can I expect Bovard to understand that ?
His biggest worry is carpal tunnel syndrome .
Mine is dying in a neighborhood I do n’t live in but risk my life for .
When you tally the number of unarmed people shot by police , are you including the dozens of suspects shot while beating officers into unconsciousness ?
How about suspects shot after striking officers with vehicles , or those killed after trying to wrestle away an officer ’s weapon ?
Put yourself in a cop ’s shoes .
If a man reaches into his waistband after he sees you approaching in uniform , what would you think ?
Is he going for a gun ?
For drugs ?
For a radio ?
His wallet ?
Decide !
There are no time - outs .
The police are tired of being scapegoats .
I know officers who have started “ de- policing ” because they fear criticism .
They do what the radio tells them to do , nothing more , nothing less .
De-policing is being practiced in cities across the country , despite what police officials tell you .
It will continue until police scrutiny is laid to rest .

“ Killer Cops ” stopped me dead in my tracks .
At first I was disgusted .
But then I thought about the police officers I know and the ones I have seen on TV digging through the rubble of the World Trade Center .
They are good people .
So perhaps the police officers in Prince George ’s County are the victims of circumstance .
Maybe the man they shot outside a fast - food restaurant was n’t all that innocent .
Maybe The Washington Post put a spin on the truth .
Police , like other citizens , are innocent until proved guilty .
Right ?

For a lucky subset of vertebrates , losing an appendage is no big deal .
As many an inquisitive child knows , salamanders can regenerate lost limbs or tails ; and as lab investigators know , zebrafish can regrow lost fins .
Of course , humans and other " higher " vertebrates must make do with repairing rather than regenerating damaged tissues .
Though whole body generation ( WBR ) does occur , it 's typically restricted to a subset of morphologically less complex invertebrates , such as sponges , flatworms , and jellyfish .
In a new study , Yuval Rinkevich et al. discovered an unusual mode of WBR in our closest invertebrate relative , the sea squirt Botrylloides leachi .
Sea squirts ( also called " tunicates " after their tough outer tunic ) are widely distributed in shallow coastal waters as colonies of genetically identical individuals called " zooids . "
To investigate WBR in B. leachi , Rinkevich et al. collected colonies from the Mediterranean coast of Israel and analyzed the morphological , cellular , and molecular characteristics of the process .
The researchers removed fragments of blood vessels with ampullae from the colonies , and placed the fragments on slides for regeneration .
Of 95 fragments , 80 underwent WBR .
Aggregating cells formed around a hollow sphere , then reorganized into a thin and thick layer on opposite sides , very similar to early stages of embryonic development .
As cells proliferated , buds grew and the thick cell layer folded inward , forming double - walled folds and chambers .
Organ development continued and an adult zooid , capable of sexual reproduction , appeared within two weeks .
For molecular insights into regeneration , the researchers focused on retinoic acid ( RA ) signaling by examining the temporal expression of its receptor ( RAR ) .
In addition to its role in chordate body patterning , RA ( a vitamin A metabolite ) induces the regeneration of several tissues and organs .
Only regenerating vessels and ampullae expressed RAR , and this expression continued through each phase of regeneration .
The researchers confirmed RA 's vital role in regeneration by inhibiting RA synthesis with chemicals and destroying RA transcripts with RNA interference .
In both cases , malformed buds failed to generate zooids from dissected fragments .
Similar problems occurred when RAR function was disrupted .
In contrast , RA overexpression led to accelerated regeneration , with multiple buds reaching the fully developed zooid stage .
RAR regulates developmental elements of the normal budding process in a sister colonial tunicate species , suggesting that organisms recruit the same signals for development and regeneration .
In regenerating fully functional adult tunicates from " minute vascular fragments , " the researchers identified several features of this system that differ from those of established regeneration model systems .
In contrast to limb or fin regeneration , which arises from local signals emanating from a " regeneration center , " B. leachi WBR arises from systemically induced signals in multiple " regeneration niches . "
These niches arise from the vascular network ( rather than from proliferating balls of cells ) , and regeneration appears to be regulated by systemic ( rather than local ) cues .
These systemic cues , the researchers propose , may travel through the circulation , thereby supporting multiple regeneration foci .
The researchers plan to investigate the cellular source of the tunicate 's remarkable regenerative power in future studies .
As invertebrate members of the phylum Chordata , sea squirts share several fundamental biological pathways with vertebrates ; consequently , using them as a model system to study WBR could illuminate not only the evolutionary origin of regeneration , but also its subsequent attenuation in vertebrates .

20 Things You Did n’t Know About Sesame Street
by jimmycanuck
Filed under : tv November 11 , 2006 , 6:32 pmFiled under : lists
I had a little spare time this afternoon , so I got to surfing around wikipedia and learned a ton of neat facts and trivia about everyone ’s favourite childrens program .
20 great facts below ;
1. Baby Bear is Jewish .
2 . The Count is nearly two million years old .
3 . The Count ’s laugh after counting each number was discontinued over concerns of it frightening children .
4 . In 1985 , Snuffeupagus ceased to be a creature only Big Bird can see .
The reason ?
Concerns that adults not believing Big Bird about Snuffy would lead to children being afraid to speak out about sexual abuse .
5 . In the first season , Grover was brown , not blue .
6. Cookie Monster predates Sesame Street by 3 years .
He began his life as “ The Wheel Stealer ” in an unaired General Foods commercial , and went on to become involved in an IBM training film and a commercial for Munchos , where he went under the name “ Arnold the Munching Monster . ”
Back in these early days , he had a big set of sharp teeth and seemed a little more terrifying to kiddies than the friendly blue monster we all know and love .
7. During his first season in 1979 , Telly was known as “ The Television Monster . ”
He had an antenna on the top of his head and his eyes would spin around whenever he watched TV .
In 1980 he was revamped into the worrywart we ’ve all gotten used to .
8. Rosita , the only Hispanic Muppet on Sesame Street , is actually a fruit bat .
9 . In the first season , Oscar the Grouch was orange , not green .
10 .
In 1970 , a single was released of Ernie singing “ Rubber Duckie . ”
It reached # 16 on the Billboard chart .
11 . Bert and Ernie are n’t gay .
Get over it .
Sesame Workshop has gone on record about this .
12 . The pilot episode of Sesame Street that was screen tested in front of a number of families in July 1969 featured only one Muppet sketch .
It involved Bert and Ernie .
This was the only part of the show that tested well , so the show was retooled to focus more heavily on the Muppets , and to have them interact with human characters as well .
13 . After Jim Henson ’s death in 1989 , only a handful of “ News Flash ” segments , which prominently featured Kermit the Frog , were created .
In 2001 , the sketches , both old and new , were abandoned completely .
14 . Guy Smiley ’s real name is Bernie Liederkrantz .
15 .
The fat blue muppet that always plays a customer to Grover ’s waiter has a name befitting his appearance – Fat Blue .
16 . In 2002 , a the South African version of Sesame Street , an HIV - positive muppet was introduced in 2002 .
Kami is a five year old girl that became HIV - positive through a blood transfusion as an infant .
Her name is derived from the word “ Kamogelo , ” which means “ acceptance ” in several African languages .
17 . Contrary to popular belief , Big Bird is not a canary .
He ’s a Golden Condor .
18 . Although the character of Elmo did n’t debut until 1984 , the Elmo puppet was used regularly as a background Muppet since the early 1970’s .
19 .
Barkley was originally intended to be an acrobatic ape rather than a sheep dog .
As well , he was called Woof Woof at first , only being called Barkley after several appearances .
20 . Ken Kwapis , the director of the 1985 Sesame Street film “ Follow That Bird , ” went on to be involved in the creation of such cultural TV landmarks as The Larry Sanders Show and the The Office .

Coding salted password hash with PostgreSQL
Important Note :
These instructions were written in 2006 when md5 was available by default in PostgreSQL and stronger hash functions required some installation work .
Today there is no reason to use a weak hash function like md5 since using strong hash functions in PostgreSQL today is as straightforward as using md5 was in 2006 .
See the documentation on the pgcrypto module .
It took me 1 - 2 hours including testing to make sure ourdoings.com would n't suffer reddit 's recent embarrassment or slashdot 's not so recent embarrassment .
This was installed with zero downtime .
Here 's how I did it :
1 . The salted hash database setup
ALTER TABLE person ADD COLUMN salt varchar ( 4 ) ; ALTER TABLE person ADD COLUMN salted_md5 char ( 32 ) ; ALTER TABLE person ALTER COLUMN salt SET DEFAULT substring ( cast ( random ( ) as varchar ) from 3 for 4 ) ; update person set salt=substring ( md5 ( email ) from 1 for 4 ) ; update person set salted_md5=md5 ( password||salt ) ;
Note how nice a relational database is for this kind of change .
The salt column gets a random value anywhere a person is created .
I do n't have to change the registration process , the " invite " feature , or the automatic person creation from PayPal to insert a salt .
All I have to change is the code that references the password column .
2. References to the password column .
This was the longest part of the process because I was trying very hard to be sure I did n't leave anything out .
In the end I found I need n't have tried so hard .
All I had to do was change password=foo everywhere to salted_md5=md5 ( foo||salt ) , and anywhere that inserted foo into the password column should insert md5 ( foo||salt ) into the salted_md5 column instead
3 . The final SQL
update person set salted_md5=md5 ( password||salt ) ; ALTER TABLE person DROP COLUMN password ;
Just in case someone set a password in the few seconds between me running the initial SQL and copying the new code in , I did a second update of the salted_md5 column .
Then , knowing I had changed all code referencing the password column , I dropped it .
No more plaintext passwords in backups !
Of course I ran everything in my test environment first and made sure I could register new users , log in with passwords , and change passwords .
It went off without a hitch .
If I knew how easy it was I would have done it a lot earlier .
Hopefully this page will inspire other sites to get it together .
If you are n't convinced , maybe your thoughts mirror ragica's comment :
I gave up on storing encrypted passwords long ago ( for web applications ) .
Too many headaches and idiot users who get annoyed by password resets , and want their password emailed to them .
I trust the users who know better to look after themselves and not reuse passwords ... and the rest have absolutely no concept of hashed passwords anyhow , so what does it matter to them ?
All they care about is that they can get their forgotten password emailed back to themselves quickly and easily every week when they forget it .
Regarding those users I ask you , why give them a password at all ?
Why not just email them a one - time token to log in whenever they use your site ?
It does get annoying having to create scores of password - protected accounts for different sites .
Why force people who rarely use your site to keep a password for it ?
That 's what I 've done with ourdoings.com .
People initially log in with an emailed link .
Any time they want to set a password they can , but if they do n't want to set a password they can use one - time login links every time .
Peak Oil , Missing Oil Meters and an Inactive Pipeline :
The Real Reason for the Invasion of Iraq ?
In this article I will present research that supports a rather startling hypothesis : that the USA invaded Iraq primarily to enable the secret diversion of a portion of Iraq ’s oil production to Saudi Arabia .
This was done in order to disguise the fact that Saudi Arabia ’s oil output has peaked , and may be in permanent decline .
The evidence for this conclusion is circumstantial , but it does knit up many of the loose threads in the mystery of the American administration ’s motivation for invasion .
To lay the groundwork we need to set out a couple of assumptions .
The primary assumption is that the world ’s oil production has been on a plateau for the last two years , and in fact we may be teetering on the brink of the production decline predicted by the Peak Oil theory .
Such a decline could be dangerous to the world economy , both directly through the loss of economic capacity and indirectly ( and perhaps more importantly ) through the loss of investor confidence in the global economic structure .
The second assumption is that the oil production of Saudi Arabia is key to maintaining the global oil supply .
Saudi Arabia supplies over 10 % of the world ’s crude oil , with over half of that coming from one enormous field named Ghawar .
There is a large and well - informed body of opinion that believes that if Saudi oil production goes into decline the world will follow because there is not the spare capacity anywhere else to make up for such a decline .
Saudi Arabia is notoriously tight - lipped about the state of their oil fields , and in fact oil production information is considered to be a state secret .
The only trustworthy information the world really has about Saudi Arabia ’s oil are their aggregated production figures .
The conclusion that can be drawn from these two assumptions is that if Saudi Arabia ’s production began to decline and the world found out about it , there would be a significant risk of a world - wide economic panic that would destabilize markets and throw nations like the USA into a recession or depression that would be worse than the actual damage done by the loss of the oil .
We can assume that the prevention or postponement of such a crisis would be an extremely high priority for the administrations of both the USA and Saudi Arabia .
These meetings have long been a bone of contention with the Bush administration .
They have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep the subject of the meetings absolutely secret .
These efforts are documented by such sources as http://www.projectcensored.org/publications/2005/8.html and http://www.bushsecrecy.org/page.cfm?PagesID=27&ParentID=1&CategoryID=1
We do know the following :
The task force was created in the second week of the Bush administration to develop national energy policies .
They met early in 2001 ( well before September 11 ) to draft policy and develop plans .
Task force meetings were attended by executives of Exxon - Mobil Corp. , Conoco , Royal Dutch Shell Oil Corp. , and the American subsidiary of British Petroleum .
Among the meager product that has been made public are maps of Iraqi and Saudi Arabian oil fields and pipelines .
On both these maps there is a pipeline called IPSA ( the Iraq Petroleum Saudi Arabia pipeline ) that is marked “ closed ” .
The maps are available at http://www.judicialwatch.org/IraqOilMap.pdf and http://www.judicialwatch.org/SAOilMap.pdf
I t is well known that the Iraqi Oil Ministry was the only major government installation guarded by American troops following the fall of Baghdad .
Indeed it was guarded extremely well : according to an April , 2003 news story at http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/16/1050172643895.html:
Since US forces rolled into central Baghdad a week ago , one of the sole public buildings untouched by looters has been Iraq 's massive oil ministry , which is under round - the - clock surveillance by troops .
The imposing building in the Al - Mustarisiya quarter is guarded by around 50 US tanks which block every entrance , while sharpshooters are positioned on the roof and in the windows .
The curious onlooker is clearly unwelcome .
Any motorist who drifts within a few metres of the main entrance is told to leave immediately .
Baghdad residents have complained that US troops should do more to protect against the looters , most of them Shi'ite Muslims repressed by Saddam Hussein 's Sunni - dominated regime who live in the vast slum known as Saddam City on the northern outskirts .
But while museums , banks , hotels and libraries have been ransacked , the oil ministry remains secure .
The ostensible reason for this extraordinary focus was to protect Iraq ’s primary asset .
Indeed an American captain is quoted in the article as saying , " Anyone who says we 're protecting this ministry to steal Iraqi oil does n't know what 's really going on in this country . "
On March 22 , 2007 , CorpWatch published an article entitled “ Mystery of the Missing Meters : Accounting for Iraq 's Oil Revenue ” ( http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=14427).
In it they make the following claims :
At the oil terminals of Al Basra ( ABOT ) and Khawr al Amaya ( KAAOT ) , “ smugglers are suspected to be diverting an estimated billions of dollars worth of crude onto tankers because the oil metering system that is supposed monitor how much crude flows into and out of ABOT and KAAOT - has not worked since the March 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq . ”
Officials blame the four - year delay in repairing the relatively simple system on " security problems . "
Others point to the failed efforts of the two U.S. companies hired to repair the southern oil fields , fix the two terminals , and the meters : Halliburton of Houston , Texas , and Parsons of Pasadena , California .
Rumors are rife among suspicious Iraqis about the failure to measure the oil flow .
" Iraq is the victim of the biggest robbery of its oil production in modern history , " blazed a March 2006 headline in Azzaman , Iraq 's most widely read newspaper .
A May 2006 study of oil production and export figures by Platt 's Oilgram News , an industry magazine , showed that up to $ 3 billion a year is unaccounted for .
The kinds of meters they were supposed to repair or replace at ABOT are commonly found at hundreds of similar sites around the world .
Because they are custom - built , shipped , then assembled and calibrated on site , the process can take up to a year .
But the probelm has persisted for four years .
After the 2003 invasion , the meters appear to have been turned off and there have since been no reliable estimates of how much crude has been shipped from the southern oil fields .
" I would say probably between 200,000 and 500,000 barrels a day is probably unaccounted for in Iraq , " Mikel Morris , who worked for the Iraq Reconstruction Management Organization ( IRMO ) at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad , told KTVT , a Texas television station .
Now we ’ll look at that pipeline on those Energy Task force maps .
The Iraq Petroleum Saudi Arabia ( IPSA ) pipeline was built during the Iran - Iraq war to circumvent attacks by Iran on Iraqi tankers in the Gulf .
It has a capacity of 1.7 million barrels per day and runs from Iraq 's southern oil fields to the Saudi port of Yanbu , north of Jeddah .
It later served both Iraq and Saudi Arabia , but has been closed by the Saudis since Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait .
The Saudis claim ownership of the pipeline , though Iraq disagrees .
The pipeline was reported ready to resume operation in September , 2003 ( http://www.ameinfo.com/28059.html ) .
One month later in October however , we heard this ( from http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/ntm34663.htm ) :
20 -10-03
The 1.7 mm bpd crude pipeline which runs from Iraq across Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea is in no condition to be utilised for Iraqi exports .
When asked about reports that Iraq was in discussions with Riyadh to re-open the line , a Saudi Aramco official said that the Iraqis " do n't know what they are talking about .
The pipeline is not in a state to be utilised . "
So is it usable or is n’t it ?
I ca n’t find anything except this denial to indicate that it ’s unserviceable , though a State Department presentation ( http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/60011.pdf ) indicates that it ’s closed with no plans to re-open .
I can find no evidence of insurgent attacks against it , so there is at least some possibility that it is running .
Saudi Arabia ’s Oil Production History
Saudi Arabia ’s oil production has been deliberately increased and decreased over the years in like with their role as the world ’s “ swing producer ” – a country with enough capacity to open the taps to keep prices from rising too high and the political discipline to restrict production if prices fell .
In the period from 2001 to the end of 2003 , this “ price band ” was set by OPEC at $ 22 to $ 28 per barrel .
At the beginning of 2004 oil prices moved above this band , and have never returned to it .
This seems to indicate that OPEC members , and particularly Saudi Arabia , do n’t have the excess capacity that would be required to bring the prices back within the traditional band .
The suspension of the price band in 2005 seems to be in recognition of this new market reality .
This graph of Saudi oil production is very interesting .
It clearly shows the fluctuations in supply during 2002 and 2003 , presumably attributable to their role as a swing producer .
At the beginning of 2004 , however , something very curious happens .
There is a very rapid rise in production of 1.3 million barrels per day over the course of two months .
This production level is maintained with only one small dip ( which may indicate the temporary influence of production from the new Haradh III oil field ) until the beginning of 2006 .
At that point a decline sets in that has not yet been arrested , resulting in a fall of 8 % over the last year .
This decline has been validated by four independent sets of data , as described here : http://www.theoildrum.com/node/2331
I have never been entirely satisfied with the unofficial explanations for the Iraq war .
I do accept ( as does this article ) the idea that the war was somehow “ about oil , ” yet none of the existing explanations for why that should be so are terribly convincing .
The United States could have achieved significant influence over the disposition of Iraqi oil through standard diplomatic and commercial means , without the expenditure of so many lives and so much money .
One hypothesis advanced by Canadian journalist , Linda McQuaig , in her book “ It ’s the Crude , Dude ” argues that the US invaded to acquire the “ carrot and stick ” of oil ownership and sales rights in order to be better able to reward friends and punish its enemies , thereby shaping regional and global power structures .
To me this seems a costly , indirect and ineffective mechanism , especially if the global oil supply is unconstrained and nations can buy from whomever they wish .
Then there is the hypothesis that invasion was staged to permit western oil companies ( particularly those with close ties to the Bush administration ) to take control of the fields and reap windfall profits .
This speculation also comes up short in my opinion .
Those oil companies were already doing very well .
An invasion and occupation are very risky ventures , and are intrinsically unlikely to provide the stable environment required for a simple transfer of commercial control ( neo-con dreams of flowers , candy and regime change notwithstanding ) .
The costs seem entirely out of proportion to the potential rewards .
The speculation of this article is that the real background of the Iraq war goes something like this :
The Bush administration is composed primarily of oilmen .
They are well aware of the Peak Oil theory .
They are also aware of the risks that a decline in global oil production could pose to the world ’s political and economic stability , especially if it is generally perceived to be the result of irreversible geological conditions ( i.e. we start to realize that the world is running out of oil and there ’s nothing we can do about it ) .
The Bush administration and the Saudis are also well aware of the role Saudi Arabia plays as the linchpin of world oil production .
The Bush administration and the Saudis are very good friends , and share intimate secrets like the actual state of Saudi oil production .
In early 2001 the Saudis tell George and Dick that Ghawar has started to “ water out ” : the oil they are pumping up contains more and more of the water that they are using to force oil into the wells .
This is a sure sign that the field is nearing the end of its useful life .
This news triggers very loud alarm bells in Washington and Riyadh , because if Ghawar and overall Saudi production are about to decline this brings the risk of global instability that much closer .
The two administrations decide they need to keep the imminence of Saudi oil decline out of the public consciousness for as long as possible .
To do this they need to accomplish two things : mask the decline of Saudi Arabia , and make it appear as though any decline in Middle East production is due to above - ground factors .
Fortunately , they have a ready target in Iraq .
Saddam is vulnerable , he has lots of oil , and Iraqi oil production has been in chaos since Gulf War 1 .
And he controls the input end of the IPSA pipeline .
At Cheney ’s Energy Task Force meetings the plan is developed and western oil companies are brought into the picture .
This ensures they will be onside and will not start asking awkward questions later about the provenance of Saudi oil .
As a parallel effort , the Saudis agree to sponsor an attack on US soil to provide the Bush administration with the required “ casus belli ” .
The Saudis recruit 15 of their own citizens to form the core of the September 11 attack team .
Once the attack has taken place the march to war begins .
It does n’t matter how flimsy the excuses are , all that matters is that the progress of the plan cannot be derailed under any circumstances .
No penetration of the ruse , however small , will be permitted .
This determination results in the Wilson / Plame reprisal , the killing of Dr. David Kelly and possibly other killings like that of State Department WMD analyst John Kokal ( http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/112003_kokal.html ) .
The real reason for the invasion must never be discovered .
Iraq is duly invaded and Baghdad is captured .
The Oil Ministry is the only facility to be secured because it ’s the only one that matters to the plan .
The meters in the southern oil fields are immediately shut off and sabotaged so nobody can tell how much oil is missing .
The un-metered oil is redirected into the perfectly functional IPSA pipeline and enters Saudi Arabia .
There are now two possibilities for what happens to the purloined oil :
It arrives at the Saudi port of Yanbu where it is loaded onto tankers as legitimate Saudi oil , and shipped to international customers .
There is a problem with this scenario , because the oil coming in from Iraq has a slightly different chemical signature from Saudi oil .
This small difference would be noticed by customers , because the refineries need to know the characteristics of their feedstock very precisely .
A more reasonable solution is that this oil is piped to refineries in Saudi Arabia and is used to satisfy domestic demand .
The Saudi oil spared by this substitution is shipped out to customers , and no one is the wiser .
This is both safer and easier than the first suggestion , because the stolen oil never leaves Saudi Arabia , and its disposition falls under the obscuring veil of Saudi secrecy .
This also makes the case harder to prove , of course .
The 1.7 million barrel per day volume of the IPSA pipeline and the timing of the rise seen in Saudi oil production in early 2004 fit the scenario perfectly .
Any decline in overall Middle Eastern oil production can now be blamed on the civil war in Iraq , which has been either a blessing in disguise or a calculated part of the plan .
The attacks on oil installations have also made it easy to disguise the disappearance of a full tanker - load - equivalent of oil every day .
It was all going well , except that the decline in Saudi oil production exceeded everyone ’s expectations .
Even with the Iraqi subterfuge in place the decline of 800,000 barrels per day over the last year could not be masked .
Conclusion
There is as yet no smoking gun to support this hypothesis .
This remains a work of pure speculation , based on a suggestive convergence of events and incidents .
The one feature of this hypothesis that makes it attractive is the extent to which it can accommodate all the odd and otherwise inexplicable events of the last six years .
On the other hand , it can be accused of suffering from the common failing of conspiracy theories : it would take too many people to implement .
The argument against that is that these events have demonstrably occurred and the binding element of the hypothesis , the peaking of Saudi oil production , would not require that many people to be aware of it in order for it to provide sufficient motivation for such a devious scheme .
I would welcome any additional thoughts or suggestions of evidence on this scenario .
I would especially like to hear of any evidence that would falsify the hypothesis – particularly evidence of the ( in ) operability of the IPSA pipeline .

No one quite knows what to do about Congressman Ron Paul , Republican candidate for president .
He refuses to play by the rules .
He ’s a bigger supporter of the free market than anyone in Congress , but he ’s also the most consistent opponent of war .
( That the conjunction of these positions — which amount to classical liberalism in a nutshell — should actually seem surprising or odd goes to show how perverse our political system has become . )
Other than Dennis Kucinich , he is the only authentic antiwar candidate in either party .
He has won so many awards from the National Taxpayers Union that he ’s probably lost count .
CNET rated him the best out of all 435 congressmen in the House of Representatives on issues relating to the Internet .
There is no more reliable civil libertarian in Congress than Ron Paul .
His conduct , moreover , is beyond reproach .
Lobbyists do n’t even bother going to his office .
If their scheme does n’t fall among the federal government ’s enumerated powers under the Constitution , they know perfectly well that there is no chance Ron Paul will support it .
Paul ’s new book , A Foreign Policy of Freedom , calls for the abandonment of hyper - interventionism and the restoration of a foreign policy of commerce and peace .
Although more and more Americans polled agree that their government should mind its own business and try to scale back its impossible commitments — Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes of Columbia and Harvard , respectively , now say that their initial estimate of $ 2 trillion as the long - term cost of the Iraq war is too low — no one in politics other than Ron Paul will actually say such a thing , much less write a book about it .
At last we have a choice , not an echo , as Phyllis Schlafly used to put it .
Dr. Paul , an Ob / Gyn who has delivered 4,000 babies in his career , utterly defies the view of the world shared by right - wing blogs and talk radio , in which America is divided into " liberals " who oppose the Iraq war and conservatives who support it .
( As I ’ve shown in the past , " liberals " do n’t have a particularly stellar antiwar record over the past hundred years , and the " liberal media , " including the Washington Post , the New York Times , and the cable news networks , overwhelmingly supported the Iraq war . )
Ron Paul ’s candidacy is having the useful effect of showing people that their ideological choices are not limited to Al Franken and Rush Limbaugh .
You can in fact be antiwar without being a leftist .
At the same time , some on the left are giving Paul a respectful hearing , sensing that this is no ordinary politician .
A writer for The Nation argued that " this Constitution - wielding contender , who voted against authorizing Bush to invade and occupy Iraq and has steadily opposed that war since its launch four years ago , would certainly make the GOP debates worth watching — and perhaps applauding . "
A writer for the Keene Free Press , who admits he does n’t " normally give Republicans much of a hearing , " found himself in for a " pleasant surprise " at one of Paul ’s New Hampshire speeches .
" His speech , like his candidacy , is refreshing .
Paul seems to be genuinely authentic .
He does n’t have the feel of a politician .
His arguments are substantive , and his demeanor warm . "
For my part , I hope Paul decides to run .
In a weak field , Paul is a true champion .
America is at a critical crossroads .
Our liberties have been trampled .
The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are in shambles .
Our reputation has been tarnished internationally by decades of provocative foreign policy .
Paul is the only candidate thus far who seems interested in reversing that trend .
And for that , if he runs , he has my vote .
An antiwar Republican who is also much sounder on other issues than they are — this is not exactly welcome news to neoconservatives .
Not long ago , the neoconservative Pajamas Media featured a presidential poll on which Ron Paul kept winning .
That was n’t the outcome they wanted , naturally , so they finally removed him from contention in order to make things come out right .
Covering their tracks , Pajamas Media tried to claim that they wanted to feature only those candidates who registered at least one percent in national polls .
When Ron Paul surpassed that figure , however , they still refused to include him , even though they have included people like Tommy Thompson who are at zero percent because they are not actually running for president .
Read all about it here .
Paul did manage to make his way onto the Fox News Channel thanks to the entreaties of hundreds of viewers who wrote to the station demanding to know why the " fair and balanced " network had totally neglected the Paul candidacy .
It was a short appearance on Fox News Live ’s " Because You Asked " feature , which features stories that viewers themselves have asked to be covered .
Ron Paul has made numerous media appearances , from C - SPAN to Lou Dobbs , since and prior to the announcement of his candidacy .
Still , the strategy thus far has been to ignore him to the extent possible .
That approach cannot work in the long run , since for one thing the enthusiasm for Dr. Paul all over the Internet cannot be contained forever .
For another , people are going to become curious about him when they watch , or hear reports about , the first Republican primary debate on May 3 .
They ’ll see a bunch of establishment hacks uttering platitudes devised for them by handlers and focus groups , and they ’ll see Ron Paul , who unlike his opponents is not only intelligent enough to write his own speeches , but who will also raise questions the other candidates would prefer not to discuss .
He can pummel every single one of them on their lousy records on taxes , the Constitution , and war .
Ron Paul is about to spoil the party .
This will be like no other Republican primary debate in many , many years .
Now that will get him noticed .
Think of how much less interesting , indeed how downright intolerable , this election cycle would be without Ron Paul : a bunch of hacks and drones , not one of whom would make a single substantial change to Washington , D.C. , if elected .
Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani may as well drop the pretense and just run on the same ticket , for heaven ’s sake .
And since they ’re part of the same racket , they both despise Ron Paul much more than they dislike each other — another excellent endorsement of Dr. Paul , of course .
I ’ve sometimes said that political discourse in America today consists of a three - by - five card from which no one is permitted to stray .
The issues we ’re allowed to discuss are confined to whether the top tax rate should be 35 percent or 38.1 percent , for example , or whether the U.S. government should invade country A or country B .
If you argue that the questions themselves are faulty in that they unduly restrict our choices , you have strayed from the three - by - five card and will not appear on Meet the Press ever again .
Ron Paul has a tremendous opportunity to shred that three - by - five card once and for all .
The Best of Tom Woods
Seasoned video game players used to laugh when beginners waved the controller up in the air , urging Mario to jump a little further , but now these frantic motions have become part of the game .
The new Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation 3 gaming systems , just released for the holidays , both include motion - sensing controllers .
Nintendo , in particular , has used its motion - sensing controller as the primary selling point of the Wii .
But how are the controllers able to precisely and accurately measure physical movement ?
At the heart of the controller technology are tiny accelerometers .
Inside these chips , silicon springs anchor a silicon wafer to the rigid controller .
As you wave the controller through the air at an attacking enemy , the wafer presses onto the springs , just as you are pressed against the seat of a car when you stomp on the gas pedal .
The faster the controller accelerates , the more the wafer moves relative to the rest of the chip .
The accelerometer monitors the position of the wafer by measuring capacitance , or the ability to store electric charge , in different directions .
When you move the controller forward in a punch , the capacitance increases at the back of the wafer and decreases at the front .
Using capacitance to measure how far and in what direction the wafer moves , the system translates your real - life movements into the perfect jab to your opponent ’s face .
Accelerometers were bulky and expensive when they were first used to guide real - life missiles and aircraft , but they became available for gaming when engineers began producing them the same way computer chips are made .
The accelerometers used in the Nintendo controller are thinner than a penny , small enough to fit twelve on a postage stamp , and sell for under $ 6 a piece .
They can accurately measure forces more than three times stronger than the pull of gravity in three directions – up and down , side to side , and forward and back .
The chips also use gravity to determine the orientation of the controller , whether you ’re holding it vertically like a golf club or horizontally like a gun .
But accelerometers alone cannot provide complete control , because small positional errors add up over time , like when you need to re-center your mouse on a mousepad .
Nintendo addressed this problem by including a sensor bar that can be placed above or below the television .
Each end of the bar emits a beam of infrared light like a television remote , which is monitored by a sensor on the controller that works like a digital camera : by seeing where the two spots of light fall on its grid of more than 750,000 pixels , the sensor can determine where the controller is pointing and translate it to a position on the television screen .
Even by combining technologies , game developers have yet to maximize the ability of motion sensing .
The Wii ignores some of the motion sensing data it collects and simplifies the gameplay to compensate for different living rooms and players .
In his Slate magazine review of the Wii , Erik Sofge , complained that a table - tennis flick of the wrist was just as effective as a proper baseball swing .
As gamers demand improved realism and accuracy in their video games , engineers will continue to push towards better motion - sensing technologies , and likely use more sensor combinations .
But if you need to swing a real baseball bat right now your best bet is to go to the park .
Have you noticed that FAQ pages for online services almost never include instructions for how to cancel your account ?
It ’s like they ’re all subject to the same bizarre superstition … if you do n’t tell people how to cancel , maybe they ’ll lose interest and keep paying you .
A long time ago I wrote an article called Let Me Go Back !
The gist of it was that if you want to attract new customers , you have to give them the confidence that there is no risk in signing up or converting from whatever they were using before .
This superstition , the superstition that leaving cancellation instructions off of the website will somehow help your business , is actually probably the result of misapplied scientific method .
It ’s very likely that somebody did an A - B test and convinced themselves that more people cancel if you tell them how to cancel .
You see , that ’s a very easy test to do .
What ’s not easy to test is how many people never sign up in the first place because they ’re afraid that canceling is going to be a nightmare .
So what you have here is a somebody doing a cost / benefit analysis where they are measuring the benefit while ignoring the cost .
Here ’s what we do at Fog Creek : we ’ve always had an unconditional 90 day money back guarantee on everything we sell .
I ’ve even had people return the movie Aardvark ’d because they just did n’t like the movie .
Our online , subscription - based service , Copilot , states clearly on the sign - up page that “ you may cancel at any time , on the Web , without hassle . ”
Since we started the company in 2000 , the moneyback guarantee has cost us precisely 2 % of revenues , which also includes chargebacks , credit card fraud , and people who accidentally ordered twice .
That figure that has remained remarkably stable through the years and which I think is well worth it , but then again , I ’m only measuring the cost , because the benefit is too hard to measure !

George Bush has been giving the essentially the same speech about the dangers of leaving Iraq for almost two years now .
The media dutifully records those same words over and over -- without applying any context .
September 22 , 2005 :
" Some Americans want us to withdraw our troops so that we can escape the violence , " said Bush , who was flanked by Vice President Cheney , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other top officials .
" I recognize their good intentions , but their position is wrong .
Withdrawing our troops would make the world more dangerous and make America less safe .
To leave Iraq now would be to repeat the costly mistakes of the past that led to the attacks of September the 11th , 2001 . "
" The enemy does not measure the conflict in Iraq in terms of timetables , " Bush said to soldiers here , a reference to congressional Democrats ' plans to start phasing in troop withdrawals .
" A strategy that encourages this enemy to wait us out is dangerous - dangerous for our troops , dangerous for our security , " Bush said .
" And it 's not going to become law . "
Slight change in wording , but essentially the same message .
If the media did any kind of analysis , they 'd examine what 's really dangerous for our troops and our security .
For example , they might note that Bush makes these remarks while troops are dying -- seven in the last two days .
For example , it 's dangerous for our troops to send them to a war without a plan and without the needed equipment and training .
What 's dangerous for our troops is leaving them to die in the middle of a civil war .
What 's been dangerous for our security has been to ignore the real terror threat while simultaneously empowering them .
" my secret dream is to win the lottery , then blow it all on the collector 's blockade runner , star destroyer , and now this . "
So you 're going to blow all your cash before they come out with the collector 's Death Star ( 1:1 scale ) ?

No author in SF , not even James Tiptree , Jr , is as impossible to " just read " as Philip K. Dick .
As much as reviewers or readers might like to think that they assess books on what 's between the covers and nothing else , you can't be in SF 's culture and not know some of the facts of Dick 's life , or speculate about how they bore on his fiction .
Even the bare bones are suggestive : born 1928 , twin sister died in infancy , apprenticeship selling stories to the SF magazines of the ' 50s , creative peak from say 1959 to 1970 , the poverty , the many marriages , the drugs , the paranoia , the 1974 " revelation " of otherworldly communication directed at him , the sparse and madness - infested late novels , the early death in 1982 , and the posthumous elevation of his reputation making him arguably the most widely admired SF author of the 20th century .
Then there are the movies .
Just thinking of the high - profile ones , there 's Blade Runner , Total Recall , and Minority Report , each taking the virus of a Dick story and injecting it into the body of some Hollywood genre template to see which antibodies will win out .
( The first words of Dick 's story " The Minority Report " are , " The first thought Anderton had when he saw the young man was : I 'm getting bald .
Bald and fat and old . "
I wonder how many picoseconds they lasted when Tom Cruise 's people saw them ? )
This summer , we get Richard Linklater 's film of A Scanner Darkly ( 1977 ) , which I 've not seen but which has promising material in the shape of Dick 's extraordinarily savage and mournful late mea culpa about drugs .
On the back of that , and anticipating an influx of new readers , Vintage have released a new one - volume PKD primer .
There 's no editor credited on the Vintage PKD , which may be house style , but it also frustrates the reviewer looking for someone to hold accountable .
Of course , a thought - through selection from Dick 's work is very welcome , and there 's evidence that whoever put this book together lavished care and consideration on it .
But it winds up as a dreadfully skewed introduction to what he was good at , for reasons which are to do with his peculiar strengths and weaknesses .
It contains extracts from five novels : The Man in the High Castle ( 1962 ) , The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch ( 1965 ) , Ubik ( 1969 ) , A Scanner Darkly ( 1977 ) , and VALIS ( 1981 )  in all cases , one or both of the first two chapters .
There are also three stories , " The Days of Perky Pat " ( 1963 ) , " A Little Something for Us Temponauts " ( 1974 ) , and " I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon " ( 1980 ) , and two pieces of non-fiction , " The Lucky Dog Pet Store " ( 1979 ) and " The Zebra Paper " ( 1977 ) .
Looking at that list , the question you wind up asking is : if you 're going to use extracts from Dick 's novels , why only pick the first couple of chapters ?
The answer , I think , is that you 're constrained to do so by the cumulative way he writes .
He 's extraordinarily good at establishing character and situation but once he 's done so does n't bother to recap that X is married to Y or lives in Z's basement .
So anything other than early chapters would leave you floundering without context .
But Dick is also an architectural writer , one whose most characteristic effects are long - term .
In order to warp reality , as he does , you have to have a settled reality quite well - established .
So reading the extracts from The Man in the High Castle is like watching a grandmaster play a standard chess opening , drumming his fingers and waiting to get to the good stuff in the middle game .
We 're introduced to Robert Childan , dealer in American cultural artefacts in an alternate world where Japan and Germany won World War II .
Childan lives in San Francisco , running a business selling American artefacts to the Japanese conquerors .
One 's first reaction to meeting him is how well and how often Dick conveys the sense of failure .
Childan has failed to obtain for a client , Mr. Tagomi , a much - desired Civil War recruiting poster .
When it does n't turn up , Childan has to grovel to Tagomi .
But then we follow Tagomi to his home where he also reflects on the failure to obtain the gift  intended for a visiting dignitary .
Both Childan and Tagomi , it turns out , use the Chinese oracle , the I Ching , to make sense of their lives .
Both of them are acutely conscious of where they sit in society and how vulnerable their positions are .
Even though almost the first scene of the book is a confrontation between them , Dick extends his sympathy to both of them  as he does , in due course , to the dignitary Tagomi wanted to impress .
So a situation which , in the hands of another author , could be merely a vehicle for expressing irony that both Childan and Tagomi are bound to the same wheel without knowing it , becomes something else : a humane , broad view of a society .
This pattern  being introduced to a small group of characters , their setting , and the common intellectual structure they use to make sense of it  is repeated in many of Dick 's other works .
Unfortunately , not many of the novel extracts in Vintage PKD get much beyond that .
As I said , it 's what Dick does next that 's most characteristic .
In the case of The Man in the High Castle , as more characters are introduced , we move towards a questioning how this world got to be the way it is , and how real it might be  especially for Tagomi .
The central element here is The Grasshopper Lies Heavy , a novel written in Dick 's world by one Hawthorne Abendsen , depicting a history where the Nazis and Japanese lost World War II .
Crucially , Grasshopper 's alternate history is not our own .
Had it been  and in many respects that 's the obvious choice to take 
Dick 's novel would have ended up as just a meta- fiction that safely located our reality as the " right " one .
But instead , Abendsen 's samizdat book describes a world where America 's post - war attention is on Asia , not Europe : a kind of Marshall Aid programme has converted much of the Pacific Rim to American consumer capitalism .
Through this example , " in the USA the colour problem had by 1950 been solved . "
The action of the book heads towards a confrontation between Juliana Frink , one of the characters who has read Grasshopper , and Abendsen himself , in his redoubt in Wyoming .
There is a devastating final scene where Abendsen reveals that his choices in writing the book were dictated by the I Ching  that , in effect , the oracle wrote the book .
Juliana and Abendsen ask the I Ching why it did so , and receive a very clear hexagram in response :
" It 's Chung Fu , " Juliana said .
" Inner Truth .
I know without using the chart , too .
And I know what it means . "
Raising his head , Hawthorne scrutinized her .
He had now an almost savage expression .
" It means , does it , that my book is true ? "
" Yes , " she said .
With anger he said , " Germany and Japan lost the war ? "
" Yes . "
Hawthorne , then , closed the two volumes and rose to his feet ; he said nothing .
" Even you do n't face it , " Juliana said .
So Juliana and Abendsen must face the idea that their reality is somehow fake  as Childan had to earlier in the novel when presented with the accusation that he was selling forgeries rather than authentic antiques .
But if the I Ching is telling the truth , then our reality is no more secure than Juliana 's , because it is not that depicted in Grasshopper .
We are refused the consolation of being told that we live in the " right " world and are reading a story which is a mere counterfactual guess .
It 's all guesses , Dick seems to be saying .
Rereading it now , many decades further from the horrors of Nazism , The Man in the High Castle makes a couple of striking impressions .
Firstly , Dick 's sense of how people and culture interact is extraordinarily nuanced .
Secondly , he is willing to tell his story in prose almost entirely without pyrotechnics  neither the deliberately beautiful sentences which the mainstream prizes or the fireworks of , say , a Bester or a Sturgeon .
Thirdly , that approach is very appropriate to his subject : ordinary people who will never walk the corridors of power , living quiet and often unsuccessful lives .
All of these were a long way from the concerns of SF at the time , and it 's easy to see how Dick came to be so unrewarded in his lifetime .
Perhaps because we 're too far from World War II  not only I , but my parents were born after it ended  the book does n't have quite the charge of strangeness which it must have had when it was published .
But there are plenty of other Dick novels one can go to for that .
Not represented in the Vintage PKD is Time Out of Joint ( 1959 ) , Dick 's first great novel and the single volume I would press into the hands of someone unacquainted with his work .
Its initial premise is innocuous enough : Ragle Gumm lives a quiet suburban life , devotedly filling in a newspaper competition every day to " Find the Little Green Man " .
Only slowly does it become apparent that Gumm 's world is an illusion created to have him at the heart of it .
The revelation of the illusion 's nature is somewhat pulpish and generic , but the scenes of paranoia that lead to it are not .
Many people suspect , at times , that the world is arranging things for their benefit or the opposite .
What would happen if you started to see evidence that suggested this was the objective reality ?
Would you be going crazy ?
Should you follow the evidence or ignore it ?
Dick knows , far too intimately for comfort , what it would feel like to ask these questions .
The abyss , in other words , is always present in his work : the abyss of mental illness and , at the same time , epistemological insecurity .
Truth is occluded and unstable , but his characters are bound to pursue it in some flawed way .
Time
Out of Joint disappoints only when it starts providing answers : madness is being stuck in the maze and knowing that your failure to find answers is your own weakness made manifest .
( It 's in this sense that the movie The Truman Show ( 1998 ) , playing with a similar scenario to Time Out of Joint , made the right structural decision : as soon as its protagonist stepped out of his virtual world to the real one , the film ended . )
But it also makes clear Dick 's greatest strength apart from his humanity and skill in characterisation : his ability to embed in fiction the largest philosophical issues .
Moreover , he managed to do so in a way that poses questions for the reader .
How would you react in this situation ?
Is Gumm going crazy when , famously , he sees a soft - drink stand evanesce to be replaced by a slip of paper saying SOFT - DRINK STAND ?
He generalises his concerns , even when he 's describing them in very specific ways : and for that reason his books , even with their cartoonish genre trappings , feel remarkably undated .
Time
Out of Joint is one of about a dozen Dick novels reprinted in the Millennium ( later Gollancz ) SF Masterworks series in the UK .
Even though they 've lately taken to filling the series with less - good PKD ( The Simulacra , The Penultimate Truth , Now Wait for Last Year ) , they 've also got most of the good ones too .
None of these ranks higher , for me , than The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch , the drug - centred novel whose premises were also explored in " The Days of Perky Pat " .
( The Vintage PKD 's decision to include both the story and the opening of the novel is , therefore , baffling duplication . )
In this novel , the 21st century is so dire that the population  and especially Mars colonists  live out a vicarious existence through miniature " layouts " of the world and the drug Can - D which allows a shared experience through the layouts .
The action of the book concerns Palmer Eldritch , injured in a crash in the Proxima system and now returning home with a new drug , Chew - Z. Chew - Z is more powerful than Can - D , more addictive , and  crucially  solipsistic .
The illusory world it creates is that of the inside of the skull , controlled by Eldritch .
Many of the props of the novel seem dated or arbitrary : the truffle - skin money , for instance , or the glaciers whose advance is measured in Grables .
But the figure of Eldritch is uniquely terrifying :
Of course the pics were ten years out of date , but this was still the man .
Gray and bony , well over six feet tall , with swinging arms and a peculiarly rapid gait .
And his face .
It had a ravaged quality , eaten away ; as if , Barney conjectured , the fat - layer had been consumed , as if Eldritch at some time or other had fed off himself , devoured perhaps with gusto the superfluous portions of his own body .
Dick was never an elaborate prose stylist : his journalistic directness , I 'd suggest , is one of the good lessons he learned in his pulp apprenticeship .
But " with gusto " is a truly brilliant stroke .
It suggests that Eldritch has wanted nothing in his life but to approach this point where , dehumanised , he controls humans ' dreams .
Stigmata is , then , not just a novel about the costs of leaving behind consensus reality for an imagined or wished - for one ; it 's also about the terror of other realities not being one 's own .
The difficulty in parsing Stigmata , in saying what 's " real " and what is n't , gives it a nightmarish flavour distinctive even in Dick 's haunted work .
A Scanner Darkly , published nearly fifteen years later , returns to the subject of drugs and addiction .
One 's first impression of this book is how much more obviously personal it is : its setting is Dick 's home patch of California , and there 's a heartbreaking Author 's Note at the end listing a dozen of his friends dead or crippled through drug use .
( As he says , " This has been a novel about some people who were punished entirely too much for what they did . " )
In the novel Bob Arctor , undercover cop , is assigned to track down those using the deadly Substance D ; but Arctor - the - cop and Arctor - the - fake - addict both discover the savage costs it has .
Early on in the book , he reflects that he had once had a " normal " life : a wife , children , " a stable household that got swept and cleaned and emptied out daily . "
Something snapped at some point , though , and he " entered , by degrees , a new and somber life , lacking all that . "
One senses that Dick , too , sees another version of himself far off , living a " normal " life .
The title , with its reference to 1 Corinthians 13 , hints at another strand in Dick 's work : his desire to patch his philosophical obsessions ever more prominently into his fiction .
Particular favourites were the New Testament , the Pre-Socratics , Plato , and Gnostic thought .
The miracle is that the novels do n't feel particularly lumpy or didactic as a result .
Dick the fiction - writer always managed to impose some kind of aesthetic order on his works , and in any case there are plenty of other obsessions swimming round in them too .
Bob Arctor 's relationship with the young addict Donna in A Scanner Darkly can stand as representative of all the older - man - younger - woman dynamics in his work .
Whether or not there is an alternate - world PKD , living a normal life and reaching a great old age , in this world there 's no such mutability .
By the time of Valis ( an acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligence System ) all his cards are on the table .
The protagonist , Horselover Fat , is a transparent PKD - surrogate , and his revelations tally with those that the author reported in , for instance , the Vintage PKD 's non-fiction .
Reading Valis now , one 's first impression is not particularly of the intricate metaphysical structure built up in Fat 's " Exegesis " , but of the fight to remain sane .
Fat has spent time in mental hospitals  there 's a hilarious riff about how patients there game the system and try to manipulate none - too - smart - nurses and the drug regimen  and he clearly has a sense of how great an abyss madness would be .
The book too , one senses , teeters on the edge of falling apart .
It both believes in VALIS 's revelations and somehow manages to stand outside them .
Even with the fictionalising devices
Dick uses , it reads as a devastatingly honest book , reviewing his past life and work unsparingly .
At times , reading Valis felt almost voyeuristic in its intimacy .
The counterculture Dick describes has gone its own way , to be replaced by other countercultures , and to be told about how it felt in such detail is like reading a postcard from Atlantis .
So Dick 's body of work is one of those that tries to make sense of the life because , rather than despite of , the author 's intentions .
His pulp - SF origins are sometimes evident in his choice of props and scenery .
But in a curious way , that does n't matter : it emphasises the unreality of what he describes and makes it easier to believe when the world starts to shimmer and vanish .
As I 've said , although I think many of his novels would be a better introduction to Dick 's work than the Vintage PKD , " The Lucky Dog Pet Store " is a very smart selection .
It 's an autobiographical piece covering a lot of ground in a short space , and would certainly help the novice reader to fit the life and the work together .
But there are at least as many fine PKD novels which I have n't had chance to discuss here : Dr. Bloodmoney ; Martian Time - Slip ; Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ; Flow My Tears , The Policeman Said ; The Divine Invasion .
You have to get used to his obsessions , to be sure , and the more first - person he gets , the more his work feels like a historical evocation .
But even if you can't follow all the contours of thought in a work like Valis 
I know I can't  you feel you know the person who is talking to you .
You sense his courage and fragility , and you wish you could hear more .

The Brain Works Constantly on Hidden , System - Tray Tasks ...
Our cognitive processes keep working at a furious pace even when there is no visual stimuli .
The implications for cognitive treatment , education , and entertainment could be staggering .
Researchers at the University of Rochester have found in reality that 80 percent of our cognitive power is cranking away on tasks completely unknown to us .
Curiously , this clandestine activity does not exist in the youngest brains , leading scientists to assert that the mysterious functions that absorb the majority of our mindpower are dedicated to subconscious reprocessing our initial thoughts and experiences .
The research , which has possible profound implications for our understanding of reality , appeared in a recent issue of the journal Nature .
" We found neural activity that frankly surprised us , " says Michael Weliky , associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester .
“ Adult ferrets had neural patterns in their visual cortex that correlated very well with images they viewed , but that correlation did n't exist at all in very young ferrets , suggesting the very basis of comprehending vision may be a very different task for young brains versus old brains .
” A second surprise was in store for Weliky .
Placing the ferrets in a darkened room revealed that older ferrets ' brains were still humming along at 80 percent as if they were processing visual information .
Since this activity was absent in the youngsters , Weliky and his colleagues were left to wonder :
What is the visual cortex so busy processing when there 's no image to process ?
Initially , Weliky 's research was aimed at studying whether visual processing bore any resemblance to the way real - world images appear .
This finding may help lead to a better understanding of how neurons decode our world and how our perception of reality is shaped .
Weliky , in a bit of irony , set 12 ferrets watching the reality - stretching film The Matrix .
He recorded how their brains responded to the film , as well as to a null pattern like enlarged television static , and a darkened room .
Movies capture the visual elements that are present in the real world .
For instance , as Keanu 's hand moves across the screen for a karate chop , the image of the hand and all the lines and color it represents moves across a viewer 's visual realm essentially the same way it would in real life .
By contrast , the enlarged static - blocks of random black and white - has no such motion .
Weliky was able to graph the movie - motion statistically , showing essentially how objects move in the visual field .
The test was then to see if there was any relationship between the statistical motion of the movie and the way visual neurons in the ferrets fired .
Each visual neuron is keyed to respond to certain visual elements , such as a vertical line , that appears in a specific area of the ferret 's vision .
A great number of these cells combine to process an image of many lines , colors , etc .
By watching the patterns of how these cells fired while watching The Matrix , Weliky could describe the pattern statistically , and match those statistics of how the ferret responded to the film with the statistics of the actual visual aspects of the film .
Weliky found two surprises .
First , while the neurons of adult ferrets statistically seemed to respond similarly to the statistics of the film itself , younger ferrets had almost no relationship .
This suggests that though the young ferrets are taking in and processing visual stimuli , they 're not processing the stimuli in a way that reflects reality .
"
You might think of this as a sort of dyslexia , " explains Weliky .
" It may be that in very young brains , the processing takes place in a way that 's not necessarily disordered , but not analogous to how we understand reality to be .
It 's thought that dyslexia works somewhat like this - that some parts of the brain process written words in an unusual way and seem to make beginnings of words appear at their ends and vice versa .
Infant brains may see the entire world the same way , as a mass of disparate scenes and sounds . "
Weliky is quick to point out that whatever way infant brains may interpret the world , just because they 're different from an adult pattern of perception does not mean the infants have the wrong perception .
After all , an adult interpreted the visual aspects of the film with our adult brains , so it should n't be such a surprise that other adult brains simply interpret the visual aspects the same way .
If an infant drew up the statistics , it might very well match the neural patterns of other infants .
The second , and more surprising , result of the study came directly from the fact that Weliky 's research is among the first to test these visual neurons while the subject is awake and watching something .
In the past , researchers would perhaps shine a light at an unconscious ferret and note which areas of the brain responded , but while that method narrowed the focus to how a single cell responds , it eliminated the chance to understand how the neural network of a conscious animal would respond .
Accepting all the neural traffic of a conscious brain as part of the equation let Weliky get a better idea of the actual processing going on .
As it turned out , one of his control tests yielded insight into neural activity no one expected .
When the ferrets were in a darkened room , Weliky expected their visual neurons to lack any kind of activity that correlated with visual reality .
Neurologists have long known that there is substantial activity in the brain , even in darkness , but the pattern of that activity had n't been investigated .
Weliky discovered that while young ferrets displayed almost no patterns that correlated with visual reality , the adult ferrets ' brains were humming along , producing the patterns even though there was nothing to see .
When watching the film , the adult ferrets ' neurons increased their patterned activity by about 20 percent .
" This means that in adults , there is a tremendous amount of real - world processing going on - 80 percent - when there is nothing to process , " says Weliky .
" We think that if you 've got your eyes closed , your visual processing is pretty much at zero , and that when you open them , you 're running at 100 percent .
This suggests that with your eyes closed , your visual processing is already running at 80 percent , and that opening your eyes only adds the last 20 percent .
The big question here is what is the brain doing when it 's idling , because it 's obviously doing something important .
" Since the young ferrets do not display similar patterns , the ' idling ' is n't necessary for life or consciousness , but since it 's present in the adults even without stimulus , Weliky suggests it may be what gives subjects an understanding of reality .
The eye takes in an image and the brain processes the image , but 80 percent of the activity may be a representation of the world replicated inside the ferret 's brain .
"
The basic findings are exciting enough , but you can't help but speculate on what they might mean in a deeper context , " says Weliky .
" It 's one thing to say a ferret 's understanding of reality is being reproduced inside his brain , but there 's nothing to say that our understanding of the world is accurate .
In a way , our neural structure imposes a certain rubric on the outside world , and all we know is that at least one other mammalian brain seems to impose the same structure .
Either that or The Matrix freaked out the ferrets the way it did everyone else .

Let 's take a closer look at the prospectivity , geology , economics , technology , reservoirs , hydrocarbons and logistics of the Lower Tertiary play in the Gulf of Mexico ( henceforth the ) .
Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts world oil and natural gas liquids capacity could increase as much as 25 % by 2015 .
Says Robert W. Esser , a director of CERA : " Peak Oil theory is garbage as far as we 're concerned . "
With the successful test drilling of Jack - 2 in the ultra deepwater Gulf of Mexico , there has been a media blitz proclaiming the good news .
The " peak oil " theory is under attack .
From Business Week 's September 7 , 2006 article Plenty of Oil-- Just Drill Deeper
The discovery of reserves in the Gulf of Mexico means supply is n't topping out , we learn
Fellow TOD contributor Bubba is co-author of this report .
He is an industry insider .
It seemed important for those of us concerned about peak oil to respond to the Jack - 2 test well result and all the publicity it has spawned .
I also had conversations about this piece with Byron King at Whiskey And Gunpowder .
Byron writes frequently about peak oil issues .
I take full responsibility for this post 's contents since I did the final editing .
More than a half a dozen world records for test equipment pressure , depth , and duration in deepwater were set during the Jack well test .
For example , the perforating guns were fired at world record depths and pressures .
Additionally , the test tree and other drill stem test tools set world records , helping Chevron and co-owners conduct the deepest extended drill stem test in deepwater Gulf of Mexico history .
Summary of Findings
Large estimated recoverable reserves ( EUR ) numbers have been quoted in the business and popular pressanywhere from 3 to 15 billion barrels ( Gb ) .
Many of these articles have given the public the misperception that all of these billions of barrels were demonstrated by and will shortly flow from the Jack discovery alone .
This report is meant to enlighten TOD readers on the true significance of the Jack discovery , the Lower Tertiary play in general , and what can truly be expected from it .
The LTGOM play consists of a number of fields as shown in Figure 1 below .
All of these fields have a EUR in the 350 million to 500 million - barrel range according to Rigzone and other unpublished sources .
The production capacity of the various fields and the types of fluid they can deliver vary considerably .
Aside from their great depth , the reservoirs and fluids present many challenges .
Some of these fields will get produced , others will not .
It is important for everyone to understand that the large EUR numbers quoted do not apply to any one field but rather represent the entire Lower Tertiary region .
The Jack - 2 well test indicated a flow of 6000 barrels per day .
This one data point encourages further appraisal but does not guarantee flow rates that will justify the massive ( billions of dollars ) investment required to put the LTGOM into full - scale production .
Whether the economics of commercial exploitation is favorable for the various fields remains an open question .
into full - scale production .
Whether the economics of commercial exploitation is favorable for the various fields remains an open question .
Implementing development plans , where they exist , for these fields pushes the limits of deepwater technology .
A myriad of questions exist about completion and production of the wells .
Unanswered logistical concerns include securing rigs , transporting produced oil to market and what to do with associated natural gas .
Realistically , initial production of some fields ( eg. Great White and Cascade ) may happen by 2009 or 2010 at the earliest .
The other fields that do get developed , including Jack , will likely not achieve first production before the 2012 to 2014 period .
Delays are likely given that many technical problems are being solved for the first time .
Under most forecasted scenarios , production from the LTGOM will likely only offset declines in US production that will have occurred by then .
In comments relating the Great White field [ Marvin ] Odum [ Shell 's executive vice president of exploration and production in the Americas ] said : [ Marvin ] Odum [ Shell 's executive vice president of exploration and production in the Americas ] said while the Gulf of Mexico will remain a key producing region of the world 's biggest energy consumer , it was unclear if new discoveries could counter decline rates at existing fields .
" It 's going to continue to be very important from a total output standpoint , whether there is real growth potential meaning to grow above volumes we have today or if it is just replacement volumes , " the Shell official said .
There is no doubt that the successful Jack - 2 test well is a technological achievement as Chevron 's September 5 press release announces .
This well test set many deepwater drilling records .
More importantly , it demonstrated that these reservoirs are capable of producing at rates that are potentially economic .
But in the end , what did Jack - 2 prove and what how significant is it relative to the future of exploration and production in the Lower Tertiary of the Gulf of Mexico ?
What has been missing is a realistic appraisal of the discovery that goes beyond the public hyperbole .
Sections below describe theplay in some depth .
For those who want to skip the details , here is a summary of our conclusions .
I return to this last point in the final section .
The other findings are discussed in more detail below .
Prospectivity
The Wilcox stratigraphic section has long been recognized as an important petroleum resource in Southeast Texas to Southwestern Louisiana , producing primarily gas from fluvial , deltaic and shallow marine sandstone reservoirs since the 1930s .
The total estimated ultimate recovery for the onshore Wilcox is 24 Tcf gas or 4 BBoe .
Not until the drilling of the BAHA 2 well in March 2001 , was the linked depositional system of the Wilcox from shelf fluvial deltaics to basin deepwater turbidites , a distance greater than 250 mi ( 403 km ) , tested by the drill bit .
Although this wildcat , drilled in 7,790 ft ( 2,375 m ) of water in the Alaminos Canyon area of the Northwest GoM was noncommercial , it established a working petroleum system in the Perdido Fold Belt ( PFB ) , Fig. 1 . The soon - to - follow nearby discoveries , Trident in July 2001 and Great White in June 2002 , proved the significant hydrocarbon potential of the PFB by documenting oil accumulations in a variety of turbidite deposits from sheet sands to amalgamated and leveed channel systems .

Going back to May of 2005 , Emergence of the Lower Tertiary Wilcox trend in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico provides a window on the geology of the area .
As Figure 1 indicates , the LTGOM play contains a number of fields .
Not shown is the Anadarko's Kaskida in the Keathley Canyon areasee Oil discovered at Kaskida prospect from the Houston Business Journal , August 31 , 2006 .
From the World Oil paper cited above :
More than 12 Bbbl of oil in place have been discovered to date [ May , 2005 ] .
Potential recoverable reserves per discovery range from 30 to 400 MMboe , with a 69 % success rate , i.e. , 9/13 [ 4 dry holes ] .
Trend - potential ranges from 3 to 15 Bbbl of recoverable oil .
The Geology , Reservoirs and Fluids
So , you can readily see the origin of the EUR numbers thrown around in the press .
The reserves estimate applies to the entire Lower Tertiary play , not just to the Jack discovery as has been implied by press reports .
More on this below .
It is always a useful exercise when evaluating hyped new discoveries to ask a simple question :
In the case of the Jack - 2 test , no news source has addressed the characteristics of the Jack - 2 reservoir and what kind of oil flowed from the well at a rate of 6000 barrels per day .
The LTGOM play contains oil of highly variable quality .
Some of it is high gravity condensate ( 40 + ° API )
Some of the oil is low gravity , highly viscous sour crude with upwards of 4 % sulfur content .
Generally speaking , the oil in the western fields ( Great White etc. ) is better than the eastern fields ( Chinook , Stones , Cascade ) .
play contains oil of highly variable quality .
Some of it is high gravity condensate ( 40 + ° API )
Some of the oil is low gravity , highly viscous sour crude with upwards of 4 % sulfur content .
Generally speaking , the oil in the western fields ( Great White etc. ) is better than the eastern fields ( Chinook , Stones , Cascade ) .
Given their great depth , many of these reservoirs are at very high pressure , about 20,000 psi .
Thermal cracking of immature oil into lighter fractions is incomplete in some fields , indicating that the oil was formed only a short ( geological ) time ago and has not migrated far .
As for associated gas , the Gas - to - Oil Ration ( GOR ) is low .
However , some gas will be produced .
Most of the oil - bearing reservoirs are low - permeability very - fine - grained turbidite sandstones .
Some are so fine - grained that they are almost siltstones .
These reservoirs , due to their deep burial depths , are also well lithified , and will be challenged to flow their oil at the necessary rates to pay out the required investments .
That was the main reason for the Jack 2 well test - to prove that oil could be produced at sufficiently - high rates to warrant further development work .
Thus , the fields are not uniform across the LTGOM region .
Moreover , four appraisal wells have been dry holes .
Although the Great White reservoir ( link above ) in the western part of the LTGOM contains light , sweet crude , even now Shell has not committed to its development .
Shell Exploration and Production Co. expects to make an investment decision on a potentially large deepwater oil and natural gas field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico this year , a company official said .
The Great White field could eventually pump 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas and crude for the U.S. market , according to figures from Shell ....
The Economics and Technology
Key technical challenges for trend commerciality are : 1 ) reservoir quality and flow capability ; 2 ) drilling and completion technology ; and 3 ) development of infrastructure .
Continued discoveries in the trend and successful flow tests planned in early 2006 could very well transform the Lower Tertiary Wilcox into a world - class petroleum system in the deepwater GoM.
Several inherent technical challenges need to be addressed to ensure economic feasibility of the Lower Tertiary Wilcox trend .
These range from the cost - effective drilling of complex salt canopies and evaluating deep structural targets to the completion and production of reservoirs in water depths that have not occurred to date .
Understanding the oil chemistry , reservoir quality and associated flow capability will determine the drilling / completion technology , and ultimately the creation of infrastructure needed to transform the Lower Tertiary Wilcox into a world - class petroleum system in the deepwater GoM .
Devon 's Cascade project , scheduled for startup in 2009 , is poised to become the first deepwater lower tertiary discovery to come on line , he [ Hadden ] said .
But first , the results of Jack 's test must be used generate designs for wells and facilities .
Lower tertiary wells may cost between $ 80 million and $ 120 million each , while producing facilities may cost between $ 600 million and $ 1.5 billion .
Pioneering is n't cheap .
Steel and skilled labor rates are going through the roof , as are rental rates for state - of - the - art offshore rigs .
BP ( BP ) , for example , will be paying $ 520,000 per day starting late next year for the same rig it is now getting for $ 190,000 per day .
That 's because these fancy rigs , which house 200 people and rise 415 feet into the air , are in short supply with drilling picking up .
Still , energy experts believe that producing oil from ultra - deep wells can be profitable as long as oil , selling for $ 67 per barrel today , stays at or above $ 40 to $ 45 .
Other Logistical Challenges
... Distance from U.S. shores is also a major issue for producers , as there are no pipelines in place to carry hydrocarbons back onshore , said Zoe Sunderland , an analyst with Edinburgh - based consultancy Wood Mackenzie .
" It 's just so far from anything , " Sunderland said .
Operators are considering using floating production , storage and offloading vessels instead of pipes .
But any natural gas produced from the wells would n't be able to be transported that way and may have to be reinjected into the reservoir or released into the atmosphere via flaring .
Reserves and Timing of Production Flows
One huge oil reserve , even if it could rival the 1968 discovery of Prudhoe Bay and increase U.S. reserves by up to 50 % , will not turn around the world 's tight energy markets , of course .
It wo n't even bring the U.S. close to energy independence when oil and gas get into full - fledged production four or five years from now .
But the capability to find and recover petroleum at extreme depths , temperatures , and pressures , as demonstrated by the Chevron team , may indeed tip the balance of supply and demand in the long term .
There will be a new frenzy of drilling at these depths in the Gulf of Mexico , where about a dozen promising exploration wells have already been drilled .
...
Earlier drilling had established promising reserves in an area of the Gulf 300 miles long and 80 miles wide , but the Chevron project found a flow rate of more than 6,000 bbl .
a day of light , sweet crude .
The discovery confirmed the area 's commercial viability , strengthening hopes that as much as 15 billion barrels of oil could be recovered in the vicinity .
The St Malo , Jack and Kaskida fields are also promising .
According to Business
Week , the Jack - 2 test flowed light , sweet crude .
However , the low permeability and high viscosity of the heavy , sour crude in some of the other fields Stones , Das Bump , Cascade and Chinook present well flow rate challenges , especially at such great depths .
Assuming commercial oil discoveries , the economics of producing thedepends on many factors and can not be divorced from technology concerns .
The Jack - 2 test well contributed to understanding " the oil chemistry , reservoir quality and associated flow capability " for that particular field .
The " cost - effective drilling of complex salt canopies and evaluating deep structural targets to the completion and production of reservoirs in water depths that have not occurred to date " presents a different set of problems as do the related well costs .
Schlumberger 's Chevron Oil Test Raises Gulf Deepwater Profile provides some details .
The article relates some remarks Stephen Hadden , Devon 's senior exploration and production vice president , made during a conference call with investors .
The start - up costs are very high and likely will be subject to inflation down the road , given the rising capital commodity costs of almost everything .
Concerning marginal costs , a reasonable guess is that it is likely that unit technical costs will be $ 20 to $ 50 per barrel .
At $ 20 / bbl these projects will fly economically .
At $ 30 and up , they will struggle to attract investment capital .
It will all depend primarily on the well rates , per well EURs , and well costs , including completion & production .
The higher the rates and EUR , the fewer wells that will be needed to drain the reservoirs .
From Just Dig Deeper ( cited at the very top ) , we learn that All this gives us some rough idea of where the profit margin lies .
Transportation infrastructure and associated natural gas present two crucial , related issues for producing thefields .
Schlumberger tells us that
The report goes on to say that the Mineral Management Service , from whom the operating companies lease these deepwater blocks , " frowns on gas flaring " .
Problems will mount if a lot of natural gas is produced .
This may not be an issue , however , given the low GOR in these reservoirs based on current knowledge .
Back to the hype .
The reader should now be a position to properly evaluate these statements from Business Week .
Let 's take the italicized statements one at a time .
First , the 15 billion barrels must be taken with a grain of salt .
The low - end estimate of 3 billion barrels defines the actual range , reflecting the large degree of uncertainty in the LTGOM trend 's EUR .
Phrasing like " as much as 15 billion barrels " leads the reader to believe the high - end estimate .
Devon Energy 's Stephen J. Hadden , senior vice president of exploration and production states :
" With 273 blocks under lease and 19 exploratory prospects already identified , Devon 's lower Tertiary position could more than double our current reserve base of about two billion equivalent barrels in the coming years . "
Devon has a 25 % share in Jack , Kaskida and St Malo .
They also have a 50 % share in Cascade .
It is hard to see how Devon could double its current 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent reserves if the total EUR is anywhere close to the low - end of acknowledged range for the whole Lower Tertiary region .
Nonetheless , to recover 15 Gb of oil , one would need to drain an accumulaton covering 177,000 acres .
This is equivalent to 276 square miles or 31 contiguous Gulf of Mexico lease blocks .
Jack itself covers only two outer continental shelf blocks ( Walker Ridge # 758 and # 759 ) or 18 square miles .
The Jack - 2 well ( in # 758 ) only tested 40 % of the total net pay there according to Chevron 's press release .
Devon states that " the [ original ]
Jack discovery on Walker Ridge block 759 was drilled in 2004 .
The discovery well encountered more than 350 net feet of pay .
The Jack # 2 well was drilled to delineate the discovery . "
The new well test represents one more piece of the puzzle , albeit an important one .
Also look back at the Rigzone article cited in the Quick Summary above .
Second , what of Business Week 's assertion that the LTGOM will " get into full - fledged production four or five years from now . "
Given all the factors covered above , this is a dubious statement .
The Bloomberg update Chevron Well Tests New Gulf of Mexico Oil Deposit states :
The partners [ Devon , Statoil & Chevron ] plan to drill another appraisal well at the site in the Walker Ridge Block in 2007 .
A decision whether to develop Jack may be made in 2007 or 2008 , Statoil 's Mellbye said .
The [ Jack ] field would start production in 2013 if development goes ahead , he said ...
Furthermore , Devon Energy " expects to drill one to three exploratory wells from this inventory [ 19 exploratory Devon prospects ] in each of the next several years . "
None of this sounds much like " full - fledged production " four or five years from now .
Assuming there are no serious delays , what production can we expect in the 2013 ?
Here is Schlumberger 's analysis .
The flow test , the first in the lower tertiary , indicates that the region 's finds " will be most likely productive , " said David Heikkinen , an analyst with Houston - based energy research firm Pickering Energy Partners .
" That bodes very well for the industry as a whole . "
Production from the [ presumably , the entire Lower Tertiary ] area could add 300,000 to 500,000 barrels of oil a day to U.S. output , Heikkinen said .
The Gulf currently has a production capacity of about 1.5 million .
It is hard to imagine given all the considerations mentioned here that the Jack discovery alone could produce 3 to 5 hundred thousand barrels per day .
Finally , let 's consider Business Week 's statement that new ultra - deepwater production " may indeed tip the balance of supply and demand in the long term . "
In order to evaluate this issue , it is necessary to look at the larger supply issues .
The Big Picture
The Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , Gulf of Mexico Region , released new oil and gas daily production rate projections that encompass the year 2006 .
According to the new report , Daily Oil and Gas Production Rate Projections From 2002 Through 2006 , Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf , MMS is forecasting a daily oil production rate of between 2.00 and 2.47 million barrels by the end of 2006 ....
These represent high case and low case estimates .
MMS Director Johnnie Burton called the new projections " a healthy , sizeable increase in the range of possible oil production .
Should the high case estimates be reached in 2006 , we will see a 160 - percent increase in oil production from the Gulf in the period 1995 - 2006 . "
On July 22 , 2002 , a press release MMS : Oil Production Offshore GOM to Rise Steeply stated thatCurrent Gulf of Mexico OCS production is approximately 1.5 / mbd , down 25 % from the MMS " low case " estimate of 2.0 / mbd for 2006 .
It has yet to fully recover from the 2005 hurricanes .
BP's Thunderhorse platform is still not operating and delayed until sometime in 2007 at current estimates .
Did we fail to mention that the Lower Tertiary deepwater play in the Gulf of Mexico is prone to hurricanes ?
The problem is bigger than that .
US petroleum production averaged 5.093 / mbd in the first 7 months of 2006 .
Assuming a generous future decline rate of about 5 % for the US as a whole , production will be 4.149 / mbd in 2010 , a net decline of 0.944/ mbd .
Future production from the LTGOM might be 0.500 / mbd sometime after that .
If we add production from fields like Chevron 's Tahiti , which is expected " to have a maximum daily production of 125,000 barrels " , then it is reasonable to expect that Gulf of Mexico production will be a wash declines will be offset six to eight years from now in the best case .
Business
Week 's assertion that really , really ultra - deepwater production from offshore regions like the LTGOM will " tip the balance of supply and demand in the long term " globally is unwarranted speculation .
Believing that statement requires a large leap of faith and depends on many complex factors e.g. possible declines in the world 's old elephant fields like Ghawar , existing declines in fields like Cantarell , the feasibility of commercial development in similar deepwater areas in other regions like West Africa 's Gulf of Guinea , etc .
The current " peak oil " bashing going on in the media is more an indication of underlying concerns about the long term supply situation , not a refutation of peak oil theories .
Those concerned about global oil depletion have never said that the world is running out of oil in the near - term or denied that advanced technology can increase recoverable reserves .
Regarding the big picture , one important question revolves around how people interpret these reserves estimates .
Typically , there is a knee - jerk response that greets any large discovery because many , even some who should know better , believe that reserves and production flows are somehow equivalent .
That is not the case .
Another important question revolves around the use of extreme production measures in " final frontier " areas like the Walker Ridge deepwater .
Rather than indicating continued abundance in oil supply , such measures may be viewed more accurately as indicating the great lengths oil producers must go to in order to find more oil to meet the world 's insatiable demand .
The " low - hanging fruit " is gone and so is the era of the cheap oil .
Ultimately , this is the meaning of the Jack - 2 test well and hopes for production from the Lower Tertiary of the Gulf of Mexico .

Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates displayed the timing of a percussionist suffering from the DTs when he called for more US education funding in an editorial for the Washington Post .
In the piece published Sunday , Gates celebrated San Diego 's High Tech High as an example for educators trying to improve the state of US schools .
The Microsoft founder 's fondness for the school is understandable given that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pumped money into the project meant to supply youngsters with a technology - laced liberal arts education .
But just before the Gates editorial appeared , word broke that one of the hi-tech schools in the heart of Silicon Valley will be shut down because of a lack of funding and students .
The board of directors behind the High Tech High in Redwood City – the home of Oracle – last week voted unanimously to mothball the school less than two years after it opened .
Parents and students broke down in tears during a meeting about the school , saying they were promised a five - year commitment to keep the project going .
Gates never mentioned this closure in his well - intentioned piece .
" Companies must advocate for strong education policies and work with schools to foster interest in science and mathematics and to provide an education that is relevant to the needs of business , " Gates wrote Government must work with educators to reform schools and improve educational excellence . "
Much of BillG 's editorial focused on the US 's need to create an engineering savvy , innovative workforce .
And , rather tellingly , Gates pointed to the US inventions such as the transistor , integrated circuit and microprocessor – not software – as examples of where this country has done well in the past .
" The most important factor is our workforce , " he wrote .
" Scientists and engineers trained in U.S. universities - the world 's best - have pioneered key technologies such as the microprocessor , creating industries and generating millions of high - paying jobs . "
That 's a funny remark coming from a man who once chastised Intel co-founder Gordon Moore during a tirade saying , " You make the sand .
I will do the software . "
Ribbing aside , Gates should be commended for keeping the US education woes in the press and for working to do something about the problem .
You can expect to read more pieces like the last since Melinda Gates in on the board of the Washington Post . ®
Does Agile imply no design ?
Can the architecture evolve from doing the simplest thing possible ?
Is up front design good or bad ?
These questions , it seems , are still very controversial in the agile community .
At the Architect Insight Conference in Newport yesterday , several presentations touched upon the topic of design and architecture in agile development .
While introducing agile templates for Visual Studio 2005 , Nick Hines from ThoughWorks talked at length about ThoughtWorks Agile , a methodology which they use to develop software .
ThoughtWorks is one of the best known supporters of agile methodologies , and their process is ‘ not radical as XP , but incorporating XP practices such as TDD and Continuous integration ’ .
According to the presentation , it is a mix between XP and Scrum , revolving around user stories .
A user story life cycle in TW Agile has a few more stages than in similar methodologies , starting from New to Defined , Analysis Complete ( also contains acceptance criteria for TDD ) , Development Complete , QA Complete and concluding with Signed Off ( after business review ) .
There was no mention of up - front design – the Story - finding workshop precedes planning , but it ’s outputs are low - fi UI prototypes , state change diagrams and process maps , not system architecture or design .
The presentation continued by explaining four key roles in TW agile : Analysts , Developers , QA and Project managers .
Introducing the Architect
So far , everything looked almost by the book , with a notable addition of the QA phase for stories .
But the next slide was really controversial .
It explained the responsibilities of an architect in an agile team :
' Cutting ' code - there are no Ivory towers , architects do not write code 24/7 , but have to get involved with the code to understand the challenged .
Maintaining overall system architectural vision
Maintaining conformity with organisational standards
Having the final word on disputed design decisions
Overall responsibility for successful delivery of the project
Interacting with the customer and customer 's IT staff as appropriate
Now this was very interesting .
First , the architect has the ultimate responsibility for successful delivery , but architects were not mentioned in any part of the story - driven development .
Is an agile architect then an outsider ?
It seems not , as the architect also has to cut code , to be involved .
Next , the architect has to maintain overall system architectural vision , but there was no mention of design , visions or anything like that in the story life - cycle .
Where does this vision come from ?
How does one develop it if stories are not discussed at length until it ’s their turn for development ?
Is the agile architect a modern form of Deus ex machina that can somehow resolve problems with a clear vision out of the blue sky ?
Responsibility for the project delivery , and interfacing with customers , have traditionally been the roles of a project manager , so is the architect then the same person as a PM ?
I talked to Nick Hines after his presentation about those concerns .
He argued that there is an implied sence of some architectural vision ( ‘ detailed enough ’ ) throughout the project , and after the talk we pinpointed the Story - finding workshop as the time when that vision is formed , although that is not codified in the process .
That is when all the technical people are in the room , and that is when the brainstorming happens .
The issues of design , story inter-relations and architecture have always been controversial in the agile community , and still are according to questions during several presentations on Architect Insight , and an on - going debate on the XP mailing list .
Should design be done up front , how much , and where does it go in the classic story life - cycle ?
How does it get justified to the customer in a story - driven approach ?
When does it turn into BDUF , the big bad wolf of agile programming ?
Even in XP , the System Metaphor allows for some architectural vision and up - front design .
Yet some people seem very convinced that there should be no design , citing principles like ‘ You Arent Gonna Need It ’ and ‘ Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work ’ .
YAGNI page on C2 Wiki does not seem to justify such extreme views :
‘ This does n’t mean you should avoid building flexibility into your code .
It means you should n’t over - engineer something based on what you think you might need later on .’ , leading us back to the overall architectural vision - as such a vision is necessary to know where to be flexible .
My personal opinion is that some design is a good thing , and is definitely required for all projects except most trivial ones .
That initial design is used to develop the vision which Nick Hines talked about , and identify main risks .
It seems just irresponsible to ignore such issues , since they will effect the team , project , customers and users .
It looks like J.R.R .
Tolkien must have had similar problems when he wrote : ‘ It will not do to leave a live dragon out of your plans if you live near one ’ .
Continuous design
If it is obvious that something will have to be refactored soon , does it pay off to do the simplest thing possible anyway ?
Or is it better to do the right thing straight away but keep it simple ?
Most developers I know will agree that if something will need to be refactored this week , we might as well do it properly straight away .
If something will need to be refactored in two years , then to hell with it .
But where do we draw the line ?
Is it one iteration , or two ?
What distance from the dragon is considered near ?
This question leads us back to Architect Insight Conference , and a panel hosted by Ron Jacobs , with Ivar Jacobson , Jack Greenfield and Colin Bird .
On the topic of evaluating software architects , the final argument was that a ‘ good architect needs to spot refactoring risks and to know how much it will cost later to refactor ’ .
Again , this architect figure somehow appears in an agile context , now effectively possessing the power to decide whether to do the simplest thing possible or to build more structure into the solution .
Answering questions from the audience about up - front design , panellists somehow came to the conclusion that the architect should provide ‘ enough design to keep the development going smooth , identifying the risks along the way ’ .
To perform this continuous design , an architect should be one step ahead of the team , always providing other developers with enough insight so that they can implement the next set of stories .
Missing steps
It seems to me that there are a few more steps in the story life - cycle , hiding among typical descriptions of Agile methods .
We always do a brainstorming session on the beginning of the project , and it seems that other organisations do a similar thing , but that step is somehow invisible , implied and never explicitly defined .
Speaking about how to scale Scrum to multiple teams and large projects , Colin Bird mentioned a preparation phase ( ‘ Sprint 0 ’ ) - maybe that is the time when the architectural vision is born .
It is , no doubt , very hard to describe exactly what goes on during that initial brainstorming and continuous design , and I guess not being able to describe it on paper is the reason why most of the agile literature just plainly ignores any notion of ‘ architecture ’ .
During his opening speech , Matt Deacon , Chief Architectural Advisor in Microsoft UK , urged conference delegates to participate in focus groups to define the types , capabilities , roles and responsibilities of architects in software development .
If one of the biggest software companies in the world needs help on defining what an architect does , it ’s no surprise that the agile community has trouble doing the same .
Ignoring architecture in agile literature , however , has a confusing effect - as all the heated debates show clearly that ‘ people over process ’ has been understood as ‘ no process ’ by a large group of people .
Perhaps the reason for those typical agile / design debates is thinking about architecture and design in the waterfall sense - not really considering a continuous architecture and design , which obviously exists on larger agile projects .
XP and Scrum avoid having traditional PM or architect roles , yet someone has to take care of the responsibilities identified by Nick Hines .
Someone needs to cater for that continuous design , as suggested by Colin Bird .
Someone needs to decide when to cut corners and when to refactor .
To perform the continuous design , an ‘ Architect ’ should be one step ahead of the rest , always providing other developers with enough insight so that they can implement the next set of stories .
So , it seems , there definitely is an Agile Architect role , responsible for the initial architectural vision and continuous design .
Although this person might actually officially be a senior developer , the mix of skills and responsibilities would indicate that it is a full time job for one person , maybe even for two people if all the responsibilities identified by Nick Hines are considered .
On the end , the titles are not really important – the only thing important is that the job gets done .
Stewart blasts media for non-stop Imus ' Gaffe - Fest '
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday April 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
With a backdrop showing the face of Don Imus and " GAFFE - FEST ' 07 " emblazoned on it , Jon Stewart took a snarky Daily Show swipe at media obsession over shock jock Imus ' controversial remark last week .
In the video clip below , Stewart barks , " Turning to our top story tonight : A guy on the radio said something shitty ! "
He shows Imus making the " nappy - headed hos " comment , then shows a montage of various news figures repeating the phrase , ending with one on Fox News saying " nappy - headed whores . "
" I believe that last gentleman did n't have his facts correct , " quips Stewart .
Larry Wilmore , " senior black correspondent " for the Daily Show , chimes in , " The real victims here are the white players on the team , the nap - less , smooth - headed players , if you will . "

Despite ( or maybe because ? ) not having a first life , lately I 've been trying out Second Life ( www.secondlife.com ) . Now , most that knows me knows I 'm not much of a gamer , but what got me interested in SecondLife was the business aspects of it .
Second Life is a 3 - D virtual world entirely built and owned by its residents .
Since opening to the public in 2003 , it has grown explosively and today is inhabited by a total of 3,441,814 people from around the globe . *
The Marketplace currently supports millions of US dollars in monthly transactions .
This commerce is handled with the in - world unit - of - trade , the Linden dollar , which can be converted to US dollars at several thriving online Linden Dollar exchanges .
* From the moment you enter the World you 'll discover a vast digital continent , teeming with people , entertainment , experiences and opportunity .
Once you 've explored a bit , perhaps you 'll find a perfect parcel of land to build your house or business .
* You 'll also be surrounded by the Creations of your fellow residents .
Because residents retain the rights to their digital creations , they can buy , sell and trade with other residents .
Second Life is a 3D platform for developers who want to present , promote , and sell their content and applications to a broad online audience within an immersive , shared space .
Unlike other massive multiplayer online experiences , Second Life has few restrictions and provides broad and flexible content authoring experiences for developers interested in building , creating and evolving the world of Second Life .
Second Life provides our expanding developer community with ownership of anything it builds or creates in Second Life .
It is yours to sell , trade or monetize within the rapidly increasing population of Second Life Residents .
I 'm looking into how it is working for now , to be open to do some development for it later .
The API documentations seems nice for e.g. registering new users from the business ' own website , so I might throw together some PHP classes for that at some point .
Anyways , if anyone is already in Second Life , feel free to throw a message the way of : Kristian Enoch .

Architecture Astronauts Are Back
I ’m starting to see a new round of pure architecture astronautics : meaningless stringing - together of new economy buzzwords in an attempt to sound erudite .
When I wrote my original complaint about architecture astronauts more than four years ago , it was P2P this and messaging that .
“ That ’s one sure tip - off to the fact that you ’re being assaulted by an Architecture Astronaut : the incredible amount of bombast ; the heroic , utopian grandiloquence ; the boastfulness ; the complete lack of reality .
And people buy it !
The business press goes wild ! ”
Now it ’s tagging and folksonomies and syndication , and we ’re all supposed to fall in line with the theory that cool new stuff like Google Maps , Wikipedia , and Del.icio.us are somehow bigger than the sum of their parts .
The Long Tail !
Attention Economy !
Creative Commons !
Peer production !
Web 2.0 !
The term Web 2.0 particularly bugs me .
It ’s not a real concept .
It has no meaning .
It ’s a big , vague , nebulous cloud of pure architectural nothingness .
When people use the term Web 2.0 , I always feel a little bit stupider for the rest of the day .
To quote the line from Billy Madison :
Principal : Mr. Madison , what you ’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard .
At no point in your rambling , incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought .
Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it .
I award you no points , and may God have mercy on your soul .
Billy Madison : Okay , a simple no would ’ve done just fine .
Not only that , the very 2.0 in Web 2.0 seems carefully crafted as a way to denegrate the clueless “ Web 1.0 ” idiots , poor children , in the same way the first round of teenagers starting dotcoms in 1999 dissed their elders with the decade ’s mantra , “ They just do n’t get it ! ”
I ’ll do my part .
I hereby pledge never again to use the term “ Web 2.0 ” on this blog , or to link to any article that mentions it .
You ’re welcome .
And While I ’m In A Bitchy Mood
Boy , am I glad I do n’t work at Microsoft any more .
The joy is gone when adding an easter egg is “ immediate grounds for termination , ” and a fun video they made for a conference does n’t have a soda can in it because “ none of the soda companies would give permission for their product to appear in this video . ”
Still , it beats the hell out of listening to one of those podcasts about podcasting or reading one of those blogs about blogging .
Unsub - frickin’ - scribed .
And now , back to my normal sunshiny self .
Although George W. Bush is probably not the worst president in U.S. history ( Woodrow Wilson may have that dubious honor ) , the president may be in contention for that title in the post - World War II era .
Although he still has two and a half years to go in his term and could conceivably orchestrate a late - inning rally , the way he has run his administration to date makes that doubtful .
But President Bush does have some stiff competition from other postwar administrations that failed  those of John F. Kennedy , Lyndon B. Johnson , and Richard M. Nixon .
Because of his charisma and because he died before his time , John F. Kennedy is still a pop icon more than 40 years after his death .
But most historians believe that the public overrates his presidency .
JFK was meek on civil rights and approved the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion by Cuban exiles attempting to overthrow Castro ’s regime  only to abandon them after they were under fire on Cuba ’s beaches .
But his most dangerous actions came before and during the Cuban missile crisis , after which he was praised by many for making Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev withdraw Soviet nuclear missiles from the island .
The Soviets began to install long - range missiles in Cuba , in part , because of fears of a full - blown U.S. invasion .
Yet JFK and Robert McNamara , JFK ’s secretary of defense , acknowledged privately that the Soviet missiles in Cuba did n’t alter the nuclear balance , which favored the United States .
The missiles in Cuba reduced U.S. warning time for an attack , but the United States did n’t ( and still does n’t ) have an effective defense against missile attacks .
When rumors first surfaced of Soviet missiles being installed in Cuba , JFK admitted privately that if he had n’t made tough public statements that this violated vital U.S. security interests , he could have done nothing about the missiles .
And information has recently surfaced indicating that doing something about the long - range Soviet missiles created a greater risk of nuclear holocaust than even the widespread fears of the time imagined .
Despite the earlier Bay of Pigs fiasco , JFK was considering the invasion of Cuba as an option ( to remove the missiles ) , this time using U.S. forces .
But unbeknownst to him and his advisers , the Soviets had installed short - range tactical nuclear weapons to deter or defend against any invasion aimed at taking out the long - range nuclear missiles being installed .
If the United States had invaded , the crisis could have quickly escalated into a nuclear conflagration .
Although the favorable U.S. - Soviet nuclear balance was not in danger of being compromised , JFK ’s competitive nature caused him to risk incineration of the world in order to best Khrushchev .
Although Lyndon B. Johnson made many more breakthroughs on civil rights than JFK , he started a war in an unimportant backwater region of the world that he knew he was likely to lose ( just after the French had been defeated there ) because he feared criticism from the Right about being soft on communism .
The pointless war cost the lives of 58,000 U.S. troops and many more Vietnamese and destroyed the country in a failed attempt to save it from communism .
The unpopular war caused widespread domestic unrest in the United States and , in response , prompted government surveillance of its own citizens .
Among liberals , LBJ gets credit for the massive domestic spending of the " Great Society " program , but he knowingly threw money at social problems without a clear idea of how the government could be successful in solving them .
These programs were n’t successful , and most failed .
Despite Richard Nixon ’s important diplomatic opening to China and détente with the Soviet Union , the massive corruption in his administration and the misuse of both the FBI and CIA condemn his record as president .
Also , before ending the war in Indochina as he had promised , he invaded Cambodia , supported the invasion of Laos , and indiscriminately bombed Vietnam  actions that either violated the Constitution or could be deemed war crimes .
In the end , Nixon obtained a diplomatic settlement  a fig leaf for U.S. withdrawal  that could have been obtained four years before , thus avoiding many war deaths .
But George W. Bush can compete with each one of these lesser lights of the presidency .
Instead of using all the U.S. government ’s national security resources to capture or kill Osama bin Laden , the perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks , Bush invaded an unrelated country , has become bogged down in a quagmire and civil war , and has unintentionally provided a training ground for and fueled the hatred of a jihadist terrorist movement that will probably attack U.S. targets for decades .
If he had been president at the beginning of World War II , Bush would have responded to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Nazi declaration of war on the United States by invading Romania .
But surprisingly , this Iraq fiasco is not the most dangerous thing the president has done .
He has used the never - ending war on terror to claim unlimited power for the president during wartime .
For example , he has flouted the Constitution by detaining prisoners without trial , spied on Americans without the constitutionally required warrants , and blatantly said that he will follow a congressionally passed law against torture when he feels like it .
None of the other postwar presidents have claimed unlimited power during wartime or crises .
This is a truly dangerous claim , especially when the war is perpetual .
The individual liberties guaranteed to citizens  unique to the American system  could be threatened by even greater future executive authoritarianism .
In the Constitution , in reaction to the despotic monarchs of Europe , the founders narrowly restricted the executive ’s power .
Bush ’s arrogant power grab , which attempts to eviscerate the checks and balances that are at the heart of the U.S. Constitution , probably makes him the most dangerous  and therefore the worst  president in the post - World War II era .
It is with a heavy heart that we bring you this special weekend report .
When PopSci's Wii arrived last week , it did n't spend too much time in the box .
Ripped open without any hesitation , our little Wii gave us a long Friday 's worth of furious Wii Sports and Excite Truck action at PopSci HQ .
But then , it was time for it to go off to a photo shoot , where its fate would be sealed .
The plan was simple : carefully disassemble the little white box and controllers for a detailed inside look , then re-assemble it with ease and get back to where we left off , working up a sweat bludgeoning our little cartoon selves in Wii Sports Boxing .
But the Wii proved to be one tough nut to crack .
Due to Nintendo's special proprietary screws , we had to resort to brute force .
And in the process of doing so , our precious white beacon of joy was rendered unplayable , forever .
But in the interest of making the best of a decidedly horrific situation , we figured it best to finish the job with a full , heart - wrenching disassembly .
Here we bring you a visual record of our Wii's autopsy — put on your recording of bagpipes playing " Taps , " get out your hankies , and click here to launch the gallery .
Sniff . — John Mahoney
The neocortex is organised into thousands of columns of neurons
Experts at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , Switzerland , will spend the next two years creating a 3D simulation of the neocortex .
This is the part of the brain thought to be responsible for language , learning , memory and complex thought .
The researchers believe the project will give them fresh insights into the most remarkable organ in the body .
" Modelling the brain at the cellular level is a massive undertaking because of the hundreds of thousands of parameters that need to be taken into account , " said Henry Markram , the EPFL professor leading the project .
The Swiss scientist and his colleagues will have at their disposal an IBM's eServer Blue Gene supercomputer .
Up the pace
The system to be installed at their EPFL lab will take up the floor space of about four refrigerators , and will have a peak processing speed of at least 22.8 trillion floating - point operations per second ( 22.8 teraflops ) , making it one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world .
Five years ago , no supercomputer in the world was capable of more than one teraflop .
Supercomputers are increasinlgy being used in research to model biomolecules
By using a supercomputer to run experiments in real time , Professor Markram hopes to accelerate substantially the pace of brain research .
" With an accurate computer - based model of the brain much of the pre-testing and planning normally required for a major experiment could be done ' in silico ' rather than in the laboratory .
" With certain simulations we anticipate that a full day 's worth of ' wet lab ' research could be done in a matter of seconds on Blue Gene . "
The Blue Brain Project will start with the neocortex but scientists expect eventually to produced a 3D model of the entire brain .
Researchers expect not only to get a better understanding of how the organ is wired up but also to use that " atlas " of neurocircuitry to probe how the brain functions - and malfunctions .
The scientists say the project could lead , for example , to new ideas on how psychiatric disorders develop - illnesses such as autism , schizophrenia , and depression .
Supercomputers have recently become a major tool in a range of advanced biological applications , from helping to piece together fragmented DNA information to the design of new drug molecules .
Those who love literature rather take for granted the idea of a literary tradition .
In part , it is a temporal map , a means of negotiating the centuries and the connections between writers .
It helps to know that Shakespeare preceded Keats who preceded Wilfred Owen because lines of influence might be traced .
And in part , a tradition implies a hierarchy , a canon ; most conventionally , it has Shakespeare dominant , like a lonely figurine on top of a wedding cake , and all the other writers arranged on descending tiers .
In recent years , the canon has been attacked for being too male , too middle class , too Euro - centric ; what remains untouched is the value of a canon itself : clearly , if it did not exist , it could not be challenged .
But above all , a literary tradition implies an active historical sense of the past , living in and shaping the present .
And reciprocally , a work of literature produced now infinitesimally shifts our understanding of what has gone before .
You cannot value a poet alone , TS Eliot argued in his famous essay , " Tradition and the Individual Talent " , " you must set him , for contrast and comparison , among the dead . "
Eliot did not find it preposterous " that the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past . "
We might discern the ghost of Auden in the lines of a poem by James Fenton , or hear echoes of Wordsworth in Seamus Heaney , or Donne in Craig Raine .
Ideally , having read our contemporaries , we return to re-read the dead poets with a fresh understanding .
In a living artistic tradition , the dead never quite lie down .
Can science and science writing , a vast and half forgotten accumulation over the centuries , offer us a parallel living tradition ?
If it can , how do we begin to describe it ?
The problems of choice are equalled only by those of criteria .
Literature does not improve ; it simply changes .
Science , on the other hand , as an intricate , self - correcting thought system , advances and refines its understanding of the thousands of objects of its study .
This is how it derives it power and status .
Science prefers to forget much of its past - it is constitutionally bound to a form of selective amnesia .
Is accuracy , being on the right track , or some approximation of it , the most important criterion for selection ?
Or is style the final arbiter ?
The writings of Thomas Browne or Francis Bacon or Robert Burton contain many fine passages that we now know to be factually wrong - but we would surely not wish to exclude them .
The tradition must keep a place for Aristotle and Galen because of the hold they had over people 's minds for centuries .
We have to beware of implying a Whig history of science , a history of the lonely road that leads to the present .
We need to remember the various discarded toys of science - the humours , the four elements , phlogiston , the ether and , more recently , protoplasm .
Modern chemistry was born out of the futile ambitions of alchemy .
Scientists who hurl themselves down blind alleys perform a service - they save everyone a great deal of trouble .
They may also refine techniques along the way , and offer points of resistance , intellectual cantilevers , to their contemporaries .
I say all this somewhat dutifully , because there actually is a special pleasure to be shared , when a scientist or science writer leads us towards the light of a powerful idea which in turn opens avenues of exploration and discovery leading far into the future , binding many different phenomena in many different fields of study .
Some might call this truth .
It has an aesthetic value that is not to be found in Galen 's confident and muddled assertions about the nature of disease .
For example , there is something of the luminous quality of great literature when the 29 - year - old Charles Darwin , just two years back from his Beagle voyage and 21 years before he will publish The Origin of Species , confides to a pocket note - book the first hints of a simple , beautiful idea : " Origin of man now proved ...
He who understands baboon would do more towards metaphysics than Locke . "
Far better , perhaps , to set aside issues of truth and inaccuracy , criteria and definitions .
We know what we like when we taste it .
Until recently , the purely literary tradition was never obliged to set out its terms .
The work came first , and then the talk about it .
In a sense , I am merely making an appeal for a grand parlour game : what might a scientific literary tradition be ?
Which books are going on our shelves ?
To propose is to ask to be challenged ; already , I suspect my own suggestions are too male , too middle class , too Eurocentric .
Here is the opening of an essay - strictly speaking , a letter - on immunology .
" It is whispered in Christian Europe that the English are mad and maniacs : mad because they give their children smallpox to prevent their getting it , and maniacs because they cheerfully communicate to their children a certain and terrible illness with the object of preventing an uncertain one .
The English on their side say : ' The other Europeans are cowardly and unnatural : cowardly in that they are afraid of giving a little pain to their children , and unnatural because they expose them to death from smallpox some time in the future ' .
To judge who is right in this dispute , here is the history of this famous inoculation which is spoken of with such horror outside England . "
This is Voltaire , writing in the late 1720s during an extended visit to England , presenting a rare instance of a French intellectual impressed by English ideas .
Voltaire wrote beautifully in his Lettres philosophiques - translated as Letters on England - on religion , politics , and literature .
He was delighted by the degree of political freedom he found here , by the powers of parliament , the absence of religious absolutism and divine right .
He attended Newton 's funeral and was amazed that a humble scientist was buried like a king in Westminster Abbey .
Crucially , he placed himself between a scientist and an interested public and offered superb expositions of Newton 's theories of optics and gravitation , which still stand today .
If you want to know what was daring and original in what Newton said , read Voltaire .
He communicates the excitement of a new idea , and sets the highest standards of lucidity .
Last year , my son William completed an undergraduate biology course at UCL .
When he came to study genetics , he was advised to read no papers written before 1997 .
One can see the point of this advice .
In recent years , estimates of the size of the human genome have shrunk by a factor of three , or even four .
Such is the headlong nature of contemporary science .
But if we understand science merely as a band of light moving through time , advancing on the darkness , and leaving ignorant darkness behind it , always at its best only in the incandescent present , we turn our backs on an epic tale of ingenuity propelled by curiosity .
Here is a man who has ground up some lenses with infinite care and arranged them in a novel way .
He has taken some water from a lake and has been studying it scrupulously , with an open mind : " I found floating therein divers earthy particles and some green streaks , spirally wound serpent - wise and orderly arranged ...
Other particles had but the beginning of the foresaid streak ; but all consisted of very small green globules joined together ; and there were very many small green globules as well ...
These animacules had divers colours , some being whitish and transparent , others with green and very glittering little scales ...
And the motion of most of these animacules in the water was so swift , and so various upwards , downwards and roundabout , that ' twas wonderful to see : and I judge that some of these little creatures were above a thousand times smaller than the smallest ones I have ever yet seen ... "
This is Anton van Leeuwenhoek writing from Holland to the Royal Society in 1674 , giving the first account of spirogyra , among other organisms .
He sent his observations to the Royal Society over a period of 50 years , and it was no accident that he should have sent his letters there .
At that time , in a small space , within a triangle formed by London , Cambridge , and Oxford , and within a couple of generations , there existed nearly all the world 's science .
Newton , Locke , ( I think we need to include certain philosophers - Hume most certainly ) Willis , Hooke , Boyle , Wren , Flamsteed , Halley - an incredible concentration of talent , and the core of our library - its classical moment , if you like .
This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the publication of Richard Dawkins ' The Selfish Gene .
There has never been a science book quite like it .
Drawing on the work of a handful of scientists , it bound together genetics and Darwinian natural selection in a creative synthesis that amazed even those few who were already familiar with the concepts .
It hastened a sea change in evolutionary theory , it affected profoundly the teaching of biology , it enticed an enthusiastic younger generation into the subject , and spawned a huge literature , and eventually a new discipline - memetics .
At the same time , and this is the measure of its achievement , it addressed itself without condescension to the layman .
It did so provocatively , and with style .
" Individuals are not stable things , they are fleeting .
Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion , like hands of cards soon after they are dealt .
But the cards themselves survive the shuffling .
The cards are the genes .
The genes are not destroyed by crossing over , they merely change partners and march on .
Of course they march on .
That is their business .
They are the replicators and we are their survival machines .
When we have served our purpose , we are cast aside .
But genes are the denizens of geological time : genes are forever . "
It is a lovely phrase , " shuffled into oblivion " , and the analogy with cards - the hand being the information , the cards themselves the genes - is apt , economical and informative : true eloquence .
In the years since then , Dawkins ' work might be seen as one extended invitation addressed to us non-scientists to enjoy science , to indulge ourselves at a feast of human ingenuity .
Just as we can sit around the kitchen table and discuss operas , movies or novels without being composers , directors or novelists , so we can engage with this subject , one more sublime achievement of accumulated creativity .
We can make it " ours " just as we might the music of Bach or Bill Evans .
A literary tradition in science would certainly help us in that , and one important contribution to the development of the idea of a living past is John Carey 's Faber Book of Science , a magisterial anthology , superbly annotated .
In it there is a long extract from Thomas Huxley 's famous lecture " On a Piece of Chalk " , delivered to a packed hall of working men in Norwich in 1868 .
The lecture contains the seductive sentence , " A great chapter in the history of the world is written in the chalk ... "
Huxley leads us , of course to Darwin .
My particular favourite is The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , in which he makes the case for emotions as human universals , shared across cultures .
He also makes an anti-racist argument for a common human nature .
This is one of the first science books to make use of photographs - in this case , one of the Darwin babies bawling in a high chair .
The edition by Paul Ekman is unsurpassed .
When we come to the present , our parlour game intensifies , for we are wallowing in riches .
The Selfish Gene stood at the beginning of a golden age of science writing .
With a fine sense of literary tradition , the physicist Steven Weinberg , in his book Dreams of a Final Theory , revisited Huxley 's lecture on chalk in order to make the case for reductionism .
Steven Pinker 's application of Darwinian thought to Chomskyan linguistics in The Language Instinct is one of the finest celebrations of language I know .
Among many other indispensable " classics " , I would propose EO Wilson 's The Diversity of Life on the ecological wonders of the Amazon rain forest , and on the teeming micro-organisms in a handful of soil ; David Deutsch 's masterly account of the Many Worlds theory in The Fabric of Reality ; Jared Diamond 's melding of history with biological thought in Guns , Germs and Steel ; Antonio Damasio 's hypnotic account of the neuroscience of the emotions in The Feeling of What Happens ; Matt Ridley , unweaving the opposition of nature and nurture in Nature via Nurture ; and recently , the philosopher Daniel Dennett , conscious of Hume as well as Dawkins , laying out for us the memetics of faith in Breaking the Spell
An important part of Richard Dawkins ' writing and public speaking has been devoted to religion - he has refused to gloss over the innate contradictions between reason and faith .
Few of us , I think , in the mid-1970s , when The Selfish Gene was published , would have thought we would be dedicating so much mental space to discussing religious faith in this new century .
We thought that since it has nothing useful at all to say about cosmology , the age of the earth , the origin of species , the curing of disease or any other aspect of the physical world , it had retreated finally to where it belongs , to the privacy of individual conscience .
We were wrong .
A variety of sky - god worshippers with their numerous , mutually exclusive certainties ( all of which we must " respect " ) appears to be occupying more and more of the space of public discourse .
Increasingly , they seem to want to tell us how to live and think , or inflict upon us the strictures they choose to impose upon themselves .
This is a passage taken from Carey 's anthology , and in my ideal science library I would want it carved in some special place - perhaps over the door as you go in .
Here is a man who has just been threatened with torture and indefinite imprisonment , unless he signs on the dotted line : " ... having before my eyes and touching with my hands the Holy Gospels , swear that I have always believed , do believe , and with God 's help will in the future believe all that is held , preached and taught by the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church ...
I must altogether abandon the false opinion that the sun is the centre of the world and immovable , and that the earth is not the centre of the world and moves and that I must not hold , defend or teach in any way whatsoever , verbally and in writing the said false doctrine ... "
Or , as Orwell would have it , two plus two equals five .
In 1632 Galileo might just have whispered to himself as he signed , " but it still moves " - we will never know .
But his confession reminds us that open - minded rational enquiry has always had its enemies .
We can take nothing for granted , for totalitarian thinking , religious or political , will always be with us in some form or other .
For this reason alone , we should nurture a living scientific literary tradition .

The museum left the safe open so that visitors could touch the gold
The gold bar , valued at $ 1.71 m ( 1.27 m euro ; £ 0.87 m ) , weighed about 220 pounds ( 100kg ) and was kept in an open safe .
The museum , in the central city of Takayama , said the gold was not protected by sensors as they wanted visitors to be able to touch it .
But the group of thieves went one step further , helping themselves to the precious metal and dragging it away .
The gold was lugged past an employee alerted by the noise , down a staircase and out of the museum where the three men were driven away by a fourth accomplice .
" The gold was exhibited on the second floor , which was monitored by a security camera from the first floor , " said 59 - year - old Hisao Nakahagi , the owner of the gold .

I am here at PyCon , enjoying the talks .
I will blog about what I have seen in a few days .
Until then , let me drop here the seven laws on how to write good technical documents .
These laws are the rules I have synthetized for the tutorial I gave yesterday , and that can be followed by anyone who write for softwares .
They are based on advices taken from :
Writing With Power ( Peter Elbow )
Agile Documentation ( Andreas Rüping )
My own experience on the topic .
The seven laws for technical writing :
Writing should be done in two stages ( Elbow , 1980 ) :
a free writing where ideas are written on the paper no matter the shape .
a review stage where things are structured and reviewed .
Each stage should take 50 % of the time .
-> Split you writing time in two phases , no one can write it right the first time ( except Mozart )
Use short sentences and simple writing style .
Use simple vocabulary
Focus on your target when you write a document ( Rüping , 2003 ) .
Assume their background knowledge to restrict the scope of the documentation .
-> A prerequest section can help a lot .
A document is about a clear focus .
A precise title for each section and the document itself , and a summary can help .
->
If you cannot easily name the document or one of its section , there ’s a problem
Drop the foo and bar habits .
Examples must be real - life examples , and usable as -is .
Neh :
>>> import graph >>> foo = graph.calculateSquare(1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ) >>> bar = graph.renderSquare( foo )
Better :
>>> import graph >>> square = graph.calculateSquare(1 , 7 , 1 , 10 ) >>> square_view = graph.renderSquare( square )
A working software is more important than the best documentation in the world ( Ambler , 2002 ) .
Quality over Quantity is the best rule .
-> Spending too much time to find something in the documentation is a bad sign .
->
Think documents like code .
Always limit the size of sections , examples , etc. Modularized documentation is the key .
Use a clear document portfolio to facilitate the reading .
Document should use :
an abstract with a readers guideline
a toc when there are more than one section
references
glossary
tables and diagrams
->
Never write a document that does n’t have a template
The cover of " The Da Vinci Code " book .
Image courtesy HowStuffWorks Shopper
Since its 2003 publication , " The Da Vinci Code " has caused quite a stir .
Since its debut to glowing reviews , it has sold more than 40 million copies in at least 44 languag­es [ ref ] .
In addition to being a bestseller , it 's sparked a lot of controversy .
It 's a work of fiction , but it presents itself as based in fact , and many critics have raised questions about whether those facts are accurate .
It 's no secret that the HowStuffWorks staff likes to take things apart and see what makes them tick .
Some of us are also the kind of sticklers who point out science and technology mistakes in TV shows and movies , much to the chagrin of the people listening .
But when we heard about the controversy surrounding " The Da Vinci Code , " we could n't resist picking it apart .

In this article , you 'll learn what happened when we took a close , hard look at " The Da Vinci Code " and how it uses science , technology , art and history .
Trouble at the Louvre
" The Da Vinci Code " begins with a crime at the Louvre Museum in Paris .
At the behest of someone known as " the Teacher , " a man named Silas murders curator Jacques Saunière .
After reviewing the evidence , French investigators summon Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon for questioning .
Captain Bezu Fache of the Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire ( DCPJ ) is sure that Langdon is the murderer .
Fache has one of his lieutenants plant a GPS dot in Landon 's pocket .
It 's a " metallic , button - shaped disk , about the size of a watch battery . "
This dot , according to cryptographer Sophie Neveu , is accurate to two feet and lets the DCPJ track Langdon 's location , no matter where he is .
In other words :
It 's tiny .
It 's amazingly accurate .
It works indoors .
However , real global positioning system ( GPS ) devices :
Can be small , but they 're usually bigger than a watch battery .
The unit described in the book would also have to fit a power source and a second radio transmitter into its tiny shell in order to communicate with police computers .
Are accurate to somewhere between 13 and 328 feet ( 4 and 100 meters ) .
Do n't work well indoors , under dense tree cover or in urban areas with tall buildings .
This content is not compatible on this device .
A GPS receiver uses the position of three or more satellites to determine a person 's location -- not one , as implied in the novel .
One fact explains all of these points -- by definition , a GPS receiver uses radio waves to communicate with satellites that are 11,000 miles above the Earth 's surface .
The receiver has to have an unbroken line of sight to these satellites , something it does n't have indoors .
Even military GPS technology can't typically get a fix on a soldier who is in dense tree cover or otherwise concealed .
Check out How GPS Receivers
Work to learn more .
The troublesome GPS dot keeps causing problems as the story moves along .
Sophie tells Langdon that if he throws the dot away , the DCPJ officers will see that it is no longer moving and know he 's onto them .
She comes up with an ingenious plan .
She imbeds the receiver in a bar of soap , breaks a restroom window and throws the soap onto the roof of a passing truck .
That seems like a good plan , and it works .
The officers rush to apprehend the truck , believing that Langdon is on the roof .
This buys him and Sophie some time .
Unfortunately :
The restrooms of the Louvre have liquid soap , just like most other public restrooms .
According to a " Da Vinci Code " tour guide , the restrooms in that part of the Louvre do not have windows [ ref ] .
In spite of its inaccuracies , this move does buy Sophie and Langdon some time .
But the mistakes in the Louvre do n't stop there .
Check out what else goes wrong in the museum in the next section .
Any frequent flyer can tell you that not every economy seat is the same .
Some are definitely better than others .
The key to finding the best seat for you is to know what 's available and how to get it .
Travellers are becoming quite savvy in selecting seats in advance , says Canadian travel agent Randy Raphael , who has 30 years ' experience in the industry .
Seats can often be reserved when a ticket is bought and many international carriers now have online or even SMS text message check - in services available up to 48 hours before a flight , which gives passengers , especially frequent - flyer members , the chance to see what is available and make their choice .
Showing up at the airport without a seat reservation can mean you get stuck with what no one else wants - or possibly worse .
If the flight is overbooked and you do n't have a seat assignment , you are the one likely to be left behind , Mr Raphael says .
It is always a good idea to book any seat .
Knowing what to pick and what to avoid is all about having the right information .
Websites like SeatGuru.com , SeatExpert.com and LoveMySeat.com offer seating information for dozens of domestic and international airlines .
Seat comfort is often listed as the top priority for travellers , says LoveMySeat.com founder Steven Hall .
Interactive maps on these sites provide assessments of individual seats according to their level of recline , leg room , row position , access to in - flight amenities and proximity to lavatories and the galley .
The recommendations are based on thousands of user comments and industry research .
The sites also rate carriers based on seat width and pitch , which is the distance between rows .
These can vary between aircraft and airlines by several centimetres , which is no small amount on a long flight .
Not surprisingly , the added leg room in the emergency - exit and bulkhead rows makes them a popular first choice .
Unfortunately , seats in the emergency - exit row can't normally be booked in advance because airline staff have to ensure passengers are physically capable of assisting the aircrew in case of an emergency .
Many airlines also reserve bulkhead rows for frequent flyers , the elderly or families with infants or small children .
These restrictions do n't mean other passengers can't get these seats , but it is one case where advance check - in or arriving early at the airport can make all the difference .
These prized spaces can have drawbacks , too .
Airlines use a wide range of aircraft and sometimes seats in emergency - exit and bulkhead rows can actually be cramped , not recline or are next to heavy - traffic areas near the lavatories or galley .
This is where informed decision - making can save the day .
" One of the fascinating things we 've discovered is that everyone has different preferences and opinions of the same seats , " says SeatGuru.com CEO and founder Matthew Daimler .
" While many users might complain about a seat near the lavatory , there are others who cherish such a seat because they do n't have to wait in a line .
" While most flyers try to avoid middle seats , we do see a fairly even split between those who prefer aisle or window seats . "
A window seat offers a view for take - off and landing , and the opportunity to rest your head against the wall .
And with no one trying to get past you there 's the greatest chance for a bout of uninterrupted sleep .
In economy class , window seats are typically the most popular location for leisure travellers , Mr Hall says .
An aisle seat guarantees access to at least one arm rest , with open space to one side and the possibility of stretching your limbs a little more .
This is helpful for those with newspapers , laptops , or written work to do .
For business travellers the most popular are aisle seats , Mr Hall adds .
However , elbows and feet can get hit by the drink or food cart and passengers traipsing past .
Those on the aisle also regularly have to move for others to get out .
The least appealing option is a middle seat .
Imagine it 's a night flight , the row in front has reclined and the passengers on the left and right are fast asleep and hogging the arm rests .
Cramped does n't begin to describe it .
If you do n't reserve your seat in advance it is highly probable you will end up with a middle seat , Mr Raphael says .
For long flights this is the worst seat to have .
Then there is the decision on which row to sit in .
The front of the plane is usually further away from the engines and therefore quieter , Mr Daimler says .
Many times the in - flight beverage and food service begins from the front , too .
Passengers at the front are also the first to get off and into the immigration and customs lines .
While this can be a deciding factor for short trips or connecting flights , it is debatable how much it helps at busy international hubs .
Some airlines now reserve these rows for frequent flyers .
The rear of the plane is typically least desirable , Mr Hall says .
It takes much longer to exit , and food and beverage service is often last to these seats .
Then there is the noise and traffic associated with the lavatories and galley .
Still , some passengers prefer the back because they are the first into the plane to get settled , with their carry - on luggage close at hand rather than jammed in whatever compartment is available .
Then there is the little - known frequent - flyer secret of the extra space provided in the final rows of a Boeing 747 , where the tapering of the fuselage means there is one less seat on each side .
Which leaves only the holy grail of economy - class seating - the empty four - seat row .
Passengers keenly watch for these open spaces , waiting impatiently for the exit doors to close so they can stake their claim .
Those who get to stretch out and relax on a long flight in such comfort never forget their luck .
Optional extras
If economy seating is not to your liking , here 's our quick guide to some of the best seats in first and business class .
First class · Cathay Pacific has ranked No.1 in the Skytrax World Airline Awards ( WAA ) for best all - round first class service two years in a row .
Seats recline into a flat bed , which is two metres long and 56 - 63 cm wide .
This year , Cathay will introduce a new , roomier seating configuration that includes an in - built massage function and 43cm television .
· Singapore Airlines has started offering a new seat - a combination seat - lounge - bed that is virtually a mini-cabin .
Billed as the widest in the sky ( 89 cm ) , the seat also features a 58 cm LCD TV with surround sound .
Available only on selected flights from Singapore .
· Emirates was the first to offer the new mini-cabin seating configuration .
Airbus A340 - 500 passengers get a 218 cm x 55 cm suite , featuring a massage function , personal TV and workstation .
Emirates won the WAA best in - flight entertainment award in 2005 and 2006 , and plans to upgrade some aircraft to a new 600 - channel audio - video system .
Business class · British Airways ranked No.1 for business class in the 2006 World Airline Awards .
Seats recline into a flat bed ( 185 cm x 51 cm ) , a feature more common in first class .
BA 's unusual seating configuration , which has some seats facing the rear of the plane , has received mixed reviews .
Passengers get access to a travel spa at Heathrow or New York 's JFK .
· Qantas ranked fourth in the WAA .
SkyBed seats on some Boeing 747s and Airbus A330s models have near - full recline capability ( 155 cm x 61 cm ) and an in - built massage function .
The audio - video system has 300 channels .
SkyBeds have not been rolled out for all routes yet , with some aircraft retaining smaller seats with reduced recline capability and no power ports .
· Air New Zealand has a spacious flat bed seat on its premier service ( 202 cm x 59 cm ) , with a 26 cm TV , remote control and ottoman footrest .
Premier is available only for certain long - haul Tasman and Pacific routes .
As a developer I am most happy writing code for other developers to write code with .
I attribute this in part to the fact that I do n’t enjoy writing user interface code as much as writing the code that no - one sees .
For me , my favourite user interface is an API or even a web service .
One of my favourite books about APIs is Framework Design Guidelines : Conventions , Idioms , and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries by Brad Abrams and Krzysztof Cwalina .
I ’ve been reading Brad ’s Blog for quite some time and today he posted a link to a really good presentation by Joshua Bloch about designing good APIs .
The presentation is video with the full slide deck , and covers a range of topics from the initial specification of an API , through implementation considerations with some specific references to good and bad APIs .
I found the parts about specification of an API and avoiding implementation details leaking into the published API and controlling the interface of the API .
Things I took away from watching the presentation :
Consult people about the specification – get as much input as possible before committing to a design
Keep the interface simple – over complication makes using the API confusing – Usability is important for APIs , stick to naming conventions already in use for your platform
Control what you expose – do n’t let internal implementation escape through your API , control the exceptions and types you expose
Documentation is important – make sure all public parts of the API are documented , the level of reuse of your API will be defined by the how good the documentation is
Consider performance of your API – make sure its not going to cause any horrid performance characteristics
Subclass only when the type is really a sub class of the parent type ( Liskov Substitution Principle )
Do n’t make the client do work if the module can do it for you – avoid the need for boiler plate code to use your API
Report errors as early as possible – compile time is best , runtime is worst
Be careful about your parameters – use the most appropriate types , keep the number of parameters under control , make sure overloads are obvious
When throwing exceptions give as much information about why the error occurred as possible
The list above is not exhaustative , I highly recommend watching the full presentation – its well worth the 68 minutes it will take .

The Origin of Love
Hedwig and the Angry Inch
When the earth was still flat and the clouds made of fire
and the mountains stretched up to the sky , sometimes higher
folks roamed the earth like big rolling kegs
they had two sets of arms
they had two sets of legs
they had two faces peering out of one giant head
so they could watch all around them as they talked while they read
and they never knew nothing of love
it was before the origin of love
origin of love
the origin of love
origin of love
Well there were three sexes then
one that looked like two men glued on back to back
they were the children of the sun
and similar in shape girth were the children of the earth
they looked like two girls rolled up in one
and the children of the moon was like a fork shoved on a spoon
they were part sun part earth part daughter part son
oh the origin of love
Well the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance
and thor said i’m gonna kill them all with my hammer
like i killed the giants
but zeus said no
you ’d better let me use my lightning like scissors
like i cut the legs off the whales
dinosaurs into lizards
then he grabbed up some bolts , he let out a laugh
said i’ll split them right down the middle
gonna cut them right up in half
and then storm clouds gathered above into great balls of fire
And then fire shot down from the sky in bolts
like shining blades of a knife
and it ripped right through the flesh
of the children of the sun and the moon and the earth
and some indian god sewed the wound up to a hole
turned it ’round to our bellies to remind us the price we payed
and osiris , and the gods of the nile gathered up a big storm
to blow a hurricane
to scatter us away
a flood of wind and rain , a sea of tidal waves
to wash us all away
and if we do n’t behave they ’ll cut us down again
and we ’ll be hopping ’ round on one foot
looking through one eye
The last time i saw you we had just split in two
he was looking at me , i was looking at you
you had a way so familiar i could not recognize
cause you had blood on your face
and i had blood in my eyes
but i swear by your expression
that the pain down in your soul was the same
as the one down in mine
that ’s the pain
that cuts a straight line down through the heart
we call it love
we wrapped our arms around each other
tried to shove ourselves back together
we were making love , making love
it was a cold dark evening such a long time ago
when by the mighty hand of jove
it was a sad story how we became lonely two - legged creatures
the story , the origin of love
that ’s the origin of love
oh yeah , the origin of love
the origin of love
the origin of love
SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT / Screening tests were sabotaged / Security workers were warned when undercover agent arrived

Federal security has decided not to confiscate scissors from air travelers before they get on the plane .
The TSA says it has more - pressing security concerns than scissors , which turn up in one - fourth of the bags , particularly now that cockpit doors are reinforced .

AIRPORT / Screening tests were sabotaged / Security workers were warned when undercover agent arrived 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Federal transportation officials and a private security firm at San Francisco International Airport worked together to undermine a federal investigation of passenger screening at security checkpoints , according to a report released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
For 16 months ending last year , Transportation Security Administration employees tipped off screeners from Covenant Aviation Security that undercover agents were on their way to the airport 's checkpoints to test whether the screeners were properly inspecting passengers and their carry - on luggage , the report said .
Despite the charges , the private security firm was rehired two weeks ago with a $ 314 million , four - year contract at the airport to screen passengers and checked bags .
Employees of the firm and the security agency were disciplined as a result of the investigation but none lost their jobs .
" Covert security testing at SFO was compromised , " says a 24 - page report signed by Homeland Security Inspector General Richard L. Skinner .
The report also found that at least one security breach was not reported to Transportation Security Administration headquarters .
In that incident , TSA officials failed to report a security breach , when a screener did not sufficiently examine a passenger at a checkpoint .
The inspector general 's auditors also found that TSA officials at the airport became aware in January 2005 that they had not properly reported to headquarters some of the prohibited items that were being confiscated by their screeners -- namely box cutters and knives with blades of 3 inches or longer .
Federal officials say the TSA 's internal affairs unit and the inspector general 's office routinely examine the security of U.S. airports by sending undercover testers through passenger security checkpoints at U.S. airports -- with false identification , contraband or suspicious behavior .
From August 2003 until May 2004 , TSA officials and Covenant managers at the airport " notified screening personnel in advance when a tester was approaching a checkpoint and provided their descriptions , " the report states .
Officials in the airport 's screening control center tracked the undercover testers with surveillance cameras and on foot , the report said , and " broadcast descriptions and locations of testers to the checkpoints to assist supervisors in identifying testers and to facilitate passing the covert penetration tests . "
According to the report , the practice of notifying SFO passenger screeners in advance of covert testers stopped in May 2004 , when a Covenant employee in the airport 's screening control center refused to provide the descriptions and locations of testers and urged Covenant 's management to intervene .
However , the report said , TSA and Covenant officials continued until January 2005 to notify Covenant personnel in SFO 's screening control center " of the start of covert security testing and directed them to notify checkpoint - screening supervisors that covert security testing was beginning . "
After the inspector general 's undercover tests in January 2005 , TSA officials established a new protocol that prohibits anyone in the airport 's screening control center to notify checkpoint screening supervisors that covert testing has begun .
" We 've got some new internal mechanisms with Covenant so it wo n't happen again , and we have full confidence in Covenant , " TSA spokesman Nico Melendez said .
" At no time was the security of the airport in jeopardy . "
According to the report , TSA officials denied instructing Covenant personnel to tip off screeners about the location of testers or their methodologies .
However , Covenant employees provided evidence that the order to tip off screeners came from an unnamed TSA manager at the airport .
Phone calls to Covenant 's officers and managers in Illinois and San Francisco were not returned .
Tamara Faulkner , a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department 's inspector general , declined to elaborate on the audit .
" The reports stands by itself , " she said .
She said the office was contacted by TSA 's internal affairs unit in February 2005 to investigate the matter .
She said auditors pursued the case from May to October last year .
Question
Will I get caught and sent to jail if I hack a soda machine ?
Community Answer
If you are taking products from the machine , that is theft unless there is a good defense ( such as an emergency need for liquid during a hostage siege ) .
Nobody can say whether or not you 'll get caught but it 's always highly likely , with people and cameras around .
As to whether or not you will " go to jail " , that 's up to your legal counsel and the courts ; this is n't the place to get legal advice .
If it is possible to systematize the archetypal two guys in a garage ( and they are generally guys ) , the year - old Y Combinator wants to do it .
The company 's formula is to throw smart people together and provide them $ 6,000 in seed money per person to cover the initial costs of the company , cookie - cutter legal paperwork and an extensive network of business contacts .
In return , Mr. Graham and his partners -- Jessica Livingston , Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris -- collectively own 1.2 to 12 percent of the company , with an average of 6 percent a person .
The company holds two boot camps a year for about eight groups each session , a summer one in Cambridge and a winter one in Mountain View .
Y Combinator is not so much an incubator as a hatchery for baby companies , and as with all things spawned in bulk , some will die , some will flourish and some will eke by .
" Y Combinator comes down to two kids in a room with two computers and ramen noodles for a summer , " said Chris Sacca , a principal of new business development at Google and a speaker at Y Combinator 's one - day start - up school conference in October at Harvard .
" It takes ambitious geeks and puts them in a situation with no distraction and expects audacious outcomes from them .
The reason we like it is that that is what Google is . "
Indeed , Google has made acquisition overtures to one of the companies that was formed during the summer session , which the founders turned down .
Mr. Graham got the idea for starting Y Combinator after giving a talk to student entrepreneurs at Harvard , where he received his Ph.D. in computer science .
He told them to look for seed money from rich people they knew , preferably ones who had made their wealth from technology .
" Then I said , ' Not me , ' and they all looked kind of downcast and then I felt like a jerk , " he said .
Then , on reflection , Mr. Graham thought , why should n't he try to support young hackers ?
The goal for Y Combinator 's young entrepreneurs is twofold : to make something people want ( which is the company 's motto ) ; and to stretch their financing long enough for additional investment or to get acquired .
For instance , Mr. Graham 's former company , Viaweb , which made software to build commercial Web sites , was bought by Yahoo and reborn as store.yahoo.com .
One Y Combinator business created last summer , a company that uses cellphones for social networking , got financing from a venture capital firm .
Two other Y Combinator companies , a calendar Web site called Kiko.com and a news site , Reddit.com , received additional angel financing .
Y Combinator relies on certain premises : that open - source software and falling hardware prices means that tech start - ups are cheap to finance ; that large companies are no longer at the forefront of innovation ; and that mature technology companies find it cheaper to buy than to build .
The company takes its name from an obscure mathematical term , describing a function that generates other functions .
Y Combinator is a company that creates other companies -- a sly reference that would elicit a smile from a very narrow set of people , but luckily the same set that the company is trying to appeal to .
It is the philosophical triumph of the passionate computer hacker over the uptight M.B.A .
With Ted Neward ’s recent post on the morass that is Object - Relational mapping , there has been a lot of discussion going around on the topic .
In the comments on Atwood ’s post on the subject , some commenters ask why put data in a relational database .
Why not use an object database ?
The Relational Model is a general theory of data management created by Edgar F. Codd based on predicate logic and set theory .
As such , it has a firm mathematical foundation for storing data with integrity and for efficiently pulling data using set based operations .
Also , as a timeless mathematical theory it has no specific ties to any particular framework , platform , or application .
Now enter object databases which I am intrigued by , but have yet to really dig into .
From what I have read ( and if I am off base , please enlighten me ) these databases allow you to store your object instances directly in the database , probably using some sort of serialization format .
Seems to me this could introduce several problems .
First , it potentially makes set based operations that are not based on the object model inefficient .
For example , to build a quick ad - hock report , I would have to write some code to traverse the object hierarchy , which might not be an efficient means to obtaining the particular data .
Perhaps an object query language would help mitigate or even solve this .
I do n’t know .
Another issue is that your data is now more opaque .
There are all sorts of third party tools that work with relational data almost without regards to the database platform .
It is quite easy to take Access and generate a report against an existing SQL database or to use other tools for exporting data out of a relational database .
But since object oriented databases lack a formal mathematical foundation , it may be difficult to create a standard for connecting to and querying object databases that every vendor will agree on .
One last issue is more big picture .
It seems to me it ties the data too much to the current code implementation .
I have worked on a project that was originally written in classic ASP with no objects .
The code I wrote used .NET and objects to access the same data repository .
Fortunately , since the data was in a normalized relational database , it was not a problem to understand the data simply from looking at a schema and load it into my new objects .
How would that work with an object database ?
If I stored my Java objects in an OO database today , would I be able to load that data into my .NET objects tomorrow without having to completely change the database ?
What about in the future when I move on from .NET objects to message oriented programming or agent oriented programming ?
Ultimately , the choice between an OO database and a relational database really depends on the particular requirements of the project at hand .
However the thought of tying an application to an OO database at this point in time gives me reason to pause .
This could lock me into a technology that works today , but is superseded tomorrow .
On several projects I have worked on , we totally revamped the core technology ( typically ASP to ASP.NET ) , but we rarely scrapped and recreated the database .
The database engine might change over the years ( Sql 6.5 to Sql 7 to Sql 2000 to Sql 2005 ) , but the data model survives .

This application factors numbers or numeric expressions using two fast algorithms : the Elliptic Curve Method ( ECM ) and the Self - Initializing Quadratic Sieve ( SIQS ) .
The program uses local storage to remember the progress of the factorization , so you can complete the factorization of a large number in several sessions .
Your computer will remember the state of the factorization .
You only have to reload this page .
Since all calculations are performed in your computer , you can disconnect it from the Internet while the factorization is in progress .
You can even start this application without Internet connection after the first run .
The source code is written in C programming language and compiled to asm.js and WebAssembly , which are the languages used by Web navigators .
The latter is faster , but it is not supported in all Web browsers .
You can see the version while a number is being factored .
See factorization records for this application .

You can use the prefix 0x for hexadecimal numbers , for example 0x38 is equal to 56 .
Factoring using the Elliptic Curve Method ( ECM )
The notation k ≡ m ( mod n ) means that the remainder of the division of k by n equals the remainder of the division of m by n .
The number n is called modulus .
This method computes points in elliptic curves , which are represented by formulas such as y ² ≡ x ³ + a x + b ( mod n ) where n is the number to factor .
In the next graphic you can see the points ( x , y ) for which y ² ≡ x ³ + 4 x + 7 ( mod 29 ) holds .
Since the computation use modular arithmetic ( in this case using the remainder of the division by 29 ) , the points that belong to the elliptic curve cannot be represented as a continuous line .
That would be the case if the operations were performed in real numbers .
Apart from the points shown above , we use another point , named O , or point at infinity .
Using complex formulas , we can define a sum of points .
In this way a point ( x 3 , y 3 ) that belongs to the mentioned curve can be the sum of other points ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ) that also belong to the curve .
A point ( x , y ) can be added to itself several times , obtaining a new point ( x 4 , y 4 ) that is a multiple of ( x , y ) .
When the modulus is a prime number , and 4 a ³ + 27 b ² ≡ 0 ( mod p ) is not true , the points that belong to the elliptic curve ( including the point O ) form a mathematical structure called group .
The group order is the number of points .
In the graphic we can see 31 points , so the group order is 32 .
Since O + O = O , if we multiply any point by a multiple of the group order we obtain the point O . Even though the value of the group order is difficult to find , it can be shown that it is near the prime number used as the modulus .
By changing the curve , we obtain a different group , and its order also changes .
In order to factor a number n , we have to find a multiple of the group order corresponding to any of the prime factors of n .
For each elliptic curve to process we try to find the point at infinity .
There are two steps .
In the first step , the algorithm multiplies points by powers of different prime numbers less than a bound named B1 .
When computing the greatest common divisor between the coordinate x of the computed point and the number to factor we can obtain the prime number we are searching if all prime factors of the group order are less than B1 .
Using the result of the first step , the second step obtains multiples of that point up to the upper bound B2 , and we multiply the coordinates x of all points found in this step .
Finally we compute the gratest common divisor between the product and the number to factor .
In this case we can obtain the prime number we are searching if all prime factors ( except one ) of the group order are less than B1 and the greatest prime factor of the group order is less than B2 .
If the greatest common divisor equals 1 , we have to try with a different curve by changing the parameters a and b and computing an initial point ( x , y ) that belongs to the new curve .
The program uses many optimizations that are outside the scope of this help to explain them here .
The execution time depends on the magnitude of the second largest prime factor and on your computer speed .
Optimal values of B1 and expected curves Digits Values of B1 Expected curves 15 2000 25 20 11000 90 25 50000 300 30 250000 700 35 1 000000 1800 40 3 000000 5100 45 11 000000 10600 50 43 000000 19300 55 110 000000 49000 60 260 000000 124000 65 850 000000 210000 70 2900 000000 340000
The program runs 25 curves with limit B1 = 2000 , 300 curves with limit B1 = 50000 , 1675 curves with limit B1 = 1000000 and finally it uses curves with limit B1 = 11000000 until all factors are found .
Factoring a number in several machines
The ECM factoring algorithm can be easily parallelized in several machines .
In order to do it , run the factorization in the first computer from curve 1 , run it in the second computer from curve 10000 , in the third computer from curve 20000 , and so on .
In order to change the curve number when a factorization is in progress , press the button named More , type this number on the input box located on the new window and press the New Curve button .
When one of the machines discovers a new factor , you should enter this factor in the other computers by typing it in the bottom - right input box and pressing Enter ( or clicking the Factor button ) .
Factoring using the Self Initializing Quadratic Sieve ( SIQS )
The notation k ≡ m ( mod n ) means that the remainder of the division of k by n equals the remainder of the division of m by n .
The number n is called modulus .
Let N be the number to be factored .
This number must not be a perfect power .
If somehow we find two integers X and Y such that X ² ≡ Y ( mod N ) and X ≠ Y ( mod N ) , then gcd ( X + Y , N ) will reveal a proper factor of N .
In order to find these values X and Y , the method finds relations which have the form t ² ≡ u ( mod N ) where u is the product of small prime numbers .
The set of these primes is the factor base .
These relations will be found using sieving , which is outside the scope of this introduction .
The relations found are combined using multiplications .
The left hand side will always be a square because it is a product of squares , so the goal is to have a square at the right hand side .
A number is a square when all its prime factors appear an even number of times .
For example : let the number to factor be N = 1817 and we have found the following relations with factor base = { 2 , 7 , 13} : 45 ² ≡ 24 × 70 × 131 123² ≡ 210 × 70 × 131 Both relations have non-square RHS , since the exponent of 13 is not even .
But multiplying them we get : 84 ² ≡ 214 × 13 ² 84 ² ≡ ( 27×13 ) ² Since 27×13 ≡ 1664 we get the factor gcd ( 84+1664 , 1817 ) = 23 .
Which relations have to multiplied to find a square in the RHS is a linear algebra problem and it is solved using matrices .
When the number to be factorized is in the range 31 to 95 digits , after computing some curves in order to find small factors , the program switches to SIQS ( if the checkbox located below the applet enables it ) , which is an algorithm that is much faster than ECM when the number has two large prime factors .
Since this method needs a large amount of your computer 's memory to store relations , if you restart the applet the factorization begins from scratch .
In order to start factoring immediately using SIQS , you can enter 0 in the New Curve box .
Threshold for switching to SIQS Digits 31 - 55 56-60 61-65 66-70 71-75 76-80 81-85 86-90 91-95 Curve 10 15 22 26 35 50 100 150 200

Happy birthday , one and all
It was a familiar frustration that led to the invention of the modern ball - point pen - leaky ink .
In 1938 , Hungarian newspaper journalist Laszlo Biro noticed the ink used on the printing presses dried quickly and so tried using it in a fountain pen to avoid the problem of leaks , blots and smudges .
But the ink was too thick to flow into the nib .
So Biro , with the help of his brother , a chemist , devised a pen tipped with a metal ball bearing that used capillary action to draw ink through the rotating ball .
They brought their invention with them when they fled to the West during a crackdown on Jews later that year .
A British firm took over the patent to produce pens for the RAF , and the first Biros went on sale in the UK 60 years ago this week .
Barring tweaks and improvements , the pen is still recognisable as the ball - point Biro devised to make writing easier , and it regularly features in top 100 design lists , says Libby Sellers , the curator of the Design Museum .
" It has worked so well for so long that you stop noticing it .
It does what it says it should be doing , like the paper clip and the Post - It note . "
But was it revolutionary ?
" That 's a big word , but it made writing easier .
No longer did you need to worry about ink spills or refills .
To be mobile and reliable are two amazing things to be able to accommodate into such a small and humble object .
" What is remarkable is Biro 's lateral thinking in bringing existing technologies together to create an everyday object that everyone could write with .
Ball bearings already existed .
Quick - drying ink already existed .
And so did roller - balls , in deodorants . "
Pen or pencil ?
Among the first Britons to use the pens were the RAF 's fighter pilots , for whom the pens proved something of a revelation .
" Fountain pens can explode or at least leak at high altitudes , so to have a reliable pen with you in the cockpit to note down important markers helped win the war , " says Miss Sellers .
What about pencils ?
" You have to sharpen pencils , they 're not as user - friendly . "
There is an old and oft - repeated rumour that because standard pens do n't work in zero- gravity , Nasa spent millions devising a space pen , while the Russians used pencils .
But this has been debunked , not least because - strange to say - pencils pose dangers in space , from broken - off tips floating about and graphite and wood being flammable in a pure oxygen atmosphere .
And it was not Nasa which developed the space pen , but inventor Paul Fisher , and it was adopted by both sides in the space race by 1968 .
Fit for purpose
While not the first everyday object in which manufacturers made a priority of user convenience , the Bic Biro is a fine example of what happens when an object is designed to make something that is easy to use .
I get asked to do artworks on trainers and T - shirts , so it 's great that it does n't wash off
Artist Jon Burgerman
Nor does she see the pens being superseded by technology .
Yes , a passing thought can easily be typed into a handheld device or a text message , but a ball - point does n't need batteries to work .
It needs ink , but most have long since been lost , borrowed or stolen before running out .
The one thing that has n't been cracked is washable ink - as anyone who has inadvertently left a ball - point pen in a pocket will attest .
For artist Jon Burgerman , who specialises in Biro works ( see Internet links , right ) , that is part of the pen 's charm .
" It 's the ingenious rolling of that little ball .
If you put one in your bag without a lid , you 're asking for it .
" I like that the ink 's indelible - I get asked to do artworks on trainers and T - shirts , so it 's great that it does n't wash off .
It 's easy to customise stuff without bothering with fabric paints .
That 's invaluable for me , as a poor artist .
I like Biros , pens are my friends . "
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
With apologies to John Burgerman , anyone doubting the ability to create truly artistic works with a humble ballpoint pen should look at Henry Moore 's drawings of sheep .
Malcolm Parker , Basingstoke
The first Biro pens cost about a pound in the 1940s , not much different from the price of a good fountain pen .
The other thing I remember from the early days is that our schoolteachers were dead against Biro pens because they were supposed to have a bad effect on handwriting .
Malcolm Baird , Hamilton , Canada
I often say that Mr Biro is one of my personal heroes .
Why ?
Because I 'm left - handed .
They make a huge difference .
Emma Stace , Coulsdon , UK
According to Stephen Fry on QI , normal biros work fine in zero gravity .
So why did Paul Fisher bother to develop the space pen ?
Or would I be write ( please excuse the pen , I mean pun ) in thinking the use of the word " space " was merely a mark - it - ing tool ?
I 'll get my coat .
DS , Bromley , England
Fair point about the pencils , but that 's precisely why you DON'T use a pure oxygen environment in a spaceship ... three men burnt to death on the launch pad in Apollo 1 and Nasa switched to an air atmosphere after that .
Pure oxygen is far too dangerous .
Peter , Nottingham
Sorry ball - point - pen .
I 'm two years older than you and I still prefer fountain pens ( they have washable ink ) and pencil ( easily erased ) .
Enjoy your fame and I 'll continue to retain my individuality .

' Surge ' needs up to 7,000 more troops WASHINGTON  President Bush 's planned escalation of U.S. forces in Iraq will require as many as 28,500 troops , Pentagon officials told a Senate committee Thursday .
Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England also told the Senate Budget Committee that it will be clear within months whether the so - called surge in forces has succeeded in helping secure Iraq .
" By this summer we would have a much better indication in terms of the success of the program , " England said .
" And so at that time we would adjust however is appropriate to do so . "
In January , Bush said he would send 21,500 more combat troops to Iraq .
England said 6,000 to 7,000 support troops will be needed to back up the larger combat force .
England 's estimate differed from the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate last month that as many as 28,000 extra troops would be needed to support the escalation .
Requests already have been granted for 2,400 support troops , said Adm.
Edmund Giambastiani , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
He said there are additional requests for 4,000 more .
Existing logistics bases , many of them in and around Baghdad , will limit the number of new support troops needed , Giambastiani said .
There are about 10,000 soldiers in Iraq now associated with the escalation , according to Lt. Col.
Carl Ey , an Army spokesman .
In all , there are about 140,000 U.S. troops now in Iraq .
The increase in troops is expected to peak in May , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Pentagon officials stressed that the additional troops will be properly equipped .
Army Brig .
Gen. Charles Anderson , director of force modernization , said in a briefing this week that they will have the body and vehicle armor they need .
Giambastiani also said the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had affected the military 's ability to deal with threats from other countries but not its ability to win a conflict .
" What will happen is there will be some added risk with regard to the time it takes us to be victorious or to win , " he said .
" And , potentially , you 'll have some additional casualties .
But let there be no mistake :
We can get our job done if another crisis comes about . "
Meanwhile , top members of the Senate Budget Committee scoffed at Pentagon estimates that the escalation would cost $ 5.6 billion .

Review : KFC Famous Bowl by Jeff Kay I like to mix my food together , I ’m that kind of guy .
Even as a kid I ’d routinely shove everything into the middle of the plate , and toss it like a salad .
It made for an unpredictable and often delicious surprise , and it ’s something I do to this day .
I ’m a natural born mixer .
My brother , on the other hand , would see this happening and react like he was viewing grisly crime scene photographs ; he ’d literally recoil in horror .
My brother is the type who requires at least an inch - wide barrier between every item on his plate .
If , through some unforeseen series of events , a green bean would happen to come in contact with the gravy , everything was ruined .
May as well just toss it all in the garbage , ballgame ’s over .
I also had an uncle who ’d become physically ill if someone put cream in their coffee and did n’t stir it right away .
He ’d sit there with beads of sweat popping out on his forehead , then finally crack beneath the pressure : “ Stir it !
For the love of all that ’s holy , stir your coffee ! ! ”
But that does n’t really have anything to do with this .
When we began seeing TV ads for the so - called KFC “ Famous Bowl , ” which was reportedly a mixture of mashed potatoes , gravy , corn , cheese , and chicken , I thought : yum .
At the same time my wife ’s lower jaw would retract , and she ’d holler , “ Damn , that ’s disgusting !
I would n’t feed that slop to a starving dog .
… Is this Comedy Central ? ? ” I guess I ’m in a mixed - marriage ?
That ’s been several months , and I never found myself in a situation where I was able to sample that delicious - looking bowl of “ slop . ”
There are only two known KFCs in our area , and both are pretty far off the beaten path .
They ’re in parts of town you only visit when , say , you need your propane tank filled , or an emergency window - tinting .
Plus , as detailed in the review here , I ’m not really a huge fan of the former Kentucky Fried Chicken , and never felt a strong urge to seek one out .
I had a vague interest in their “ bowl , ” but not enough to put forth any actual effort in purchasing one .
I wanted one , but not enough to work for it .
Until last week , that is .
For reasons unknown , KFC appears to be advertising their Famous Bowl as a brand new menu item again , and this time they got me .
I was out running errands one day , and the commercial suddenly began playing inside my head .
Without realizing what was happening , I ’d whipped the steering wheel violently to the right and was headed for Tintsville .
I was under the impression there are now two bowls : one with chicken on the top , and another with country fried steak , or somesuch .
But the KFC in Upper Propane Township only offered the chicken variety .
Not a problem , since I ’d planned on going with the classic version anyway , but where ’d I get such a notion ?
Had I dreamed it ?
Sweet Jesus , please tell me I was n’t dreaming about steak bowls … .
A surly teenage girl , wearing the expression of someone smelling turds , passed my lunch to me through a window and thoughtfully included a packet containing a napkin and a spork .
I peeked into the sack with anticipation , and the plastic dome over the bowl was fogged - up and dripping with the condensation of brown gravy .
Double yum !
When I got home our dog
Andy sniffed the bag of food I was carrying , and his eyes almost popped out of his head .
I ’d never seen such a reaction from that hound .
He began whimpering and turning tight circles in the middle of the floor ….
I hoped he would n’t just say screw it , give in to the chicken frenzy , and make a leap for my throat .
But he was right , that thing was putting off one helluva beautiful aroma , and I could n’t wait to get at it .
I sat down at the dining room table , broke the seal on my cutlery bag , and lifted the dome off my lunch .
And before you click the link to see the photograph of what was contained within , please take a second to review the KFC website representation of the Famous Bowl at the top of this column .
See it ?
Now look at this .
My stomach sank .
It appeared to have already been eaten at least once .
It looked like a pipin ’ hot bowl of vomit .
But , of course , I ate it anyway .
And it was good , really good .
The chicken was tender and tasty , not the kind with the hard breading that tears holes in your gums , or anything like that .
The gravy was delicious , the corn buttery , and there was so much sodium and fat my heart is still cutting in and out – and it ’s the arrhythmia of love .
If they could maybe dress it up a little , and get away from the insinuation of fresh barf , I think the public would embrace the Famous Bowl .
Not my wife , needless to say , but the part of the population that lives in the moment , and never bothers with such fancy - pants information as this .
I give the KFC Famous Bowl a solid B , docked a bit for its off - putting appearance .
And , for the record , Andy is still not acting quite right .
Further fast food shenanigans
Na poziv Stanovanjskega sklada RS ( SSRS ) se je odzvalo sedem bank , ki so skupaj zaprosile za 15.000 varčevalnih lotov .
Odziv bank je precej zadržan , saj jih je v prejšnjih razpisih sodelovalo trinajst , poleg tega so izkoristile vse razpoložljive lote , tokrat pa jih je 5000 še ostalo .
Na skladu previdnosti bank niso komentirali , direktor SSRS Primož Pirc pa meni , da " nacionalna stanovanjska shema še vedno ostaja primeren način varčevanja za reševanje stanovanjskega vprašanja mladih družin , prvih iskalcev stanovanja , skratka vseh tistih , katerim je treba pomagati , da si uredijo svoje bivanjske težave " .
Na skladu zato pričakujejo dober odziv bodočih varčevalcev , na tak način pa bi tudi prepričali banke , da pogumneje prevzamejo svojo vlogo v varčevalni shemi .
Ta namreč privlači mlade varčevalce , ki so za banke hkrati zanimivi kot morebitni bodoči komitenti .
Po besedah Pirca bo sklad javni poziv za dolgoročno varčevanje v NSVS objavil v soboto , 9 . septembra , sklepanje varčevalnih pogodb pa bo potekalo od 2 . oktobra dalje na sedmih izbranih bankah .
En lot bo vreden 12.000 tolarjev ( 50,08 evra ) , varčevalci pa bodo tako kot v prejšnji shemi lahko sklenili varčevalno pogodbo za več lotov .
Poglavitna novost prenovljene sheme je nižja letna premija države ( z 1/12 se je znižala na 1/24 letno privarčevanega zneska ) , pogoj zanjo pa je namenska poraba privarčevanih sredstev ali posojila ter najmanj deset plačanih obrokov na leto .
Obrestne mere se bodo spreminjale vsako leto , pri večjih odstopanjih pa tudi med letom .
Osnova zanje je 75 odstotkov tržne donosnosti državnih obveznic , obresti za posojilo so višje za odstotek ( po sedanjih izračunih so varčevalne obresti 3,1 , posojilne pa 4,1 odstotka ) .
Obdobje varčevanje je gibljivo in lahko traja od pet do deset let .
It ’s taken several years during which she ’s called for the conquering and conversion to Christianity of the entire Muslim world , and used the phrase “ raghead ” to describe every Muslim , but it seems that conservatives are finally beginning to realize that Ann Coulter is someone they do n’t want to be associated with :
The legendary conservative thinker Richard Weaver wrote a book entitled Ideas Have Consequences .
Rush Limbaugh has said again and again that â€œwords mean things .â€ 
Both phrases apply to Coulterâ€™s awful remarks .
Coulterâ€™s vicious word choice tells the world she care little about the feelings of a large group that often feels marginalized and despised .
Her word choice forces conservatives to waste time defending themselves against charges of homophobia rather than advancing conservative ideas .
Within a day of Coulterâ€™s remark John Edwards sent out a fundraising email that used Coulterâ€™s words to raise money for his faltering campaign .
She is helping those she claims to oppose .
How does that advance any of the causes we hold dear ?
Denouncing Coulter is not enough .
After her â€œragheadâ€ remark in 2006 she took some heat .
Yet she did not grow and learn .
We should have been more forceful .
This year she used a gay slur .
What is next ?
If Senator Barack Obama is the de facto Democratic Presidential nominee next year will Coulter feel free to use a racial slur ?
How does that help conservatism ?
It does n’t , of course .
And the more conservatives come to realize that the reactionary ideas of people like Ann Coulter and Pat Buchanan do n’t help them , the more they may come realize that the conservative - libertarian alliance that seemed to come into it ’s own during the Reagan Administration ( only to be snuffed out by Bush 41 and people like Pat Buchanan ) is the only hope for political viability that conservatives have today .
Basically , conservatives have two choices .
They can talk , and govern , like Ronald Reagan ; in which case they may actually have a chance of winning .
Or they can talk like Ann Coulter ; in which case they have no chance at all .
Update :
In addition to denunciations from her fellow conservatives , it looks like Coulter will pay a financial price for her stupid comments :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
At least three major companies want their ads pulled from Ann Coulter ’s Web site , following customer complaints about the right - wing commentator referring to Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards as a “ faggot . ”
Verizon , Sallie Mae and Georgia - based NetBank each said they did n’t know their ads were on AnnCoulter.com until they received the complaints .
Good .
Editors Note :
There is often some confusion between this definition of the ego and Freuds definition .
This is addressed in The Confusion About Ego .
This is your consciousness and your awareness .
It is beautiful , perfect , and peaceful .
It is the I inside you , the “ I ” that controls your body , mind , and emotions .
It is the true I am .
It is what you were before life happened to you .
This is what covers your inner peace .
Your ego has stepped in , and life has left its scars .
Your peace and your beauty have been obscured by countless scars ugly marks that cover up your true consciousness .
( Now that Ive got your awe and attention with my stupendous Photoshop skills , I ’d like to add that this is a seriously long post nearly 6000 words .
It is also my favourite and most heartfelt so far , but youll get your moneys worth from reading it . )
Note :
Ive also split this post up into pages , so dont forget to read the other pages !
The ego that obscures your peace
What are these blotches that mar your perfection ?
They represent the little things that you take for who you are :
Your likes , dislikes , loves , hatreds .
They are the history that you ca n’t let go of .
They are your memories , your hopes and dreams .
They are your little habits , your hobbies , your mannerisms .
All these , each one a mark , combine to make your personality , your ego , your identity .
But what is your personality ?
It is something that you have mistaken for yourself .
Almost everybody does they dont know any better .
Ask anybody who they are , and most likely they will tell you their name , their age , their job , their race , their gender , their history , dreams , likes and dislikes .
They define themselves by these .
These are all part of your personality .
But they are merely about you .
But they are not you .
They merely describe you , but somehow we have reduced ourselves to these descriptions , these little details .
We have forgotten who we are ; weve forgotten the true core and consciousness that has been covered by all these details .
And its sad , because the core contains everything we seek everything we look for in the goals we chase unshakeable peace and joy .
Read this post , and then read all the previous posts even the ones based on modern psychology , whether they are on anger , sadness , forgiveness or happiness youll find this truth hidden in there somewhere .
Stop the thoughts before they overtake you .
Stop the emotions before they take you over .
Stop the ego from telling you that things shouldnt be this way .
They all lead to one teaching stop the ego from marring your peace .
Most methods , from old religions , to modern psychology , are based around this they just describe it in a different way .
Either that or they are ignorant of the core consciousness and dont mention it .
Since the canard that since Mars is warming anthropogenic warming here on earth must be false pops up again and again ( like in whack - a - mole ) , I think it appropriate to post something about it .
The only thing possibly linking a warming on Earth and Mars ( if there were a common cause ) is variations of the sun ’s radiation .
This has n’t changed much in at least the last 30 years , apart from the 11 year solar cycle :
It is clearly visible that even those cyclic changes are small – about 1 W / m2 .
To compare with forcings by the greenhouse effect , this has to divided by four , because the 1367 W/m2 apply only to a surface perpendicular to the direction of the sun ( like at the equator without absorption by the atmosphere ) , while forcings are calculated for the whole surface of the earth .
The greenhouse forcings ( the additional effect by manmade GHGs ) are at about 1.5 W/m2 .
Compare this with 0.25 – and it is irrelevant anyway , because these changes go up and down .
Moreover , in the last few years , it has gone down , not up .
But we just observed the warming on Mars in just those last few years .
Now there is a new paper ( for those fortunate enough to have a subscription ) published in Nature that explains the warming trend on Mars with changes in the albedo .
It is cited in Scientific American :
Snapshots over the past three decades have shown vast regions of the Red Planet ’s surface have brightened or darkened by 10 percent or more , reflecting about 20 percent of incoming sunlight in total .
To determine if albedo ( reflectivity ) changes affect the climate , researchers compared Viking orbiter photos from 1976 to 1978 , which mapped the planet ’s bright and dark spots , to those from 1999 to 2000 , when the Mars Global Surveyor discovered a darker Mars .
See also this post by William M. Connolley .
Changes in albedo can have an effect .
I have a small C program that calculates the expected temperature with
T = pow ( ( solconst / (d * d ) ) /( 4* SIGMA ) *( 1.0 - albedo ) , 0.25 ) ;
With the values d ( distance ) = 1.53 AU , solconst = 1367 W/m2 ( at 1 AU ) , SIGMA = 5.6704 ×10−8 ( metric ) , and albedo = 0.16 the temperature gets 215.65 K ( - 57.5C ) .
With just 1 percent point increase in albedo ( 0.17 ) it gets 215.00 K ( - 58.14C ) .
We disregard the greenhouse effect on Mars here – which is there , but small ( the average temperature on Mars is about 10 degrees higher ) .
Now that the iPhone has moved from rumor limbo into the land of the living ( at least we think so -- how many people have actually touched one ? ) , we obviously need another mythical mobile to drool over and speculate about -- and the natural candidate is , of course , the so - called Google phone .
While the big G has been making inroads on your handset with mobile versions of its search , email , and mapping software for some time , there has been growing speculation that the company is working on its own hardware -- speculation that only intensified when we published that pic of a supposed Google / Samsung collaboration called the Switch ( pictured above , as a refresher ) .
Well the latest juicy G - phone morsels to hit our plate come courtesy of Simeon Simeonov ( no relation to the deceased Bulgarian soccer player , we think ) and his HighContrast blog , whose always - reliable " inside source " broke down some of the anticipated specs .
According to Simeonov 's tipster , we can expect a " Blackberry - like , slick device " ( QWERTY ? ) running Java on a C++ core with perhaps a Linux bootstrap .
For graphics , Google is said to be leveraging the 2005 purchase of little known company name Skia that developed a 2D engine capable of rendering " state - of - the - art " images on low - power devices .
Finally , Google is said to be offering carriers a deal wherein the search giant will sell and market the phone online , relying on the carriers for their networks only and subsequently driving down their costs .
Combined with Google 's tradition of offering almost everything for free , there 's a good chance that you 'll be able to pick up your G - phone for much less than your precious iPhone -- although lets hope the tradeoff is n't being forced to listen to ads every time we want to make a damn call .
Scientists may soon have a new tool in the annual fight against the flu .
It ’s called the FluChip , and it could help to quickly recognize and track flu virus infections as they race across the globe , according to a study published in a recent issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology .
Biochemists Kathy Rowlen and Robert Kuchta of the University of Colorado designed the FluChip to identify flu samples in seven to eight hours .
Current methods take several days .
An even faster version of the chip , which would work in two hours , is in development , according to Kuchta .
The FluChip matches DNA from a flu sample to bits of genetic material from previously identified flu viruses .
It works like a microscopic pegboard , with known flu genes attached to the tips of the pegs .
When the chip is dipped into a flu sample , bits of the sample ’s DNA stick to the pegs with matching flu DNA .
After scientists determine which pegs the sample has bound to , the flu virus can be quickly identified .
The chip , which the scientists hope will be in production within a year , will be useful to public health organizations , like the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control .
It will help the WHO and CDC track the demographics of the disease , including strain , location and the timescale of the virus as it spreads , said Kuchta .
Kuchta also said that the FluChip will help health organizations design vaccines for emerging strains of the virus .
Components of flu vaccines are changed every year depending on flu strains circulating in Southeast Asia the year before .
Scientists can also modify the FluChip to identify new strains of flu virus , according to Kuchta .
“ The chip is very dynamic .
If a strain came out that the chip had trouble with , it would be simple for us to put new sequences on it to make it work better , ” he said .
Despite its potential benefits , however , the FluChip still faces significant hurdles .
A new study found that the chip was only effective 72 percent of the time in identifying flu viruses provided by the CDC .
Its accuracy rate was even lower - 50 percent - when used on samples taken directly from patients .
The relatively low accuracy rates are due to the challenges of working with viruses , which have limited amounts of genetic material and are short lived .
The FluChip was more effective in analyzing the CDC - supplied samples , Kuchta said , because “ the CDC samples had a lot of virus in them .
There were many fewer viruses in the patient samples . ”
Also , virus concentrations in patient samples decrease over time , according to David Evans , Chairman of the Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department at the University of Alberta in Canada .
“ By the time you get a clinical specimen , much of the virus may have disappeared , ” he said .
This makes the amplification step , which is performed before using the FluChip to make many copies of the viral DNA , crucial .
“ The amplification steps are a challenge , ” said Kuchta , who acknowledged that amplification takes up most of the seven to eight hours currently needed for the FluChip to work .
Evans , who has tried to develop similar flu- identifying chips , said that in part due to amplification difficulties , he is no longer pursuing this research and remains “ unconvinced that it ’s the right technology for the problem . ”
Kuchta , however , is sticking with his FluChip .
He said his lab is currently working on ways to improve the amplification process and is also looking into the possibility of eliminating amplification altogether by “ developing completely novel technologies that could have a huge impact for all gene chips . ”
Unsatisfied about a new product you 've just bought ?
Frustrated about the bad service big corporations offer you ?
Why not use the internet to show the world about it ?
That 's exactly what Captain Eric Wright from the US army just did .
Mr Wright , which is presently stationed in Iraq , had some problems with an HP printer he was using extensively .
Here ’s what happened :
" OK HP , I 've got a printer over here I 've been using to help do my job , to protect your freedom .
I call you up the other day because my printer 's broken , and you want me to pay you to tell me how to fix it .
I got something for you . "
After being circulated on the Internet for a while , this video was screened by some people at HP , which immediately decided to send Captain Wright a replacement unit .
The moral of this story ?
When companies refuse to give you support for a product under warranty , show the world about it !

Everyone wants to be a hero .
Techies especially so .
And there are special occasions where true glory awaits the hero .
When there ’s a crisis , it can pay to just carry on no matter what .
Get the problem solved and celebrate victory .
Winning through shear effort .
But most days are not like that .
Most features need not heroes .
They need realists .
People who are willing to give up and walk away .
Being a hero is all about sitting aside all costs and winning anyway .
That ’s not a prudent way to drive everyday development .
Here ’s the problem :
You agree that feature X can be done in two hours .
But four hours into it , you ’re still only a quarter of the way done .
The natural instinct is to think “ but I ca n’t give up now , I ’ve already spent four hours on this ! ” .
So you go into hero mode .
Determined to make this work , but also embarrassed that it is n’t already so .
So the hero grabs his hermit cape and isolates himself from feedback .
“ I really need to get this done , so I ’ll turn off IM , Campfire , email , and more for now ” .
And some times that works .
Throwing sheer effort at the problem to get it done .
But was it worth it ?
Probably not .
The feature was deemed valuable at a cost of two hours , not sixteen .
Sixteen hours of work could have gotten four other things done that individually were at least as important .
And you had to cut the feedback loop to avoid feeling too much shame , which is never a good thing to do .
That ’s where the concept of sunk cost gives us a guide on what to do .
It does n’t matter what you ’ve already spent .
That time and money is gone .
It only matters whether spending what ’s left is worth it or not .
Business school 101 , but one of the hardest lessons to internalize .
In other words , stop being so afraid of calling it quits .
You ’re playing to win the full season , not a single game .
Every time you play the hero card , you ’re jeopardizing the next game .
Heroics are for when you have no other choice .
When you can afford to take on tremendous risk because there ’s no alternative .
That ’s probably not today .
Sol LeWitt , whose deceptively simple geometric sculptures and drawings and ecstatically colored and jazzy wall paintings established him as a lodestar of modern American art , died yesterday in New York .
He was 78 and lived mostly in Chester , Conn .
The cause was complications from cancer , said Susanna Singer , a longtime associate .
Mr. LeWitt helped establish Conceptualism and Minimalism as dominant movements of the postwar era .
A patron and friend of colleagues young and old , he was the opposite of the artist as celebrity .
He tried to suppress all interest in him as opposed to his work ; he turned down awards and was camera - shy and reluctant to grant interviews .
He particularly disliked the prospect of having his photograph in the newspaper .
Typically , a 1980 work called “ Autobiography ” consisted of more than 1,000 photographs he took of every nook and cranny of his Manhattan loft , down to the plumbing fixtures , wall sockets and empty marmalade jars , and documented everything that had happened to him in the course of taking the pictures .
But he appeared in only one photograph , which was so small and out of focus that it is nearly impossible to make him out .
His work — sculptures of white cubes , or drawings of geometric patterns , or splashes of paint like Rorschach patterns — tested a viewer ’s psychological and visual flexibility .
See a line .
See that it can be straight , thin , broken , curved , soft , angled or thick .
Enjoy the differences .
The test was not hard to pass if your eyes and mind were open , which was the message of Mr. LeWitt ’s art .
He reduced art to a few of the most basic shapes ( quadrilaterals , spheres , triangles ) , colors ( red , yellow , blue , black ) and types of lines , and organized them by guidelines he felt in the end free to bend .
Much of what he devised came down to specific ideas or instructions : a thought you were meant to contemplate , or plans for drawings or actions that could be carried out by you , or not .
B
y now , it ’s no secret that one of my favorite hobbies , besides collecting Beanie Babies and hunting mimes for sport , is binge drinking .
Liquor is like jewelry for the palate : so many colors , so many textures .
And like a piece of jewelry , the right drink can serve as the perfect accessory , whether you ’re fireside at a ski lodge , or in the women ’s bathroom stall at Hooters , trying to wash the taste of semen and wing sauce out of your mouth .
I like throwing back glasses in big stone houses , so to speak , but I do n’t have a lot of loyalty to one particular type of beverage .
I drink as the mood strikes me , moving from beer to shots to cocktails like a flitting bumblebee , trying to determine what flower ’s nectar will yield the best honey .
Sometimes , the right drink has netted me the best honey , too .
I admit , this is perhaps not the wisest way to drink .
Mixing up my beverages so defiantly might make a bold statement about fuck and you , but it ’s also a recipe for a killer hangover .
Nevertheless , there are times when you ’ve had enough beer and only a glass of sweet , sweet Manischevitz will satisfy your appetite for mayhem , if not your sense of religious identity .
The point is , as a generalist in the liquor arena and a slightly - paranoid social critic , I ’ve noticed that the drink you choose , as an accessory , says a lot about you .
Sure , there are easy stereotypes about beer - swilling frat boys and martini - sipping debutantes , but the scope of social commentary is as wide as the selection at the nearest bar .
So take a trip with me , wo n’t you , and discover what the drink in your hand says about joy in your heart .
Or complete lack thereof .
( N.B . All of these apply to bar situations .
What you drink in the privacy of your own home is between you and your 12 - Step sponsor .
Where necessary , I ’ve differentiated between men and women .
You ’ll thank me for this later . )
Wine
Wine has been around since ancient times , when it played a pivotal role in civic , social , religious , and governmental affairs .
Seemingly , very little has changed .
Nowadays , the wine you drink is likely to have been made from grapes stomped on by comically inept redheaded sitcom starlets .
Best not to think about that .
As Jerry Seinfeld might have observed , “ There ’s red wine … and there ’s white wine … but there ’s no green wine .
There are green grapes … what ’s up with that ? ”
What it says about you :
Red : ( Women ) I ’m traditional , in a 2.4 kids , suburban sort of way .
And if I ’m not married already , I ’m dreaming of the day I can pile my kids into the minivan after soccer practice .
In other words , avoid me at all costs , unless you enjoy the sensation of boredom .
White : ( Men ) I ’m pretty classy , but not a show - off .
I might be some kind of undercover secret agent , trying not to draw attention to myself .
Or I might just be waiting for my chance to slip the Rohypnol into your drink .
Beer
Beer has a long and interesting history .
Enough said .
What it says about you :
Domestic : ( Men ) I ’m low - maintenance , easy - going , and maybe a little uncouth .
I enjoy watching sports , and do n’t expect much out of life .
That said , I ’m probably having more fun than anybody else in here .
( Women ) I ’m a lot of fun , unpretentious , and think I ’m confident .
That ca n’t last , so go ahead and treat me like a doormat .
Imported : I have more panache and am statistically more likely to buy a woman a drink .
There ’s a good chance I am in fact a beer snob , and wo n’t order any beer that is n’t spelled with at least two umlauts .
In other words , you ca n’t even pronounce the beer I ’m drinking , let alone afford it .
Malt Liquor
Long demonized as “ liquid crack ” for the poor , unemployed , and possibly homeless , malt liquor has made a recent comeback of sorts , thanks in part to hip hop culture .
I know it ’s important to honor my dead homies and all , but if I ’m willingly tipping part of my drink on the ground , it better not cost more than $ 1.39 for a forty - ounce bottle .
Thankfully , malt liquor fits the bill .
What it says about you :
( Men ) I plan on getting drunk as quickly and cheaply as possible .
Perhaps I permanently lost my sense of taste fighting in Vietnam .
Hopefully , I ’ll have some money left over for my child support payment .
But do n’t kid yourself .
That money ’s earmarked for more Colt 45 .
( Women )
In about 10 minutes , I ‘ll be drunk enough to spread for you and your buddies , and I hope you do n’t mind pubic lice .
Also : Please enjoy my appearance on Flavor of Love 2 .
Vodka
Vodka is the workhorse of the hard liquors .
It is believed to have originated in the grain - growing region bounded by Belarus , Poland , Lithuania , and the Ukraine .
This is probably because people living there needed something to swill all day in order to quell the stench of decaying corpses and bear crap .
Nevertheless , vodka remains an enduring favorite thanks to its crisp purity and formidable alcohol content .
What it says about you :
Bloody Mary : I have a slightly exotic , possibly hippie air about me , and as an alcoholic , I need to find new and creative ways to work
vegetables into my diet
Cosmopolitan : ( Men ) I ’m gayer than Lance Bass in pink paisley underwear .
( Women ) I ’m a former sorority girl , and sometimes , I watch Sex in the City reruns .
In either case , better make a mental note of it , for
later .
Screwdriver : I ’m pretty new to the whole “ drinking ” thing but I heard about screwdrivers in a movie once .
Since orange juice is part of my wholesome complete breakfast , I ’m comfortable drinking this until science figures out a way to ferment bacon .
White Russian : I ’m sophisticated enough to drink sweet cocktails , but not sophisticated enough to order anything too threatening .
Additionally , I have a superhuman constitution that allows me to mix booze with milk without risk of puking until at least an hour from now , so enjoy my company while you can .
Red Bull & Vodka :
Go ahead and laugh if you want , but I ’ll still be dancing 6 hours from now when the clothes start flying , and you ’ll be asleep , wishing the room would stop spinning .
My erratic heartbeat is soon to be a cause for concern .
Tequila
For some , the very mention of tequila evokes sheer terror .
Since it ’s a product of Mexico , this is perfectly understandable .
Tequila is a type of distilled alcohol made from the agave plant .
As a Canadian , I do n’t know what the fuck agave is , but it kind of sounds like the name of a stripper .
Good or bad , everyone seems to have at least one tequila story .
If you ’ve ever heard mine , you ’ll know why I ’m not allowed at the zoo anymore .
What is says about you :
Straight : ( Women ) I ’m looking for a party .
Obnoxious dancing and / or girl - on - girl kissing are sure to follow .
This tequila might fuck me up bad , but at least I ’ll know I had a great night .
( Men ) I ’m still coordinated enough to do the thing with the lemon and the salt , but I wo n’t be for long .
If you want to take advantage of me , now ’s your chance .
Prairie Fire / TNT : ( Men ) I ’m trying to impress a girl , and probably failing miserably .
I ’ll regret it tomorrow , when the inner wall of my sphincter has a second - degree burn and farting causes me to black out in pain .
( Women ) I lost a bet .
Maybe I can dump this foul drink out in that fichus plant and no one will notice .
Margarita : ( Men ) I ’m just searching for my lost shaker of salt .
( Women ) I ’m whimsical , have a great sense of adventure , and do n’t mind trying new things .
Do n’t delve too deeply into my past , though .
There ’s a good chance I was on Girls Gone Wild .
Whiskey / Bourbon
Whiskey is traditionally favored by emotionally distant Irish fathers , and other stereotypes .
It ’s smoky , distinct , and a little rough around the edges .
The creation of whiskey is generally very complex , and involves things like grain mash and oak casks and vatted malts .
Since I do n’t know what any of that means , I ’m going to picture Brooke Hogan ’s D - List celebrity crotch for a while .
Mmmmm …
What is says about you :
Straight : I ’m a veteran cop who just saw my partner shot to death mere days before his retirement .
You can leave the bottle , buddy .
On the Rocks : ( Men ) I am a tough cookie ; men and women alike admire me .
It ’s entirely possible I wandered out of a movie from the 1950’s .
In any case , I can probably kick your ass , so do n’t fuck with me .
( Women ) Divorced at least twice , kids who do n’t visit , liver spots , reek of cigarettes , and failure impossible to remove .
Come and get me , boys !
Mint Julep : I am a feeble old man , and I may have thought this bar was the Kentucky Derby .
What ’s going on ?
Who stole my bifocals ?
Nurse !
Nurse !
Gin
Gin is a spirit flavored with juniper berries , which are kind of like the retarded step - children of the berry world .
A well - made gin will be relatively dry compared to other spirits , which does n’t bode well if you are using it as a lubricant .
Gin originated in the Netherlands in the 17th century , so if you really enjoy it , chances are you stuck your fingers into dikes in a former life .
What it says about you :
Gin and 7 - Up / Kool - Aid / Ginger
Ale / Juice : I ’m not 100 % sure I enjoy the taste of alcohol , so I ’m kind of hedging my bets .
This will probably be the only drink I touch all night , and it ’s not because I ’m the designated driver , either .
I ’m just a pussy .
Gin and Tonic : I live a fast - paced lifestyle with no time to dick around .
Even my drink of choice can be abbreviated to just two letters .
But beyond that , I ’m a fairly good drinker , and if some scumbag bartender waters down my drink , I ’ll notice .
Martini : ( Women )
I ’m either a truly classy person or else I wish to play one on TV .
Please notice me .
( Men ) I know how to play the game .
I do n’t mind making my drink orders unnecessarily complicated because I do n’t really respect anyone .
My next martini better contain an almond - stuffed olive .
Please use exactly 1.9 % less vermouth , and I want that bad boy stirred counter - clockwise .
Idiot .
Rum
Popular with novice drinkers , at beachside resorts , and among pirates , Rum can run the gamut from white to gold to dark .
This is also somewhat true of the people who produce it .
Most drinkers outgrow rum at some point , and it ’s not hard to see why .
Unless you ’re stuck at sea for weeks on end with only a bilge rat to sleep with , there ’s not much to recommend it .
What it says about you :
Cuba Libre / Rum & Coke : I ’m either a communist or I like drinks that are n’t too complicated , do n’t cost much , and taste the same no matter where I order one .
In other words , I ’m a communist .
Daiquiri : ( Women ) I was on vacation once , and I like to pretend I still am .
Also , check my driver ’s license to make sure I am in fact old enough to drink .
( Men ) I must be a space robot sent to infiltrate you puny humans , because no man with any kind of awareness is going to order such an emasculating earth drink .
Mojito :
My mother was once raped by a bartender .
So , as a means of revenge , I like to order the most complicated , finicky , labor - intensive drink I can think of .
That mint leaf better be chopped just right , and I want powdered sugar , not granulated .
God help you if I see one granule , Paco .
Piña Colada : I like shitty music .
And getting caught in the rain .
Others
Champagne : I am romantic , and do n’t care much what anyone thinks of me .
And if it ’s not already totally obvious , I ’m hoping to get laid tonight , and I likely will .
Sake : I am unbelievably pretentious .
It will be a miracle if I make it out of this bar without being stabbed with a cocktail umbrella .
Goldschläger : I hate myself .
Plus , the idea of ingesting gold flakes is appealing to me for some reason .
Fuzzy Navel : I like drinks that mask the taste if alcohol , and I ’m willing to sacrifice my dignity in order to enjoy them .
Please do n’t take me seriously .
Jägermeister : I ’m in college , possibly high school , and I wish to impress my macho friends .
I secretly hate Jägermeister , but do n’t tell anyone .
Brandy : I am a fictional character .
Shortly , we will retire to the drawing room , where I will reveal the identity of the murderer .
Absinthe : I have a death wish .
Essential New Word of the Week :
nay nay [ ‘ne ‘ ne ] interj :
Depending upon your intoxicant of choice , the ability to deflect abuse is critical .
I do n’t mean actual , reduce - Oprah - to - tears - abuse , but the friendly kind .
Having stuff thrown at you , being poked or tripped , that sort of thing .
When your defenses are down and you ’re too wasted to do anything but sit there and take it , you have to resort to creative measures to get it to stop .
A few weeks ago , I was at a party enjoying a deep buzz , and one of my more sober friends , a student of martial arts , launched an offensive by attempting to slap on , I do n’t know , some kind of atomic death lock .
He was really harshing that buzz , but I somehow knew that “ Stop it , asshole ! ” or “ Cut it out , douche ! ” would only make him redouble his efforts .
Thinking quickly , I yelled out “ nay nay ! ”
Now , I understand it ’s some obsolete form of “ no , no ” so it was n’t entirely off the mark .
But it was a random enough thing to say to get him to desist .
He could only laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of the utterance .
Lacking any sort of coordination , I turned humor and confusion into my weapons , and it worked perfectly .
So , if someone is doing something you want to stop , do n’t go the conventional route .
Tell him or her “ nay nay . ”
Afterall , the best defense is a puzzling offense .

The online retailer of books and just about everything else was awarded three new patents , covering its purchase circles , search and consumer reviews .
While Amazon.com 's patent police would go after Web publishers , not consumers , the review patent could put the kibosh on the social networking components of many search services .
Amazon.com 's purchase circles can be based on everything from a hobby to an employer , or they can merely peep to see what 's the hot book among Oracle employees .
The patent covers methods of forming circles and marketing to them , for example , by showing one person looking at a book detail page and who else in the circle has bought that book .
The second patent covers a method of discovering and delivering as search results related products from multiple categories , such as books written by Steve Martin , as well as DVDs of movies in which he appeared .
The third patent is the real kicker .
It covers methods for encouraging consumers to write reviews of items they 've purchased by determining the optimal times to send them e-mails or reminders .
Voting and Elections : Introduction
Posted October 2004 .
Feature Column Archive
1. Introduction
Everyone is familiar with the power of mathematics to solve problems in physics .
Though Galileo is recognized more as a physicist than a mathematician , he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Pisa ( 1589 - 1591 ) and the University of Padua ( 1592-1610 ) .
Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 ) makes any short list of both the greatest physicists and mathematicians of all time .
Other mathematicians who made significant contributions to mathematics and physics include Leonard Euler ( 1707 - 1783 ) , Laplace ( 1749 -1827 ) , and Gauss ( 1777 -1855 ) .
Mathematics has also had an important role to play in chemistry , geology and biology but what about mathematics and political science ?
Has mathematics had significant applications in political science ?
I believe so and in my discussion here I will deal with mathematical approaches to voting and elections .
Contributions of mathematics to voting began earlier than many people realize .
During the period of the French Revolution , two fascinating people with talent in mathematics , the Marquis de Condorcet ( 1743-1794 ) and Jean de Charles Borda ( 1733-1799 ) , raised important ideas related to voting systems .
Others who made contributions to mathematical ideas that involve elections include Charles Dodgson ( 1832-1898 ) , Duncan Black ( 1908 - 1991 ) , Kenneth Arrow , and John Kemeny ( 1926-1992 ) , and Steven Brams .
Dodgson was a professional mathematician at Oxford , in addition to being the author of Alice in Wonderland .
Duncan Black was an economist who revived interest in using mathematical tools to study voting systems .
Black 's book The Theory of Committees and Elections revived significant interest in using mathematical tools to study election questions .
Arrow , though he taught in economics departments , began his academic career as a mathematics major .
Kenneth Arrow won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1972 in part for the insight he obtained into group decision making processes in his 1951 doctoral dissertation .

If one is to do a mathematical analysis of any subject , one has to carefully examine phenomena related to what one is investigating and make simplifying assumptions , to construct what today are called mathematical models .
Voting is carried out in a surprisingly large array of situations : selection of candidates for municipal , state , and national elections ; votes that legislators make when choosing among alternative courses of action ; decisions by economic planners about what course of action to take ; selection by judges of the winner for a skating competition ; selection of a movie for best film of the year ; or selection of what should be served at the company picnic .
What are the salient phenomena involved in elections and voting ?
Elections require voters and alternatives to choose from ( typically people , but there are many other possibilities ) .
To express voter opinions about the alternatives requires a ballot of some kind .
After the voters make their judgments on the alternatives ( candidates ) , it is required that some decision method be used to arrive at the winning candidate , winning candidates , or a collection of selected alternatives .
There are many interesting aspects of elections that probably will not play a part in a first pass at using mathematics to study elections .
Should felons be restricted from voting ?
Should people who can not be present when the voting is to take place have a way to cast a ballot in some other way ?
Are the machines ( or physical mechanism ) currently used for voting the best choice possible ?
( Best choice from what point of view ? )
The Spitzer Space Telescope 's new view of the Eagle Nebula with a pullout of the Pillars of Creation region .
This story was updated at 2:50 pm EST .
SEATTLE -
They helped open the public 's eyes to the wonders of space when they were first photographed in 1995 , but a new study suggests the famous Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula might have already been toppled long ago , and that what the Hubble Space Telescope actually captured was only a ghost image .
A new picture of the Eagle Nebula shot by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , presented here at the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society , show the intact pillars next to a giant cloud of glowing dust scorched by the heat of a massive stellar explosion known as a supernova [ image ] .
" The pillars have already been destroyed by the shockwave , " said study leader Nicolas Flagey of The Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in France .
Astronomers think the supernova 's shock wave knocked the pillars down about 6,000 years ago .
But because the Eagle Nebula is located some 7,000 light years away , the majestic pillars will appear intact to observers on Earth for another 1,000 years or so .
The supernova blast is thought to have occurred between 6,000 and 9,000 years ago , so what astronomers see now is evidence of the blast just before its destructive shock wave reached the pillars .
Astronomers have long predicted that a supernova blast wave would destroy the famous pillars .
One earlier study concluded that the pillars would be destroyed sometime within the next million years .
About 20 stars in the region are ripe for exploding and it was only a matter of time before one detonated .
The Eagle Nebula has been studied in infrared wavelengths before , but the new study is the most detailed yet .
" What is brand new with Spitzer is that we have access to longer wavelengths , " particularly the 70 micron wavelength , Flagey said .
" We did n't have access to these wavelengths before . "
The new Spitzer image suggests one of the stellar time bombs in the Eagle Nebula has already gone off .
Humans living 1,000 to 2,000 years ago might have noticed the supernova event that destroyed the pillars as an unusually bright star in the sky .
" We have checked with historical records , and there might be some candidates , " in Chinese history , Flagey said .
It 's also possible that the supernova was hidden behind huge amounts of interstellar dust that muffled the explosion , he added .
In an end befitting their name , astronomers think that gas and dust from the pillar 's destruction will help give birth to a new generation of stars .
Editor 's Note :
All week , SPACE.com is providing complete coverage of the 209th meeting of the American Astronomical Society .
In 1984 , a Palo Alto , California , family received a Selective Services reminder that it was almost time for Johnny Klomberg to register for the draft .
Problem was , there was no Johnny Klomberg living at that address .
Or anywhere else .
He was purely the fictional invention of the two boys who did live there , Eric and Greg Hentzel .
To remind 18 - year - olds to register with the Selective Service , that agency had been tracking down young men through commercial mailing lists .
The Selective Service got caught out at that practice when they sent such an invitation to a fictional kid who ’d been dreamed up by a couple of young kids whose dad was an ex-Serviceman , a lawyer , and not amused .
Their dad did n’t think it right that a kids ’ “ free ice cream ” list should be turned into a Selective Service name harvesting opportunity .
Young men are required to register with the Selective Service within thirty days of turning eighteen years old , and failure to register is punishable with a $ 250,000 fine and / or a jail sentence of up to five years .
The Selective Service has used various methods to track down those who have failed to register , including scanning driver ’s license records and , sometimes , Social Security and Internal Revenue Service files .
Selective Service did n’t see anything wrong with what they were doing .
“ We do everything we can to get every 18 - year - old to register , ” said Will Ebel , their director of public affairs .
“ Our concern is equity .
If your son registers , the guy who lives across the street who is 18 should have to register too . ”
Nonetheless , news of an ice cream parlor ’s birthday club mailing list being used to enforce registration struck a number of people as plain wrong .
Seven years earlier the Hentzel brothers had dreamed up Johnny in an effort to weasel free frozen treats out of the local ice cream parlor .
Farrell ’s birthday club rewarded members with free sundaes on their special days .
It was but a matter of filling out a form with name , address and date of birth , and a Farrell ’s invitation for a free treat would arrive through the mail at the appropriate time .
Magic , the Hentzel boys thought .
Also too good an opportunity to pass up .
“ We made up really phony names and put different birthdays on but our own address , ” said Eric .
Which is how Johnny Klomberg ’s Selective Service notice ended up arriving at their house .
Their bit of childhood perfidy uncovered what the government had been up to .
Selective Service was forced to acknowledge that in 1983 it paid a mailing list broker $ 5,687 for 167,000 names of other birthday club boys who would be turning eighteen that year so that it could remind them to register .
Farrell ’s Ice Cream Parlor Restaurant , a large national chain , was “ outraged ” to discover its list had been passed to the government without permission .
The restaurant chain kept a list of the children ’s names and addresses so it could mail out “ free ice cream ” invites to those who signed up .
It also sometimes rented its list through a direct mail broker .
Mailing lists are rented or traded between various businesses as a matter of due course .
The standard agreement provides for the payment of a fee or a list swap in return for the one - time use of the names ; each additional mailing using those names generates another fee or swap due .
All rentals and trades have to be agreed to by both parties .
Which brings us back to why Farrell ’s was “ outraged ” — they ’d never agreed to such a use of their list :
“ The broker is authorized only to let people use the list with our written permission , ” said Alexander Hehmeyer , senior vice president and general counsel of Farrell’s .
“ We have no record of any request by government .
We were shocked and outraged ; we would never give permission for its use by a government agency . ”
“ It smacks of big brother government and use of information by the government that citizens would not want used , ” he said .
“ I have two young sons and would be very upset if I thought I could sign them up for a free ice cream at Farrell ’s and they ’d hear from the draft . ”
The list broker , George Mann Associates of New Jersey , acknowledged it had allowed Selective Service to buy the list without first checking with Farrell’s .
When this transaction came to light , Selective Service threw out the names it had so harvested because , without Farrell ’s express permission to it , they should n’t have had the use of them .
“ The use of this commercial list was entirely appropriate and we do n’t have any moral qualms , ” said Will Ebel .
“ But it appears the list broker may have sold us the names without the permission of the originator , and in these circumstances we feel it best not to use them . ”
Moral of the story :
Be careful what you sign your child up for .
You never quite know what use the information will be put to .

The Z80 feeling
So you 've learned a little z80 .
You know ld , cp and jp , and think that 's all .
As far as commands go , that 's most of it indeed ; you 'll get the job done ( usually ) .
However , the thing with z80 is , with a little experience and feeling you can make everything twice as fast , half as big .
That 's what I love about it :)
Below 's a short list of common mistakes , or impurities rather , by beginning programmers .
Most more experienced programmers will ( or should ) already know better .
But for those who can't feel the ugly code , just remember these few rules .
( Note : of course there are a lot of exceptions , these are just basic guidelines . )

On Iran , Iraq , and the Rest of the World
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Michael Shank
Foreign Policy in Focus , February 16 , 2007
Shank :
With similar nuclear developments in North Korea and Iran , why has the United States pursued direct diplomacy with North Korea but refuses to do so with Iran ?
Chomsky :
To say that the United States has pursued diplomacy with North Korea is a little bit misleading .
It did under the Clinton administration , though neither side completely lived up to their obligations .
Clinton did n’t do what was promised , nor did North Korea , but they were making progress .
So when Bush came into the presidency , North Korea had enough uranium or plutonium for maybe one or two bombs , but then very limited missile capacity .
During the Bush years it ’s exploded .
The reason is , he immediately canceled the diplomacy and he ’s pretty much blocked it ever since .
They made a very substantial agreement in September 2005 in which North Korea agreed to eliminate its enrichment programs and nuclear development completely .
In return the United States agreed to terminate the threats of attack and to begin moving towards the planning for the provision of a light water reactor , which had been promised under the framework agreement .
But the Bush administration instantly undermined it .
Right away , they canceled the international consortium that was planning for the light water reactor , which was a way of saying we ’re not going to agree to this agreement .
A couple of days later they started attacking the financial transactions of various banks .
It was timed in such a way to make it clear that the United States was not going to move towards its commitment to improve relations .
And of course it never withdrew the threats .
So that was the end of the September 2005 agreement .
That one is now coming back , just in the last few days .
The way it ’s portrayed in the U.S. media is , as usual with the government ’s party line , that North Korea is now perhaps a little more amenable to accept the September 2005 proposal .
So there ’s some optimism .
If you go across the Atlantic , to the Financial Times , to review the same events they point out that an embattled Bush administration , it ’s their phrase , needs some kind of victory , so maybe it ’ll be willing to move towards diplomacy .
It ’s a little more accurate I think if you look at the background .
But there is some minimal sense of optimism about it .
If you look back over the record — and North Korea is a horrible place nobody is arguing about that — on this issue they ’ve been pretty rational .
It ’s been a kind of tit - for - tat history .
If the United States is accommodating , the North Koreans become accommodating .
If the United States is hostile , they become hostile .
That ’s reviewed pretty well by Leon Sigal , who ’s one of the leading specialists on this , in a recent issue of Current History .
But that ’s been the general picture and we ’re now at a place where there could be a settlement on North Korea .
That ’s much less significant for the United States than Iran .
The Iranian issue I do n’t think has much to do with nuclear weapons frankly .
Nobody is saying Iran should have nuclear weapons –nor should anybody else .
But the point in the Middle East , as distinct from North Korea , is that this is center of the world ’s energy resources .
Originally the British and secondarily the French had dominated it , but after the Second World War , it ’s been a U.S. preserve .
That ’s been an axiom of U.S. foreign policy , that it must control Middle East energy resources .
It is not a matter of access as people often say .
Once the oil is on the seas it goes anywhere .
In fact if the United States used no Middle East oil , it ’d have the same policies .
If we went on solar energy tomorrow , it ’d keep the same policies .
Just look at the internal record , or the logic of it , the issue has always been control .
Control is the source of strategic power .
Dick Cheney declared in Kazakhstan or somewhere that control over pipeline is a “ tool of intimidation and blackmail . ”
When we have control over the pipelines it ’s a tool of benevolence .
If other countries have control over the sources of energy and the distribution of energy then it is a tool of intimidation and blackmail exactly as Cheney said .
And that ’s been understood as far back as George Kennan and the early post - war days when he pointed out that if the United States controls Middle East resources it ’ll have veto power over its industrial rivals .
He was speaking particularly of Japan but the point generalizes .
So Iran is a different situation .
It ’s part of the major energy system of the world .
Shank :
So when the United States considers a potential invasion you think it ’s under the premise of gaining control ?
That is what the United States will gain from attacking Iran ?
Chomsky :
There are several issues in the case of Iran .
One is simply that it is independent and independence is not tolerated .
Sometimes it ’s called successful defiance in the internal record .
Take Cuba .
A very large majority of the U.S. population is in favor of establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba and has been for a long time with some fluctuations .
And even part of the business world is in favor of it too .
But the government wo n’t allow it .
It ’s attributed to the Florida vote but I do n’t think that ’s much of an explanation .
I think it has to do with a feature of world affairs that is insufficiently appreciated .
International affairs is very much run like the mafia .
The godfather does not accept disobedience , even from a small storekeeper who does n’t pay his protection money .
You have to have obedience otherwise the idea can spread that you do n’t have to listen to the orders and it can spread to important places .
If you look back at the record , what was the main reason for the U.S. attack on Vietnam ?
Independent development can be a virus that can infect others .
That ’s the way it ’s been put , Kissinger in this case , referring to Allende in Chile .
And with Cuba it ’s explicit in the internal record .
Arthur Schlesinger , presenting the report of the Latin American Study Group to incoming President Kennedy , wrote that the danger is the spread of the Castro idea of taking matters into your own hands , which has a lot of appeal to others in the same region that suffer from the same problems .
Later internal documents charged Cuba with successful defiance of U.S. policies going back 150 years – to the Monroe Doctrine — and that ca n’t be tolerated .
So there ’s kind of a state commitment to ensuring obedience .
Going back to Iran , it ’s not only that it has substantial resources and that it ’s part of the world ’s major energy system but it also defied the United States .
The United States , as we know , overthrew the parliamentary government , installed a brutal tyrant , was helping him develop nuclear power , in fact the very same programs that are now considered a threat were being sponsored by the U.S. government , by Cheney , Wolfowitz , Kissinger , and others , in the 1970s , as long as the Shah was in power .
But then the Iranians overthrew him , and they kept U.S. hostages for several hundred days .
And the United States immediately turned to supporting Saddam Hussein and his war against Iran as a way of punishing Iran .
The United States is going to continue to punish Iran because of its defiance .
So that ’s a separate factor .
And again , the will of the U.S. population and even US business is considered mostly irrelevant .
Seventy five percent of the population here favors improving relations with Iran , instead of threats .
But this is disregarded .
We do n’t have polls from the business world , but it ’s pretty clear that the energy corporations would be quite happy to be given authorization to go back into Iran instead of leaving all that to their rivals .
But the state wo n’t allow it .
And it is setting up confrontations right now , very explicitly .
Part of the reason is strategic , geo-political , economic , but part of the reason is the mafia complex .
They have to be punished for disobeying us .
Shank : Venezuela has been successfully defiant with Chavez making a swing towards socialism .
Where are they on our list ?
Chomsky :
They ’re very high .
The United States sponsored and supported a military coup to overthrow the government .
In fact , that ’s its last , most recent effort in what used to be a conventional resort to such measures .
Shank :
But why have n’t we turned our sights more toward Venezuela ?
Chomsky :
Oh they ’re there .
There ’s a constant stream of abuse and attack by the government and therefore the media , who are almost reflexively against Venezuela .
For several reasons .
Venezuela is independent .
It ’s diversifying its exports to a limited extent , instead of just being dependent on exports to the United States .
And it ’s initiating moves toward Latin American integration and independence .
It ’s what they call a Bolivarian alternative and the United States does n’t like any of that .
This again is defiance of U.S. policies going back to the Monroe Doctrine .
There ’s now a standard interpretation of this trend in Latin America , another kind of party line .
Latin America is all moving to the left , from Venezuela to Argentina with rare exceptions , but there ’s a good left and a bad left .
The good left is Garcia and Lula , and then there ’s the bad left which is Chavez , Morales , maybe Correa .
And that ’s the split .
In order to maintain that position , it ’s necessary to resort to some fancy footwork .
For example , it ’s necessary not to report the fact that when Lula was re-elected in October , his foreign trip and one of his first acts was to visit Caracas to support Chavez and his electoral campaign and to dedicate a joint Venezuelan - Brazilian project on the Orinoco River , to talk about new projects and so on .
It ’s necessary not to report the fact that a couple of weeks later in Cochabamba , Bolivia , which is the heart of the bad guys , there was a meeting of all South American leaders .
There had been bad blood between Chavez and Garcia , but it was apparently patched up .
They laid plans for pretty constructive South American integration , but that just does n’t fit the U.S. agenda .
So it was n’t reported .
Shank :
How is the political deadlock in Lebanon impacting the U.S. government ’s decision to potentially go to war with Iran ?
Is there a relationship at all ?
Chomsky :
There ’s a relationship .
I presume part of the reason for the U.S. - Israel invasion of Lebanon in July — and it is US - Israeli , the Lebanese are correct in calling it that — part of the reason I suppose was that Hezbollah is considered a deterrent to a potential U.S. - Israeli attack on Iran .
It had a deterrent capacity , i.e. rockets .
And the goal I presume was to wipe out the deterrent so as to free up the United States and Israel for an eventual attack on Iran .
That ’s at least part of the reason .
The official reason given for the invasion ca n’t be taken seriously for a moment .
That ’s the capture of two Israeli soldiers and the killing of a couple others .
For decades Israel has been capturing , and kidnapping Lebanese and Palestinian refugees on the high seas , from Cyprus to Lebanon , killing them in Lebanon , bringing them to Israel , holding them as hostages .
It ’s been going on for decades , has anybody called for an invasion of Israel ?
Of course Israel does n’t want any competition in the region .
But there ’s no principled basis for the massive attack on Lebanon , which was horrendous .
In fact , one of the last acts of the U.S. - Israeli invasion , right after the ceasefire was announced before it was implemented , was to saturate much of the south with cluster bombs .
There ’s no military purpose for that , the war was over , the ceasefire was coming .
UN de-mining groups that are working there say that the scale is unprecedented .
It ’s much worse than any other place they ’ve worked : Kosovo , Afghanistan , Iraq , anywhere .
There are supposed to be about one million bomblets left there .
A large percentage of them do n’t explode until you pick them up , a child picks them up , or a farmer hits it with a hoe or something .
So what it does basically is make the south uninhabitable until the mining teams , for which the United States and Israel do n’t contribute , clean it up .
This is arable land .
It means that farmers ca n’t go back ; it means that it may undermine a potential Hezbollah deterrent .
They apparently have pretty much withdrawn from the south , according to the UN .
You ca n’t mention Hezbollah in the U.S. media without putting in the context of “ Iranian - supported Hezbollah . ”
That ’s its name .
Its name is Iranian - supported Hezbollah .
It gets Iranian support .
But you can mention Israel without saying US - supported Israel .
So this is more tacit propaganda .
The idea that Hezbollah is acting as an agent of Iran is very dubious .
It ’s not accepted by specialists on Iran or specialists on Hezbollah .
But it ’s the party line .
Or sometimes you can put in Syria , i.e . “ Syrian - supported Hezbollah , ” but since Syria is of less interest now you have to emphasize Iranian support .
Shank :
How can the U.S. government think an attack on Iran is feasible given troop availability , troop capacity , and public sentiment ?
Chomsky :
As far as I ’m aware , the military in the United States thinks it ’s crazy .
And from whatever leaks we have from intelligence , the intelligence community thinks it ’s outlandish , but not impossible .
If you look at people who have really been involved in the Pentagon ’s strategic planning for years , people like Sam Gardiner , they point out that there are things that possibly could be done .
I do n’t think any of the outside commentators at least as far as I ’m aware have taken very seriously the idea of bombing nuclear facilities .
They say if there will be bombing it ’ll be carpet bombing .
So get the nuclear facilities but get the rest of the country too , with an exception .
By accident of geography , the world ’s major oil resources are in Shi’ite - dominated areas .
Iran ’s oil is concentrated right near the gulf , which happens to be an Arab area , not Persian .
Khuzestan is Arab , has been loyal to Iran , fought with Iran not Iraq during the Iran - Iraq war .
This is a potential source of dissension .
I would be amazed if there is n’t an attempt going on to stir up secessionist elements in Khuzestan .
U.S. forces right across the border in Iraq , including the surge , are available potentially to “ defend ” an independent Khuzestan against Iran , which is the way it would be put , if they can carry it off .
Shank :
Do you think that ’s what the surge was for ?
Chomsky :
That ’s one possibility .
There was a release of a Pentagon war - gaming report , in December 2004 , with Gardiner leading it .
It was released and published in the Atlantic Monthly .
They could n’t come up with a proposal that did n’t lead to disaster , but one of the things they considered was maintaining troop presence in Iraq beyond what ’s to be used in Iraq for troop replacement and so on , and use them for a potential land move in Iran — presumably Khuzestan where the oil is .
If you could carry that off , you could just bomb the rest of the country to dust .
Again , I would be amazed if there are n’t efforts to sponsor secessionist movements elsewhere , among the Azeri population for example .
It ’s a very complex ethnic mix in Iran ; much of the population is n’t Persian .
There are secessionist tendencies anyway and almost certainly , without knowing any of the facts , the United States is trying to stir them up , to break the country internally if possible .
The strategy appears to be : try to break the country up internally , try to impel the leadership to be as harsh and brutal as possible .
That ’s the immediate consequence of constant threats .
Everyone knows that .
That ’s one of the reasons the reformists , Shirin Ebadi and Akbar Ganji and others , are bitterly complaining about the U.S. threats , that it ’s undermining their efforts to reform and democratize Iran .
But that ’s presumably its purpose .
Since it ’s an obvious consequence you have to assume it ’s the purpose .
Just like in law , anticipated consequences are taken as the evidence for intention .
And here ’s it so obvious you ca n’t seriously doubt it .
So it could be that one strain of the policy is to stir up secessionist movements , particularly in the oil rich regions , the Arab regions near the Gulf , also the Azeri regions and others .
Second is to try to get the leadership to be as brutal and harsh and repressive as possible , to stir up internal disorder and maybe resistance .
And a third is to try to pressure other countries , and Europe is the most amenable , to join efforts to strangle Iran economically .
Europe is kind of dragging its feet but they usually go along with the United States .
The efforts to intensify the harshness of the regime show up in many ways .
For example , the West absolutely adores Ahmadinejad .
Any wild statement that he comes out with immediately gets circulated in headlines and mistranslated .
They love him .
But anybody who knows anything about Iran , presumably the editorial offices , knows that he does n’t have anything to do with foreign policy .
Foreign policy is in the hands of his superior , the Supreme Leader Khamenei .
But they do n’t report his statements , particularly when his statements are pretty conciliatory .
For example , they love when Ahmadinejad says that Israel should n’t exist , but they do n’t like it when Khamenei right afterwards says that Iran supports the Arab League position on Israel - Palestine .
As far as I ’m aware , it never got reported .
Actually you could find Khamenei ’s more conciliatory positions in the Financial Times , but not here .
And it ’s repeated by Iranian diplomats but that ’s no good .
The Arab League proposal calls for normalization of relations with Israel if it accepts the international consensus of the two - state settlement which has been blocked by the United States and Israel for thirty years .
And that ’s not a good story , so it ’s either not mentioned or it ’s hidden somewhere .
It ’s very hard to predict the Bush administration today because they ’re deeply irrational .
They were irrational to start with but now they ’re desperate .
They have created an unimaginable catastrophe in Iraq .
This should ’ve been one of the easiest military occupations in history and they succeeded in turning it into one of the worst military disasters in history .
They ca n’t control it and it ’s almost impossible for them to get out for reasons you ca n’t discuss in the United States because to discuss the reasons why they ca n’t get out would be to concede the reasons why they invaded .
We ’re supposed to believe that oil had nothing to do with it , that if Iraq were exporting pickles or jelly and the center of world oil production were in the South Pacific that the United States would ’ve liberated them anyway .
It has nothing to do with the oil , what a crass idea .
Anyone with their head screwed on knows that that ca n’t be true .
Allowing an independent and sovereign Iraq could be a nightmare for the United States .
It would mean that it would be Shi’ite - dominated , at least if it ’s minimally democratic .
It would continue to improve relations with Iran , just what the United States does n’t want to see .
And beyond that , right across the border in Saudi Arabia where most of Saudi oil is , there happens to be a large Shi’ite population , probably a majority .
Moves toward sovereignty in Iraq stimulate pressures first for human rights among the bitterly repressed Shi’ite population but also toward some degree of autonomy .
You can imagine a kind of a loose Shi’ite alliance in Iraq , Saudi Arabia , and Iran , controlling most of the world ’s oil and independent of the United States .
And much worse , although Europe can be intimidated by the United States , China can’t .
It ’s one of the reasons , the main reasons , why China is considered a threat .
We ’re back to the Mafia principle .
China has been there for 3,000 years , has contempt for the barbarians , is overcoming a century of domination , and simply moves on its own .
It does not get intimidated when Uncle Sam shakes his fist .
That ’s scary .
In particular , it ’s dangerous in the case of the Middle East .
China is the center of the Asian energy security grid , which includes the Central Asian states and Russia .
India is also hovering around the edge , South Korea is involved , and Iran is an associate member of some kind .
If the Middle East oil resources around the Gulf , which are the main ones in the world , if they link up to the Asian grid , the United States is really a second - rate power .
A lot is at stake in not withdrawing from Iraq .
I ’m sure that these issues are discussed in internal planning .
It ’s inconceivable that they ca n’t think of this .
But it ’s out of public discussion , it ’s not in the media , it ’s not in the journals , it ’s not in the Baker - Hamilton report .
And I think you can understand the reason .
To bring up these issues would open the question why the United States and Britain invaded .
And that question is taboo .
It ’s a principle that anything our leaders do is for noble reasons .
It may be mistaken , it may be ugly , but basically noble .
And if you bring in normal moderate , conservative , strategic , economic objectives you threatening that principle .
It ’s remarkable the extent to which it ’s held .
So the original pretexts for the invasion were weapons of mass destruction and ties to al - Qaida that nobody but maybe Wolfowitz or Cheney took seriously .
The single question , as they kept reiterating in the leadership , was : will Saddam give up his programs of weapons of mass destruction ?
The single question was answered a couple of months later , the wrong way .
And quickly the party line shifted .
In November 2003 , Bush announced his freedom agenda : our real goal is to bring democracy to Iraq , to transform the Middle East .
That became the party line , instantly .
But it ’s a mistake to pick out individuals because it ’s close to universal , even in scholarship .
In fact you can even find scholarly articles that begin by giving the evidence that it ’s complete farce but nevertheless accept it .
There was a pretty good study of the freedom agenda in Current History by two scholars and they give the facts .
They point out that the freedom agenda was announced on November 2003 after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction , but the freedom agenda is real even if there ’s no evidence for it .
In fact , if you look at our policies they ’re the opposite .
Take Palestine .
There was a free election in Palestine , but it came out the wrong way .
So instantly , the United States and Israel with Europe tagging along , moved to punish the Palestinian people , and punish them harshly , because they voted the wrong way in a free election .
That ’s accepted here in the West as perfectly normal .
That illustrates the deep hatred and contempt for democracy among western elites , so deep - seated they ca n’t even perceive it when it ’s in front of their eyes .
You punish people severely if they vote the wrong way in a free election .
There ’s a pretext for that too , repeated every day : Hamas must agree to first recognize Israel , second to end all violence , third to accept past agreements .
Try to find a mention of the fact that the United States and Israel reject all three of those .
They obviously do n’t recognize Palestine , they certainly do n’t withdraw the use of violence or the threat of it — in fact they insist on it — and they do n’t accept past agreements , including the road map .
I suspect one of the reasons why Jimmy Carter ’s book has come under such fierce attack is because it ’s the first time , I think , in the mainstream , that one can find the truth about the road map .
I have never seen anything in the mainstream that discusses the fact that Israel instantly rejected the road map with U.S. support .
They formally accepted it but added 14 reservations that totally eviscerated it .
It was done instantly .
It ’s public knowledge , I ’ve written about it , talked about it , so have others , but I ’ve never seen it mentioned in the mainstream before .
And obviously they do n’t accept the Arab League proposal or any other serious proposal .
In fact they ’ve been blocking the international consensus on the two - state solution for decades .
But Hamas has to accept them .
It really makes no sense .
Hamas is a political party and political parties do n’t recognize other countries .
And Hamas itself has made it very clear , they actually carried out a truce for a year and a half , did n’t respond to Israeli attacks , and have called for a long - term truce , during which it ’d be possible to negotiate a settlement along the lines of the international consensus and the Arab League proposal .
All of this is obvious , it ’s right on the surface , and that ’s just one example of the deep hatred of democracy on the part of western elites .
It ’s a striking example but you can add case after case .
Yet , the president announced the freedom agenda and if the dear leader said something , it ’s got to be true , kind of North Korean style .
Therefore there ’s a freedom agenda even if there ’s a mountain of evidence against it , the only evidence for it is in words , even apart from the timing .
Shank :
In the 2008 presidential election , how will the candidates approach Iran ?
Do you think Iran will be a deciding factor in the elections ?
Chomsky :
What they ’re saying so far is not encouraging .
I still think , despite everything , that the US is very unlikely to attack Iran .
It could be a huge catastrophe ; nobody knows what the consequences would be .
I imagine that only an administration that ’s really desperate would resort to that .
But if the Democratic candidates are on the verge of winning the election , the administration is going to be desperate .
It still has the problem of Iraq : ca n’t stay in , and ca n’t get out .
Shank :
The Senate Democrats can’t seem to achieve consensus on this issue .
Chomsky : I think there ’s a reason for it .
The reason is just thinking through the consequences of allowing an independent , partially democratic Iraq .
The consequences are nontrivial .
We may decide to hide our heads in the sand and pretend we ca n’t think it through because we cannot allow the question of why the United States invaded to open , but that ’s very self - destructive .
Shank :
Is there any connection to this conversation and why we cannot find the political will and momentum to enact legislation that would reduce C02 emissions levels , institute a cap - and - trade system , etc . ?
Chomsky :
It ’s perfectly clear why the United States did n’t sign the Kyoto Protocol .
Again , there ’s overwhelming popular support for signing , in fact it ’s so strong that a majority of Bush voters in 2004 thought that he was in favor of the Kyoto Protocol , it ’s such an obvious thing to support .
Popular support for alternative energy has been very high for years .
But it harms corporate profits .
After all , that ’s the Administration ’s constituency .
I remember talking to , 40 years ago , one of the leading people in the government who was involved in arms control , pressing for arms control measures , détente , and so on .
He ’s very high up , and we were talking about whether arms control could succeed .
And only partially as a joke he said , “ Well it might succeed if the high tech industry makes more profit from arms control than it can make from weapons - related research and production .
If we get to that tipping point maybe arms control will work . ”
He was partially joking but there ’s a truth that lies behind it .
Shank :
How do we move forward on climate change without beggaring the South ?
Chomsky : Unfortunately , the poor countries , the south , are going to suffer the worst according to most projections — and that being so , it undermines support in the north for doing much .
Look at the ozone story .
As long as it was the southern hemisphere that was being threatened , there was very little talk about it .
When it was discovered in the north , very quickly actions were taken to do something about it .
Right now there ’s discussion of putting serious effort into developing a malaria vaccine , because global warming might extend malaria to the rich countries , so something should be done about it .
Same thing on health insurance .
Here ’s an issue where , for the general population , it ’s been the leading domestic issue , or close to it , for years .
And there ’s a consensus for a national healthcare system on the model of other industrial countries , maybe expanding Medicare to everyone or something like that .
Well , that ’s off the agenda , nobody can talk about that .
The insurance companies do n’t like it , the financial industry does n’t like and so on .
Now there ’s a change taking place .
What ’s happening is that manufacturing industries are beginning to turn to support for it because they ’re being undermined by the hopelessly inefficient U.S. healthcare system .
It ’s the worst in the industrial world by far , and they have to pay for it .
Since it ’s employer - compensated , in part , their production costs are much higher than those competitors who have a national healthcare system .
Take GM .
If it produces the same car in Detroit and in Windsor across the border in Canada , it saves , I forget the number , I think over $ 1000 with the Windsor production because there ’s a national healthcare system , it ’s much more efficient , it ’s much cheaper , it ’s much more effective .
So the manufacturing industry is starting to press for some kind of national healthcare .
Now it ’s beginning to put it on the agenda .
It does n’t matter if the population wants it .
What 90 % of the population wants would be kind of irrelevant .
But if part of the concentration of corporate capital that basically runs the country — another thing we ’re not allowed to say but it ’s obvious — if part of that sector becomes in favor then the issue moves onto the political agenda .
Shank :
So how does the south get its voice heard on the international agenda ?
Is the World Social Forum a place for it ?
Chomsky : The World Social Forum is very important but of course that ca n’t be covered in the West .
In fact , I remember reading an article , I think in the Financial Times , about the two major forums that were taking place .
One was the World Economic Forum in Davos and a second was a forum in Herzeliyah in Israel , a right wing forum in Herzeliyah .
Those were the two forums .
Of course there was also the World Social Forum in Nairobi but that ’s only tens of thousands of people from around the world .
Shank :
With the trend towards vilifying the G77 at the UN one wonders where the developing world can effectively voice their concerns .
Chomsky :
The developing world voice can be amplified enormously by support from the wealthy and the privileged , otherwise it ’s very likely to be marginalized , as in every other issue .
Shank :
So it ’s up to us .
Among the many interesting things in Online Journalism Review ’s article about using eyetracking to increase the effectiveness of news article design is this odd result :
Although both men and women look at the image of George Brett when directed to find out information about his sport and position , men tend to focus on private anatomy as well as the face .
For the women , the face is the only place they viewed .
Coyne adds that this difference does n’t just occur with images of people .
Men tend to fixate more on areas of private anatomy on animals as well , as evidenced when users were directed to browse the American Kennel Club site .
That is absolutely fascinating .
I ’d love to hear an evolutionary biologist ’s take on why that is .
I ’m also heartened by the article ’s first featured finding : that tighter writing , more white space , and jettisoning unnecessary imagery helps readers read faster and retain more of what they ’ve read .
In my recent post about Michael Charles Smith , I received a response from a reader by the name of Carl Deen regarding my support for the war against terror Islamofascism ( Not the war on terror .
Terrorism is the method the Islamofascist uses to accomplish his political - religious goals ) .
I think his challenge is worth a post of its own so rather than responding in the original post , I have decided to answer him here .
Deen writes :
Letâ€™s see if I understand the author .
Without provocation , much like Germany did to Poland , the USA invaded Iraq , a country that was no threat to us ; however , because , we did , we cannot admit our mistakes and withdraw .
I suppose , by that reasoning , we must stay there forever at a cost of $ 500 billion and the lives of several hundred solders a year .
According to the author , Islam is a threat to us ; therefore , we must attack and meddle in their affairs .
It doesnâ€™t occur to the author that if you attack and meddle in their affairs , you make more enemies than if you leave them alone .
Oh , I forgot ; they hate us for our freedoms .
Therefore , by using the war as reasons to turn the USA into a police state , they will stop hating us because we will have lost our remaining freedoms .
Was Iraq a threat to the United States ?
First of all , the comparisons of the U.S. to Nazi Germany are getting very tiresome .
Whatever â€˜atrocitiesâ€ ™ the U.S. has committed pale in comparison to the Holocaust .
I also reject the premise that Iraq was no threat to the U.S. Regardless of whether or not Saddam had WMD , he was a threat to the U.S. Saddam did in fact invade Kuwait in the early 1990 â€™s to steal the Kuwaitâ€™s oil .
Had Saddam been allowed to proceed , there would have been national security threats as well as economic threats to the U.S. and the world .
When Saddam surrendered to the international coalition , there were certain conditions that he agreed to so that he could continue to be in power .
Among those conditions were that he was not to reconstitute his WMD program and was restricted from flying in the â€˜no fly zones.â€ ™
To enforce the agreement , coalition fighters patrolled the no fly zones from the time of the surrender to the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom .
Saddam routinely fired with anti-aircraft weapons on the coalition fighters patrolling the no fly zones , directly putting the lives of U.S. and coalition pilots at risk .
These attacks were provocative acts of war .
Letâ€™s also not forget that Saddam attempted to assassinate former President Bush .
Regardless of how you feel about President Bush , he was a president of the United States .
An attack on the presidentâ€ ” any American president is a provocative act of war against the United States .
And then there were the families of the suicide bombers who Saddam paid to spread terrorism throughout Israel .
Sure , he was not paying suicide bombers to make attacks in American cities ( as far as we know anyway ) , but this still proved that he was not above such tactics .
Though the 9/11 commission found no links between Saddam Hussein and the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the commission did find that attempts were made between Saddam and Bin Laden to form an alliance .
Their ties however , were non-operational .
Had Saddam been as far along in his WMD program as most of the worldâ€™s intelligence agencies and world leaders had thought , it is not out of the realm of possibility to believe that those ties could have eventually become operational making it possible for Islamofascits to gain access to this material and carry out an attack on the U.S. Based on Saddamâ€™s track record ( his use of chemical and biological weapons on his own people , for example ) , there was no reason to believe that he did not have WMD .
U.S. intelligence had underestimated Saddamâ€™s progress in his WMD programs in the past .
If left unchecked , he would have .
Whoops !
We were wrong , time to go ?
We can debate whether or not the invasion of Iraq was justified and can even argue that preemption is a bad military philosophy .
Fine , thatâ€™s fair .
A case could be made that other outlaw regimes such as Iran or North Korea posed a greater security threat to America .
But right or wrong , we have troops in Iraq right now as a direct result of that philosophy .
What possible good can come from surrendering and allowing Iraq to become quite possibly the largest hotbed of Islamofascism ?
If we leave Iraq in its current state , I am absolutely convinced the Islamofascists will follow us home .
We also have a responsibility to the Iraqis to leave their country in a better situation than we found it .
If we leave now , there will likely be a humanitarian disaster and the blood will be on our hands for allowing it .
I do not believe that our troops should stay in Iraq forever but I do believe they should stay until the Iraqi government is stable enough to handle the violence by itself .
I also believe that our government should put more pressure on the Iraqi government to make this happen .
Rather than a time table , there needs to be reasonable benchmarks that should be met before a pullout should occur .
Hopefully , there are people in the Pentagon much smarter than me who can determine what these benchmarks should be .
If we leave them alone , they will leave us alone ?
Carl Deenâ€™s suggestion that if America simply pulled the troops out of all of the Islamic countries , the Islamofascists would forgive , forget , and leave us alone is typical of the â€˜peace at any priceâ€™ crowd .
America has made foreign policy mistakes in the past , no question .
But does anyone seriously believe that if we say â€˜weâ€™re sorryâ€™ the Islamofascists will forgive us ?
These people havenâ€™t forgiven Europe for the Crusades for crying out loud !
The Islamofascists grudge against the West generally and America specifically is by no means limited to Americaâ€™s actions in â€ ˜Allahâ€™s land .â€ ™
The Islamofascists do in fact hate America and Western culture because its freedoms are an anathema to the teachings of Islam .
America is often referred to as â€ ˜the great Satanâ€™ because America is very liberal when it comes to rights of women , the freedom of religion , the separation of church ( mosque ) and state , and representative government .
Islamofascists are afraid that our â€˜decadenceâ€™ will spill over into their counties and undermine their precious holy laws .
I am aware that itâ€™s not PC to say anything negative about oneâ€™s religion but the Quran itself states many times that non-Muslims are to be converted , enslaved , or killed .
If you donâ€™t believe me , read it yourself here .
Should we negotiate our way out of this war ?
Ever heard that line in the Marine hymn â€ œFrom the halls of Montezuma , to the shores of Tripoliâ€ ?
The Tripoli part of the hymn has to do with Americaâ€™s first encounters with Islamofascists – the Barbary Pirates .
President George Washington sent Thomas Jefferson and John Adams to try to solve the crisis diplomatically .
The pirates refused .
Instead , they demanded the U.S. government to pay tribute ( ransom ) in exchange for promises that they would no longer attack and capture U.S. ships .
The Adamsâ€™ administration agreed to play ball ( this surely would please the peace at any price Left of today ) .
When Thomas Jefferson became president , he decided to put an end to paying tribute and instead used the full force of the Navy and Marines .
As it turned out , force was the only thing that worked against the Muslim Barbary Pirates .
After the pirates were defeated , they left American vessels alone and the European nations who were dealing with the same problem followed suit .
Our leaders of today could learn a valuable lesson from this experience .
Sacrificing freedom for safety
This of course is a very valid concern .
When we trade freedom for safety , we deserve neither .
Many of us complain about the so - called domestic spying , warrantless wiretaps , the U.S.A. Patriot Act , and the creation to the Department of Homeland Security .
Some reasonable security measures can be taken without sacrificing the freedom of Americaâ€™s citizens but we all know that government often over reacts and over reaches .
Supposing we pull out of Iraq or go even further and withdraw troops from every Islamic state and the inevitable happens ( attacks against American cities worse than 9/11 ) , then what will happen to our freedoms ?
Let just one nuclear device take out just one American city and life as we know it in America will change forever .
Expect martial law to be declared in every metropolitan area in the country and other government actions that will make the Patriot Act look like nothing .
This will happen irrespective of whichever political party is in power at the time .
So yes Mr. Deen , I do believe that America was right to go into Iraq based on the intelligence available at the time and no I do not think our troops should stay there forever .
Iraq is now a central front in a much larger war against Islamofascisim ; a war which will continue as long as there are Islamofascists who intend to destroy our country and our way of life .

Google will charge companies , or individuals , $ 50 a seat per year for its Google Apps Premier Edition suite .
Likes its free stable mate , PE now contains Google Docs & Spreadsheets , as well as Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Talk , and the Google customizable Start Page feature .
Unlike Microsoft , Google seems to have a working currency converter , with UK punters being charged £ 26 a seat .
For the $ 50 PE fee , you also get 10 GB of storage , compared to the free version ’s 2GB .
The fee also buys you APIs to hook the suite into existing corporate systems , so admins can still control provisioning , data migration , single sign - on etc. 24x7 support is included , including phone support for administrators , and this is all tied up with a 99.9 per cent uptime promise .
Crucially , advertising is optional in PE .
It 'll be turned off as standard , though we we ’d love to hear of a reason why any company would want turn it on .
The bundling of Google Docs & Spreadsheets comes in the wake of Microsoft 's Office and Vista launches .
But the company 's initial pitch seems to be more around the comms and collaboration features of the suite .
Robert Whiteside , Google 's head of enterprise in the UK , said something like 50 per cent of employees do not have email , with companies like retailers having few ways to communication with their workforces without spending a lot of money of computers and software from , well , you know .
Whiteside insisted that companies would n't worry about their data being Google - ized and then sent to reside somewhere in the Google cloud , saying “ The benefit of taking away the management challenge [ of maintaining the data ] is only the start of it . ”
Corporates are already happily outsourcing systems and data anyhow , he added .
Early adopters include GE and Proctor and Gamble , which are running beta programs on “ point projects “ in the US .
Salesforce.com is also listed as an early adopter , though if Google turned up at the hosted CRM vendor touting the removal desktop apps , it'd be hard for the firm to refuse to wave the flag .
Also today , Google Apps will include Gmail for Mobile on the Blackberry .
Whiteside said the firm intended to roll out dedicated mobile support to other mobile devices in the future . ®

When I read that Australia had become the first country in the world to ban incandescent bulbs I had two thoughts .
First , I said to myself , " This is a great step in the right direction for the fight against global warming . "
And second , I asked myself , how come Australia was able to pass a law like this without a massive public outcry ?
To help answer this question I decided to look into replacing all of the light bulbs in my house with compact fluorescent bulbs for a hefty fee of roughly $ 100 .
But what would I really be doing ?
Aside from the environmental benefits of compact fluorescent bulbs and playing a part in preventing global warming , will I benefit from switching all of my bulbs ?
And if so , how ?
Will I save any money ?
Will I be able to recuperate the money I spent ?
Well , the answer is a resounding " YES ! "
One bulb = $ 2.49 + tax
Energy Use = 15 watts = 60 watt incandescent light bulb light output
One year saving for one bulb averaging three hours of use = $ 12
Average Life of Bulb = 7 years at three hours of use per day
Nate Would Replace 30 Bulbs
Nate 's Pre-Replacement Energy Use = 1,800 watts
Nate 's Post - Replacement Energy Use = 450 watts
Nate 's Savings Per Year = $ 360
Nate 's Savings
Over the Life Time of the Bulbs = $ 2,520
With this analysis , Australia 's decision to outlaw incandescent makes perfect sense .
The government is able to play a part in preventing global warming , and the citizens actually will recuperate their expenses and attain additional savings by switching .
This seems pretty reasonable right ?
So why can't we do it ?

Lindsay Lohan had a rough morning Sunday – and by the looks of it , a pretty rough night , too .
At 6:45 am , a TMZ spy spotted Lindsay at Olive and Sunset in Hollywood , near a dog park .
Lindsay was sitting in her parked black Cadillac Escalade and our spy , who was walking his dog , could see Lohan through the tinted windows , " freaking out " and talking on her phone .
Then , Lohan called our spy over and told him that two men in a silver Toyota 4 Runner -- parked behind her -- had been following her for the last two hours , trying to " hit " her vehicle .
Our spy reports that " she seemed out of it , " that it appeared she 'd been out all night , and that she 'd clearly been crying , with mascara running down her face .
" I 've called the cops , " said Lindsay of her alleged pursuers .
" But the cops ca n't catch them . "
What Lindsay did n't even realize in her reduced state was that the two men in the Toyota were actually paparazzi .
Our spy saw them snapping away .
And , he says , as their vehicle started to creep up on Lindsay 's Escalade , she shifted into drive , hit the gas and took off .
The paparazzi followed her .

I wish I weighed a little bit less .
Or a lot less .
And I often fear , to paraphrase Kingsley Amis , that I ’m heading in the wrong direction , that inside of me is an even fatter me waiting to get out .
I ’m not alone .
A recent study found that 80 % of the American people are overweight .
Many of us seem to have trouble saying no to that second piece of pie , the super - sizing of fries and the longing to lay on the couch burning up as few calories as possible .
I have always thought of my weight as kind of personal .
It often is .
When I get my driver ’s license and the clerk ask my weight , I ’m on the honor system .
The clerk demands an eye test , but there ’s no scale .
A confession — I take what I actually weigh and what I ’d like to weigh and split the difference .
So far , even the security people at the airport let me get away with this deception .
But like everything else these days , the personal is political .
Some people say my weight problem is your problem and vice versa .
Obesity is related to higher risks of heart disease , cancer , stroke , diabetes and lots of other unpleasant outcomes .
A total of 3,196 active - duty soldiers deserted the Army last year , or 853 more than previously reported , according to revised figures from the Army .
The new calculations by the Army , which had about 500,000 active - duty troops at the end of 2006 , significantly alter the annual desertion totals since the 2000 fiscal year .
In 2005 , for example , the Army now says 2,543 soldiers deserted , not the 2,011 it had reported .
For some earlier years , the desertion numbers were revised downward .
National Public Radio first reported on Tuesday that the Army had been inaccurately reporting desertion figures .
When the IT director at North Carolina 's Charlotte & Mecklenburg County public library began training staff in the latest web technologies , she lured reluctant participants with bribes – a free MP3 player and the chance to win a laptop .
Six months later , the program they developed is the real prize .
Learning 2.0 , developed by public services technology director Helene Blowers , has become a surprise grassroots hit , available for free on the web and adopted by dozens of other libraries around the globe .
" The last thing we want is for people to come into our libraries and ask about Flickr or Second Life and be met with a blank look , " said Christine MacKensie , director of the Yarra Plenty Regional Library in Melbourne , Australia , which just finished a four - month version of Learning 2.0 .
" And they certainly wo n't now . "
Google and Microsoft are racing into libraries to digitize the world 's books , but the success of Learning 2.0 shows that the human problem of retraining workers is often being tackled from the ground up .
Recognizing that librarians need to know how to participate in the new media mix if libraries are to remain relevant , Blowers challenged her 550 staffers to become more web savvy .
Using free web tools , she designed the program and gave staff members three months to do 23 things .
They created blogs and podcasts , tried out Flickr , set up RSS feeds , learned about wikis , uploaded video to YouTube , played with image generators and Rollyo , and explored Technorati , tagging and folksonomies .
" Librarian avatars were popping up all over the blogs , " said Blowers , who keeps track of developments on her blog .
Although her original goals for Learning 2.0 were touchy - feely " E's " – exposing staff to new tools , encouraging play , empowering individuals , expanding the knowledge toolbox , eliminating fear – the effects were both practical and financial .
" We do n't have to wait for some training company to come along and say , ' For $ 20,000 we 'll show you how this stuff works , ' " said Michael Stephens , who wrote Web 2.0 and Libraries : Best Practices for Social Software .
" Helene put it on the web so anyone can use that program . "
Libraries all over the world are doing just that – moving the entire Learning 2.0 program to their own websites .
The program has been duplicated by university and community library systems in Sweden , Australia , Canada and Denmark .
In the United States , programs are underway in South Carolina , Florida , Maryland and California .
Even the Combined Arms Research Library , a military repository , is trying it .
Now Blowers ' program is spreading beyond libraries ( even virtual ones , like the teen library in Second Life ) .
A public relations firm wants to set up a Learning 2.0 program for its staff , and several universities and an elementary school want to use the system to educate teachers , she said .
Michael Casey , division director of technology services for the Gwinnett County Public Library in Georgia , calls this movement Library 2.0 .
" For libraries , the service aspect makes it as akin to Business 2.0 as to Web 2.0 , " said Casey , who writes Library Crunch .
" The 2.0 technology makes it possible to offer a lot without all the licensing and maintenance .
It 's all free , it 's browser - based – it's a technician 's dream . "

Where 2.0 Gives the World Meaning

Ten years ago , Netscape ’s explosive IPO ignited huge piles of money .
The brilliant flash revealed what had been invisible only a moment before : the World Wide Web .
As Eric Schmidt ( then at Sun , now at Google ) noted , the day before the IPO , nothing about the Web ; the day after , everything .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

Computing pioneer Vannevar Bush outlined the Web ’s core idea – hyperlinked pages – in 1945 , but the first person to try to build out the concept was a freethinker named Ted Nelson who envisioned his own scheme in 1965 .
However , he had little success connecting digital bits on a useful scale , and his efforts were known only to an isolated group of disciples .
Few of the hackers writing code for the emerging Web in the 1990s knew about Nelson or his hyperlinked dream machine .
At the suggestion of a computer - savvy friend , I got in touch with Nelson in 1984 , a decade before Netscape .
We met in a dark dockside bar in Sausalito , California .
He was renting a houseboat nearby and had the air of someone with time on his hands .
Folded notes erupted from his pockets , and long strips of paper slipped from overstuffed notebooks .
Wearing a ballpoint pen on a string around his neck , he told me – way too earnestly for a bar at 4 o’clock in the afternoon – about his scheme for organizing all the knowledge of humanity .
Salvation lay in cutting up 3 x 5 cards , of which he had plenty .
Although Nelson was polite , charming , and smooth , I was too slow for his fast talk .
But I got an aha ! from his marvelous notion of hypertext .
He was certain that every document in the world should be a footnote to some other document , and computers could make the links between them visible and permanent .
But that was just the beginning !
Scribbling on index cards , he sketched out complicated notions of transferring authorship back to creators and tracking payments as readers hopped along networks of documents , what he called the docuverse .
He spoke of “ transclusion ” and “ intertwingularity ” as he described the grand utopian benefits of his embedded structure .
It was going to save the world from stupidity .
I believed him .
Despite his quirks , it was clear to me that a hyperlinked world was inevitable – someday .
But looking back now , after 10 years of living online , what surprises me about the genesis of the Web is how much was missing from Vannevar Bush ’s vision , Nelson ’s docuverse , and my own expectations .
We all missed the big story .
The revolution launched by Netscape ’s IPO was only marginally about hypertext and human knowledge .
At its heart was a new kind of participation that has since developed into an emerging culture based on sharing .
And the ways of participating unleashed by hyperlinks are creating a new type of thinking – part human and part machine – found nowhere else on the planet or in history .
Not only did we fail to imagine what the Web would become , we still do n’t see it today !
We are blind to the miracle it has blossomed into .
And as a result of ignoring what the Web really is , we are likely to miss what it will grow into over the next 10 years .
Any hope of discerning the state of the Web in 2015 requires that we own up to how wrong we were 10 years ago .
1995 Before the Netscape browser illuminated the Web , the Internet did not exist for most people .
If it was acknowledged at all , it was mischaracterized as either corporate email ( as exciting as a necktie ) or a clubhouse for adolescent males ( read : pimply nerds ) .
It was hard to use .
On the Internet , even dogs had to type .
Who wanted to waste time on something so boring ?
The memories of an early enthusiast like myself can be unreliable , so I recently spent a few weeks reading stacks of old magazines and newspapers .
Any promising new invention will have its naysayers , and the bigger the promises , the louder the nays .
It ’s not hard to find smart people saying stupid things about the Internet on the morning of its birth .
In late 1994 , Time magazine explained why the Internet would never go mainstream : “ It was not designed for doing commerce , and it does not gracefully accommodate new arrivals . ”
Newsweek put the doubts more bluntly in a February 1995 headline : “ THE INTERNET ? BAH ! ” The article was written by astrophysicist and Net maven Cliff Stoll , who captured the prevailing skepticism of virtual communities and online shopping with one word : “ baloney . ”
This dismissive attitude pervaded a meeting I had with the top leaders of ABC in 1989 .
I was there to make a presentation to the corner office crowd about this “ Internet stuff . ”
To their credit , they realized something was happening .
Still , nothing I could tell them would convince them that the Internet was not marginal , not just typing , and , most emphatically , not just teenage boys .
Stephen Weiswasser , a senior VP , delivered the ultimate putdown : “ The Internet will be the CB radio of the ’ 90s , ” he told me , a charge he later repeated to the press .
Weiswasser summed up ABC ’s argument for ignoring the new medium : “ You are n’t going to turn passive consumers into active trollers on the Internet . ”
I was shown the door .
But I offered one tip before I left .
“ Look , ” I said .
“ I happen to know that the address abc.com has not been registered .
Go down to your basement , find your most technical computer guy , and have him register abc.com immediately .
Do n’t even think about it .
It will be a good thing to do . ”
They thanked me vacantly .
I checked a week later .
The domain was still unregistered .
While it is easy to smile at the dodos in TV land , they were not the only ones who had trouble imagining an alternative to couch potatoes .
Wired did , too .
When I examine issues of Wired from before the Netscape IPO ( issues that I proudly edited ) , I am surprised to see them touting a future of high production - value content – 5,000 always - on channels and virtual reality , with a side order of email sprinkled with bits of the Library of Congress .
In fact , Wired offered a vision nearly identical to that of Internet wannabes in the broadcast , publishing , software , and movie industries : basically , TV that worked .
The question was who would program the box .
Wired looked forward to a constellation of new media upstarts like Nintendo and Yahoo ! , not old - media dinosaurs like ABC .
Problem was , content was expensive to produce , and 5,000 channels of it would be 5,000 times as costly .
No company was rich enough , no industry large enough , to carry off such an enterprise .
The great telecom companies , which were supposed to wire up the digital revolution , were paralyzed by the uncertainties of funding the Net .
In June 1994 , David Quinn of British Telecom admitted to a conference of software publishers , “ I ’m not sure how you ’d make money out of it . ”
The immense sums of money supposedly required to fill the Net with content sent many technocritics into a tizzy .
They were deeply concerned that cyberspace would become cyburbia – privately owned and operated .
Writing in Electronic Engineering Times in 1995 , Jeff Johnson worried : “ Ideally , individuals and small businesses would use the information highway to communicate , but it is more likely that the information highway will be controlled by Fortune 500 companies in 10 years . ”
The impact would be more than commercial .
“ Speech in cyberspace will not be free if we allow big business to control every square inch of the Net , ” wrote Andrew Shapiro in The Nation in July 1995 .
The fear of commercialization was strongest among hardcore programmers : the coders , Unix weenies , TCP / IP fans , and selfless volunteer IT folk who kept the ad hoc network running .
The major administrators thought of their work as noble , a gift to humanity .
They saw the Internet as an open commons , not to be undone by greed or commercialization .
It ’s hard to believe now , but until 1991 , commercial enterprise on the Internet was strictly prohibited .
Even then , the rules favored public institutions and forbade “ extensive use for private or personal business . ”
In the mid-1980s , when I was involved in the WELL , an early nonprofit online system , we struggled to connect it to the emerging Internet but were thwarted , in part , by the “ acceptable use ” policy of the National Science Foundation ( which ran the Internet backbone ) .
In the eyes of the NSF , the Internet was funded for research , not commerce .
At first this restriction was n’t a problem for online services , because most providers , the WELL included , were isolated from one another .
Paying customers could send email within the system – but not outside it .
In 1987 , the WELL fudged a way to forward outside email through the Net without confronting the acceptable use policy , which our organization ’s own techies were reluctant to break .
The NSF rule reflected a lingering sentiment that the Internet would be devalued , if not trashed , by opening it up to commercial interests .
Spam was already a problem ( one every week ! ) .
This attitude prevailed even in the offices of Wired .
In 1994 , during the first design meetings for Wired ‘s embryonic Web site , HotWired , programmers were upset that the innovation we were cooking up – what are now called clickthrough ad banners – subverted the great social potential of this new territory .
The Web was hardly out of diapers , and already they were being asked to blight it with billboards and commercials .
Only in May 1995 , after the NSF finally opened the floodgates to ecommerce , did the geek elite begin to relax .
Three months later , Netscape ’s public offering took off , and in a blink a world of DIY possibilities was born .
Suddenly it became clear that ordinary people could create material anyone with a connection could view .
The burgeoning online audience no longer needed ABC for content .
Netscape ’s stock peaked at $ 75 on its first day of trading , and the world gasped in awe .
Was this insanity , or the start of something new ?
2005 The scope of the Web today is hard to fathom .
The total number of Web pages , including those that are dynamically created upon request and document files available through links , exceeds 600 billion .
That ’s 100 pages per person alive .
How could we create so much , so fast , so well ?
In fewer than 4,000 days , we have encoded half a trillion versions of our collective story and put them in front of 1 billion people , or one - sixth of the world ’s population .
That remarkable achievement was not in anyone ’s 10 - year plan .
The accretion of tiny marvels can numb us to the arrival of the stupendous .
Today , at any Net terminal , you can get : an amazing variety of music and video , an evolving encyclopedia , weather forecasts , help wanted ads , satellite images of anyplace on Earth , up - to - the - minute news from around the globe , tax forms , TV guides , road maps with driving directions , real - time stock quotes , telephone numbers , real estate listings with virtual walk - throughs , pictures of just about anything , sports scores , places to buy almost anything , records of political contributions , library catalogs , appliance manuals , live traffic reports , archives to major newspapers – all wrapped up in an interactive index that really works .
This view is spookily godlike .
You can switch your gaze of a spot in the world from map to satellite to 3 - D just by clicking .
Recall the past ?
It ’s there .
Or listen to the daily complaints and travails of almost anyone who blogs ( and does n’t everyone ? ) .
I doubt angels have a better view of humanity .
Why are n’t we more amazed by this fullness ?
Kings of old would have gone to war to win such abilities .
Only small children would have dreamed such a magic window could be real .
I have reviewed the expectations of waking adults and wise experts , and I can affirm that this comprehensive wealth of material , available on demand and free of charge , was not in anyone ’s scenario .
Ten years ago , anyone silly enough to trumpet the above list as a vision of the near future would have been confronted by the evidence :
There was n’t enough money in all the investment firms in the entire world to fund such a cornucopia .
The success of the Web at this scale was impossible .
But if we have learned anything in the past decade , it is the plausibility of the impossible .
Take eBay .
In some 4,000 days , eBay has gone from marginal Bay Area experiment in community markets to the most profitable spinoff of hypertext .
At any one moment , 50 million auctions race through the site .
An estimated half a million folks make their living selling through Internet auctions .
Ten years ago I heard skeptics swear nobody would ever buy a car on the Web .
Last year eBay Motors sold $ 11 billion worth of vehicles .
EBay ’s 2001 auction of a $ 4.9 million private jet would have shocked anyone in 1995 – and still smells implausible today .
Nowhere in Ted Nelson ’s convoluted sketches of hypertext transclusion did the fantasy of a global flea market appear .
Especially as the ultimate business model !
He hoped to franchise his Xanadu hypertext systems in the physical world at the scale of a copy shop or caf – you would go to a store to do your hypertexting .
Xanadu would take a cut of the action .
Instead , we have an open global flea market that handles 1.4 billion auctions every year and operates from your bedroom .
Users do most of the work ; they photograph , catalog , post , and manage their own auctions .
And they police themselves ; while eBay and other auction sites do call in the authorities to arrest serial abusers , the chief method of ensuring fairness is a system of user - generated ratings .
Three billion feedback comments can work wonders .
What we all failed to see was how much of this new world would be manufactured by users , not corporate interests .
Amazon.com customers rushed with surprising speed and intelligence to write the reviews that made the site ’s long - tail selection usable .
Owners of Adobe , Apple , and most major software products offer help and advice on the developer ’s forum Web pages , serving as high - quality customer support for new buyers .
And in the greatest leverage of the common user , Google turns traffic and link patterns generated by 2 billion searches a month into the organizing intelligence for a new economy .
This bottom - up takeover was not in anyone ’s 10 - year vision .
No Web phenomenon is more confounding than blogging .
Everything media experts knew about audiences – and they knew a lot – confirmed the focus group belief that audiences would never get off their butts and start making their own entertainment .
Everyone knew writing and reading were dead ; music was too much trouble to make when you could sit back and listen ; video production was simply out of reach of amateurs .
Blogs and other participant media would never happen , or if they happened they would not draw an audience , or if they drew an audience they would not matter .
What a shock , then , to witness the near - instantaneous rise of 50 million blogs , with a new one appearing every two seconds .
There – another new blog !
One more person doing what AOL and ABC – and almost everyone else – expected only AOL and ABC to be doing .
These user - created channels make no sense economically .
Where are the time , energy , and resources coming from ?
The audience .
I run a blog about cool tools .
I write it for my own delight and for the benefit of friends .
The Web extends my passion to a far wider group for no extra cost or effort .
In this way , my site is part of a vast and growing gift economy , a visible underground of valuable creations – text , music , film , software , tools , and services – all given away for free .
This gift economy fuels an abundance of choices .
It spurs the grateful to reciprocate .
It permits easy modification and reuse , and thus promotes consumers into producers .
The open source software movement is another example .
Key ingredients of collaborative programming – swapping code , updating instantly , recruiting globally – did n’t work on a large scale until the Web was woven .
Then software became something you could join , either as a beta tester or as a coder on an open source project .
The clever “ view source ” browser option let the average Web surfer in on the act .
And anyone could rustle up a link – which , it turns out , is the most powerful invention of the decade .
Linking unleashes involvement and interactivity at levels once thought unfashionable or impossible .
It transforms reading into navigating and enlarges small actions into powerful forces .
For instance , hyperlinks made it much easier to create a seamless , scrolling street map of every town .
They made it easier for people to refer to those maps .
And hyperlinks made it possible for almost anyone to annotate , amend , and improve any map embedded in the Web .
Cartography has gone from spectator art to participatory democracy .
The electricity of participation nudges ordinary folks to invest huge hunks of energy and time into making free encyclopedias , creating public tutorials for changing a flat tire , or cataloging the votes in the Senate .
More and more of the Web runs in this mode .
One study found that only 40 percent of the Web is commercial .
The rest runs on duty or passion .
Coming out of the industrial age , when mass - produced goods outclassed anything you could make yourself , this sudden tilt toward consumer involvement is a complete Lazarus move : “ We thought that died long ago . ”
The deep enthusiasm for making things , for interacting more deeply than just choosing options , is the great force not reckoned 10 years ago .
This impulse for participation has upended the economy and is steadily turning the sphere of social networking – smart mobs , hive minds , and collaborative action – into the main event .
When a company opens its databases to users , as Amazon , Google , and eBay have done with their Web services , it is encouraging participation at new levels .
The corporation ’s data becomes part of the commons and an invitation to participate .
People who take advantage of these capabilities are no longer customers ; they ’re the company ’s developers , vendors , skunk works , and fan base .
A little over a decade ago , a phone survey by Macworld asked a few hundred people what they thought would be worth $ 10 per month on the information superhighway .
The participants started with uplifting services : educational courses , reference books , electronic voting , and library information .
The bottom of the list ended with sports statistics , role - playing games , gambling , and dating .
Ten years later what folks actually use the Internet for is inverted .
According to a 2004 Stanford study , people use the Internet for ( in order ) : playing games , “ just surfing , ” shopping the list ends with responsible activities like politics and banking .
( Some even admitted to porn . )
Remember , shopping was n’t supposed to happen .
Where ’s Cliff Stoll , the guy who said the Internet was baloney and online catalogs humbug ?
He has a little online store where he sells handcrafted Klein bottles .
The public ’s fantasy , revealed in that 1994 survey , began reasonably with the conventional notions of a downloadable world .
These assumptions were wired into the infrastructure .
The bandwidth on cable and phone lines was asymmetrical : Download rates far exceeded upload rates .
The dogma of the age held that ordinary people had no need to upload ; they were consumers , not producers .
Fast - forward to today , and the poster child of the new Internet regime is BitTorrent .
The brilliance of BitTorrent is in its exploitation of near - symmetrical communication rates .
Users upload stuff while they are downloading .
It assumes participation , not mere consumption .
Our communication infrastructure has taken only the first steps in this great shift from audience to participants , but that is where it will go in the next decade .
With the steady advance of new ways to share , the Web has embedded itself into every class , occupation , and region .
Indeed , people ’s anxiety about the Internet being out of the mainstream seems quaint now .
In part because of the ease of creation and dissemination , online culture is the culture .
Likewise , the worry about the Internet being 100 percent male was entirely misplaced .
Everyone missed the party celebrating the 2002 flip - point when women online first outnumbered men .
Today , 52 percent of netizens are female .
And , of course , the Internet is not and has never been a teenage realm .
In 2005 , the average user is a bone - creaking 41 years old .
What could be a better mark of irreversible acceptance than adoption by the Amish ?
I was visiting some Amish farmers recently .
They fit the archetype perfectly : straw hats , scraggly beards , wives with bonnets , no electricity , no phones or TVs , horse and buggy outside .
They have an undeserved reputation for resisting all technology , when actually they are just very late adopters .
Still , I was amazed to hear them mention their Web sites .
“ Amish Web sites ? ” I asked .
“ For advertising our family business .
We weld barbecue grills in our shop . ”
“ Yes , but “
“ Oh , we use the Internet terminal at the public library .
And Yahoo ! ”
I knew then the battle was over .
2015 The Web continues to evolve from a world ruled by mass media and mass audiences to one ruled by messy media and messy participation .
How far can this frenzy of creativity go ?
Encouraged by Web - enabled sales , 175,000 books were published and more than 30,000 music albums were released in the US last year .
At the same time , 14 million blogs launched worldwide .
All these numbers are escalating .
A simple extrapolation suggests that in the near future , everyone alive will ( on average ) write a song , author a book , make a video , craft a weblog , and code a program .
This idea is less outrageous than the notion 150 years ago that someday everyone would write a letter or take a photograph .
What happens when the data flow is asymmetrical – but in favor of creators ?
What happens when everyone is uploading far more than they download ?
If everyone is busy making , altering , mixing , and mashing , who will have time to sit back and veg out ?
Who will be a consumer ?
No one .
And that ’s just fine .
A world where production outpaces consumption should not be sustainable ; that ’s a lesson from Economics 101 .
But online , where many ideas that do n’t work in theory succeed in practice , the audience increasingly does n’t matter .
What matters is the network of social creation , the community of collaborative interaction that futurist Alvin Toffler called prosumption .
As with blogging and BitTorrent , prosumers produce and consume at once .
The producers are the audience , the act of making is the act of watching , and every link is both a point of departure and a destination .
But if a roiling mess of participation is all we think the Web will become , we are likely to miss the big news , again .
The experts are certainly missing it .
The Pew Internet & American Life Project surveyed more than 1,200 professionals in 2004 , asking them to predict the Net ’s next decade .
One scenario earned agreement from two - thirds of the respondents : “ As computing devices become embedded in everything from clothes to appliances to cars to phones , these networked devices will allow greater surveillance by governments and businesses . ”
Another was affirmed by one - third : “ By 2014 , use of the Internet will increase the size of people ’s social networks far beyond what has traditionally been the case . ”
These are safe bets , but they fail to capture the Web ’s disruptive trajectory .
The real transformation under way is more akin to what Sun ’s John Gage had in mind in 1988 when he famously said , “ The network is the computer . ”
He was talking about the company ’s vision of the thin - client desktop , but his phrase neatly sums up the destiny of the Web :
As the OS for a megacomputer that encompasses the Internet , all its services , all peripheral chips and affiliated devices from scanners to satellites , and the billions of human minds entangled in this global network .
This gargantuan Machine already exists in a primitive form .
In the coming decade , it will evolve into an integral extension not only of our senses and bodies but our minds .
Today , the Machine acts like a very large computer with top - level functions that operate at approximately the clock speed of an early PC .
It processes 1 million emails each second , which essentially means network email runs at 1 megahertz .
Same with Web searches .
Instant messaging runs at 100 kilohertz , SMS at 1 kilohertz .
The Machine ’s total external RAM is about 200 terabytes .
In any one second , 10 terabits can be coursing through its backbone , and each year it generates nearly 20 exabytes of data .
Its distributed “ chip ” spans 1 billion active PCs , which is approximately the number of transistors in one PC .
This planet - sized computer is comparable in complexity to a human brain .
Both the brain and the Web have hundreds of billions of neurons ( or Web pages ) .
Each biological neuron sprouts synaptic links to thousands of other neurons , while each Web page branches into dozens of hyperlinks .
That adds up to a trillion “ synapses ” between the static pages on the Web .
The human brain has about 100 times that number – but brains are not doubling in size every few years .
The Machine is .
Since each of its “ transistors ” is itself a personal computer with a billion transistors running lower functions , the Machine is fractal .
In total , it harnesses a quintillion transistors , expanding its complexity beyond that of a biological brain .
It has already surpassed the 20 - petahertz threshold for potential intelligence as calculated by Ray Kurzweil .
For this reason some researchers pursuing artificial intelligence have switched their bets to the Net as the computer most likely to think first .
Danny Hillis , a computer scientist who once claimed he wanted to make an AI “ that would be proud of me , ” has invented massively parallel supercomputers in part to advance us in that direction .
He now believes the first real AI will emerge not in a stand - alone supercomputer like IBM ’s proposed 23 - teraflop Blue Brain , but in the vast digital tangle of the global Machine .
In 10 years , the system will contain hundreds of millions of miles of fiber - optic neurons linking the billions of ant - smart chips embedded into manufactured products , buried in environmental sensors , staring out from satellite cameras , guiding cars , and saturating our world with enough complexity to begin to learn .
We will live inside this thing .
Today the nascent Machine routes packets around disturbances in its lines ; by 2015 it will anticipate disturbances and avoid them .
It will have a robust immune system , weeding spam from its trunk lines , eliminating viruses and denial - of - service attacks the moment they are launched , and dissuading malefactors from injuring it again .
The patterns of the Machine ’s internal workings will be so complex they wo n’t be repeatable ; you wo n’t always get the same answer to a given question .
It will take intuition to maximize what the global network has to offer .
The most obvious development birthed by this platform will be the absorption of routine .
The Machine will take on anything we do more than twice .
It will be the Anticipation Machine .
One great advantage the Machine holds in this regard :
It ’s always on .
It is very hard to learn if you keep getting turned off , which is the fate of most computers .
AI researchers rejoice when an adaptive learning program runs for days without crashing .
The fetal Machine has been running continuously for at least 10 years ( 30 if you want to be picky ) .
I am aware of no other machine – of any type – that has run that long with zero downtime .
While portions may spin down due to power outages or cascading infections , the entire thing is unlikely to go quiet in the coming decade .
It will be the most reliable gadget we have .
And the most universal .
By 2015 , desktop operating systems will be largely irrelevant .
The Web will be the only OS worth coding for .
It wo n’t matter what device you use , as long as it runs on the Web OS .
You will reach the same distributed computer whether you log on via phone , PDA , laptop , or HDTV .
In the 1990s , the big players called that convergence .
They peddled the image of multiple kinds of signals entering our lives through one box – a box they hoped to control .
By 2015 this image will be turned inside out .
In reality , each device is a differently shaped window that peers into the global computer .
Nothing converges .
The Machine is an unbounded thing that will take a billion windows to glimpse even part of .
It is what you ’ll see on the other side of any screen .
And who will write the software that makes this contraption useful and productive ?
We will .
In fact , we ’re already doing it , each of us , every day .
When we post and then tag pictures on the community photo album Flickr , we are teaching the Machine to give names to images .
The thickening links between caption and picture form a neural net that can learn .
Think of the 100 billion times per day humans click on a Web page as a way of teaching the Machine what we think is important .
Each time we forge a link between words , we teach it an idea .
Wikipedia encourages its citizen authors to link each fact in an article to a reference citation .
Over time , a Wikipedia article becomes totally underlined in blue as ideas are cross-referenced .
That massive cross-referencing is how brains think and remember .
It is how neural nets answer questions .
It is how our global skin of neurons will adapt autonomously and acquire a higher level of knowledge .
The human brain has no department full of programming cells that configure the mind .
Rather , brain cells program themselves simply by being used .
Likewise , our questions program the Machine to answer questions .
We think we are merely wasting time when we surf mindlessly or blog an item , but each time we click a link we strengthen a node somewhere in the Web OS , thereby programming the Machine by using it .
What will most surprise us is how dependent we will be on what the Machine knows – about us and about what we want to know .
We already find it easier to Google something a second or third time rather than remember it ourselves .
The more we teach this megacomputer , the more it will assume responsibility for our knowing .
It will become our memory .
Then it will become our identity .
In 2015 many people , when divorced from the Machine , wo n’t feel like themselves – as if they ’d had a lobotomy .
Legend has it that Ted Nelson invented Xanadu as a remedy for his poor memory and attention deficit disorder .
In this light , the Web as memory bank should be no surprise .
Still , the birth of a machine that subsumes all other machines so that in effect there is only one Machine , which penetrates our lives to such a degree that it becomes essential to our identity – this will be full of surprises .
Especially since it is only the beginning .
There is only one time in the history of each planet when its inhabitants first wire up its innumerable parts to make one large Machine .
Later that Machine may run faster , but there is only one time when it is born .
You and I are alive at this moment .
We should marvel , but people alive at such times usually do n’t .
Every few centuries , the steady march of change meets a discontinuity , and history hinges on that moment .
We look back on those pivotal eras and wonder what it would have been like to be alive then .
Confucius , Zoroaster , Buddha , and the latter Jewish patriarchs lived in the same historical era , an inflection point known as the axial age of religion .
Few world religions were born after this time .
Similarly , the great personalities converging upon the American Revolution and the geniuses who commingled during the invention of modern science in the 17th century mark additional axial phases in the short history of our civilization .
Three thousand years from now , when keen minds review the past , I believe that our ancient time , here at the cusp of the third millennium , will be seen as another such era .
In the years roughly coincidental with the Netscape IPO , humans began animating inert objects with tiny slivers of intelligence , connecting them into a global field , and linking their own minds into a single thing .
This will be recognized as the largest , most complex , and most surprising event on the planet .
Weaving nerves out of glass and radio waves , our species began wiring up all regions , all processes , all facts and notions into a grand network .
From this embryonic neural net was born a collaborative interface for our civilization , a sensing , cognitive device with power that exceeded any previous invention .
The Machine provided a new way of thinking ( perfect search , total recall ) and a new mind for an old species .
It was the Beginning .
In retrospect , the Netscape IPO was a puny rocket to herald such a moment .
The product and the company quickly withered into irrelevance , and the excessive exuberance of its IPO was downright tame compared with the dotcoms that followed .
First moments are often like that .
After the hysteria has died down , after the millions of dollars have been gained and lost , after the strands of mind , once achingly isolated , have started to come together – the only thing we can say is : Our Machine is born .
It ’s on .
