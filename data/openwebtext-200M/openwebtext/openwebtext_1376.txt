It was a slow rollout today , but the promised Zune HD Twitter app is now live in Marketplace .
We 've been playing with it a little since we got it , and while it 's definitely one of the more attractive mobile Twitter clients we 've come across , it 's also distressingly laggy : it 's stalled out several times just scrolling a list of tweets , button presses go ignored , and refreshing data seems to cause all sorts of consternation -- our Zune 's dropped its WiFi connection several times now .
Not sure what 's going on with that , but we 've definitely seen some far more polished apps running on the Zune , so we 're hoping these glitches get cleaned up soon .
Turns out there 's a bigger problem here than just poor performance -- as reader Scott Zero points out , it censors naughty words out of tweets in your timeline .
( Seriously -- here 's his original tweet that we 've highlighted above . )
Sure , it 's a free app , but this kind of active content censorship just rubs us the wrong way -- even worse than Apple 's various Twitter - related App Store shenanigans .
Bleh .
The troubled American private ­security company Blackwater faced fresh ­controversy today when two former employees accused it of defrauding the US government for years , including ­billing for a Filipina prostitute on its payroll in Afghanistan .
According to Melan Davis , a former employee , Blackwater listed the woman for payment under the " morale welfare recreation " category .
The company , which allegedly employed her in Kabul , billed the ­government for her plane tickets and monthly salary , Davis said .
Blackwater , renamed
Xe last year apparently because of the bad publicity attached to its original name , is among the biggest private security firms employed by the state department and Pentagon in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The most notorious incident involving Blackwater was the shooting of 17 Iraqis in Baghdad in 2007 .
Charges against Blackwater employees in the US over the incident were dropped last year , prompting the Iraqi government to order hundreds of its security staff out of the country within the next few days .
The latest accusations are contained in court records that have been recently unsealed and reveal details of a lawsuit by Davis and her husband , Brad , who both worked for Blackwater .
According to Associated Press , the records say they had personal knowledge of the company falsifying invoices , double - billing federal agencies and charging the government for personal and inappropriate items whose real purpose was hidden .
They said they witnessed " systematic " fraud on the company 's security contracts with the state department in Iraq and Afghanistan , and with the department of homeland security and federal emergency management agency in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina .
There was no immediate response today from the company headquarters in North Carolina .
Melan Davis , who was fired from the company , is challenging the legality of her dismissal , claiming it was because she questioned the billing .
Her husband voluntarily resigned from the company .
According to the lawsuit , Melan Davis raised concerns about the company 's bookkeeping with her bosses in March 2006 .
The lawsuit claims she was told to " back off , " and that she " would never win a medal for saving the government money " .
The Davis couple launched the lawsuit in December 2008 , one of a number against Blackwater .
Brad Davis , a former Marine , served as a team leader and security guard , including in Iraq .
He resigned from the company .
The Washington Post said the couple had made their allegations that Blackwater defrauded the government as part of a false claims lawsuit , which allows whistleblowers to win a portion of any public money that the government recovers as a result of the information .
The justice department has chosen not to join them in pursuing their civil suit , a decision that led to the court papers being unsealed this week .
The Post said that Melan Davis travelled to Amman , Jordan , where she and two co-workers spent hours generating reams of false invoices for plane travel at inflated rates .
On Friday , the University of Alabama at Huntsville suffered a horrific tragedy : Biology professor Amy Bishop shot five colleagues , killing three , over an alleged tenure dispute .
One news outlet suggests it was a nerd rage crime , motivated by D&D .

It 's been a long time since the psychopathic nerd stereotype stalked through cheap paperbacks and across TV screens .
The Boston Herald digs deep into 1980s D&D paranoia to produce this shockingly clueless set of paragraphs :
Bishop , now a University of Alabama professor , and her husband James Anderson [ pictured below ] met and fell in love in a Dungeons & Dragons club while biology students at Northeastern University in the early 1980s , and were heavily into the fantasy role - playing board game , a source told the Herald .
" They even acted this crap out , " the source said .
When questioned about it yesterday , Anderson , 45 , a research scientist in Huntsville , Ala. , dismissed the egghead escape as " a passing interest .
It was a social thing more than anything else .
It 's not the crazy group people think they are . " . . .
The popular fantasy role - playing game has a long history of controversy , with objections raised to its demonic and violent elements .
Some experts have cited the D&D backgrounds of people who were later involved in violent crimes , while others say it just a game .
A federal appeals court recently upheld a prison ban on the game in Wisconsin , where prison officials reportedly testified they were afraid the game could promote " hostility , violence and escape behavior . "

The best part is the anonymous " source " making fun of nerds who " act this crap out . "
I 'm assuming the " source " is referring to LARPing , or possibly just displaying the same ignorance about D&D that the Herald itself does .

The facts of the Bishop case as they 've emerged over the past few days hardly suggest that the troubled professor 's crimes were a result of a LARP gone wrong .
It 's beginning to seem that Bishop 's life was plagued by violence , and not the swords - and - spells variety .
In 1986 , when Bishop was 19 , she shot and killed her younger brother Seth .
Though police at the time ruled it an accident , disturbing details have come to light since Friday 's shootings .
The crime was never fully investigated , despite the fact that Bishop and her mother gave contradictory stories about what happened .

Though Bishop claimed the gun went off " accidentally , " she had already shot a wall upstairs before coming down to shoot her brother .
After shooting him in the chest , she fled her house with the gun and ran to a local car dealership .
A mechanic who worked in the car dealership , Tom Pettigrew , described what happened then .
According to the Boston Globe :
" I yelled , ‘ What are you doing ? ' and she screamed at me to put my hands up .
So I put my hands up , " Pettigrew , 45 , said in an interview at his home in Quincy on Monday .
Pettigrew recalled that Bishop said she had had a fight with her husband and he was going to come after her , so she needed a getaway car .
Pettigrew said that Braintree police briefly questioned him and several other employees , but authorities never contacted him again .

Investigators now say that Bishop may have murdered her brother .
It seems just as likely that Bishop did shoot him accidentally , but that the incident left her scarred - and possibly pushed her toward violent acts later .
Several years later in 1993 , when Bishop was a graduate student in biology at Harvard , she and her husband were questioned after one of her advisers - who had been critical of her work - received two pipe bombs in the mail .
She was cleared of any wrongdoing in that case , but the circumstances seem eerily similar to what happened in Alabama .

Before she shot her colleagues in a department meeting , Bishop had been denied tenure .
When she appealed , and charged the university with sex discrimination , she was again denied tenure .
Bishop had just received her second denial of tenure via email before the meeting where she pulled out a gun and systematically shot her colleagues in the head .
Ironically , given her charges of sexism , one of the colleagues she killed was female .
In 2002 , Bishop had also assaulted another woman , whom she punched in the head in an IHOP restaurant .

As a neuroscience researcher , Bishop was about to embark on a project to build a biological computer that she called the Neuristor .
On her research page , she wrote :
My laboratory 's goal will be to continue in our effort to develop a neural computer , the Neuristor™ , using living neurons .
This computer will exploit all of the advantages of neurons .
Specifically , neurons rich with the nitric oxide ( NO ) dependent learning receptor , N Methyl D Aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) , will be utilized .
Advertisement
Bishop has spent most of her adult life studying NO , which is crucial to the process of learning in the brain .
But in high doses released during times of stress or injury , NO can be toxic and causes brain damage .
Bishop has been charged with capital murder .
While the biology professor certainly lead the life of a geek , did that have anything to do with her homicidal rage on Friday ?
Was she driven to attack her colleagues because she liked D&D , or because she believed she could build a computer out of living neurons ?
Many news stories underscore how Bishop was " socially awkward " and did n't socialize with her neighbors .
But are these typically nerdy attributes the cause of her crimes ?
Obviously not .
Awkward geeks who love games and biotech fill our universities and corporations , and lead nonviolent lives .
Advertisement
You'd think by now that pop media would have gotten beyond the idea that nerdiness leads to crime .
Apparently they have n't .
I am cringing as I await the next round of evil geek TV specials , featuring mad scientists building biological computers while playing " Mazes and Monsters " and plotting the murders of their colleagues .

ASPARTAME VERSUS SPLENDA ( SUCRALOSE )
The dangers of aspartame are now widely known , but the risks of using Splenda are not documented – until now .
Splenda may not penetrate the blood brain barrier as aspartame does , hence entering the brain and creating neurotoxin havoc at the brain center , but Splenda CAN adversely affect the body in several ways because it IS a chemical substance and not natural sugar .
December newsletter Equal Sues Splenda
The same patterns with aspartame ( NutraSweet / Equal ) are repeating with sucralose ( Splenda ) .
Their claims of product safety and research results are identical to those used by The NutraSweet Company .
Note the comparisons and repetitions between the products , the corporations , and marketing .
Maybe now , consumers can prevent damage to human health sooner than with NutraSweet , which has damaged the health and lives of millions of innocent consumers since it was placed in the public food supply in 1982 .
Has the FDA repeated the aspartame approval process for sucralose , allowing a product with proven carcinogens to flood our food supply ?
Only time will tell , as it has with aspartame .
Yet at the cost of human lives .
Knowledge is power .
As an educated consumer , you have the awareness to choose what you and your family will ingest .
Unnatural artificial sweeteners may affect your health .
Why take the chance ?
With this book , you woke up and smelled the coffee just in time .
Now you can drink it safely .
SPLENDA ® Is It Safe or Not ?
After twenty years of NutraSweet® ( aspartame ) dominating the sweetener market , people are realizing for themselves that aspartame really is a foul food chemical tragically harmful to their health .
Now , people think Johnson & Johnson ’s Splenda , made from sucralose , has come to the rescue as the newest chemical sugar replacement “ made from real sugar . ”
People do n’t want to hear that it may be just as dangerous as aspartame , and this white knight of sweeteners is no better improvement .
New chemical sweeteners ( like Splenda ) and the sweetener blends ( aspartame , sucralose and acesulfame K blended together in one product ) may be causing users to show signs of weight gain , disruption of sleep patterns , sexual dysfunction , increases in cancer , MS , Lupus , diabetes , and a list of epidemic degenerative diseases .
The corporations continue to stand tough in their denial of any connection to chemical sweetener additives .
This website takes you into the world of Splenda ; ready or not , here we go again .
The Chlorine In Splenda
Chlorine is commonly found in nature , but almost always in combination with other building block elements .
Chlorine 's structure makes it very reactive and because it is so reactive , it is very useful to chemists , engineers and others involved in making things humans use every day .
The inventors of Splenda admit around fifteen percent ( 15 % ) of sucralose is absorbed by the body , but they cannot guarantee us ( out of this fifteen percent ) what amount of chlorine stays in the body and what percent flushes out .
So , do you feel lucky today as you sprinkle that yellow packet of powder in your tea ?
You will be alarmed once you realize how chlorine , this common chemical we ’ve trusted as a “ purifier ” , is actually affecting our health in more ways than you know .
Hopefully , this chapter will make you hesitate before you let your toddler take another sip of your diet cola .
What Are Sweetener Blends ?
I ’ve written about how artificial sweeteners like sucralose ( found in Splenda ) and aspartame ( found in NutraSweet ) can have a negative impact on your health .
Now the sweetener industry has gone a step further in their quest to copy real sugar ’s sweet flavor .
They are mixing Splenda and NutraSweet and other artificial sweeteners together !
Mixtures of any artificial sweeteners are called “ sweetener blends . ”
Instead of one harmful chemical coursing through your body , you now have two or three ( or more ) interacting with each other , and in ways we may not know yet .
If one substance is hazardous , do you think adding toxins to it will make it better ?
It is just one more potent “ alien ” mixture with unknown interactions that your poor body will try to use , excrete , or store .
Its mix n’ match chemistry at the expense of your health .
The Unsafe Sweeteners Out There
Artificial sweeteners :
This category of non-nutritive , high - intensity sugar substitutes includes ASPARTAME , ACESULFAME-K , NEOTAME , SUCRALOSE , and ALITAME .
The two sweeteners that have recently undergone current and pending FDA approval are SUCRALOSE and ALITAME , respectively .
Cyclamate lost its FDA approval in 1970 , but is currently up for re-approval .
Numerous new sweeteners are currently in various stages of development and approval .
Saccharin , Stevia and Other Safe Alternative Sweeteners
Sugar and the quest for weight loss represent an enormous growth opportunity for the food and beverage manufacturers worldwide .
And as everyone in the industry knows , the average human prefers taste to nutrition .
Let ’s see how we can reverse this trend .
The two safest choices of sweeteners to date are saccharin and stevia .
Yes , saccharin !
Saccharin is actually similar to stevia in its origin .
It originally came from a plant imported from China , and in its original form , is a complex sugar extract from the plant itself .
Stevia is extracted from a plant grown in South America , and is also a complex sugar extract .
According to FDA documents , saccharin has never caused cancer .
Years ago , saccharin was sold in tiny pin-sized pellets , and merely two or three were enough to add sweetness to coffee or iced tea .
This is what I consider a natural sucrose ( sugar ) substitute !
The Real Scoop On Sugar
Everyone needs to know that there is a difference between sugars - natural sugar , refined sugar , and corn syrup .
Sugar is like a two - sided coin : heads – if natural , it can be useful to the body , and tails – if altered by man , it can be harmful to the body .
How do you know the difference , and where can you buy the right kind of sugar products ?
Here ’s the scoop ... artificial sweeteners are not the solution .
Dying To Be Thin : Weight Loss and Weight Gain
Do diet sweeteners really help you lose weight , or do you eat more and gain weight in the long run ?
Do diet sweeteners make you fat ?
Yes , because they trick your body and do n’t feed it what it needs
According to researchers , there is no clear - cut evidence that sugar substitutes help people lose weight .
These days , more and more data suggests that these chemical sweeteners may actually stimulate appetite .
Aspartame has been on the market for over twenty years , so most of the information in this chapter refers to weight gain in relation to products made with aspartame .
It is too early to know how these patterns will repeat with sucralose ( Splenda ) .
Are Your Kids Depressed and Aggressive ?
If you have kids , you ’ll be the first one to notice health and behavioral changes in your children .
Children are reacting to artificial sweeteners in harmful ways , but this aspect of the sweetener wars has gone unnoticed in the mainstream health community .
The sweetener corporations market to children by placing soft drink machines in public elementary schools , and by influencing doctors that diet sweeteners do n’t cause abnormal behavior and emotional stress in children .
When you have exhausted all the other reasons for your child ’s poor health or mental / emotional problems , then diet chemicals could be the culprit .
The rising numbers of mental disorders have gone unexplained until now .
A diet of chemical foods means a diet of malnutrition , and when the body is starved of nutrients , it becomes mentally and physically stressed .
Do n’t raise your children on diet chemicals – search for healthy alternatives .
Sugar - Free With Diabetes
Diabetes may be a common disease these days , but it is still misunderstood .
Most people think diabetes is simply a disease that means you just ca n’t eat sugar .
The artificial sugar industry markets fake sugars as totally harmless to the diabetic , and tempts them into believing they can eat and drink all they want by “ tricking ” their bodies .
But what works for one person may not work for another .
What makes this matter even more difficult to understand : diabetes is just a little bit different for every diabetic .
This is why no one artificial sweetener company can truly make a blanket statement that their product is “ safe for diabetics . ”
As delicate as diabetes is , how then , can diet chemical sweeteners be safe when a person with diabetes requires such precise chemical management ?
Who Will Win The Sweetener Wars ?
The immediate dramatic success of Splenda has shaken things up in the artificial - sweetener business , dominated for decades by the rivalry between the blue and pink - Equal and Sweet 'N Low® .
Each of these brands has come up with a new marketing approach to deal with the ravenous dynamics of the ‘ diet ’ marketplace .
Are they playing fair or playing on consumer trust ?
In the midst of the continued controversy over aspartame , many pharmaceutical and health food manufacturers - Pro Lab , Twin Lab
and Ross Products , makers of Pedialyte® , for example - have switched to using sucralose in their manufactured products .
But who are these major big corporations ‘ fighting ’ in the artificial sweetener wars , and what do these mega corporations really stand for ?
This is an important question to answer before buying their products .
Rising From The Grave ’s Disease
Justin Dumais is a 2004 Athens ' Olympic Silver Medalist , a Grave ’s Disease survivor , and aspartame victim .
Merely months before the Olympic trials , Justin contacted me for nutritional help in recovering from a diagnosis of Grave ’s Disease caused by diet colas with aspartame .
He read my first book Sweet Poison , followed my recovery experience from my own case of Grave ’s caused by aspartame , and cured his disease in six weeks ( just like I did ) by simply removing aspartame from his diet , cleansing , and restoring his depleted nutrients .
His recovery from a “ false ” diagnosis of Grave ’s Disease came merely months before the 2004 Athen ’s Olympic Trials .
But , like me , did Justin really have Grave ’s or merely aspartame disease ?
Nutritional Alternatives To Stay Healthy
Nutritional diets are critical to long - term health , but when you are polluted with chemical toxins from your foods , such as chlorine in sucralose and methanol in aspartame , it is important to remove these toxins as quickly and as safely as possible .
Removing chemicals from the human body is a two part process – eating right and cleansing from the chemicals permeating your tissues .
Go here for the nutritional protocol for restoring good health I used to recovery from my own near - fatal disease .
I pass on to you the best of my nutritional programs and recommendations for removing harmful food chemicals from your body in the 10 Steps to Detoxification and The Richardson Cancer Diet , most importantly – how to cleanse from artificial sweetener chemicals .
Splenda Product List
As of May 2004 , the list of over 3,000 products containing Splenda was thirty - four pages in length .
Note : some of the products are not labeled sugar - free , and some products also contain aspartame .
The best advise is to read ALL the labels on anything you buy for you or for your children ’s safety .
The list includes a variety of foods and food products , pharmaceuticals and children ’s medications , vitamin supplements , protein powders , protein bars and weight loss products , liquid and powdered drinks , popcorn , gums and mints , toothpaste , and water .
Aspartame Case Histories
Case histories are an excellent way to share the experiences of those who have faced one of life ’s hardest challenges – nutritionally turning disease into health .
Most of these case histories have happy endings , and after considering the evidence , especially after their long and arduous struggles for health , what these people have learned serves as a beacon of hope for others .
Aspartame has been on the market since 1981 , so over twenty years of aspartame use has passed .
Let ’s hope our new awareness of the influences of sucralose and the other chemical sweeteners comes much sooner to prevent any more human suffering .
NutraSweet Product List
The original product list containing NutraSweet ’s twenty - year product monopoly is impossible to find these days .
Taken from my book on aspartame , Sweet Poison , the original list of NutraSweet ’s novel 5,000 products from the 1980s was sent to me directly from the NutraSweet Company .
Splenda Research Studies
Bottom line – what ’s the research say about sucralose ?
Well , the studies proving the safety concerns are out there , but they are hard to find and technical .
Nonetheless , they prove the claims of concern are valid and I have spent the past 10 months uncovering the research thanks to my contacts around the world .
With this website , you woke up and smelled the coffee just in time .

Legalizing same - sex marriage would reduce San Francisco 's health and welfare costs because married people are healthier and wealthier than singles , and would generate revenue for government from a surge in weddings , the city 's chief economist testified Thursday at the trial of a lawsuit challenging California 's Proposition 8 .
Edmund Egan 's testimony was the first attempt by the plaintiffs - two same - sex couples and the city of San Francisco - to assess the economic effects of the November 2008 ballot measure that amended the state Constitution to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman .
The couples , two Burbank men and two Berkeley women , have already testified about the effect Prop. 8 had on their lives by frustrating their hopes to marry .
The plaintiffs are trying to show that the measure has also caused financial harm , strengthening their claim that it was irrational and thus must have been motivated by unconstitutional bias against gays and lesbians .
" Married individuals are healthier , on average , and behave in healthier ways than single individuals , " Egan , who heads the Office of Economic Analysis in the city controller 's office , testified in U.S. District Court in San Francisco .
That translates into lower worker absenteeism , greater productivity , higher wages and more payroll taxes , he said .
Married people also are less likely to need health care and are more likely than single people or domestic partners to be covered by insurance , in which case the city does n't have to subsidize their care , Egan said .
He also said lesbians and gays now use " a disproportionately high level " of drug and alcohol treatment programs , " and one reason is discrimination . "
Research showing that married people are more likely than singles to accumulate wealth suggests that allowing same - sex marriage would increase spending on consumer goods , Egan said .
He said it was impossible to put dollar figures on the city 's projected savings in those areas .
But Egan offered estimates of the revenue San Francisco would receive from same - sex weddings and ran into tough questioning from a lawyer for Prop.
8 's sponsors .
The city could expect $ 1.7 million a year in added sales taxes and $ 900,000 in hotel taxes from wedding - related spending and out - of - town visitors , the economist said .
Egan said the figures were projections based on the more than 4,100 gay and lesbian weddings performed in the city from June 2008 , when a state Supreme Court ruling legalizing same - sex marriages took effect , and Nov. 4 , 2008 , when Prop. 8 passed .
Peter Patterson , lawyer for Protect Marriage , the Prop. 8 campaign committee , said Egan had greatly overstated the measure 's impact .
The 2008 figures reflected a " pent - up demand " for same - sex weddings that would surely decline , Patterson said during cross-examination .
He noted that there was a sharp drop in gay and lesbian marriages in Massachusetts in the second year after they were legalized there .
Patterson questioned Egan 's assumption that married same - sex couples would be less likely to incur health care costs than unmarried partners , saying the economist had based his statement on studies of heterosexual couples .
Those studies were irrelevant to a " gay- friendly city " like San Francisco , Patterson said .
He also noted that same - sex domestic partners are entitled under state law to the same insurance coverage as spouses .
Egan replied that the pre-Prop .
8 burst of San Francisco weddings exceeded expectations that were based on the Massachusetts figures .
He said they would probably continue at an elevated level , at least in the short term , if the law changes .
In late December , I received a New Year ’s e-mail from a former Iranian diplomat .
The contact surprised me .
I had known the man when I lived in Tehran from 2004 to ’ 07 , but I had n’t heard from him in more than two years .
In 2007 , as the Ahmadinejad administration began tarring its ideological enemies as foreign stooges , he cut relations with me .
I had n’t become less of a liability in the interim .
In 2009 , during the postelection unrest , I was arrested at Tehran ’s airport as I was boarding a flight and transferred to Evin Prison .
Though the Greek government intervened to obtain my prompt release , others were less fortunate .
A government - issued indictment accused many green movement sympathizers of being pawns of America , Israel or Britain and seeking to execute a velvet revolution .
Most were sentenced to long prison terms or execution .
Things were so bad , I doubted I would be hearing from my estranged friend , particularly because the government had stepped up its monitoring of electronic communications .
But then his season ’s greeting arrived , and I was n’t the only recipient .
Some even more radioactive addressees were openly listed in the e-mail .
One of them was a high - profile prisoner in Evin Prison , tried and found guilty on a charge of espionage .
Another was an American academic whose name came up in a show - trial indictment as an intelligence agent .
Why would my diplomat friend make a seemingly suicidal gesture at a time when the Islamic Republic ’s television cameras are showcasing pro-regime crowds and sympathetic ayatollahs denouncing the opposition ?
One possibility is that he senses the impending collapse of the government .

“ The current regime has broken the social bonds that tie it to the public and thus is eventually due to fall , ” Bill Beeman , a Persian - speaking professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota and former president of the Middle East section of the American Anthropological Assn. , told me recently .
“ Iran is a hierarchical society .
Folks in the superior position must care for those in the inferior position or they will be toppled .
The folks in the lower position will cease to support them -- in fact will work to undermine them . “
There is a Persian concept that translates as the “ party of the wind . ”
It refers to the tendency of Iranians to bend politically whichever way the ideological winds blow .
The oversubscribed classes of civil servants are some of the Islamic Republic ’s most invested supporters , but they are not necessarily true believers .
Their loyalty is likely to last only as long as the monthly checks and the subsidized cars , plasma - screen televisions and pilgrimages to Damascus and Mecca .
One of the reasons that Iran ’s 1979 revolution was relatively bloodless was the smooth , almost instant shift in the loyalties of thousands of bureaucrats and military men from Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to the opposition .
The last Sunday of 2009 was the first time that anti-government demonstrators turned on the security forces , shattering seven months of passivity in a wave of violence .
They discovered that the Islamic Republic ’s demoralized riot police no longer had much fight left in them .
They often turned tail and ran .
Videos emerging from Iran showed angry crowds surrounding trapped , often bloodied , police and plainclothes religious loyalists .
“ What grabbed me was the look in the eyes of the soldiers standing in the streets , ” one witness told me on the phone from Tehran .
“ You could easily notice grief , guilt and fear in most of them . ”
Advertisement
In the shocked silence that followed , there was a feeling that the center of gravity had shifted .
Another friend wrote from Tehran : “ It is getting really exciting .
. . .
These people are fearless , brave and amazing .
Nothing can stop them . ”
The movement has continued to pick up speed since then .
This month , a diplomat at an Iranian embassy in Europe openly told me that the time of “ justice and freedom ” is coming .
His time scale was “ the next few months . ”
This would have been an extraordinary statement for a loyal servant of the Islamic Republic to make anywhere , much less in an embassy reception hall , which is probably bugged .
“ The disillusionment within the regime is sometimes stronger than the disillusionment of the ordinary people , because these are people who had traveled outside Iran , to Europe , and knew a different level of life , ” a high - ranking official in the Islamic Republic told me in 2007 , after news broke that a former deputy defense minister probably had defected to Turkey .
Iranian officials -- not least the Islamic Republic ’s diplomats -- are canny strategists .
There was nothing random about my friend ’s electronic glasnost .
When I wrote back asking what he had done while I was in jail , I got back a one - line plea to allow him “ an opportunity ” in the future to explain .
Perhaps this opportunity is now not too far off .

Most of you might remember mid-Nineties hip - hop sensation Coolio for his hit singles Gangsta 's Paradise and Fantastic Voyage .
But in recent years Coolio has found another audience — not on the mic but behind the stove as host of his cooking videos Cookin ' with Coolio .
As the self - proclaimed " ghetto Martha Stewart " and the " black Rachael Ray , " Coolio got his start in the kitchen at an early age .
Without necessities ( as basic as a refrigerator ) and using bare - bones staples like canned tuna , hot sauce , and white bread , Coolio quickly learned to make do with what he had , which usually was n't much .
This survivalist mentality along with his mom Jackie 's kitchen skills and encouragement lead Coolio to become The King of the Kitchen Pimps , a title that allows him to make no qualms about " filleting Bobby Flay " or " sending his posse after Emeril Lagasse . "
But for all of his big talk , how does Coolio 's newly released cookbook , Cookin ' with Coolio stack up ?
For all of the wittily names recipes ( Chicken Lettuce Blunts , U Can't See My Bass ) and unique measurement techniques ( a dime bag of pepper , as much as you damn well please hot sauce ) , Cookin ' with Coolio is actually filled with some pretty great information , especially for those with limited experience in the kitchen .
In an opening chapter called " Cool - mandments , " Coolio outlines his ten basic rules for solid home - cooking that will be sure to keep us far away from the evils of fast - food by drawing the readers into the light of the refrigerator .
The analogy might seem far - fetched , but the basic premise of his rules are pretty down - to - earth .
Here are two examples :
Cool - mandment IV : Thou Shalt Honor Your Friends and Family with Amazing Food .
Coolio wants all of us to prepare romantic meals for our significant others and cook fun healthy meals for our kids that encourage them to get involved in the kitchen .
Cool - mandment VII : Thou Shalt Always Practice Proper Presentation .
Here Coolio is just reiterating what every competent chef and home cook knows : you taste with your eyes first , so your food should look as good as it tastes .
Judging by the recipes in Cookin ' with Coolio , the man really does warrant the title of ultimate kitchen pimp .
This might not be gourmet food but it 's definitely ghetto gourmet ( a new genre ? ) and damn good .
So , without further ado here is a recipe for Coolio 's favorite chicken wings :

THEY may smile and seem like they are sharing the holiday joy with you , but from preying on those in grief to lying about cheap trips , travel agents can be just as cut - throat as the meanest in any industry that works on commission .
Mark and Brian ( names changed to protect identity ) , both Australian - based travel agents , dish the dirt on the business and tell you how to avoid falling for their tricks .
Charging you extra is a game for us
Mark :
“ All travel agents get paid commission from hotels and airlines , but this can be as low as one per cent so we have to make our money somewhere .
“ Recently we played a game in the office of how much we mark up tickets to Sydney for .
The tickets were about $ 89 one way but I sold them for $ 265 - some guy had to get to Sydney for a work meeting .
I bet he was a bit shocked when he got on the plane and it was n’t chock - a- block like I told him .
But that ’s a mark - up of $ 176 , so I won that round . ”
You have a death in the family , we party
Brian : “ Times of need such as death , illness or other urgent trips are where agents see the big bucks .
Airlines do n’t charge any more for late bookings , but the agent sure will . ”
Mark : “ I remember a time when I marked an airfare up $ 600 over what you could get it for on the internet or with the airline direct .
“ A family member had passed away in the US and they wanted to leave the following day .
I felt a bit guilty , but it paid for a big weekend of partying . ”
Your ticket is NOT non-refundable
Mark :
“ Whilst most airlines will charge a small fee for making changes , there is not one airfare out at the moment that is non-refundable .
“ We will normally tell you the ticket is non-refundable when we sense there is the slightest chance you may cancel , especially if it ’s a big booking - we need to protect our commission and it ’s like a form of punishment for cancelling your trip . ”
“ I made close to $ 3000 commission recently on a romantic trip for two to Tahiti , ( after ) they cancelled due to family problems .
We charged them $ 3500 in cancellation fees – what they did n’t know was the actual cancellation fees were just $ 365 for the two airfares and the hotels were cancelled free of charge . ”
Appearances definitely count
Brian : “ You need to be careful what you look like and how you act because that will influence how much you will get charged .
Naive and clueless people are the best sources of cash , and those from more affluent suburbs pay so much more than those from working class suburbs . ”
Mark : “ You need to be confident and know what you want .
Some agents are like dogs , as soon as they smell fear , they pounce , and you end up staying at the Ritz instead of a backpackers with 15 tours of a place you ’ve never heard of . ”
The internet is our enemy
Mark : “ We really hate the internet .
Ninety - nine per cent of the time booking on the internet is cheaper .
Why would a hotel pay a travel agent upwards of 25 per cent commission , when they can just sell it direct and make more money themselves ? ”
Brian : “ Always check the internet .
Expedia is one of the best websites , we have a 25 per cent mark up , where they work off a margin around five per cent .
The same goes for the airlines . ”
We ’ll rip you off with travel insurance
Mark : “ Travel insurance is our bread and butter .
Ever wondered why it is so expensive ?
It ’s because we get paid 40 per cent commission on policies we sell .
“ Always ask for a discount on the insurance , anything less than a 20 per cent discount and you ’re getting ripped off . ”
We use cheap holidays as bait
Mark : “ Travel advertising is like a fishing trip .
We put the bait out of a holiday to Fiji for $ 669 , which might be available some time over the next year staying at a resort we probably would n’t send our own mother - in - laws to .
“ We then we get a nibble which is you walking into the store and sitting down and that ’s when we tell you it ’s not available and then we sell you a much more expensive package to a resort that pays top commission .
That ’s when you know you have landed a good catch . ”
Do n’t be too loyal or we ’ll take advantage
Brian : “ Shop around .
If you do n’t it ’s at your own peril .
If you have your favourite agent that you always use , chances are you pay too much , even when you think they are looking after you . ”
Mark :
“ We know when you come in that you ’re going to book with us , you always do , so that package you want that is $ 1400 pp it just became $ 1500 pp and my girlfriend just got a big bunch of flowers and a bottle of champagne . ”
When push comes to shove
Mark : “ Have you ever heard a travel agent say ‘ the airline is withdrawing the airfare so we need to get your payment in as soon as possible ’ ?
Whilst this occasionally happens , chances are that your travel agent is falling short of their sales targets and needs your money to help them so they do n’t get into trouble from the powers that be .
“ All my big bookings are generally due the month I ’m on holiday , just so that my commission pay does n’t drop whilst I ’m away .
Do n’t fall for it . ”
Beware of the over - excited travel agent
Brian : “ If you sense the agent is getting excited it ’s because they can see the dollars about to roll in .
They generally can’t tell when they are doing it , so if you notice it you need to be asking yourself what ’s going on and where you are being fleeced . ”
New employees will give you a better deal
Mark :
“ The travel industry has one of the biggest staff turnover rates , so we always have new kids in the store .
“ They do n’t have the confidence to rip you off , so you ’re generally going to get the best available price with them , whereas the older more experienced agents know all the tricks and will squeeze every dollar out of you . ”
Do n’t fall for the tours trap
Mark : “ Tours and day trips are another place where agents beef up their bookings with more money and more commission .
Without a doubt it is going to be cheaper to buy your tours and day trips at your destination , that way you avoid all commissions and pay the operator direct .
“ One of my friends who works at a huge travel agency just told me about a incentive they have running called ‘ pimp that file ’ where they are encouraged to put every little tour , transfer , show and everything you do n’t need just so that they can increase the cost of the package and in turn increase their take home pay . ”
Price beating is crucial
Brian : “ If you ’re unsure , ask the agent to explain the charges , then ring the hotel or airline direct to check their cancellation policy .
Get prices from everywhere and then take it to a travel agent who offers to beat any quote by a certain amount .
“ Do n’t tell them you ’re going to price beat them until after they have done all the work , just before you ’re about to pay , just watch their attitude change towards you .
If I know someone is price beating me , I try to get them in and out as quick as I can because I ’m not going to make any money out of them . ”
Top five top tips when dealing with a travel agent .
1. Price beat , price beat , price beat
2. Shop around , and let the agent know you ’re shopping around .
They are more likely to give you a better price .
3 . You do n’t really need all the tours , buy them when you get there .
4 . Get a price breakdown , know exactly what you ’re paying for .
Never accept a total price , that way you can check prices .
5 . Ask for an explanation , and keep asking until you understand .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - All seven Republicans on the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee plan to boycott next week ’s work session on a climate - change bill , an aide said on Saturday , in a move aimed at thwarting Democratic efforts to advance the controversial legislation quickly .

“ Republicans will be forced not to show up ” at Tuesday ’s work session , said Matt Dempsey , a spokesman for Republican senators on the environment panel .
Under committee rules , at least two Republicans are needed for Chairwoman Barbara Boxer to hold the work sessions that would give senators an opportunity to amend the controversial legislation and then vote to approve it in the panel , which is controlled by President Barack Obama ’s fellow Democrats .
But Republicans are demanding more detailed economic analysis of the bill by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- a task that could take more than a month -- before agreeing to participate in the work sessions that are called “ mark ups . ”
The seven Republicans have not indicated they ultimately would vote for the bill , which Boxer wants to move through her committee before December ’s international climate - change summit in Copenhagen .
Even with committee approval of the bill , the full Senate is not expected to vote on it this year .
The legislation , as currently written , would have a hard time gaining the support of the 60 senators needed to pass major bills .
Nevertheless , the Obama administration is hoping for more progress by Congress before the Copenhagen summit .
In June , the House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to reduce U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
CARBON POLLUTION
Boxer ’s bill , which she wrote with Democratic Senator John Kerry , would require U.S. manufacturers , utilities and refineries to reduce their carbon pollution output 20 percent by 2020 , from 2005 levels .
That is slightly more ambitious than the House - passed bill .
Most Republicans and some moderate Democrats in the Senate have criticized the emissions - reduction target of the Kerry - Boxer bill .
Kerry already has begun talking to other senators about significant changes to his bill , including expanding U.S. nuclear power generation .
Republicans on the environment committee say the climate - change bill would cause significant job losses by encouraging manufacturers to relocate more of their plants in countries that do not have as strict carbon controls .
They also say it would significantly boost consumer prices as companies are forced to use more expensive alternative fuels -- a claim that has not been backed up by some independent analysis or by a preliminary EPA analysis .
“ Republicans are insisting on a full EPA analysis before a mark up .
We are not opposed to a mark up , only on holding one this rushed , ” said a statement by committee Republicans .
Full details of the Democratic bill were unveiled only a week ago .
The senior Republican on the committee , Senator James Inhofe , has been an outspoken opponent of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , saying there is no sound scientific evidence that the world is suffering due to carbon emissions resulting from human activities .

GENEVA ( AP ) 
The World Trade Organization 's top arbitrators upheld a ruling that China is illegally restricting imports of U.S. music , films and books , and Washington pushed forward with a new case accusing China of manipulating the prices for key ingredients in steel and aluminum production .
Monday 's verdict by the WTO 's appellate body knocked down China 's objections to an August decision that came down decisively against Beijing 's policy of forcing American media producers to route their business through state - owned companies .
If China fails over the next year to bring its practices in line with international trade law , the U.S. can ask the WTO to authorize commercial sanctions against Chinese goods .
The Asian country 's import restrictions have been a key gripe of Western exporters , who complain that China 's rapid rise as a trade juggernaut has been aided by unfair policies that boost sales of Chinese goods abroad while limiting the amount of foreign products entering the Chinese market .
The probe initiated Monday by the WTO — at the request of the U.S. , Mexico and the 27 - nation European Union — focuses on the other half of the equation by examining China 's treatment of domestic and foreign manufacturers with regards to its vast wealth of raw materials .
Washington and Brussels claim that China unfairly favors domestic industry by setting export quotas on materials such as coke , bauxite , magnesium and silicon metal .
Export quotas are contentious under trade rules because they can cause a glut on the domestic market , driving down prices for local producers , while leading to scarcity and higher prices for competitors abroad .
Beijing , however , claims that the curbs are an effort to protect the environment , and says they comply with WTO rules .
For its part , China is challenging U.S. trade rules on a number of issues such as poultry , and asked the WTO at the dispute body meeting Monday for a new investigation into American import taxes on Chinese tires .
Washington delayed the tire probe for another month , but the global trade referee will likely rule in all these disputes over the course of the next year .
Analysts and observers believe these Sino - American trade fights are only the beginning as President Barack Obama 's administration will likely file more cases against China .
Obama made campaign pledges to take a tougher approach with U.S. trading partners in the face of soaring job losses and the longest U.S. recession since World War II .
Last week , the two countries settled a dispute initiated by the Bush administration in December over subsidies that China allegedly provides to exporters of famous Chinese merchandise .
Beijing agreed out - of - court to eliminate the subsidies , according to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative , which will boost the prospects of U.S. exporters of household appliances , textiles , chemicals , medicines and food products .
The media dispute with China focused on a number of complaints raised by the trade associations representing record labels such as EMI and Sony Music Entertainment ; publishers including McGraw Hill and Simon & Schuster ; and , to a lesser extent , the major Hollywood studios of Warner Bros. , Disney , Paramount , Universal and 20th Century Fox .
The WTO made no finding that implies it is illegal for Beijing to review foreign goods for objectionable content .
But it said China cannot limit the distribution of U.S. goods to Chinese state - owned companies , and said the Asian country 's burdensome restrictions were not " necessary " to protect public morals .

Stein co-managed The Ramones during their 1970s heyday
The personal assistant to former Ramones manager Linda Stein has been convicted in a New York court of bludgeoning her boss to death .
Prosecutors said Natavia Lowery , 28 , stole more than $ 30,000 ( £ 19,500 ) from Stein , then clubbed her with a piece of exercise equipment to try and hide it .
Jurors spent less than a day reaching a second - degree murder verdict .
Stein was found dead at her Manhattan apartment on 30 October 2007 having died from blows to the head and neck .
Although Lowery 's lawyers acknowledged she stole from Stein and at least one previous employer , they denied she killed her .
They argued in their closing statements that police plied their client into a false confession after 12 hours of questioning .
Lowery had initially denied any knowledge of the killing , blaming it on a masked stranger who told her not to report it .
She eventually gave a videotaped account of beating Stein to death after her employer badgered her about the pace of her work and blew cannabis smoke in her face .
Authorities later determined there was no cannabis in Stein 's body when she died , and she suffered far more than the roughly six blows Lowery described .
Surveillance videotape also showed the personal assistant leaving Stein 's building soon after the estimated time of the killing .
Stein managed The Ramones along with Danny Fields during the band 's heyday .
The ex-wife of Sire Records head Seymour Stein , she went into property after parting company with the band in 1980 .
Dubbed a " broker to the stars " , Stein 's clients included Madonna , Sting , Steven Spielberg and Angelina Jolie .
Tokyo , Japan ( CNN ) --
Outside the 400 - year - old Kyoouji Temple , Kansho Tagai , dressed in his traditional monk robes , paused and began a sutra .
He bobbed his head and then broke into a lyrical rap .
" This is an old , old story , a fantasy and longing cosmology .
Hey , hey , what 's the story about ?
It 's about the Buddha , yo .
Hey brother , listen carefully !
You got it ?
No ?
You do n't ?
Okay , baby , no problem . "
Tagai , or Mr. Happiness , as he prefers to be called , is delivering an ancient message to a hip hop beat .
The monk hosts hip hop shows at his temple , drawing young people to a place that is traditionally filled with the elderly .
His hip hop message is so popular that twice as many people now visit his temple .
" Buddha 's doctrine is a treasure for us , " Tagai said .
" But we 're not able to convey his wisdom to the people if we only stick with the old ways .
So I try to use a new way to spread Buddha 's doctrine .
I want to spread Buddhism to the young by using the language they easily understand .
Buddhism itself has n't changed .
It 's just the way it 's presented . "
The ancient religion is in crisis , Tagai said , because monks are not reaching the young with a message that brings spiritual relief .
The numbers support his fears .
Japan is home to 75,000 temples , but those numbers are on the decline .
The Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs reports that since 2000 , hundreds of temples have closed every year .
Will religion soon be a thing of the past ?
Younger monks like Tagai are taking matters into their own hands , by trying to attract a new generation of Buddhists .
At the Monk Bar in Shinjuku , Zenshin Fujioka shakes up the house special .
He pours a drink layered in red , yellow and pink , which he calls " heaven . "
His other special of the night is " hell , " a spicy vodka mix that sticks with you for hours .
Never mind that Zenshin is a monk .
Sutras are shaken and stirred at the Monk Bar .
" There 's this image that monks sit deep in a mountain , training alone , " Zenshin said .
" But it 's important that we come down into the secular world and live in modern society .
An altar does n't mean you have a temple .
A temple is a place where people follow the faith and Buddha . "
" This place is a temple , " Zenshin said , wiping liquor off the bar .
To those who call the venue a gimmick , he said , " please visit my bar before judging . "
As the bar filled with smoke and patrons one evening , Zenshin paused and rang his bell .
The ancient sutras flowed forth , as customers listened .
Hardly anyone can follow the ancient Buddhist text , a Japanese that 's so complicated , only monks are readily able to understand it .
But Zenshin said the real religion happens as he pours the drinks , talking to his guests about their problems and soothing with the Buddhist texts .
" Buddhism for Japan is a religion you normally only experience at funerals , " said patron Naoyuki Osano , who comes to the bar twice a week .
" But the Buddhist philosophy is wonderful .
It 's great to have a place like this for us to learn about Buddhism . "
It might be one of the world ’s poorest areas , besieged by its neighbour Israel , but Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip have been donating what little they have to help those struck by the earthquake in Haiti .
Among the donations collected by a Red Cross representative : toys , toiletries and sweets – small luxuries that Gazans know only too well can brighten spirits in the face of devastation .
Some also gave money .
Dr Jamal Khudari , from the Palestinian Committee against the Siege said : “ It ’s a symbolic donation for the people of Haiti , for the children of Haiti , to tell them that we feel the suffering . ”
There are ruins in the Gaza Strip reminiscent of the scenes in Haiti .
These were not caused by a natural disaster , but by bombs and shells in Israel ’s deadly assault on Gaza , which drew to a close a year ago .
Israel blamed attacks by militants for sparking the offensive .
The reason for the destruction might be different , but Palestinians say they understand Haiti ’s pain .
Q : How do they vote ?
A. Massachusetts employs optical scan balloting without voter - verified paper ballot back - up .
If the race is tight , this procedure will fuel conspiracy theories about hacked votes , ACORN machinations and the like .
The upside : the votes will be counted quickly .
Q . Are there exit polls ?
A. No national exit polls .
We 'll just have to wait .
Q. The recount procedure for Massachusetts is ...
A . Here 's one way for Democrats to delay certification if they think they need to .
If a candidate 's margin of victory statewide is less than one half of one percent , then the losing candidate has up to TEN days to petition for a recount and 15 days to submit petitions to the Secretary of State .
Q. What should we watch for tonight ?
A. Coakley 's margins in Middlesex County , where she 's from , in Suffolk ( that 's Boston ) and in Worcester .
Also : turnout of minorities .
Q. What about independents ?
A. Half of registered voters in Massachusetts are independents .
Most of them lean Democratic .
Most of those who've said they intend to vote lean Republican .
Q. Can Democrats really delay seating Brown ?
A. Probably .
There are several built - in election procedure traps , including the counting of absentee ballots and ballots from soldiers overseas .
If for some reason these ballots are counted and there are no significant challenges by the seventh day after the election -- that 's next Wednesday -- State of the Union Day -- then Secretary of State Bill Galvin could certify the election if he wanted to .
Harry Reid , the majority leader , wo n't seat a senator until the secretary of state certifies him or her .
But a week is too short a time frame here : under federal law , overseas votes can arrive as late as January 29 .
Throw in a few days for the counting of provisional ballots , and we 're into early February .
Then the formal certification meeting happens , which can take an extra day , depending on who is where .
Al Green ’s nightmare began with a pot of grits , ended with two gunshots , and helped push the greatest soul singer of the early ’ 70s away from the music that had made him a star .
On Oct. 18 , 1974 , for reasons that still remain unclear , Green ’s girlfriend , Mary Woodson , then 29 , burst in on the singer as he prepared to take a shower in his Memphis home .
Heaving scalding grits at his back , Woodson burned the singer so badly he would spend several months in the hospital .
Woodson then fled to a bedroom , where she shot and killed herself with the singer ’s registered .38 - caliber pistol .
Green — who had achieved huge artistic and commercial success with songs like ” Let ’s Stay Together , ” ” Take Me to the River , ” and ” Tired of Being Alone ” — had met Woodson at a concert in upstate New York several months earlier .
A few days after Green returned from a concert in San Francisco , Woodson showed up at his Memphis home .
She claimed to be single but actually had left her husband and children behind in New Jersey .
A deeply troubled woman , she latched onto the charismatic Green and his pop-star lifestyle , and the two became close .
” I ’ve never met a man with more of a basic animal appeal to women , ” says Davin Seay , who collaborated with Green on his recent autobiography , Take Me to the River .
” This one came back at him with a vengeance .
I think it was a wake - up call . ”
And an awakening .
” I think it was a catalyst that resulted in him turning from secular music to gospel music , ” says Seay of Green , who ’d become a born - again Christian nearly a year before Woodson ’s suicide .
” It does him an injustice to assume his religious conversion was a matter of convenience based on this traumatic experience , and he likes to distance the facts of his conversion from the terrible events of that night .
But I think the Woodson incident kind of crystallized his need to move on , to sort of shut down one part of his life and open up another . ”
By the late ’ 70s , Green had devoted himself almost entirely to religious music .
In 1976 he became a Baptist minister , buying the Full Gospel Tabernacle church in Memphis , where he continues to preach today .
As horrific as Mary Woodson ’s suicide was , it helped the man who once sang ” Call Me ” to find what he believed to be his true calling .
Let us review .
Commercial ovens designed for pizza or bread have thick stone or refractory brickwork floors , which are preheated to high temperatures and have sufficient thermal mass that placing wet dough on it reduces the temperature by only a small amount .
The side effect is that whatever is on the oven floor cooks extremely quickly .
Commercial ovens are also free of the thermostatic regulators that prevent most home ovens from reaching the high temperatures of which they are almost all capable — during a self - clean cycle , the a home oven reaches north of 900 F .
Clearly , of the many trials faced by the home cook hell - bent on the pizza of his or her dreams , the two biggest are achieving both a high - temperature cooking surface to crisp the bottom of the pizza and a high - temperature cooking environment to rapidly cook the top .
Attempts to surmount these twin problems have included ( but are not limited to ) the following :
• Buying or building a pizza oven much like a serious pizza restaurant would have .
While solving both problems , this solution is not feasible for those with insufficient room ( or floor strength ) for an 800 - pound brick structure .
• Using a pizza stone .
These stoneware discs are usually ½ " to ¾ " thick and take more than an hour to heat up fully in a very hot oven .
This solves problem one , but in a spectacularly energy - inefficient way .
• Jerry - rigging home ovens to cook on the cleaning cycle .
This involves subverting the automatic lock that usually engages when the cleaning cycle is turned on .
If successful , a magnificent pizza .
If unsuccessful in opening the oven and retrieving the pizza , ashes , a damaged pizza stone , and the smell of smoke pervading throughout .
I know this from bitter experience as , apparently , does Jeffrey Steingarten .
• Investing in specialized home pizza - oven machines that surround the pie with ample heat .
Perfect , but at what price ?
Also , I despise equipment that has only one purpose .
Who can really identify the thought processes behind breakthrough ideas ?
In any case , about two weeks ago , it occurred to me to ask three questions :
1 . Does a cast - iron skillet have enough thermal mass to cook and lightly char a pizza base if thoroughly preheated , then taken off the heat ?
2 . Does a broiler generate enough radiant heat and hot air to cook and lightly char a pizza top fast enough to not dry it out ?
3 . Can the combination of a preheated skillet and broiler produce pizza awesomeness ?
The answer to all three questions , as it turns out , is yes .
A cast - iron skillet and a broiler in combination are the easy secret to a light , airy , moist , chewy , crisp , lightly - charred pizza without an expensive wood - fired oven or a potentially - expensive experiment with your home oven 's safety lock .
This pizza will not be quite as good as something baked in under a minute in a roaring - hot pizza oven , but it comes awfully close , all things considered .
After several trial runs , I am ready to share the following learning .

Still in nesting mode , see DIY Bow Wrist Sling , I head to the shop and create a DIY Bow Press for around $ 25 .
The recent purchase of a parallel limb bow left me without the ability to “ press my own ” .
My old traditional style press would n’t work and for the most part I do n’t trust “ pro ” shops to mess with my bows so I was “ up a bow string without a peep sight ” .
Then , while surfing through Archery Talk ’s DIY Forum I found AT user Race59 ’s plans for a $ 20 press that works on a somewhat linear fashion for both parallel and regular limb compound bows .
As presented here it likely will not work on beyond parallel limb bows nor will it allow you to change limbs although there are work - arounds for both discussed in the thread .
Race59 seems to be a fairly prolific press designer who likes to share – to our good fortune .
This is a very portable press easily tossed into the truck bed with your kitchen sink and other gear .

(1) 8 ″ piece of indoor / outdoor carpet or similar cushioning material .
( 4) # 8 x 3/4 ″ wood screws
The pipe clamps , commonly marketed under the Pony brand in your local home improvement store , are available for $ 11 - 13 .
Many of the AT users who utilized 1/2 ″ pipe and clamps reported jamming problems not on the pressing cycle , but on the “ relax ” cycle .
I chose to use 3/4 ″ pipe and clamps since I had a stack of them out in the wood shop .
The pipe was available in shorter 60 ″ ( 5 ′ ) lengths for $ 5 - 11 .
Note that for the construction described here one end MUST be threaded for the pipe clamp to attach .
It typically comes that way or home centers will do it for you at no cost .
As mentioned before , see the original AT thread for other options .
The wood , double - faced tape and carpet were lying around my shop .
Assembly
Note that these instructions are for the 3/4 ″ pipe and clamps .
Adjust dimensions accordingly for 1/2 ″ pipe and clamps .
Step 1 ) Mill the wood to final dimensions .
You want to end up with two blocks 3 1/2 ″ wide x 7 ″ long x 1 1/2 ″ thick .
The two milled blocks .
Step 2 ) Drill a 1 1/8 ″ hole centered 1 1/16 ″ from the bottom into each block for the pipes to pass through .
See the picture for the exact location .
Hole placement .
Step 3 ) Drill a 3/4 ″ hole centered 4 1/8 ″ from the bottom for the cam channel through each block .
Again , see the picture above for the exact location .
Step 4 ) Form the cam channel by cutting a slot between the top of the block and the hole drilled in Step 3 .
Forming the cam channel .
Step 5 ) Cut a 1/4 ″ deep saw kerf into the face of each block 1 ″ from the top .
Forming the bottom of the notch .
Step 6 ) At a 6 - 7 degree angle cut a saw kerf from the top of the block down to meet the kerf cut in Step 5 .
This creates a notch for the bow ’s limbs to rest in .
Forming the top of the notch .
Step 7 ) Apply the double - sided tape and indoor / outdoor carpeting to the notches made in step 6 .
The double - sided tape and indoor / outdoor carpeting applied .
Step 8 ) Drill two 11/64 ″ ( or similar - sized ) holes in the faces of each of the pipe clamps – see photo below .
Holes were drilled in the clamps , pilot holes were drilled in the blocks and screws were installed .
Step 9 ) Transfer the holes from the pipe clamps onto the backs of the wooden blocks .
Drill 1/8 ″ pilot holes 1 ″ deep on the transferred marks .
Attach the blocks to the clamps with the wood screws being careful not to twist the heads off ( as I did 5 times ) .
Step 10 ) Grease the screw end of the pipe around the wooden block and clamp – see picture below .
Many AT users reported filing and sanding the black pipe down to bare metal then waxing it to make the pressing action more smooth .
I ’m short on attention span so I did n’t want to do this tedious task .
Grease the pipe clamp in the area marked .
Step 11 ) Build a base for your press – that is n’t covered here nor is it necessary , but a couple of “ U ” bolts and a tabletop or saw horse should work quite well .
You should now have a viable , portable press .
Using Your Press
To use the press first back off the limb bolts 2 - 4 turns before pressing .
Then adjust the screw end all the way out so that the space between the two clamp faces is the largest .
Place the bow into the block ’s notch on the screw end and adjust the levered end clamp until the opposite limb tip rests snugly into it .
Now begin tightening the screw until the bow is relaxed .
Also note that some bows have draw stops that may have to be removed in order to use this type of press .
Use a pencil to mark the stop location on the cam so that it may be returned easily .
happy hunting , dv

You can now get a satellite 's - eye view of the devastation in Haiti with Google Earth .
Google worked with satellite imaging company GeoEye to put together a map layer file that provides up - close views of the wreckage of government buildings and more in the Haitian capital city of Port - au - Prince .
Download the file to check it out .
It 's in KML format , and it should load in Google Earth automatically if you have that desktop app installed .
Alternatively , you can just pull it up in the web - based Google Maps app .
If you switch the layer on and off for some before - and - after perspective , you 'll see just how serious the damage is — as if the pictures circulating on Twitter and other places on the Internet were n't harrowing enough already .
Here 's an embed with the data to make things even easier .
You can help relief workers , orphanages and other critical services in Haiti by donating on the web .
We 've put together a list of places you can go online to do that .
You can even donate $ 10 by texting " HAITI " to 90999 ; the Red Cross has collected more than $ 3 million that way already .
Sketch of Artificial Wet Neuronal Networks .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new kind of information processing technology inspired by chemical processes in living systems is being developed by researchers at the University of Southampton , UK .
Dr Maurits de Planque and Dr Klaus - Peter Zauner at the University ’s School of Electronics and Computer Science ( ECS ) are working on a project which has just received € 1.8 million from the European Union ’s Future and Emerging Technologies ( FET ) Proactive Initiatives , which recognises ground - breaking work which has already demonstrated important potential .
The researchers , Dr de Planque , a biochemist , and Dr Zauner , a computer scientist , will adapt brain processes to a ' wet ' information processing scenario by setting up chemicals in a tube which behave like the transistors in a computer chip
“ What we are developing here is a very crude , minimal liquid brain and the final computer will be ‘ wet ’ just like our brain , ” said Dr Zauner .
“ People realise now that the best information processes we have are in our heads and as we are increasingly finding that silicon has its limitations in terms of information processing , we need to explore other approaches , which is exactly what we are doing here . ”
The project , entitled Artificial Wet Neuronal Networks from Compartmentalised Excitable Chemical Material , which is being co-ordinated by Friedrich Schiller University Jena with other project partners , the University of the West of England , Bristol and the Institute of Physical Chemistry , Polish Academy of Sciences , Warsaw , will run for three years and involves three complementary objectives .
The first is to engineer lipid - coated water droplets , inspired by biological cells , containing an excitable chemical medium and then to connect the droplets into networks in which they can communicate through chemical signals .
The second objective is to design information - processing architectures based on the droplets and to demonstrate purposeful information processing in droplet architectures .
The third objective is to establish and explore the potential and limitations of droplet architectures .
“ Our system will copy some key features of neuronal pathways in the brain and will be capable of excitation , self - repair and self - assembly , ” said Dr de Planque .

I grew up in a socialist country .
I ’m reminded of it every time I hear that public health care is socialist , or that financial regulation is socialist , or that regulating the auto industry is socialist , or that taxation is “ spreading the wealth ” and therefore socialist .
I do n’t get the impression that this refers to the “ socialism ” of the Scandinavian variety .
More likely , it refers to the Soviet Union and its then - satellite countries – exactly where I was born .
I suppose I should recognize those various socialist things – oppose them , even – as marks of the failed system that I grew up with .
But I do n’t .
Instead , I try to find a way to explain life under socialism to someone who does n’t know it and I come up short every time .
It ’s not just explaining why apples are not like oranges .
It ’s explaining why apples are not like hockey and oranges are not like patio furniture .
Yes , we did have more political repression and government regulation .
Yes , we had censorship , rationing and fewer consumer articles .
People understand that .
But then you mention to someone the high prevalence of tooth decay , and they respond , “ sure , I bet you did n’t have fluoridated water ” , and then you do n’t know if you ’ll be able to answer that in less than half an hour , so you smile , say that it was actually a little bit more complicated , and change the subject .
Take for example taxation .
Do you think it ’s socialist ?
If so , you ’ll be interested to know that neither my parents nor I had ever filed a personal tax return before I left Poland at the age of 23 .
Taxation as it is known in the Western world was almost nonexistent in socialist countries .
Just think about it .
Most of the economy was state - owned , so why would the state try to tax something it owns to begin with ?
The public sector employees – the vast majority of the population – did not pay taxes , either .
Poland allowed a small private sector : family - owned small farms , produce stands , private medical and dental offices , handcraft , and so on .
I think those businesses were taxed .
Of course , the private sector was intended to be only temporary and was expected to disappear once the transition to socialism was fully completed .
There were no sales taxes .
We did have some incidental taxes , for example on inheritance .
That ’s about it .
Is “ spreading the wealth ” socialist ?
Where I grew up , there was no wealth to be spread .
The Eastern European socialist countries were , for the most part , poor as a church mouse .
Poland ’s economy was devastated in WWII , rebuilt less than optimally , then drained and mismanaged throughout the socialist years .
What we had was empty shops , shortages of food and sanitary products , run-down crowded apartments with frequent power and water outages .
Everyone had a flashlight and a supply of candles at home because the power might go out at any time .
The outages could last the whole day or more , so it was common practice to keep pots , buckets and bathtubs filled with water whenever utility work was scheduled .
Did you know that in a water outage you can still flush a toilet by pouring water from a bucket directly into the bowl ?
Well , now you do .
Speaking of accommodation , here ’s a recent photo of my undergraduate dorm .
Back then , of course , we did n’t have satellite dishes .
What you should imagine instead is plastic and mesh grocery bags hanging out from almost every window , with preserve jars and plastic - wrapped food packages clearly visible .
There were only a few shared refrigerators in a dorm housing about 500 students , so most of us kept our food fresh by hanging it out the window whenever it was cold enough outside .
The jars , plastic bags and aluminum foil protected the food from the rain and dirt .
Most of the packaging would be washed and reused .
After graduating with a Master ’s degree , I worked as a junior researcher in the math department and lived in the building that you can see here in the back .
I was initially assigned to a shared bedroom ; once my roommate moved out , I applied for a single bedroom and got it .
Each bedroom had a sink , but the kitchens and bathrooms were communal as in the dorm , one on each floor .
There were families with children living there .
If you had one child , your family was entitled to one bedroom .
If you had two children , you were entitled to two bedrooms , not necessarily on the same floor .
People lived like that for decades , and so would I if I had not left .
The expected waiting period for public housing was 20 years or more and a junior researcher ’s salary did not pay for a decent private rental apartment in a large city .
You think that ’s bad ?
According to one report , a census of a major factory ’s workers in 1957 showed that only 1 % of families had hot running water at home , less than 50 % of families had cold running water , and 75 % did not have a toilet in the building .
Does this begin to answer the question about the teeth ?
As for the shortages of food and other articles , there was a whole culture around it in the 1980s .
You ’d walk into a grocery store and the shelves would be completely empty – or else there would be long rows of canola oil and vinegar bottles on display , because that ’s all there was in stock .
Many articles were rationed at various times , including sugar , meat and meat products , milk , butter , flour and other selected grain products , alcohol , chocolate , cigarettes , soap , laundry detergent , toilet paper , gasoline , and more .
This does not cover all articles that were subject to shortages – products such as coffee and oranges were also hard to get , but they were not rationed because they were not considered essential enough .
( Yes , I know .
Coffee is essential . )
The typical diet was heavily dependent on meat .
That was the tradition and there were n’t many alternatives to choose from .
And meat was in very short supply .
People would often start lining up many hours before the butcher ’s shop would open , bringing blankets and tea in thermoses , waiting for the delivery that might or might not come .
Queuing up at the butcher ’s could be a full - time job , sometimes a paid one , as there were people who got paid to line up on behalf of others who could n’t miss work .
But here ’s something about rationing that you might not know .
You may remember that the origins of the Solidarity trade union go back to an agreement between the government and the striking workers at the Gdansk shipyard that ended the nation - wide strikes in the summer of 1980 .
( See here for the full text in Polish . )
The Gdansk workers had presented the government with a list of 21 demands .
Number one was the right to form independent ( of the government ) trade unions – this led to the creation and legalization of Solidarity .
Number 13 on the same list was meat rationing , which indeed was introduced in February 1981 .
The rationing system was expanded to cover other products later on , except for sugar which had already been rationed since 1976 .
Yes , you ’ve read this right .
Walesa and the reform movement demanded meat rationing .
Of course they also demanded an increase in supply , see items 10 and 11 on the list .
But since it was clear enough that the supply would not meet the demand any time soon , the rationing would introduce an element of fairness to the process .
When I think of socialism , I also think of people who defended it .
I do n’t mean in official media , and I do n’t mean government or party officials .
They were my kin and my friends ’ kin .
They defended socialism in our private conversations , not because they were worried about getting reported by a family member – that did not happen much in my days – but because they genuinely believed that its advantages outweighed the disadvantages .
They would cite public education , public health care , almost universal employment , the elimination of the most extreme poverty .
If that came at the expense of political freedom , so be it .
They believed that it was worth the price .
They were of course skipping over the same point that many Americans are missing right now : it is possible to have public health care without political repression and low living standards for everyone .
That has been demonstrated in many countries including Canada .
It was n’t necessarily an option for Poland , stuck between a rock and a hard place , devastated by the war and strong - armed by the Soviet Union .
We could n’t have it all .
But there ’s no reason why America could n’t .
Last summer , clean energy advocates were confident that the U.S. Congress would pass a comprehensive energy and climate bill by the time the Copenhagen conference rolled around .
Now , as energy issues slip further down the policy priority list in the wake of that failed meeting , advocates are left wondering if the U.S. will see any significant piece of clean energy legislation in 2010 .
With health care , the economy and the upcoming mid-term elections dominating the political agenda in Washington , most onlookers now believe that an energy bill will be broken up into smaller pieces in order to make progress on key issues this year .
“ It looks less and less likely that Congress will pass a broad climate bill .
Lawmakers are now talking about individual bills focused just on one issue , ” says Chris Stimpson , Executive Campaigner for Solar Nation , a grassroots lobbying organization run by the American Solar Energy Society .
Much has changed since the beginning of 2009 , when the clean energy community was banking on President Obama ’s election promises to swiftly pass a climate bill that would put a price on carbon and create strong national targets for renewable energy .
The prospects for such a program looked good last July when the Waxman - Markey bill passed the House of Representatives .
That piece of legislation created a cap and trade program , a 20 percent renewable energy target by 2020 , a program to upgrade the electric grid and stronger energy efficiency standards .
Although the cap and trade portion was criticized by some as being too lenient on polluters , the bill was a major step for renewables :
It would have finally provided the national target that the industry has been seeking for years .
But then the climate bill quickly stalled in the Senate , where lawmakers have been sidetracked by the contentious health care debate .
A number of politicians , including Democratic Senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer , have introduced their own pieces of legislation ; however , it is unlikely that the Senate will vote on either bill until March of this year .
House lawmakers are now urging Senators to act soon , as the bills will expire at the end of this year when the Congressional session ends .
Because this is a Congressional election year , the make - up of the House and Senate may be different when the new session begins .
That could mean that Democrats — who have been much more supportive of climate and clean energy legislation — will have less power to pass a strong bill next year .
And if members of Congress are worrying about getting re-elected , they may not give as much attention to climate and energy issues this year .
“ [ Congress ] may not have the energy , ironically enough , to work on an energy bill , ” says Stimpson .
“ If it does n’t happen by Memorial day , this being an election year , it ’s generally understood here [ in Washington ] that you can forget it — nothing else will happen until after the election . ”
The chance that individual , renewable - energy specific programs will get passed is much more realistic , says Stimpson .
Some analysts believe that Congress will individually support more manufacturing tax credits for renewable energy companies , a renewable energy standard and increased funding for an overhaul of the electric grid , rather than an overarching climate bill .
Many advocates who see renewables as only one part of a broader carbon - reduction strategy are disappointed by this approach .
Assuming the political landscape in Washington will be different in the next session of Congress , they see 2010 as a “ make - or - break ” year for climate change legislation .
“ To say that we ’ll pass some parts this year and save other parts for other years , I think risks dealing with the bargaining in Congress that needs to take place , ” says Jim Rubens with the advocacy group Clean Energy Works .
“ If we ca n’t get them in this year , they ’re just going to be tougher to get later . ”
To make matters more complicated , there is increasing backlash in Washington against an economy - wide cap and trade program .
Many Senators have proposed more straightforward carbon taxes or “ cap and dividend ” programs , which would tax carbon at the source and then send the money back to taxpayers in different ways .
Most observers believe that cap and trade will be the policy of choice , but they agree that the debate could be delayed further as concerns over a complex trading program are worked out .
“ I do believe [ cap and trade ] is on the train right now .
But I do think there ’s going to be lots of compromise and lots of horse trading .
And you never know what ’s going to end up in the sausage until the votes are taken , ” says Analyst Scott Sklar , president of the Washington , DC - based consulting firm Stella Group Ltd .
In the meantime , the Environmental Protection Agency is gearing up to start regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act .
This top - down “ command and control ” approach , which is much less flexible than a trading program , has many in the energy business worried .
The Obama administration is using this option as a way to get Congress moving on a climate bill this year .
It does n’t appear to be working , however .
Even though the passage of a comprehensive climate bill is becoming less likely each day , analysts are still positive about the prospects for renewables in 2010 .
After all , the Obama administration has given more support for clean energy in the last year than had been given in the last decade , says Sklar .
Sklar points to last year ’s stimulus package , increased government spending on R&D and the billions of private dollars that have poured into the industry as tell - tale signs of how strong the industry is today — even if Congress does n’t pass a bill that advocates were hoping for .
“ Sometimes you have to separate the climate issues and the renewables issues … They are both extremely important … but I sometimes have to pinch myself when I see where [ the renewable energy industry ] has come .
It ’s on a trajectory that I do n’t think can be stopped . ”
There 's an incredibly powerful movement opposed to action on climate change .
Without doubt it had more influence on the outcome of the climate negotiations in Copenhagen than many of the world 's countries combined .
Obama knew if he signed up to something that would truly deliver significant cuts in global warming pollution , he 'd suffer a serious blow from this movement 's army of activists and its allies in the Senate .
This movement 's ability to make Democrats pay a serious political price – just see what they helped to do in Massachusetts where the Democrat candidate lost a recent election – shows what raw activism can look like .
The name of this world - changing movement ?
It 's the Tea Party movement , coupled with its sophisticated echo chamber of right - wing shock jocks , culture - war keyboard commandos , and allies at Fox News , all pushing the scepticism line on climate change .
Over the last few years as climate campaigners such as myself have tried to mount a good rational argument , theirs has mounted a powerful disinformation campaign .
In the last few weeks we have witnessed that effective campaign gain momentum and turn into a sort of global asymmetrical warfare , with criticism of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) for its claims about the speed with which Himalayan glaciers are melting , personal attacks against its chairman Rajendra Pachauri and a persistent hounding of climate scientists and those reviewing the scientists .
Gold - standard scientific reporting from the IPCC , and indeed the value of scientific inquiry itself , is now under sustained assault from a motley assortment of cranks , ideologues and special interest voices intent on stopping the transition to a clean energy economy .
It was just these sorts of tactics that , with the Swift boat campaign questioning his military service , helped to bring down Senator John Kerry 's presidential candidacy in 2004 .
The problem was that Kerry thought being right would be enough .
His response was to be photographed going wind - surfing .
In contrast , when Obama ran in 2008 and he faced a similar smear campaign attack on the basis of inflammatory comments made by his former pastor , the Reverend Wright , he knew being right would n't be enough .
What followed was Obama 's race speech in Philadelphia setting the record straight , and the rest is history .
There 's still time for the IPCC to be Obama in 2008 rather than Kerry in 2004 , but that 's going to require a much stronger response than it 's issued so far .
At the moment there 's a real danger that when the next major IPCC climate assessment report is released , the likes of the BBC will feel the need to spend 30 % of their coverage remembering an inconsequential error about Himalayan glaciers in the last report , because the battle here is over trust and perception .
On both of these fronts there can be no doubt that the scientists are losing ground .
We all need the IPCC to focus urgently on rebuilding trust , and for the scientific community at large to robustly defend science itself .
Influential sceptical commentators can afford to just throw mud and see what sticks , because they have what former PM Stanley Baldwin famously attacked back in 1931 as " power without responsibility . "
It 's the same dynamic that allowed Sarah Palin to make up " death panel " myths to distort the US healthcare debate and get away with it — those in opposition just do n't face the same scrutiny as those holding the incumbent establishment position .
That 's why inside newsrooms the balance of legitimacy has been allowed to tilt so considerably that the climate science controversy that was largely resolved is now live once again , despite the rock solid nature of the core facts .
Prolific climate deniers such as Ian Plimer , James Delingpole and Christopher Booker who deliberately spread untruths on climate change can be wrong 99 % of the time and right for less than 1 % of the time and still win the argument because the playing field simply is n't level .
Equally , the IPCC can be right 99 % of the time and wrong less than 1 % of the time , and they still lose .
The climate movement would be wrong to underestimate the damage that 's been done over these last few weeks .
One extremely influential British journalist told me that editors are coming under significant pressure to adopt a more contrarian stance on the climate science because they are receiving scores of emails and telephone calls daily from the public demanding a more sceptical line .
They are receiving very few messages supporting the consensus scientific view .
On the web the situation is even starker .
The top ten conservative blogs in Britain are all sceptical of climate science and the founder of Conservativehome.com , Tim Montgomerie , himself a climate sceptic , now compares it to Europe as a major dividing line that even splits the shadow cabinet .
If you still doubt the power of this sceptic surge , ask yourself how much of the Tory party 's rump of climate scepticism can be put down to Conservative MPs and activists having read Plimer in the Spectator , or Booker or Delingpole in the Telegraph , or Iain Dale online .
The scientific community , with honourable exceptions , continues to handle the issue badly because they have n't apologised for their mistakes and come out all guns blazing on the robustness of the climate science .
But utimately , as John Kerry learned , and as Obama mastered completely during his campaign , an altogether different kind of response is required anyway — one that speaks less in the language of " parts per million of atmospheric carbon dioxide " and more to people 's values and everyday concerns .
I 've often thought it strange and problematic that climate change became a culture war issue .
Rightly or wrongly , if you " believe " the science of climate change , it 's assumed that you probably read The Guardian or Independent , that you support gay marriage and opposed the war in Iraq .
But of course the polarisation of society on this issue has been completely manufactured by those who seek to deliberately polarise the carbon debate by painting climate change as the latest liberal obsession .
That 's why climate change has come to be associated with austerity and regulation when it could just as easily be connected with economic opportunity and national security .
After all , dealing with climate change will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas from unstable regimes , and involve establishing a multi-trillion dollar global clean energy market , effectively a global arms race for green technologies .
Right now global warming is linked to rising energy bills and potential black outs .
In fact insulation of people 's homes would mean reduced energy bills , a smaller number of fuel poor , and increased energy security .
This issue can and should be owned by left and right alike .
We climate activists need to ask ourselves how this whole incongruous state of affairs came about .
The most zealous deniers , a subculture of outlandish paranoid conspiracy theorists , claim to speak for independent thinking when in truth they 're the shock troops for a choking and insidious form of censorship , blotting out the truth with the ideology and interests of the world 's most powerful Big Carbon corporates .
Climate change is real and human - caused , the case for tackling it is just common sense .

Underground Inspiration
Last year , the inaugural SHIFTboston Ideas Competition called on architects , designers , engineers , and others to submit provocative visions “ to enhance and electrify the urban experience in Boston . ”
The competition sponsors were n’t necessarily looking for build - able schemes , but rather for inspiration — for ideas that would engage citizens and galvanize the local design community .
But the winning proposal , announced last month , actually does n’t seem that far - fetched .
The architects Sapir Ng and Andrzej Zarzycki — the former is an associate at Tsoi / Kobus & Associates , the latter an assistant professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology — envisioned a new use for the abandoned Tremont Street Subway tunnel , which runs underneath Boston Common .
In their scheme , the tunnel becomes a network of underground cultural venues , including a theater , a cinema , art galleries , and a “ media - infused trolley museum . ”
What are the chances that such a thing could actually be built ?
Right now it ’s simply too early to tell ; according to a press release from Tsoi / Kobus & Associates , “ [ m ] eetings to share details of the plan with politicians and policy makers are currently being scheduled . ”
Here ’s hoping those meetings happen , and that the city ’s politicians are canny enough ( and / or jealous enough of New York ’s High Line ) to take Ng and Zarzychi ’s proposal seriously .

Critics have pointed to a blizzard in the Mid-Atlantic states as the latest evidence that climate change is a hoax .
Comedy Central ’s Stephen Colbert used his “ advanced weather forecasting technology ” to determine that the current winter conditions prove that the world will be cold and dark forever .
Colbert announced an advancement in weather technology : The Dopplest 9000 .
“ Others may be ‘ doppler , ’ but mine is the ‘ dopplest , ’ explained Colbert .

“ As you can see , the East Coast is being slammed by a classic nor ’easter , ” said Colbert .
“ Especially hard hit is Washington D.C. , where it has snowed twice in one week . ”
“ Therefore completely repudiating the theory of global warming , ” Colbert decided .
But Colbert is n’t the only one that is using the current weather conditions as proof that global warming is a hoax .
One Fox News guest told Neil Cavuto Wednesday that the weather is “ burying [ Al Gore ’s ] global warming theory . ”
Fox News host Steve Doocy asked , “ The weather is so rotten people are going ‘ How can there be global warming ? ' ”
Another Fox News host , Sean Hannity , said Monday that the snow storm “ would seem to contradict Al Gore ’s hysterical global warming theories . ”

“ That is simple observational research , ” noted Colbert .
“ Whatever just happened is the only thing that ’s happening . ”
Taking a shot at climate change deniers , Colbert said , “ Ask any peek - a - boo - ologist . ”
But then Colbert used his high tech weather technology to break an even bigger story .
“ Which leads me to my next terrifying weather alert , ” he said .
“ According to my dopplest 9000 , it ’s dark outside . ”

“ Based on this latest data , I can only assume that the sun has been destroyed , ” concluded the comedian .

Japanese Man Ties Record For Catching Biggest Largemouth Bass
Records were made to be broken , or in this case , tied .
Unfortunately for this Japanese fishing hero , it took more than 6 months for him to get recognition for his amazing catch .
The original record for biggest largemouth bass is 22 pounds 4 ounces and was held for 77 years by Georgia angler George Perry .
On July 22 , 2009 , that record was tied by Japanese fisherman Manabu Kurita , but due to some controversy surrounding the catch , it was not approved until a couple days ago .
What caused the controversy ?
Well there was a ton of speculation that Kurita had caught the fish in a no fishing zone or broken some other laws in order to catch the beast .
Kurita had to undergo extreme scrutiny to get his record in the books , even undergoing a polygraph lie - detector test .
The International Game Fish Association , which administers these records , claimed it wanted to make sure that the record was obtained properly before certifying it , although some speculation exists that the holy grail of fishing records was being protected by the industry that has profited so greatly from it .
Either way this is an impressive fish , though its not exactly a 750 pound , 10 - foot shark .
I ’m a terrible fisherman myself , the biggest fish I have ever caught is maybe 3 pounds at most .
I bet that giant bass is a lot tastier than my fish was .
Do you think they get to eat it ?

This article is part of the Tobacco portal on Sourcewatch funded from 2006 - 2009 by the American Legacy Foundation .
Edward Louis Bernays ( November 22 , 1891 – March 9 , 1995 ) is considered one of the fathers of the field of public relations along with Ivy Lee .
As a member of the Creel Committee , he helped U.S. President Woodrow Wilson propagandize in support of allied war aims during World War I .
He went on to design PR campaigns for politicians and companies such as General Motors , Procter & Gamble and American Tobacco .
Combining the ideas of Gustave Le Bon and Wilfred Trotter on crowd psychology with the psychoanalytical ideas of his uncle , Sigmund Freud , Bernays was one of the first to attempt to manipulate public opinion using the subconscious .
He felt this manipulation was necessary in society , which he regarded as irrational and dangerous as a result of the ' herd instinct ' that Trotter had described .
Adam Curtis 's award - winning 2002 documentary for the BBC , The Century of the Self , pinpoints Bernays as the originator of modern public relations , and Bernays was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine . [ 1 ]
Life and Influences
Born 1891 in Vienna to Jewish parents , Bernays was nephew to psychoanalyst pioneer Sigmund Freud .
His father was Ely Bernays , brother of Freud 's wife Martha Bernays .
His mother was Freud 's sister , Anna . [ 2 ]
In 1892 his family moved to New York City .
In 1912 he graduated from Cornell University with a degree in agriculture , but chose journalism as his first career .
He married Doris E. Fleischman in 1922 .
As well as being influenced by his uncle Sigmund 's ideas of the Unconscious , Bernays applied the ideas of the French writer Gustave LeBon , the originator of Crowd psychology , and of Wilfred Trotter , who promoted similar ideas to the English speaking world in his famous book , Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War .
Bernays refers to these two names in his writings .
Trotter , who was a head and neck surgeon at University College Hospital , London , read Freud 's works , and it was he who introduced Wilfred Bion , with whom he lived and worked , to Freud 's ideas .
When Freud fled Germany for London at the start of World War II , Trotter became his personal physician , and Bion and Ernest Jones became key members of the Freudian Psychoanalysis movement in England , and would go on to develop the field of Group Dynamics , largely associated with the Tavistock Institute where many of Freud 's followers worked .
Thus ideas of Group Psychology and Psychoanalysis came together in London around World War II .
Bernays ' public relations efforts helped popularize Freud 's theories in the United States .
Through him , Freud 's influence on the fledgling public relations industry was enormous , and that legacy continues today in the most direct familial sense at Freud Communications , a high - powered British PR firm owned by Matthew Freud , Sigmund 's great - grandson .
In addition to handling celebrities such as Arnold Schwarzenegger , Sylvester Stallone , Bruce Willis , Hugh Grant and Pamela Anderson , Freud Communications has worked for companies such as Volvo and Pizza Hut , and also handled the PR for the 1995 launch of Pepsi 's redesigned soda pop cans . [ 3 ]
Bernays also pioneered the PR industry 's use of psychology and other social sciences to design its public persuasion campaigns .
" If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind , " he wrote , " is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it ?
The recent practice of propaganda has proved that it is possible , at least up to a certain point and within certain limits . "
( Propaganda , 2005 ed. , p. 71 . )
He called this scientific technique of opinion - molding the " engineering of consent . "
In 1913 , Bernays started his career as Press Agent , counseling to theaters , concerts and the ballet .
In 1917 , American President Woodrow Wilson engaged George Creel and realizing one of his ideas , he founded the " Committee on Public Information . "
Bernays , Carl Byoir and John Price Jones worked together to influence public opinion towards supporting American participation in World War I .
In 1919 , Bernays opened an office as Public Relations Counselor in New York .
He held the first Public Relations course at the University of New York in 1923 , publishing the first groundbreaking book on public relations entitled Crystallizing Public Opinion that same year .
The Third Party Technique
One of Bernays ' favorite techniques for manipulating public opinion was the indirect use of " third party authorities " to plead his clients ' causes .
" If you can influence the leaders , either with or without their conscious cooperation , you automatically influence the group which they sway " , he said .
In order to promote sales of bacon , for example , he conducted a survey of physicians and reported their recommendation that people eat heavy breakfasts .
He sent the results of the survey to 5,000 physicians , along with publicity touting bacon and eggs as a hearty breakfast .
" He helped shape public relations by favoring the use of endorsements from opinion leaders , celebrities , doctors and other " experts " to strengthen the arguments his clients wanted to make .
In addition , he favored surveys , releasing the results of experiments and polls to make a better case for his clients ' positions and products , " reported the New York Times . [ 4 ]
Bernays also drew upon his uncle Sigmund 's psychoanalytic ideas for the benefit of commerce in order to promote products as diverse as cigarettes , soap and books .
Beyond his contributions to these famous and powerful clients , Bernays revolutionized public relations by combining traditional press agentry with the techniques of psychology and sociology to create what one writer has called " the science of ballyhoo . "
PR industry historian Scott Cutlip describes Bernays as " perhaps public relations ' most fabulous and fascinating individual , a man who was bright , articulate to excess , and most of all , an innovative thinker and philosopher of this vocation that was in its infancy when he opened his office in New York in June 1919 . "
Philosophy and public relations
Bernays ' papers , just recently opened , contain a wealth of information on the founding of the field in the twenties .
In fact , The Biography of an Idea : Memoirs of Public Relations Counsel Edward L. Bernays ( 1965 ) contains one of the very best overviews of the decade .
Many of the essays selected for the Coolidge - Consumerism collection from the Bernays Papers were written as early drafts for The Biography of an Idea .
Bernays defined the profession of " counsel on public relations " as a " practicing social scientist " whose " competence is like that of the industrial engineer , the management engineer , or the investment counselor in their respective fields . "
To assist clients , PR counselors used " understanding of the behavioral sciences and applying them - sociology , social psychology , anthropology , history , etc . "
Bernays , who pursued his calling in New York City 1919 - 1963 , styled himself a " public relations counsel . "
He had very pronounced views on the differences between what he did and what people in advertising did .
A pivotal figure in the orchestration of elaborate corporate advertising campaigns and multi-media consumer spectacles , he nevertheless is among those listed in the acknowledgments section of the seminal government social science study Recent Social Trends in the United States ( 1933 ) .
On a par with Bernays as the most sought - after public relations counsel of the decade was Ivy Ledbetter Lee , among whose chief clients were John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , Bethlehem Steel , Armour & Company , and the Pennsylvania Railroad .
Lee is represented in the Coolidge - Consumerism collection by " Publicity : Some of the Things It Is and Is Not " ( 1925 ) .
The belief that propaganda and news were legitimate tools of his business , and Bernays 's ability to offer philosophical justifications for these beliefs that ultimately embraced the whole democratic way of life , in Bernays ' mind set his work in public relations apart from what ad men did .
The Bernays essays A Public Relations Counsel States His Views ( 1927 ) and This Business of Propaganda ( 1928 ) show that Bernays regarded advertising men as special pleaders , merely paid to persuade people to accept an idea or commodity .
The public relations counsel , on the other hand , he saw as an Emersonian - like creator of events that dramatized new concepts and perceptions , and even influenced the actions of leaders and groups in society .
Bernays ' vision was of a utopian society in which the dangerous libidinal energies that lurked just below the surface of every individual could be harnessed and channeled by a corporate elite for economic benefit .
Through the use of mass production , big business could fulfill constant craving of the inherently irrational and desire driven masses , simultaneously securing the niche of a mass production economy ( even in peacetime ) , as well as sating the dangerous animal urges that threatened to tear society apart if left unquelled .
In Manipulating Public Opinion ( 1928 ) , Bernays wrote : " This is an age of mass production .
In the mass production of materials a broad technique has been developed and applied to their distribution .
In this age , too , there must be a technique for the mass distribution of ideas . "
In This Business of Propaganda ( 1928 ) , he argued that a public relations counsel " must never accept a retainer or assume a position which puts his duty to the groups he represents above his duty to society . "
In practice , however , Bernays took on clients such as the tobacco industry whose products he knew were harmful to the public .
In later life , he stated publicly that he regretted doing so .[ citation needed ]

Propaganda .
Cover of Bernays ' 1928 book ,
In Propaganda ( 1928 ) , his most important book , Bernays argued that the scientific manipulation of public opinion was a necessary to overcome chaos and conflict in society :
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democracy society .
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country .
...
We are governed , our minds are molded , our tastes formed , our ideas suggested , largely by men we have never heard of .
This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized .
Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society .
...
In almost every act of our daily lives , whether in the sphere of politics or business , in our social conduct or our ethical thinking , we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons ... who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses .
It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind .
Tie-In
Bernays had a particular gift for the marketing strategy called the " tie - up " or " tie - in " -- in which one venue or opportunity or occasion for promoting a consumer product , for example , radio advertising , is linked to another , say , newspaper advertising , and even , at times , to a third , say a department store exhibition salesroom featuring the item , and possibly even a fourth , such as an important holiday , for example Thrift Week .
Bernays ' brilliance for promotion in this vein emerges clearly when one reads , in the Bernays Typescript on Publicizing the New Dodge Cars , 1927 - 1928 : " Two Sixes " , the story of how he managed to secure newspaper coverage for the radio programs he developed to promote the Dodge Brothers ' new six - cylinder cars .
The Bernays Typescript on Publicizing the Fashion Industry , 1925 - 27 : " Hats and Stockings " and the Bernays Typescript on Art in the Fashion Industry , 1923 - 1927 , reveal a similar flair for consumer manipulation in the arena of fashion .
In addition to famous corporate clients , such as the Dodge Brothers , Procter & Gamble , the American Tobacco Company , Cartier Inc. , Best Foods , CBS , the United Fruit Company , General Electric , Dodge Motors , the fluoridationists of the Public Health Service , Knox - Gelatin , and innumerable other big names , Bernays also worked on behalf of many non-profit institutions and organizations .
These included , to name just a few , the Committee on Publicity Methods in Social Work ( 1926 -1927 ) , the Jewish Mental Health Society ( 1928 ) , the Book Publishers Research Institute ( 1930 - 1931 ) , the New York Infirmary for Women and Children ( 1933 ) , the Committee for Consumer Legislation ( 1934 ) , the Friends of Danish Freedom and Democracy ( 1940 ) , the Citywide Citizens ' Committee on Harlem ( 1942 ) , and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society ( 1954 -1961 ) .
For the U.S. Government , he worked for the President 's Emergency Committee on Employment ( 1930 - 1932 ) and President Calvin Coolidge .
In 1950s Bernays helped create India as the Democratic Republic of Southeast Asia by having the People 's Congress of India adapt the Bill of Rights , adding freedom of the press , speech , religion , assembly , and freedom of petition to the country 's constitution .
The Bernays Typescript on Public Relations Work and Politics , 1924 : " Breakfast with Coolidge " shows that President Coolidge too was among his clients .
Bernays was hired to improve Coolidge 's image before the 1924 presidential election .
Another selection from his papers , the Typescript on Publicizing the Physical Culture Industry , 1927 : " Bernarr Macfadden " , reveals Bernays ' opinion of the leader of the physical culture movement .
Yet another client , department store visionary Edward A. Filene , was the subject of the Typescript on a Boston Department Store Magnate .
Bernays ' Typescript on the Importance of Samuel Strauss : " 1924 - Private Life " shows that the public relations counsel and his wife were fans of consumerism critic Samuel Strauss .
Clients and Campaigns
Bernays 's clients included President Calvin Coolidge , Procter & Gamble , CBS , the American Tobacco Company , General Electric and Dodge Motors .
In the 1920s , working for the American Tobacco Company , Bernays sent a group of young models to march in the New York City parade .
He then told the press that a group of women 's rights marchers would light " Torches of Freedom . "
On his signal , the models lit Lucky Strike cigarettes in front of the eager photographers .
The New York Times ( 1 April 1929 ) printed a story headlined , " Group of Girls Puff at Cigarettes as a Gesture of ' Freedom . ' "
This helped break the taboo against women smoking in public . [ 5 ]
( 1 April 1929 ) printed a story headlined , " Group of Girls Puff at Cigarettes as a Gesture of ' Freedom . ' "
This helped break the taboo against women smoking in public .
Bernays handled publicity for the 1920 regional convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Atlanta . [ 6 ]
Bernays once engineered a " pancake breakfast " with vaudevillians for U.S. President Calvin Coolidge in what is widely considered one of the first overt media acts for a president .
Bernays used his uncle Sigmund Freud 's ideas to help convince the public , among other things , that bacon and eggs was the true all - American breakfast . [ 7 ]
In October 1929 , Bernays was involved in promoting " Light 's Golden Jubilee . "
The event , which spanned across several major cities in the U.S. , was designed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Thomas Edison 's invention of the light - bulb .
The publicity elements of the Jubilee – included the special issuance of a U.S. postage stamp and Edison 's " re-creating " the invention of the light bulb for a nationwide radio audience . "
Bernays helped the Aluminum Company of America ( Alcoa ) and other special interest groups to convince the American public that water fluoridation was safe and beneficial to human health .
This was achieved by using the American Dental Association in a highly successful media campaign .
In the 1930s , his Dixie Cup campaign was designed to convince consumers that only disposable cups were sanitary .
In 1934 , Bernays spent $ 30,000 organizing a " green fashions ball " in the hope that it would stimulate women across the country to color - coordinate with Lucky 's green packaging .
[ 8 ]
Bernays worked for six months to make green the fashion color of the year .
In addition to organizing the " Green Ball " with socialites , he worked with manufacturers of accessories , dresses and textiles , and sent 6,500 letters and kits to department stores , fashion editors and interior decorators , telling them of the green " trend . "
At his urging , Harper 's Bazaar and Vogue featured green on covers on date of the Green Ball .
He also sent press releases with psychologist stories suggesting benefits of the color green , as " color of spring , an emblem of hop , victory ( over depression ) and plenty . " [ 9 ]
According to the New York Times , " sales figures " proved that the " campaign was a brilliant success . " [ 10 ]
However , the campaign failed to impress George Washington Hill , the president of American Tobacco .
He fired Bernays , believing that the money spent on the campaign had been wasted .
Beyond his contributions to these famous and powerful clients , Bernays revolutionized public relations by combining traditional press agentry with the techniques of psychology and sociology to create what one writer has called " the science of ballyhoo . " [ citation needed ]
Used by Fascists
History has shown the flaw in Bernays 's claim that " manipulation of the masses " is natural and necessary in a democratic society .
The fascist rise to power in Germany demonstrated that propaganda could be used to subvert democracy as easily as it could be used to " resolve conflict . "
In his autobiography , titled Biography of an Idea , Bernays recalls a dinner at his home in 1933 where " Karl von Weigand , foreign correspondent of the Hearst newspapers , an old hand at interpreting Europe and just returned from Germany , was telling us about Goebbels and his propaganda plans to consolidate Nazi power .
Goebbels had shown
Weigand his propaganda library , the best Weigand had ever seen .
Goebbels , said Weigand , was using my book Crystallizing Public Opinion as a basis for his destructive campaign against the Jews of Germany .
This shocked me .
...
Obviously the attack on the Jews of Germany was no emotional outburst of the Nazis , but a deliberate , planned campaign . "
Bernays is held in high standards even today , and was even named as one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century . [ 11 ]
Overthrow of government of Guatemala
On behalf of the United Fruit Company ( today's Chiquita Brands International ) , Bernays orchestrated political propaganda in concert with the U.S. government to facilitate the overthrow of the democratically elected president of Guatemala , Jacobo Arbenz Guzman .
Bernays ' propaganda ( documented in the BBC documentary , The Century of the Self ) , branded Arbenz as communist and was published in major U.S. media .
According to a book review by John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton of Larry Tye 's biography , " The Father of Spin : Edward L. Bernays & The Birth of PR " ,
" the term ' banana republic ' actually originated in reference to United Fruit 's domination of corrupt governments in Guatemala and other Central American countries .
The company brutally exploited virtual slave labor in order to produce cheap bananas for the lucrative U.S. market . "
Self - promotion
Much of Bernays 's reputation today stems from his persistent public relations campaign to build his own reputation as " America 's No. 1 Publicist . "
During his active years , many of his peers in the industry were offended by Bernays 's constant self - promotion .
According to Cutlip , " Bernays was a brilliant person who had a spectacular career , but , to use an old - fashioned word , he was a braggart . "
" When a person would first meet Bernays , " Cutlip wrote , " it would not be long until Uncle Sigmund would be brought into the conversation .
His relationship with Freud was always in the forefront of his thinking and his counseling . "
According to Irwin Ross , another writer , " Bernays liked to think of himself as a kind of psychoanalyst to troubled corporations . "
In the early 1920s , Bernays arranged for the US publication of an English - language translation of Freud 's General Introduction to Psychoanalysis .
In addition to publicizing Freud 's ideas , Bernays used his association with Freud to establish his own reputation as a thinker and theorist — a reputation that was further enhanced when Bernays authored several landmark books of his own , most notably Crystallizing Public Opinion ( 1923 , ISBN 0-87140-975-5 ) , Propaganda ( 1928 , ISBN 0-8046-1511 - X ) and " The Engineering of Consent " in Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science ( March 1947 ) .
Recognition and criticism
Bernays 's celebration of propaganda helped define public relations , but it did n't win the industry many friends .
In a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt , Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter described Bernays and Ivy Lee as " professional poisoners of the public mind , exploiters of foolishness , fanaticism and self - interest . "
Articles in the journals of opinion , such as the one by Marlen Pew , Edward L. Bernays Critiqued as " Young Machiavelli of Our Time " , and the debate between Bernays and Everett Dean Martin in Forum , Are We Victims of Propaganda ? , depicted Bernays negatively .
He and other publicists were often attacked as propagandists and deceptive manipulators , who represented special interests against the public interest and covertly contrived events that secured coverage as news stories , free of charge , for their clients instead of securing attention for them through paid advertisements .
A 2002 BBC documentary , The Century of the Self , also describes Bernays as " undemocratic " .
In 2006 a Der Spiegel journalist interviewed the founder of the PR firm Burson - Marsteller , Harold Burson , and asked him about the role of Edward Bernays in shaping the course of modern PR .
" Bernays thought that he could control public opinion .
His methodology , of course , was fundamental .
Most of the things we do today were identified by Bernays 80 years ago .
He had brilliant ideas .
I met him a few times , but did n’t like him .
He was one of the most egocentric people I have ever met , " Burson said . [ 12 ]

The owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village , the iconic middle - class housing complexes overlooking the East River in Manhattan , have decided to turn over the properties to creditors , officials said Monday morning .
The decision by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty comes four years after the $ 5.4 billion purchase of the complexes ’ 110 buildings and 11,227 apartments in what was the most expensive real estate deal of its kind in American history .
The surrender of the properties , first reported by the Wall Street Journal , ends a tortured real estate saga that saw the partnership make expensive improvements to the complex and then try to rent the apartments at higher market rates in a real estate boom .
But a real estate downturn and the city ’s strong rent protections hindered those efforts , leaving the buyers scrambling to make payments on loans due for the properties , which have been a comfortable harbor for the city ’s middle class since they opened in the late 1940s .
“ We have spent the last few weeks negotiating in good faith to restructure the debt and ownership of Stuyvesant Town / Peter Cooper Village , ” said the statement by the partnership .
“ Over the last few days , however , it has become clear to us through this process that the only viable alternative to bankruptcy would be to transfer control and operation of the property , in an orderly manner , to the lenders and their representatives . ”

Bloom Box and the Very Disruptive Future of Distributed Energy [ Video ]
‘ Holy Grail ’ vs ‘ Disruptive ’
Bloom Energy is helping to shake up the conversation about the future of distributed energy systems .
But let ’s be clear …!!!
There is no Holy Grail solution for global energy market !
There is no silver bullet !
The spectrum of energy demands is too wide and varied across applications to have one single solution .
Disruptive energy systems exist for the demands of tiny sensors ( ambient capture ) , smart phones ( density ) , electric vehicles ( low cost per weight ) , data centers ( reliability ) , and grid energy ( base load ) .
So let ’s not get distracted looking for one solution !
More importantly , we should not confuse an aspirational industry ‘ holy grail ‘ for a genuinely applied ‘ disruptive ‘ energy system that could change the cost structure and business model innovation landscape in a way that avoids direct competition with incumbents .
Disruptive energy platforms are rare ( e.g. steam engine , internal combustion engine , electrical grid ) but we are likely to see more candidates emerge in the 21st century as we tap the power of energy entrepreneurs and advance our knowledge and engineering prowess in the areas of nanoscale materials design and bio industrial processes .
Energy systems are about the interaction of molecules – and both nano– and bio– give humanity new shapes to manipulate and control the interaction of light , electrons and molecules .
And within the energy sector , it is materials science that enables business model innovation ( not the other way around ) !
This is a materials science game !
Why Bloom Energy ’s Distributed Fuel Cell Vision is Disruptive
Low cost , highly reliable distributed power generation systems are disruptive because they open up a new ecosystem for non-grid based power generation that can bypass the incumbents entrenched business model .
They are green in the sense that electrochemical energy conversion is more efficient and less polluting than combustion conversion .
But let ’s be clear .
Being green is less disruptive than being cheap , reliable and distributed .
What makes an energy system disruptive ?
Let ’s look at two versions of solar .
Traditional solar farms try to compete directly against the grid without a chemical fuel .
Good luck !
Feels good , but it ’s not disruptive .
You are at the mercy of grid access , price volatility of chemical fuels , and the regulatory frameworks of the utility sector .
The disruptive version is ‘ distributed solar ’ ( e.g. rooftop via thin film solar ) and is not connected to the grid , and creates new market demand rather than trying to replace or repair the old model .
Fuel cells convert chemical fuels ( e.g. natural gas , oil , coal , propane , biofuels , hydrogen ) into electricity .
They are silent , have no moving parts and can be manufactured using low cost scalable and modular assembly .
Electricity powers the future !
And fuels dominate the electricity power generation market .
Bloom Energy plays into the fuels market , but offers a non -grid solution for energy !
Bloom Energy ’s success will of course be based on its ability to continue to apply innovative technology with great business leadership .
As to the skeptic points raised by Greentech Media ‘s Michael Kanellos ( whom I respect and admire ! ) here are my notes on issues of :
Hype : I hear you !
Of course , we ’ve followed this since Ballard ’s bubble in the late 1990s .
But you know that all technologies pass through the hype cycle !
Should n’t we compare notes on latest developments in labs and Board rooms and talk about an plausible roadmap that has commercialization within 2 - 10 years for first wave of products ?!
Bloom is testing an actual product !

Durability : Fuel cells do not have to last 30 years .
Stacks can be broken down , replaced , et al .
And the cost is per unit , not per power plant .
So we do n’t need a product that lasts forever !

Mass manufacturing :

Certainly a barrier , but not a show - stopper .

Certainly a barrier , but not a show - stopper .
Competition : ‘ It will be GE , not Bloom Energy ! ’ — Great !
That is not a criticism .
I expect incumbents will play !
If Siemens , GE , Dow , DuPont , JC , Emerson ( et al ) get into the game , great news !
: ‘ It will be GE , not Bloom Energy ! ’ — Great !
That is not a criticism .

Cost – Bloom ’s CEO stated $ 3,000 price point – a fine place to start , but really , we need $ 300 ! 😉
But it seems clear that low cost alternatives to precious metals are becoming commercially viable .

Note :
I have followed Bloom Energy since it was formerly Ion America many years ago .
And I have been an evangelist for the disruptive market potential for fuel cells applied to portable and distributed power generation .
And to all the doubters of fuel cells or hydrogen I have responses to the dated and misguided criticisms related to storage , production , energy loss , et al .
Happy to answer questions in Comments section .

Shanta Karki was barely 13 when she volunteered to be a child soldier for the People ’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) , the Maoists ’ military wing in Nepal , in 2003 .
She was one of around 3,000 soldiers who were disqualified from the PLA for being an underage combatant when the Maoists signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2006 , ending a decade - long conflict .
Now 20 , Shanta was part of the first batch of former child soldiers to be released from Maoist army cantonments in January 2010 .
Returning home for the first time since joining the PLA , she will participate in government and
UN rehabilitation programmes ( see earlier report ) , but told IRIN she was unsure of her prospects :
“ After seven years of my life with the PLA , I feel very bad for being expelled like this .
I have been deprived of helping to liberate my people from this ongoing repression .
“ I do n’t know whether my family or village will accept me or not .
I have yet to find that out .
“ I joined the war when I was still in school .
I witnessed a lot of repression of the poor [ and ] this provoked me to do something when I was still a young girl .
I have been to the battlefield with a gun .
I will continue my life with the Maoists until we have total liberation .
“ I ’m not keen on rehabilitation .
I do n’t need rehabilitation .
I ’m already standing on my own two feet .
The UN rehabilitation package is not going to make things better for me .
They want to train us to weave baskets and make candles .
They want to sponsor my schooling , but I am already educated .
“ I do n’t want to spend my life making baskets .
My ambitions are in politics and in the security sector .
After fighting for my people , how can I just weave baskets now ? ”
“ The government should do more to help in the welfare and future of soldiers like us by nationalizing the Nepal Army , and integrating Maoist soldiers into the establishment .
They say we ’re not qualified , since we work with a Maoist ideology .
“ I will continue working as [ a ] political cadre for my party . "

Since Palestinians in Gaza buried their loved ones — more than 1,400 persons , almost 400 of them children — there has been little healing and virtually no reconstruction .
According to international aid agencies , only 41 trucks of building supplies have been allowed into Gaza during the year .
Promises of billions made at a donors ’ conference in Egypt last March attended by luminaries of the so - called “ international community ” and the Middle East peace process industry are unfulfilled , and the Israeli siege , supported by the US , the European Union , Arab states , and tacitly by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) in Ramallah , continues .
Amid the endless , horrifying statistics a few stand out : of Gaza ’s 640 schools , 18 were completely destroyed and 280 damaged in Israeli attacks .
Two - hundred - and - fifty students and 15 teachers were killed .
Of 122 health facilities assessed by the World Health Organization , 48 percent were damaged or destroyed .
Ninety percent of households in Gaza still experience power cuts for four to eight hours per day due to Israeli attacks on the power grid and degradation caused by the blockade .
Forty - six percent of Gaza ’s once productive agricultural land is out of use due to Israeli damage to farms and Israeli - declared free fire zones .
Gaza ’s exports of more than 130,000 tons per year of tomatoes , flowers , strawberries and other fruit have fallen to zero .
That “ much of Gaza still lies in ruins , ” a coalition of international aid agencies stated recently , “ is not an accident ; it is a matter of policy . ”
This policy has been clear all along and it has nothing to do with Israeli “ security . ”
From 19 June 2008 , to 4 November 2008 , calm prevailed between Israel and Gaza , as Hamas adhered strictly — as even Israel has acknowledged — to a negotiated ceasefire .
That ceasefire collapsed when Israel launched a surprise attack on Gaza killing six persons , after which Hamas and other resistance factions retaliated .
Even so , Palestinian factions were still willing to renew the ceasefire , but it was Israel that refused , choosing instead to launch a premeditated , systematic attack on the foundations of civilized life in the Gaza Strip .
Operation Cast Lead , as Israel dubbed it , was an attempt to destroy once and for all Palestinian resistance in general , and Hamas in particular , which had won the 2006 election and survived the blockade and numerous US - sponsored attempts to undermine and overthrow it in cooperation with US - backed Palestinian militias .
Like the murderous sanctions on Iraq throughout the 1990s , the blockade of Gaza was calculated to deprive civilians of basic necessities , rights and dignity in the hope that their suffering might force their leadership to surrender or collapse .
In many respects things may seem more dire than a year ago .
Barack Obama , the US president , whom many hoped would change the vicious anti-Palestinian policies of his predecessor , George W. Bush , has instead entrenched them as even the pretense of a serious peace effort has vanished .
According to media reports , the US Army Corps of Engineers is assisting Egypt in building an underground wall on its border with Gaza to block the tunnels which act as a lifeline for the besieged territory ( resources and efforts that ought to go into rebuilding still hurricane - devastated New Orleans ) , and American weapons continue to flow to West Bank militias engaged in a US - and Israeli - sponsored civil war against Hamas and anyone else who might resist Israeli occupation and colonization .
These facts are inescapable and bleak .
However , to focus on them alone would be to miss a much more dynamic situation that suggests Israel ’s power and impunity are not as invulnerable as they appear from this snapshot .
A year after Israel ’s attack and after more than two - and - a - half years of blockade , the Palestinian people in Gaza have not surrendered .
Instead they have offered the world lessons in steadfastness and dignity , even at an appalling , unimaginable cost .
It is true that the European Union leaders who came to occupied Jerusalem last January to publicly embrace Ehud Olmert , the then Israeli prime minister — while white phosphorus seared the flesh of Gazan children and bodies lay under the rubble — still cower before their respective Israel lobbies , as do American and Canadian politicians .
But the shift in public opinion is palpable as Israel ’s own actions transform it into a pariah whose driving forces are not the liberal democratic values with which it claims to identify , but ultra-nationalism , racism , religious fanaticism , settler - colonialism and a Jewish supremacist order maintained by frequent massacres .
The universalist cause of justice and liberation for Palestinians is gaining adherents and momentum especially among the young .
I witnessed it , for example , among Malaysian students I met at a Palestine solidarity conference held by the Union of NGOs of The Islamic World in Istanbul last May , and again in November as hundreds of student organizers from across the US and Canada converged to plan their participation in the global Palestinian - led campaign of boycott , divestment and sanctions modeled on the successful struggle against South African apartheid in the 1980s .
This week , thousands of people from dozens of countries are attempting to reach Gaza to break the siege and march alongside Palestinians who have been organizing inside the territory .
Each of the individuals traveling with the Gaza Freedom March , Viva Palestina , or other delegations represents perhaps hundreds of others who could not make the journey in person , and who are marking the event with demonstrations and commemorations , visits to their elected officials and media campaigns .
Against this flowering of activism , Zionism is struggling to rejuvenate its dwindling base of support .
Multi-million dollar programs aimed at recruiting and Zionizing young American Jews are struggling to compete against organizations like the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network , which run not on money but principled commitment to human equality .
Increasingly , we see that Israel ’s hasbara ( propaganda ) efforts have no positive message , offer no plausible case for maintaining a status quo of unspeakable repression and violence , and rely instead on racist demonization and dehumanization of Arabs and Muslims to justify Israel ’s actions and even its very existence .
Faced with growing global recognition and support for the courageous nonviolent struggle against continued land theft in the West Bank , Israel is escalating its violence and kidnapping of leaders of the movement in Bilin and other villages ( Mohammad Othman , Jamal Juma ’ and Abdallah Abu Rahmeh are among the leaders of this movement recently arrested ) .
In acting this way , Israel increasingly resembles a bankrupt failed state , not a regime confident about its legitimacy and longevity .
And despite the failed peace process industry ’s efforts to ridicule , suppress and marginalize it , there is a growing debate among Palestinians and even among Israelis about a shared future in Palestine / Israel based on equality and decolonization , rather than ethno-national segregation and forced repartition .
Last , but certainly not least , in the shadow of the Goldstone report , Israeli leaders travel around the world fearing arrest for their crimes .
For now , they can rely on the impunity that high - level international complicity and their inertial power and influence still afford them .
But the question for the real international community — made up of people and movements — is whether we want to continue to see the still very incomplete system of international law and justice painstakingly built since the horrors of the Second World War and the Nazi holocaust dismantled and corrupted all for the sake of one rogue state .
What we have done in solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza and the rest of Palestine is not yet enough .
But our movement is growing , it can not be stopped , and we will reach our destination .
Ali Abunimah is co-founder of The Electronic Intifada and author of One Country : A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli - Palestinian Impasse .
He will be among more than 1,300 persons from 42 countries traveling to Gaza with the Gaza Freedom March this week .

The Renault Formula 1 team launched its 2010 car at the Valencia circuit on Sunday afternoon and confirmed Vitaly Petrov as its second driver .
The new R30 was unveiled by Russian Petrov and team - mate Robert Kubica , who will form the all - new driver line - up of the French squad this year .
Twenty - five year - old Petrov , last year 's runner - up in the GP2 series , becomes the first Russian Formula 1 driver in the history of the sport .
Petrov will be partnering Pole Kubica at Renault , who is hoping to turn around its fortunes following a dismal 2009 season in which the team scored just 26 points on its way to eighth place in the championship .
" The start of a new Formula 1 season is always a time of great anticipation , " said new team boss Eric Boullier .
" For Renault , this is particularly true of the 2010 season as we begin a new era for the team .
" With a new structure in place , new drivers , and new colours , there is a lot to be excited about and a lot to look forward to in the year ahead .
" Setting objectives is never easy , but it 's clear that we have high ambitions for 2010 as we aim to take Renault back to the front of the grid .
However , this is not going to happen overnight and our ambition is to make this journey one step at a time .
" The R30 should be a competitive , strong and reliable car and we 've opted for an aggressive development strategy .
The factories in Enstone and Viry have been working flat - out during the long winter months to ensure that we begin the new season in the best shape possible .
These factories have been successful in the past and they have n't forgotten how to win in Formula 1 . "
The R30 was presented with Renault 's new colours - yellow and black - following the exit of ING as main sponsor in the middle of last season .
It also incorporates a similar shark fin engine cover , as those seen in the new McLaren and Sauber cars .
The new colour scheme resembles that used by Renault when it first entered Formula 1 back in 1978 .
when legal loopholes run wild …
Over the last 16 years , DSHEA has been a massive giveaway to alt med and snake oil peddlers , doing far more harm than good .
Imagine a law which allows anyone to sell you pretty much anything without having to follow any standards or testing the wares being sold for safety provided they wink and tell you that what you ’re buying is n’t intended to cure of diagnose any disease and that their claims have n’t been evaluated by anyone .
Then , say that you really should buy it to lose weight , feel better , boost your immune system or help you deal with an illness , ensuring that nowhere do they explicitly say the two words they ’re not allowed to mention in their product pitch .
Is it just me , or does that sounds like a loophole for people to sell whatever they want without consequences and any kind of oversight or regulation , hoping that no one gets hurt and sues them for selling something dangerous , at which point their questionable claims would be brought up in a court of law and taken apart by experts ?
Well as odd as it may seem , the U.S. has such a legal loophole .
It ’s called the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act , or DSHEA , and it basically places the burden of making sure that anything marked as a dietary supplement on the manufacturer rather than on the FDA , so all reports on product safety or efficacy depend solely on the sellers ’ good will or lawsuits by angry customers .
On top of that , the FDA ca n’t just yank products off the market .
It has to prove they ’re unsafe before that happens so if you ’re selling bottled water you claim is rich with miracle minerals and antioxidants that will help your customers live longer , you ’ll never be hauled to court or get your products pulled since your product is n’t actively harmful .
This is the same law which allows homeopaths to sell sugar pills sprinkled with water they say has magical properties , radiating special mystical energies best explained by rambling technobabble , or a horrendous mangling of physics .
Claiming that it ’s holistic medicine that treats the whole body , not just the disease ( whatever that means ) , lets them sell whatever they want and make tens of billions of dollars a year doing it .
And they ’re so good at hiding this lack of regulation in 3 point font of barely legible scrawl on their products , a third of the people buying them do n’t even know they ’re not FDA approved and are n’t required to be .
And that brings us to the Quack Miranda by which all those pitching “ natural cures and treatments ” abide .
You probably saw it more times than you can count on commercials for diet pills and vitamins flashing a standard template which we outlined with our introduction to the DSHEA .
So all those homeopaths and makers of odd , questionable supplements they claim are being suppressed by Big Pharma say that they ’re going to cure you in ways that the FDA would never allow because it would cost pharmaceutical companies money and yet , they also warn that the product you ’re taking is n’t actually intended to cure any disease .
So which one is it ?
Will the mysterious pill they want you to take cure you or do absolutely nothing ?
The general response of the quacks is to bombard you with testimonials , which is how pseudoscience and quackery generally spreads according to a scientific study on the subject .
But the fact remains , they just sold you something they say can cure some sort of malaise .
You know it .
They know it too .
And so they concoct elaborate conspiracy theories and rely on the good , old fashioned image of a rebel thumbing his nose at the stogy Establishment to convince you that their sly tactics are really for the best .
Hell , many of them have been chanting this so long , they ’ve bought their own argument hook , line and sinker .
Meanwhile , the FDA just looks the other way .
But here ’s the big problem .
There are thousands of outfits and pseudo - doctors making medical claims which are not subject to any clinical trial or any oversight whatsoever , relying on folksy testimonials and rambling on and on about the virtues of “ natural medicine ” and “ being open - minded . ”
Instead of freeing up the FDA to keep its eye on Big Pharma and its partners , DSHEA also unleashed a swarm of charlatans selling the modern day version of snake oil .
Obviously having the already overburdened , understaffed and under - budgeted FDA also spend time on evaluating millions of placebos is n’t a very good solution to the dilemma .
Trying to turn the agency ’s focus solely on quacks is also not realistic since Big Pharma are no angels and someone has to be there to make sure they do n’t cut corners to bring a product to market and catch their mistakes when they do .
But it seems that DSHEA is in dire need of modification which would ban any supplement maker from trying to make medical claims when selling their products unless they submit clinical studies showing their claims to be accurate .
Is it placing an expensive burden on the supplement makers ?
Yes .
But if they should never play with people ’s lives .
Instead of whining about Big Pharma ’s sins , they should thrive to be better than them .
People have been harmed and killed by quackery and we have a duty to stop those who profit from promising treatments and cures they have n’t bothered to back up with anything more than rants about the little guy vs. Big Pharma .
When you rake in more than $ 30 billion a year in revenues , you ’re not entitled to pretend you ’re a little group of healers who just want to make people feel better because that ’s lying , plain and simple .
You ’re an industry , same as those pharmaceutical giants you want to hold accountable for their mistakes .
All I ask is that you ’re willing to hold yourself to similar standards you want placed on the likes of Pfizer , Merck and GSK .
Or of course you could fight it tooth and nail , claiming a Big Pharma conspiracy to put you out of business while in reality , it ’s just a ploy used to inspire an outburst of alt med populist rage and freeing you from being held accountable for your actions …
On December 24 , the Senate passed a vote by a razor thin margin ( with not a vote to spare ) to raise the Federal debt ceiling from $ 12,104 billion to $ 12,394 billion .
The actual debt ceiling increase took effect on December 28 .
And as the chart below shows , the Treasury 's cash flow projections were spot on : 3 days later , and the debt subject to limit surged to $ 12,254 , a jump of over $ 200 billion in 2 days , and a whopping $ 150 billion over the old debt ceiling .
Three days is all the buffer the administration 's reckless spending spree has afforded this country to avoid bankruptcy .
Had one more Democratic vote dissented from the stopgap measure , the US would now be in technical default .
There is just $ 140 billion left before the revised debt ceiling is breached .
We hope for the country 's sake that Bill refunding in January is massive , because as we already pointed out , on January 7th we expect another ~ $ 130 of new Treasuries to be announced for auction by January 15th .
And then there are two more weeks in January ...
Which is why the Treasury better be using that TARP money to pay down all it can , because if the general population understands how close this nation was to the fiscal brink , many more answers may be demanded out of the ruling party as to how it could allow things to get so out of hand .

The oldest evidence of four - legged animals walking on land has been discovered in southeast Poland .
Rocks from a disused quarry record the " footprints " of unknown creatures that lived about 397 million years ago .
Scientists tell the journal Nature that the fossil trackways even retain the impressions left by the " toes " on the animals ' feet .
The team says the find means that land vertebrates appeared millions of years earlier than previously supposed .
" This place has yielded what I consider to be some of the most exciting fossils I 've ever encountered in my career as a palaeontologist , " said team member Per Ahlberg from Uppsala University , Sweden .
" [ They are ] fossil of footprints that give us the earliest record of how our very distant ancestors moved out of the water and moved on to the land and took their first steps . "
Numerous trackways have been identified in the Zachelmie Quarry in the Holy Cross Mountains .
They represent the movements of many animals as they scurried around what would have been a tropical muddy shoreline in the Middle Devonian Period of Earth history .
Slabs of carbonate rock are dappled with prints that range in size and detail .
Some indentations are obscured where successive animals have trampled over the same patch of ground ; but others retain exquisite features of the pads and digits that made them .
The animals were probably crocodile - like in appearance and lived an amphibian - like existence ( although those specific animal forms did not appear until many millions of years later ) .
The dimensions of the prints suggest some individuals were more than two metres long .
How one of the Devonian animals might have made the tracks
The Polish and Swedish scientific team analysed the trackway patterns to reconstruct how the ancient creatures would have moved their " hips " , " elbows " and " knees " .
This confirms that only true four - legged animals , or tetrapods , could have left the marks .
Theory holds that the first land creatures evolved from fish that had pairs of lobed fins .
The precise timing of this transition has been a dynamic field of study in recent years .
The assumption of palaeontologists had been that there was a swift but stepwise transition between water and land .
The discovery changes the story of the emergence of vertebrates on land Perhaps the most notable fossil in this story is an organism called Tikaalik roseae , an animal that had features intermediate between fish and tetrapods .
But Tiktaalik lived about 375 million years ago ; and although there are slightly older transition fossils , the Zachelmie Quarry tetrapods break the neat and simple timeline .
" The discovery of undoubted trackways from the earliest period of the Eifelian - that is 397 million years ago - pushes back the divergence between fishes and the four - legged vertebrates by about 18 million years , if not probably more , " commented Dr Philippe Janvier from the National Museum of Natural History , Paris , France .
" I suspect that now we can push the divergence back to the Emsian stage , maybe 400 million years ago .
That 's surprising , but this is what the fossil evidence tells us , " the independent researcher told BBC News .
Another key surprise from the research is the recognition that these tetrapods lived in a marine environment , perhaps a coral lagoon .
The favoured origin before now for the emergence of tetrapods had been marshy environments , such as deltas or lakes where freshwater dominated .
The team behind the latest research said the new explanation made sense because it would have allowed marine ancestors of tetrapods gradually to acquire terrestrial competence while accessing a new and essentially untouched resource of food washed up with the tides .
" In the intertidal setting , you 've got a smorgasbord laid out twice a day , " said Dr Ahlberg .
" Every time the tide goes out , it leaves behind this drift - line of dead and moribund animals .
All this was just left there for vertebrates - our ancestors - to emerge on to land and pick them off . "

A Korean sausage maker is experiencing a sales boom due to cold winter weather .
People are buying CJ Corporation 's snack sausages to use as styluses for their iPhones .
The sausage - fingers , which may or may not be called " Max Rods " , conduct electricity and let iPhone owners use their devices whilst keeping their gloves on .
According to the rather hard - to - interpret Korean news story , a cold winter has boosted sales by 40 % .
The photo , taken by Byron of the Bikehugger community , appears to show commuters stroking their meat across the capacitive screen while still encased in its plastic sheath – good news , as otherwise things might get a bit gross .
We wonder how long these sausages last .
We guess that if they are encased in their plastic sleeves , and used in the cold , they 'll probably be good until spring , whereupon they can be repurposed as a delicious snack .

DES MOINES  First - grader Matthias Beattie this week joined the hundreds of U.S. children suspended each year under post -Columbine " zero tolerance " policies when he took a shotgun shell to his school .
The difference is that Matthias is home - schooled .
The 6 - year - old Carlisle boy takes a class once a week through a Des Moines school district program that pairs public school teachers with home - schooled children .
The boy 's parents say his one - week suspension lacks common sense .
" Matthias is a little kid from the farm , and he did not have intent to do any harm , " his mother , Charlene Beattie , said .
School officials also never made clear that the policy applies to home - schooled children , she said .
Matthias is n't a public school student in the eyes of state law , and his class meets at a church .
But district officials say Matthias and other home - schooled students are bound by discipline policies .
" Even though you spend 95 % of your week home schooling , you are enrolled in the public schools , " Leslie Dahm , the district 's home - schooling coordinator , said in an e-mail to Matthias ' parents this week .
Dahm called live ammunition a " serious threat " for which the school district could be sued .
Leigh McGivern , a district spokeswoman , said Wednesday she was n't familiar with the incident .
But she said school policies are drawn up primarily to protect students .
" Whether it 's an empty shell or a loaded shell , it 's considered part of a weapon and unsafe , " McGivern said .
" We have students who do n't know the difference .
The policy is , let 's be unequivocal about it .
Do n't bring anything like that to school .
And that way they do n't have to use judgment as a child . "
Dan Beattie and his son found the shotgun shell as they cleared out a wall of their Carlisle farmhouse , which they are renovating .
Beattie , a church pastor , said he used the encounter to teach Matthias about guns and safety .
He then let Matthias add the shotgun shell to his collection of raccoon bones and other farm finds .
" He thought it was cool , " Dan Beattie said .
The Beatties said they did n't know the shotgun shell was in Matthias ' pants pocket when they dropped him off last week at his public school class .
" It was an oversight on my part , " Dan Beattie said .
The shell fell out of Matthias ' pocket as he jumped around in the gymnasium , his mother said .
Odds that a dropped shotgun shell would explode are " one in a million , " one weapons expert says .
John Underwood , an agent in the Des Moines office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , said the odds escalate when the shotgun shell primer detonates — usually from being slammed against an object .
" The danger is remote , but it 's there , " Underwood said .
Dahm 's e-mail shows school administrators considered more severe penalties before they settled on a one - week suspension for Matthias Beattie .
The punishment stemmed from the Beatties ' willingness to shoulder part of the blame , according to the e-mail .
Dahm acknowledged in the e-mail that student discipline policies are n't distributed to families regularly because of printing costs .
The e-mail said parents are expected to read the policy online .
Dahm could not be reached for comment for this article .
Charlene Beattie said the experience will be one of her son's biggest lessons .
" I told him , ' Sometimes there are rules that are made that we are not aware of , ' " she said .
" We still have to abide by them . "
The incident marks the second time in four months that the Des Moines district 's no-weapons policy has triggered controversy .
In October , Brody Middle School officials suspended a sixth - grader who took empty shotgun shells to school to show a teacher .
It also exemplifies a philosophical collision between home - school parents and public school policy .
" Most of us in the home - school community know how to talk about things like that , and we move on , " said Dan Beattie , Matthias ' father .
" The way our society has become , we 're so scared of everything that could possibly go wrong and so we have such blind allegiance to policy that we obliterate common sense , " he said .

Skype 's new strategy for 2010 : Your flat - screen TV in your living room can now be your phone .
Or , if your tastes run more toward " The Twilight Zone , " think of it as your TV watching you -- as you watch TV .
A Panasonic Viera HDTV with Skype capabilities ( click image to enlarge )
The makers of popular software that allows users to make free phone and video calls via the Internet announced new deals Tuesday with LG and Panasonic that put Skype inside new Web - connected versions of their HDTVs .
Starting sometime in mid-2010 , consumers who buy new Panasonic Viera TVs and LG sets with NetCast Access will be able to plug in special webcams ( sold separately ) and enjoy face - to - face conversations with family and friends .
Skype earned its reputation as a low - cost alternative to traditional phone calls via your PC , and that particular platform was n't ignored in Tuesday 's spate of announcements .
The company also said it is now supporting 720 p high - definition video calls over computers , and those attending this week 's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas will get a chance to check out new HD webcams from Skype partners faceVsion and In Store Solutions that do all the software encoding within the cameras .
However , it 's the move to expand Skype 's domain from the home office to the family room that signals an important new direction for the seven - year - old company .
Dialing Up Customer Demand
" We 're looking at how our customers are using Skype , and we 've been running a ton of studies about what they want , " Skype director of business development Manrique Brenes told TechNewsWorld .
" People want to have a better Skype experience and a more relaxed experience , and being able to go to their living rooms is a natural environment for it . "
Not that Skype is forgetting about the home - office users who make up a large portion of its customer base .
" This is a business play as well .
Most of our users use Skype for some kind of business engagement , and so this is also a natural evolution for them .
These new systems are good entry - level solutions that will make Skype even better , " Brenes said .
The new PC webcams start at US $ 120 ; no prices have been announced yet for the Skype - friendly HDTVs .
If they are anywhere near the consumer " sweet spot , " the company may see a boom in business , said Scott Steinberg , publisher and editor - in - chief of DigitalTrends.com .
" Anything that expands their market is of great benefit to them , " Steinberg told TechNewsWorld .
" We 've heard about mainstream video conferencing for years , and deals like this could finally bring this to fruition .
For grandparents hoping to see their grandchildren half a country away , or for folks in international time zones hoping to catch up with friends -- it 's amazing to think that this is what we now have in this day and age , that ( video conference ) is going to be more accessible . "
Reeducating the Tech - Shy Consumer ?
The webcams will be relatively easy to plug in to Skype - friendly TVs , Brenes said , and ease - of - use should n't be a problem .
Those wanting to take advantage of the new HD webcams for PCs will need processors that run at speeds of at least 1.8GHz to enjoy the 720 p video .
However , even with more help for tech - intimidated consumers , Steinberg said Skype will have to reintroduce its calling features to a potential new audience who may not know that Skype - to - Skype calls are free , and calls to non-Skype landlines and mobile phones can be much cheaper than traditional services .
" Unquestionably , consumers will have to be reeducated about the benefits and the ease of use , especially with the TV , " he said .
" The TVs should help break down barriers to entry .
People are fairly comfortable using their remotes .
This is the first time you are seeing this technology bridging this gap .
Within a matter of years , maybe three years , a lot more people could be using their living rooms as a video conferencing hub . "

One of the arguments we ’ve heard is that global warming has been impacting insurance premiums .
Perhaps it has .
Here is a short article I wrote for the IPA Review in 2008 .
In order to prepare the nation for the introduction of the ETS , the federal government has begun a large advertising campaign to argue that , without action , climate change will have a significant economic impact .
In particular one of their most widely distributed advertisements claims that ‘ scientists warn that climate change will cause more severe bushfires , storms , cyclones and floods .
This is already pushing up insurance premiums . ’
Both these statements may be true in isolation - some scientists are warning of such things , and some insurance premiums are going up - but the federal government invites us to believe that the first is causing the second .
This is , however , not the case .
The government ’s argument can be tested by looking at a more direct measure of damage from climate change - insurance losses .
In a paper published in the peer - reviewed journal Environmental Science & Policy , Ryan Crompton and John McAneney of Macquarie University have investigated the link between insurance losses and meteorological hazards .
Using data from the Insurance Council of Australia over 1967 - 2006 Crompton and McAneney adjusted the insurance losses to normalised 2006 dollars .
Doing so involves more than just accounting for inflation .
For example , as population and wealth increases the loss from a meteorological disaster increase .
Conversely , changes in building safety standards reduce losses from wind damage .
Crompton and McAneney have taken these sorts of factors into account to standardise insurance loss data , to ensure they are comparing like with like .
The results are quite startling .
Cyclone Tracy destroyed Darwin in 1974 with an insured loss of $ 200 million - in normalised 2006 dollars that would be equivalent to $ 3.56 billion .
It is quite rightly the single largest meteorological disaster in Australian history .
But before Crompton and McAneney normalised the data , the ICA data appears to indicate that the 1999 Sydney hailstorm was the largest disaster in Australian history with an insured loss of $ 1.7 billion , but $ 3.3 billion in normalised 2006 dollars .
Crompton and McAneney conclude ‘ there is no discernable evidence that human - induced climate change is significantly impacting insured losses ’ .
The observed increase in insurance losses is largely due to an increased number of more valuable buildings .
They have a more recent one page description of their work with updates to include Black Saturday .
Collectively all of these studies suggest societal conditions are driving the increasing trend in disaster losses and , at least to this point in time , there is no evidence to ascribe increasing disaster losses to ACC [ Anthropogenic Climate Change ] .
On the other hand , the success of improved building standards in reducing wind - induced losses from tropical cyclones is clear evidence that important gains can be made through disaster risk reduction .
Moreover , land planning policies in hazard prone parts of this country that ignore the risk are inconsistent with their public safety obligations .
It is in this context that a letter from the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in the United States is so interesting .
At the same time , proponents suggested that there was little room for doubt that “ global warming is occurring , ” as a 2008 Task Force white paper unequivocally declared .
The white paper disposed of the debate over the extent and consequences of anthropogenic global warming in a single sentence : “ [ The Task force ] believe [s ] that there is ample evidence in support of this assumption in a variety of other reports and studies , so we have decided not to focus on the scientific aspects of global warming . ”
That decision was certainly questionable in 2008 .
Today , it is untenable in our view .
The unauthorized release in November 2009 of thousands of e-mails containing correspondence among scientists affiliated with the University of East Anglia ’s Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) makes clear that insurers , regulators , and anyone else with a serious interest in climate change cannot afford the luxury of simply assuming that the “ reports and studies ” to which the Task Force white paper alludes present an accurate and unbiased picture of what is known about climate change .
The CRU e-mails show that a close - knit group of the world ’s most influential climate scientists actively colluded to subvert the peer - review process ( and thereby prevent the publication of research by scientists who disagreed with the group ’s conclusions about global warming ) ; manufactured pre-determined conclusions through the use of contrived analytic techniques ; and discussed destroying data to avoid government freedom - of - information requests .
Viewed collectively , the CRU e-mails reveal a scientific community in which a group of scientists promoting what has become , through their efforts , the dominant climate - change paradigm are at war with other scientists derisively labeled as “ skeptics , ” “ deniers , ” and “ contrarians . ”
The insularity and non-collegiality of these climate scientists had previously been noted in a 2006 report to Congress prepared by a committee of statisticians led by Dr. Eugene Wegman of George Mason University .
The Wegman Report examined the body of research behind the widely - publicized “ hockey stick ” graph , which purported to show a dramatic and unprecedented increase in average global temperature during the twentieth century .
After thoroughly discrediting the hockey stick graph , the report observed that “ authors in the area of paleoclimate studies are closely connected and thus ‘ independent studies ’ may not be as independent as they might appear on the surface . ”
The report further noted “ the isolation of the paleoclimate community , ” concluding that “ even though they rely heavily on statistical methods , they do not seem to be interacting with the statistical community . ”
When members of paleoclimate community were asked to explain and defend their work , “ the sharing of research materials , data and results was haphazardly and grudgingly done . ”
In short , because serious questions have been raised about the integrity of contemporary climate science , NAMIC believes it would be exceedingly risky for any insurance company to make important business decisions based on an uncritical acceptance of the dominant scientific paradigm on climate change .
Put differently , we believe there is considerable risk involved in an approach to assessing “ climate risk ” that assumes the validity of any particular theory or set of beliefs about anthropogenic global warming .
If insurance premiums have been rising due to risks of AGW I expect that they should start falling .
Indeed this is an oppourtunity for the ACCC to investigate whether or not any firms have made false claims to justify price increases .
( Please do n’t interpret this as approval of the ACCC as an organsation , nonetheless false advertising falls within their jurisdiction ) .

Death reopens debate over ' honour ' killings in Turkey , which account for half of all the country 's murders
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 24 February 2010
The article below reported the arrest of relatives on suspicion of killing a teenager for having friendships with boys .
More than 200 such killings take place each year , said the piece , " accounting for around half of all murders in Turkey " .
According to Eurostat , Turkey 's yearly murder rate averaged 6.1 per 100,000 population between 2005 and 2007 ( the ­latest figures ) , meaning that the 200 are actually set against an annual total of about 4,400 .
Turkish police have recovered the body of a 16 - year - old girl they say was buried alive by relatives in an " honour " killing carried out as punishment for talking to boys .
The girl , who has been identified only by the initials MM , was found in a sitting position with her hands tied , in a two - metre hole dug under a chicken pen outside her home in Kahta , in the south - eastern province of Adiyaman .
Police made the discovery in December after a tip - off from an informant , the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on its website .
The girl had previously been reported missing .
The informant told the police she had been killed following a family " council " meeting .
Her father and grandfather are said to have been arrested and held in custody pending trial .
It is unclear whether they have been charged .
The girl 's mother was arrested but was later released .
Media reports said the father had told relatives he was unhappy that his daughter – one of nine children – had male friends .
The grandfather is said to have beaten her for having relations with the opposite sex .
A postmortem examination revealed large amounts of soil in her lungs and stomach , indicating that she had been alive and conscious while being buried .
Her body showed no signs of bruising .
The discovery will reopen the emotive debate in Turkey about " honour " killings , which are particularly prevalent in the impoverished south - east .
Official figures have indicated that more than 200 such killings take place each year , accounting for around half of all murders in Turkey .
President Obama ’s campaign to overhaul the nation ’s healthcare system is officially on the back burner as Democrats turn to the task of stimulating job growth , but behind the scenes party leaders have nearly settled on a strategy to salvage the massive legislation .
They are meeting almost daily to plot legislative moves while gently persuading skittish rank - and - file lawmakers to back a sweeping bill .
This effort is deliberately being undertaken quietly as Democrats work to focus attention on more - popular initiatives to bring down unemployment , which the president said was a priority in his State of the Union address on Wednesday .
Many have concluded that the only hope for resuscitating the healthcare legislation is to push the issue off the front page and give lawmakers time to work out a new compromise and shift public perception of the bill .
“ A little bit of time and quiet could help , ” said Arkansas Sen .
Mark Pryor , a conservative Democrat who was among a group of centrist Democrats from the House and Senate who met last week to discuss a way forward on healthcare .
“ Human nature being what it is , it ’s always easier to be against something than to be for it .
And if you create any uncertainty with change , opponents can jump on that and just try to scare people .
. . .
That has been hard to overcome politically , ” Pryor said .
“ Maybe over time , people will have a chance to understand what is in the legislation . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - San Francisco ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) particularly want to give members time to recover from the shock of Republican Scott Brown ’s victory in the Massachusetts Senate race two weeks ago .
The election cost Democrats their filibuster - proof Senate majority .
But in the coming weeks , Pelosi and Reid hope to rally House Democrats behind the healthcare bill passed by the Senate while simultaneously trying persuade Senate Democrats to approve a series of changes to the legislation using budget procedures that bar filibusters .
At the same time , leading consumer groups , doctors and labor unions that have backed the healthcare legislative effort for more than a year are stepping up attempts to stiffen lawmakers ’ resolve .
Almost all of the proponents of a healthcare overhaul are desperate to avoid a repeat of the contentious public debate and deal - making that consumed Capitol Hill last year .
“ In a 24 - hour news cycle , with the Internet and bloggers and cable news , sometimes a lot more can be accomplished , especially with healthcare , when it happens behind closed doors , ” said Drew Altman , a healthcare policy expert who heads the nonprofit Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation .
Democrats , who would almost certainly get no Republican votes for their bill , still must overcome substantial obstacles .
Many rank - and - file Democrats remain rattled by Brown ’s winning campaign in Massachusetts , which in part targeted the healthcare bill in Washington .
Recent national polls indicate that fewer than 40 % of Americans like the healthcare legislation being pushed by Obama and his congressional allies .
Some Democrats would prefer to vote on a series of more limited bills targeting pieces of the healthcare system , an approach that House leaders are exploring .
A group of liberal House lawmakers are pushing for inclusion of a new government insurance plan , or public option , in the final bill .
Tensions also remain high between Democrats in the House and Senate .
Many
House lawmakers blame the Senate bill for fueling public opposition with provisions such as a new tax on high - end “ Cadillac ” health plans and special aid for Nebraska that was added at the 11th hour to satisfy the state ’s Democratic senator .
At a closed - door caucus meeting last week , Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) won applause from his colleagues when he told a story about being confronted recently by an angry voter in his district who said he did n’t want his health benefits taxed to pay off Nebraska .
Democrats hope to use a process known as budget reconciliation , which allows budget - related legislation to be passed with a simple majority in the Senate rather than the 60 - vote majority that has become necessary given the threat of Republican filibuster .
But many House Democrats do not want to vote on the Senate bill until the Senate passes the fixes they want .
And it is unclear whether the Senate could approve a package of changes to its bill before the House approves the underlying legislation , according to senior Democratic aides .
Democratic leaders hope to agree on a procedural path forward by the end of this week .
Despite the hurdles , there is a growing consensus that a modified Senate bill may offer the best hope for enacting a healthcare overhaul .
“ The more they think about it , the more they can appreciate that it may be a viable . . . vehicle for getting healthcare reform done , ” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly ( D - Va. ) , president of the Democratic freshman class in the House .
Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , who chairs the Senate health committee , noted that even before the Massachusetts election , senior Democrats had substantially agreed on a series of compromises that addressed differences between the House and Senate healthcare bills .
These included scaling back the Cadillac tax , boosting aid to help low - and moderate - income Americans buy insurance , closing the “ doughnut hole ” in the Medicare prescription drug plan , and giving all states the assistance that Nebraska secured to expand Medicaid .

So , I made these ....
Hands down , AWESOMENESS !!
These were inhaled and the only thing on the side you might need is milk .
I used a thicker cut apple wood smoked bacon cut into about a half an inch wide .
There were about 5 - 6 pieces of bacon used , and they were cooked low and slow , to a light crispness .
For the next batch we were thinking of using a smaller cubed piece of bacon , that has a more smokey taste , smokier than the apple wood surprisingly .
Other thoughts we had were to go ahead and cut up crispier smaller pieces and add them in the last few minutes of cooking to the cheesecake top .
We were thinking that the flavor of the bacon wo n't overwhelm the cheesecaky - ness of the whole situation .
Please make and consume them immediately !!
This was easy to make and only get better and better and better and better ............
In Washington , " cybersecurity " is a term that ’s come to have a thousand meanings , and none at all .
Any crime , prank , intelligence operation , or foreign - government attack involving a computer has become a " cyber threat . "
But at the Pentagon , they are n’t worried about some kid painting a Hitler moustache on Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ online portrait .
They ’re not even that concerned about a full - scale attack on the military ’s networks – even though the modern American way of war depends so heavily on the free flow of data .
In the military , there ’s now broad agreement that one cyber threat trumps all others : electronic espionage , the infiltration ( and possible corruption ) of Defense Department networks .
Well - placed spy software not only opens a window for an adversary to look into American military operations .
That window can also be used to extract information — everything from drone video feeds to ammunition requests to intelligence reports .
Such an opening also gives that enemy a chance to introduce his own false data , turning American command - and - control systems against themselves .
How does a soldier trust an order , if he does n’t know who else is listening – or who gave the order in the first place ?
" For a sophisticated adversary , it ’s to his advantage to keep your network up and running .
He can learn what you know .
He can cause confusion , delay your response times – and shape your actions , " says one Defense Department cyber official .
My report for the Progressive Policy Institute has more .
A few months back , the Institute 's Jim Arkedis and Will Marshall asked me to put together some thoughts on military cybersecurity .
I do n't consider myself much of a policy guy .
But I have hung around enough folks at the Defense Department working on the issue that I figured I 'd share what I 've found – even if that risked putting me on Nathan 's dreaded list of " reporters who heart think tanks . "
Read whole paper here .
And let me know what you think .

( Newser ) – Republicans have been crowing that Scott Brown should be seated right away , just like Ted Kennedy was back in 1962 , but there are some big differences between then and now .
Senators are not supposed to be sworn in until they ’re officially certified , TalkingPoints Memo explains .
The Senate waived that rule for Ted for two reasons : first , he ’d won by a landslide , and second , the Senate was n’t in session , so it made little difference .
This time around , of course , the Senate is in session , and since rules can only be waived by unanimous consent , that ’s unlikely to happen again .
Democrats also have more recent precedent on their side : Al Franken and Roland Burris both faced certification issues .
Massachusetts law also allowed for swifter certification in 1962 ; these days , all absentee and military ballots have to be counted first .

n my never - ending search for interesting new ideas in the IT world , every now and then I come across something truly innovative and brilliant .
Such was the case when I first stumbled upon the initial announcement of Project Lombok .
In the two months since then , Project Lombok has become an indispensable part of my Java tool chain and I can't imagine coding without it .
What Is Project Lombok ?
Project Lombok is really two things : a compile - time code generator and a development - time code generator .
It 's the latter that makes it so brilliant .
Basically , Lombok integrates directly into the Eclipse compilation cycle ( by manipulating the abstract syntax tree of your code as you type ) and generates code immediately based on annotations .
The generated code is visible to all other classes instantly .
What type of code can Lombok generate from annotations ?
Most importantly , it generates the basic boilerplate stuff that makes Java classes look so verbose , namely :
getters and setters for fields
toString ( ) representation of your POJOs
representation of your POJOs hashCode ( ) and equals ( )
At the same time , Lombok provides automatic resource management .
For example , it always closes your streams safely , without the need for try / catch / finally statements .
Figure 1 . The Lombok Installation Wizard : Upon running the lombok .
jar file , a simple wizard will pop up .
Lombok Installation and Maven Support
Lombok is provided as an executable JAR file ( lombok . jar ) , and the development - time support currently works only in Eclipse .
Upon running the JAR file , a simple wizard will pop up and ask you to specify where your Eclipse executable is located ( see Figure 1 ) .
Just point to your Eclipse executable and press " Install / Update . "
You will need to do this for every new version of Lombok .
To include Maven support , just add the Project Lombok repository and dependencies to your pom.xml , as per the instructions on the project web site .
After that , Lombok will work with Maven 's compilation lifecycle out of the box .
Ever wonder which places receive the highest amount of rainfall in the world ?
Not surprisingly , most are located in the tropics and subject to monsoons .
Based on the information compiled from Wikipedia the top three places that receive the most amount of rainfall in the world are the following ( ranked from low to high ) :
3. Mount Waiʻaleʻale
Meaning “ Overflowing Water ” in Hawaiian , the summit of Mount Waiʻaleʻale has an elevation of 5148 feet , which is the second highest point in the Kaua ’i islands of Hawaii .
Average rainfall has been recorded at about 426 inches since the year 1912 with a record 683 inches in 1982 .
According to Wikipedia , several factors give Waiʻaleʻale more potential to create precipitation than the rest of the surrounding area :
Its northern position relative to the main Hawaiian Islands provides more exposure to frontal systems that bring rain during the winter .
It has a relatively round and regular conical shape , exposing all sides of its peak to winds and the moisture that they carry .
Its peak lies just below the so - called trade wind inversion layer of 6,000 feet , above which trade - wind - produced clouds cannot rise .
And most importantly , the steep cliffs cause the moisture - laden air to rise rapidly .
2. Cherrapunji , India
Located in the northeast state of Meghalaya , Cherrapunji , averages 450 inches of rainfall annually .
It has an average elevation of 4,869 ft and sits on a plateau in the southern part of the Khasi Hills , facing the plains of Bangladesh .
The highest rainfall recorded in Cherrapunji was in the year 1861 with a world record that still stands today at 1042 inches .
1. Mawsynram , India
Also located in the Indian state of Meghalaya , Mawsynram is about 16 km west of Cherrapunji .
The village has recorded an average rainfall of 468 inches taken over a period of 38 years by the Public Works Department and is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the wettest place on Earth .
Three reasons are cited for the high amount of rainfall at Mawsynram according to Wikipedia :
The warm moist winds of the northward - moving air from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon converge into the narrower zone over the Khasi Hills , thus concentrating their moisture .
The alignment of the Khasi Hills ( east to west ) places them directly in the path of the airflow from the Bay of Bengal , producing a significant uplift .
Finally , uplift over the Khasi Hills is virtually continuous in the monsoon period because the lifted air is constantly being pulled up by vigorous winds in the upper atmosphere , hence the rainfall is more or less continuous .
One more place with a lot rainfall which deserves an honorable mention is Tutunendo in Chocó , Colombia .
The rainfall here averages to 11,394 mm in a year which is approximately 448 inches .
The highest rainfall recorded in this town is 26,303 mm ( 1,035.6 inches ) in the year 1974 .

Brown has put his great clunking feet in it again .
If reports on BBC - TV are to be believed , Brown 's new National Council on Democratic Renewal - a body that may very well meet mostly in private - is to propose that the UK adopt the alternative vote ( AV ) for elections to Parliament .
There is apparently to be a referendum .
Quite what Brown and his wretched party - I am a former member - hope to achieve is beyond me .
There is a very strong group in the party - Mandelson , Hain , Martin Linton , etc , etc - who have long argued the dubious case for AV since they think it is the " electoral reform " option that will best preserve their place in national politics ; and since it will block the move towards proportional representation that will alone free Parliament from bondage to the executive .
So there is a simple self - serving motive at work .
But this is such a stupid gesture that I suspect that they would be happy to put the proposition to a referendum and lose , having falsely demonstrated their commitment to democratic renewal .
So why is this so outlandish ?
First , because AV is even more disproportionate than first - past - the - post ( FPTP ) .
In 1997 , we at Democratic Audit - Patrick Dunleavy , Helen Margetts and me - carried out an expert simulation of the actual general election result that year and calculated that AV would have produced a more disproportionate outcome than FPTP - the deviation from proportionality was 23.5 per cent under AV , 21 per cent under FPTP .
Labour 's bloated seat count would have risen to 436 seats .
The Lib Dems would also have benefited disproportionately .
Okay , you may say , this was just a calculation .
Well it was impeccably done in the first place .
But the actual experience of AV voting for the House of Representatives in Australia has demonstrated time and time again that it produces disproportional results .
( In Australia , the deviation is to some degree mitigated by STV elections to the upper house .
For more detail , see Democratic Audit 's report )
Second , Blair commissioned a report from Lord Jenkins that recommended a combination of AV with a limited numbers of top - up seats , known as AV Plus that would have made it more proportional .
Reformers have recently been combining around this option as a compromise .
Brown , Mandelson and co have rejected this course .
Third , the public deserve a wider and more deliberative choice than this cynical gesture offers .
New Zealand had two referendums around an expert appraisal of all the alternatives , which gave people time to decide in principle to consider change , and then offered them an informed choice between FPTP and a proportional system .
( Again , for more detail , see the Democratic Audit 's report )
Fourth , the whole proposal smacks of the old discredited politics that disgusts the public .
The New Zealand appraisal was carried out by an appointed commission .
Here a citizens assembly could do it .
Fifth , it is bad politics .
It looks like the desperate self - serving gamble that it is .
It gives the Conservatives , who are very anxious about demands for electoral reform , a sitting duck to shoot dead .
They have already taken the predictable line - Brown is scared that he will lose under the current system .
Amazingly , a Lib Dem MP floundered on BBC News , failing to state that AV is more disproportional than FPTP , even when prompted several times to do so by the interviewer .
It is not often that I shout at the telly .
But I did out so of sheer frustration .
Surely the Lib Dems could have found someone who could make the case for real reform robustly - it is after all the key Lib Dem issue - rather than this vapid ignoramus ?
There are other reports - one that Brown may go for an elected second chamber .
Go for it , but with a more sensitive form of PR than the rigid system used for the Euro elections !

The New York Times has recently reported that the number of obese people in the United States seems to have reached a plateau .
A real peaking of a tendency that has been going on for decades and that has made the US the " obese nation " in the world . " " , we could say .
Peaking of anything is always interesting for " peakers " , people who study peak oil and the peaking of natural resources .
So , is peak fat something that we can interpret as part of a general peaking phenomenon ?
In some ways , yes .
The interpretation given in the article is that peak fat is the result of some kind of physical limit : people can't just get fatter than they are already .
It may be , but it is also true that we are not speaking of people getting fatter , but of the fraction of people who reaches values of the " body mass index " ( BMI ) that define obesity .
So , if about 35 % of adult males in the US are defined today as obese , there is no obvious physical limit that would prevent this number from going higher .
Why not 50 % ?
Or 75 % ?
What is the limit of obesity ?
It depends on what causes it .
Obesity is sometimes taken as an indication of national wealth .
The United States , it is said , is a rich country and there are so many obese Americans because they can afford to eat what they want .
That is not the case ; actually it is the opposite .
In the United States , people get fat because they cannot afford to eat what they want .
There have been several studies ( see , e.g. , this link ) showing that poor people tend to optimize their diet in terms of the ratio of calories to dollars .
In other words , they try to buy the cheapest food that can provide them with the same number of calories .
Unfortunately , it turns out that this cheap food is what we call " junk food " ; food rich in saturated fats and sugar .
This is the kind of food that makes you obese .
Healthy food is expensive in terms of calories per dollar and the poor cannot afford it .
Surely , there are also cultural factors that lead Americans to eat junk food .
But economic factors must play a major role .
So , I can propose an explanation for the peaking of the growth of obesity .
It may be that poor people in the USA are becoming so poor that they can't afford any more even a diet of junk food .
They must cut on the overall food budget and that is surely a way of losing weight , although not a planned one .
Of course , this is just a hypothesis but , if it is true , then " peak fat " is indeed related to the economy and - indirectly - to crude oil .
The obesity epidemics started in the 1970s , when the US economy underwent what was termed " the great u-turn " by Bluestone and Harrison , who published a book with that title in 1982 .
The great u-turn led to an increase in the income inequality in the US , which is lasting to this day .
In other words , the poor started becoming poorer and their diet started to worsen .
The trend is continuing and , at this point , it may be that we have reached a turning point that makes even junk food unaffordable for the poor .
In general , these economic trends are due in large part to the diminishing availability of mineral resources - oil is just one of them .
So , peak fat may well be another effect of peak oil .
As Generose lay bleeding near her husband ’s corpse , the soldiers cut up the amputated leg , cooked the pieces on the kitchen fire , and ordered her children to eat their mother ’s flesh .
One son , a 12 - year - old , refused .
“ If you kill me , kill me , ” he told the soldiers , as his mother remembers it .
“ But I will not eat a part of my mother . ”

So they shot him dead .
The murder is one of Generose ’s last memories before she blacked out , waking up days later in the hospital where she had worked .
That ’s where Lisa enters the story .
After seeing the Oprah show on the Congo war , Lisa began to read more about it , learning that it is the most lethal conflict since World War II .
More than five million had already died as of the last peer - reviewed mortality estimate in 2007 .
Everybody told her that the atrocities continued because nobody cared .
Lisa , who is now 34 , was appalled and decided to show that she cared .
She asked friends to sponsor her for a solo 30 - mile fund - raising run for Congolese women .
That led her to establish Run for Congo Women , which has held fund - raising runs in 10 American states and three foreign countries .
The money goes to support sponsorships of Congolese women through a group called Women for Women International .

An Oxfam spokeswoman was quoted as saying : " I did n't know touching could cure gangrene " , while other people questioned how Travolta was able to gain landing permission while many other aid flights were turned away from the airport .
While covering the development of digital , high - definition television since its inception , I ’ve been approached by any number of startups that promised The Next Big Thing in displays : rear - projection sets that would cost a small fraction of current technology ; a technique to dramatically increase screen contrast and remove all reflective room light that was so promising it was financed by one of the biggest television manufacturers in the world ; SED technology demonstrated by Toshiba that put the picture quality of the best plasma TVs to shame .
In short , flat panel displays so enticing that makers of other technologies would immediately throw in the towel .
The latest promising new disruptive display technology comes from Prysm , a privately financed startup with offices in Silicon Valley , Massachusetts and India .
The 100 - employee firm has been working for five years on a system it calls LPD , or laser - powered phosphor display .
Like a CRT picture - tube TV , an image is created when phosphors on the screen are excited .
But rather than use electrons , LPD technology uses a laser to hit the screen .
Because it works like a CRT display , no backlight is used for illumination .
The result , company officials say , is the best of all worlds : large screens with great black levels , high definition 3 - D capable resolution , very low power consumption , wide 180 - degree viewing angle , completely recyclable components , no mercury used in production , and a long 65,000 - hour panel life , with no burn - in issues .
Could anything be better ?
Given that the company has received sufficient working capital to employ 100 people for the past five years , it ’s worth paying attention to their claims .
But as with any invention , there are negatives as well .
For starters , the display is relatively deep , about 5.5 inches .
While that would seem slim in any reasonable world , new TVs shown at last week ’s Consumer Electronics
Show were just a few millimeters in thickness .
In addition , the world ’s major television manufacturers have invested many tens of billions of dollars in LCD and plasma manufacturing facilities ; they ’re not about to throw their investment away and license a new technology .
While I have not yet had a chance to see the new display technology , according to someone who has , the quality does indeed live up to its promise .
“ The picture quality , vividness and power consumption are incredible , ” said Stephen Shea , a senior associate with Shen Milsom Wilke , an audio- visual consulting firm .
On the other hand , Mr. Shea did not see a large screen display , but rather 30 small 25 - inch units stacked on top of each other to form a 100 - inch unit .
In addition , the imagery , which he saw on Monday , had a slight bend in it , with some of the pixels not perfectly shaped .
Whether Prysm will be able to solve all its problems and create viable , cost - effective superior displays remains an unknown .
But Roger Hajjar , the company ’s chief technology officer , is confident they will .
“ The big guys are courting us .
Make no mistake about that . ”
My Santa sent me a copy of The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick .
Fucking awesome !
I am pumped to read this book .
Also included was a recipe for the Belgian food ' Smoutebollen ' - which , after some research , I found out translates to lardballs .
Yes , lardballs .
I am fairly certain that this is the only treat that is capable of rivaling the tastiness of bacon .
I can't wait to try it out .
The package was a bit beat up and worn , but the contents were not damaged .
Thanks , resurge !
Edit : I just noticed that my santa also included a link to a photo essay documenting the journey of the package from his table to the mailslot !
Pretty neat .
For those who do not drink , researchers have found that six essential oils - from thyme , clove , rose , eucalyptus , fennel and bergamot — can suppress the inflammatory COX - 2 enzyme , in a manner similar to resveratrol , the chemical linked with the health benefits of red wine .
They also identified that the chemical carvacrol was primarily responsible for this suppressive activity .
These findings , appearing in the January issue of Journal of Lipid Research , provide more understanding of the health benefits of many botanical oils and provide a new avenue for anti-inflammatory drugs .
Essential oils from plants have long been a component of home remedies , and even today are used for their aromatherapy , analgesic ( e.g. cough drops ) , or antibacterial properties .
Of course , the exact way they work is not completely understood .
However , Hiroyasu Inoue and colleagues in Japan believed that many essential oils might target COX - 2 much like compounds in wine and tea .
So , they screened a wide range of commercially available oils and identified six ( thyme , clove , rose , eucalyptus , fennel and bergamot ) that reduced COX - 2 expression in cells by at least 25 % .
Of these , thyme oil proved the most active , reducing COX - 2 levels by almost 75 % .
When Inoue and colleagues analyzed thyme oil , they found that the major component - carvacrol - was the primary active agent ; in fact when they use pure carvacrol extracts in their tests COX - 2 levels decreased by over 80 % .

New water samples reveal that Asian carp DNA has been found in Lake Michigan near the city of Chicago , the first indication that the giant leaping fish , which can upend entire ecosystems , has made it up the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and into the world 's largest freshwater system .
The Journal Sentinel learned of the apparent breach just minutes before the U.S. Supreme Court announced it had declined a request from a coalition of Great Lakes states to force the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to slam shut two lakeside navigation locks in a drastic attempt to protect the Great Lakes and their $ 7 billion annual fishery .
Biologists fighting to halt the invasion are not conceding defeat ; they say there is still no indication the lake is home to a breeding population of silver or bighead carp .
In fact , biologists have yet to land a single fish above an electric fish barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , about 20 miles downstream from Lake Michigan .
But the news was another distressing development in what conservationists and politicians alike have characterized as a slow - motion ecological disaster decades in the making .
The water samples , taken Dec. 8 , showed the presence of carp DNA in Calumet Harbor near the Chicago shoreline as well as in the Calumet River just above the O'Brien lock , one of the structures the State of Michigan last month asked the Supreme Court to order shuttered .
The hope was to buy some time in the fight to beat back the fish that have been migrating north from Arkansas since the 1970s .
The Army Corps said Tuesday it is scrambling to figure out how to best protect the lakes , but the locks were built for navigation , and that is how the Corps must prioritize management of them .
Asked if he had the authority to order the gates shut , Maj. General John Peabody replied : " The short answer is no . "
Peabody said he could recommend to the secretary of the U.S.
Army a change in the way the locks are operated , but before he makes any such decision he needs to assess the effectiveness of relying on the aged , leaky locks to halt or even slow the migration .
He also has to assess the impacts such a move could have on Chicago in terms of flooding and waterborne commerce .
Peabody figures it will be weeks before he knows enough to make a decision .
The State of Michigan was hoping the Supreme Court would make that decision for the Corps , but the court declined in a statement released Tuesday morning .
It did not offer a reason why .
The barge industry that uses the locks to move millions of tons of cargo annually was relieved by the news .
" We are gratified that the U.S. Supreme Court has taken action to prevent disastrous consequences to Midwest consumers and to the hardworking Americans employed in the towing industry and in all the industries and companies that rely on the essential commodities shipped by barge , " said Thomas Allegretti , president of the American Waterways Operators .
The Supreme Court , however , did not rule on a separate request from the State of Michigan to reopen an ongoing case over the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , which provides an artificial link between the Mississippi River basin and Lake Michigan .
" They just denied the motion for preliminary injunction to shut the locks , they 're completely silent on the petition to reopen the case , " said Noah Hall , a Wayne State University law professor who has followed the case closely .
In that portion of the case , the State of Michigan , backed by Wisconsin , New York , Ohio and Minnesota , is hoping the court will reopen a decades - old lawsuit over the operation of the Chicago canal .
Their goal is to force the Corps and Chicago to permanently re-engineer the canal system to once again separate Lake Michigan from the Mississippi .
The canal , which opened in 1900 , was built to flush Chicago sewage toward the Gulf of Mexico .
Briefs in the petition to reopen the case are due Feb. 19 .
Breach not a surprise
Peabody says it is " bothersome " that no actual fish have been found at a time he 's being pressured to dramatically change the way water flows through Chicago , but he is not discounting the tests ' validity .
" It 's not a dead - certain lock , but we 've got to take it seriously , " he said .
Others , however , believe the presence of DNA in lake waters is essentially as good as finding a fish .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , for example , dispatched a team to the laboratories at the University of Notre Dame where the DNA tests are being conducted , and concluded that the tests are a reliable means of detecting the presence of a fish .
The technology can sniff out even the tiniest trace of fish DNA , and scientists say it indicates a fish has been in the area within the past two days .
The material likely comes from a carp 's digestive tract , and while there are other possible explanations for the material to be found in a body of water - contaminated ballast discharges from a barge , for example - the scientists behind the technology say that is highly unlikely .
What the tests do not reveal , however , are how many fish may be in an area , or the size or age of the fish .
News of the apparent carp advance did not come as a surprise to Phil Moy , a University of Wisconsin Sea Grant biologist who has co-chaired the panel that helped the Army Corps construct a system of electric fish barriers on the canal .
" The fish have probably been up there around the locks for a year , " Moy said .
The reason :
He said the Army Corps turned off the power to the first - generation barrier system in October 2008 for about a week 's worth of maintenance , and he believes the fish likely slipped through at that time .
That first barrier was not built to operate at level strong enough to repel juvenile fish , which need a bigger jolt .
A second , stronger barrier was turned on in April , but it was not cranked up to a level strong enough to deter small fish until August because of the dangers it posed to barge operators and recreational boaters traveling the canal .
Biologists have said all is not lost if a small population of fish make it into Lake Michigan , because it can be very difficult for a breeding population to get established .
" If a few fish get into the Great Lakes , it 's not game over , " Duane Chapman , a U.S. Geological Survey researcher who has made a career out of studying the fish on the heavily infested Missouri River , said last month .
The fish can grow to 50 pounds and consume up to 20 % of their weight in plankton per day - food upon which every other species in a water system either directly or indirectly depends .
Chapman said they do indeed pose a dire threat to fishing and recreational boating on the world 's largest freshwater system .
But he said what matters now is how many get into the lake .
First , the invading fish have to find each other .
Then they have to find a place to spawn .
A handful of adult fish were found in Lake Erie several years ago , but because no juveniles were found biologists determined the lake is not home to a breeding population .
The worry now is what the carp could do to Lake Michigan 's $ 7 billion commercial and recreational fishery , as well as the recreational boating industry .
It is a worry that did not disappear with the Supreme Court ruling .
Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said Tuesday they are asking the Obama administration , which opposed Michigan 's request to shut the locks , to convene a summit between Great Lakes leaders and senior White House staff to address the threat .
North Korea fired artillery into the sea Wednesday near its disputed border with South Korea and South Korean forces fired back , Seoul officials said .
The North ’s artillery batteries on land fired into waters near the border shortly after 9:00 am ( 0000 GMT ) , a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff said .
“ Our military immediately fired back in response , ” a Seoul presidential official told AFP on condition of anonymity .

The incident came a day after the North declared a “ no sail zone ” around the tense border , which was the scene of deadly naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 .
Another clash in November left a North Korean patrol boat in flames .
The official said the North ’s artillery rounds landed north of the sea border , while Seoul ’s forces fired at the rounds while they were in the air .
No one was injured and no damage was caused .
The official refused to say what types of weapon were used or how many rounds were exchanged .
“ Our military fired at the shells in the air , ” he said .
“ Our field manual states that we are supposed to target any incoming flying objects . ”

Yonhap news agency said the North ’s shells landed near the South Korean - controlled island of Baengnyeong in the Yellow Sea .
‘ THEY ARE UNEMBARRASSED ’….
If you have some time this morning , I ’d recommend taking a few minutes to watch this fairly devastating segment from last night ’s Rachel Maddow ’s show .
It emphasizes a point that I ’ve been pushing quite a bit — as Republican lawmakers reject ideas they support , reason has lost all meaning , and the GOP ’s descent into madness is nearly complete .
The segment highlights the ways in which Republicans loved their idea for a deficit commission , until President Obama endorsed it at which point the GOP rejected their own proposal .
The same is true of cap - and - trade .
And PAYGO .
And the financial industry bailout .
And trying accused terrorists in U.S. courts .
The same Republicans who said the stimulus “ failed ” also say that the stimulus is absolutely fantastic — so long as the money is going to their state / district .
“ What Republicans are doing on policy is no longer interesting , ” Rachel explained .
“ It is so thoroughly , unrelentingly , consistently predictable , that anyone who thinks it ’s an open question as to what Republicans are going to do about the next legislation that ’s proposed just is not paying attention . ”
Rachel ended the segment explaining exactly why all of this matters : “ Republicans , right now , do not care about policy — by which I mean , they will not vote for things that even they admit are good policies .
On policy terms they have been caught bragging on the stimulus as good policy .
I have no doubt that some of them think that health reform is good policy .
We know they think that things like a deficit commission or cap - and - trade or PAYGO are good policy , because they ’re on the record supporting them .
“ But they ’re not going to vote for them because … screw Policy .
Screw what even they believe is good for the country .
Screw what even they believe is good for their own districts .
They are not voting ‘ yes , ’ for even things they agree with .
For anything substantive .
They are not going to vote ‘ yes ’ for anything substantive that this president supports .
It ’s not going to happen .
“ You ’re not going to earn Republican votes for a second stimulus , for example , by pointing out that it ’s good policy that creates jobs .
We know they already know that .
They concede that in their home districts .
And they ’re still not voting for it .
“ And they are unembarrassed about this fact .
They are not embarrassed .
Charging them with hypocrisy , appealing to their better , more practical , more ‘ what ’s best for the country ’ patriotic angels is like trying to teach your dog to drive .
It wastes a lot of time , it wo n’t work , and ultimately the dog comes out of the exercise less embarrassed for failing then you do for trying . ”
LOS ANGELES -- Tomas Holmstrom has worked on tipping pucks in front of the net for more than a dozen years after practice .
That is why he arguably is the best in the business .
As luck would have it during this amazing , injury - plagued season for the Detroit Red Wings , Holmstrom finally took a shot in the wrong spot after Wednesday 's workout at Honda Center in Anaheim .
Now , the offensively challenged Red Wings will be without their leading goal scorer for three to four weeks after Holmstrom sustained a non-displaced fracture in his foot .
It is a tough blow to a team that bolstered its top two lines and its struggling power play with the return of forwards Henrik Zetterberg and Dan Cleary , each out with a separated shoulder , Thursday night against the Los Angeles Kings .
" We were excited to get Cleary and Z back ; now , it 's two in and one out , '' Red Wings general manager Ken Holland said .
" The hard part is it happened after practice .
" It 's a fluke injury .
He was working on his hand - eye coordination , changing direction of shots .
Every day for 10 to 12 years he 's done that . ''
The club sent Holmstrom home Thursday morning .
He will be evaluated further Friday .
“ What are you going to do ? " Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
“ You ’re allowed to feel sorry for yourself for a second .
I actually called my wife , she told me to suck it up .
It does n’t matter what their names are .
We just got to find a way to keep grinding out some wins . ’’
Holmstrom , bouncing back from an injury - plagued 2008 - 09 season and poor playoff performance , leads the team with 15 goals , including seven on power plays .
His play earned him a spot on the Swedish Olympic team .
He likely will return in time for the Olympics .
While Zetterberg and Cleary will boost a power play that had converted only 2 - of - 41 opportunities in the past 12 games , it will hurt not having Holmstrom 's net - front presence on the top power - play unit .
Either Todd Bertuzzi or Cleary will fill that role .
“ Tough break for Homer , ’’ defenseman Brad Stuart said .
“ I feel bad for him , but we should be used to it by now .
We ’ve gone through it a few times . ’’
Holmstrom was one of only four Red Wings who had played in all 42 games , along with Nicklas Lidstrom , Brad Stuart and Bertuzzi .
" Obviously , injuries are part of the sport , '' Holland said .
" We 're getting two important players back .
We got to find a way to win games .
You think you 're gaining ground and you look at the standings and you 're losing ground . ''
The Red Wings have four other players out with injuries .
Defenseman Jonathan Ericsson ( bone bruise in knee Dec. 14 ) has practiced but wo n't return until next week at the earliest .
Defenseman Niklas Kronwall ( sprained MCL on Nov. 21 ) is not skating and is at least a couple weeks from returning .
Right wing Jason Williams ( fractured fibula Nov. 7 ) is skating lightly on his own , so he , too , is at least a couple weeks from returning .
Forward Johan Franzen ( torn ACL on Oct. 8 ) is practicing with the team but will not be back until right before or after the Olympic break ( Feb. 15 - 28 ) .
Notable , quotable
Detroit goaltender Jimmy Howard sported an ice pack on his left forearm following
The Red Wings have defeated the Kings six consecutive times and are 20 - 2 - 0 in their past 22 games against them , 10 - 1 in their past 11 at the Staples Center .
Babcock said the line of Darren Helm , Kris Draper and Patrick Eaves was “ outstanding . ’’
He also liked how Justin Abdelkader and Derek Meech played .
“ I thought Abby was outstanding ; Abby and Meech played maybe one of their best games , ’’ Babcock said .
“ Those kids are getting better . ’’
After threatening to end its adoption and homeless services programs in Washington D.C. if the City Council approved gay marriage there , the Catholic Church ’s charities unit is indeed dismantling its foster care program — even after the Church said it would back off its own promise to do so .
Claiming it cannot operate its 80 - year - old foster - care program if the city somehow “ forces ” the Church to officiate gay unions and recognize same - sex partners of employees , the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington is getting out of the foster care business before the M - word comes to the nation ’s capital .
The church ’s Catholic Charities unit , which receives $ 20 million annually from the city ( read : taxpayers ) , on Feb. 1 transferred its 43 children , 35 families and seven staff members to the National Center for Children and Families , another foster care provider , reports the Washington Post .
“ Now we ’re in a position where we need to scrutinize everything , ” says Catholic Charities chief Edward Orzechowski .
“ From our point of view , it ’s important that we do n’t in any way compromise our religious teaching . ”
It ’s unclear whether Catholic Charities will also dismantle its homeless services program .
This is all silly .
D.C. ’s gay marriage law includes , however narrow , exemptions for religious institutions .
Catholic priests do not have to oversee same - sex ceremonies if they claim religious beliefs preclude them from doing so .
( Depending on who you ask , the marriage law will require any employer to recognize same - sex partners if benefits are provided to staffers ’ spouses . )
All of which sends this message :
It ’s less important for the Catholic Church , led by Archbishop Donald Wuerl ( pictured ) , to be directly involved in the well - being of parent - less children than it is for them to acknowledge gay men and women should have equal marriage rights .
However , maybe this has turned out for the best .
The children , their families , and even the program ’s semployees have found a new home — at the National Center for Children and Families , which as far as we can tell , is not affiliated with any religious institution .
Which means these children will still have the services they very much need , without the intervention of a church that abandoned them to uphold discrimination .
LAHORE , Pakistan 
The death already seemed like a bitter injustice .
A maid died after unexplained injuries she got in the house of her rich employer .
But one detail in particular has outraged Pakistanis : she was 12 .
Her employer  a lawyer and a former head of the Lahore Bar Association  says she fell down stairs , and died Jan. 22 of complications from a skin disease .
Her family claims she was tortured .
The employer remains in police custody while they investigate the family ’s charges .
Whatever the case , the death of Shazia Masih , a wisp of a girl from a bone - poor family , has served as a vivid reminder of the powerlessness of the poor in Pakistan .
Many wealthy Pakistanis employ children as servants , often to help with their own youngsters , a relatively common practice that Pakistani law does not prohibit .
Slight and shadowy figures at the edges of birthday parties and nights out in fancy restaurants , these young servants , who rarely earn more than $ 50 a month , form a growing portion of Pakistan ’s domestic labor force .
Not all skills are created equal in all campaigns .
In a plane hopping game Arcana is king .
In a political game you had better have Diplomacy , Bluff and Insight .
But 4e games seem to have an almost universally useless skill , Endurance .
On paper Endurance is used to resist extreme conditions like weather and starvation and to overcome disease .
Sounds useful right ?
In practice anyone with a good Heal bonus , already a useful skill , can make checks on the diseased character ’s behalf .
Of course , that ’s assuming you do n’t just use the level 6 ritual to instantly abolish the disease .
So now Endurance is left with weather and hunger , which combined with encumbrance form the trifecta of things that DMs ignore .
Even if the DM pays attention to those things , both can be solved with low level magic items .
So what do you with a skill that is replaced by level 6 ?
Surprise !
If you do n’t usually use weather and extreme conditions in your game , I have an obvious piece of advice for you .
Give it a try !
Perhaps the undead monsters in the tomb like to keep it in a deep freeze .
Why not ?
It is probably comfortable for them and debilitating to invaders .
A long trek up a mountain in the rain to a villainous stronghold is worth a few Endurance checks and can soften up the party for a tense fight .
It is the obvious answer , but most DMs just do n’t think to go for it .
Information Extraction
Picture this , the corrupt noble who opposes the party poisons their food to capture them ( or a TPK avoiding battle capture ) .
He wo n’t just kill them , they are far too valuable for that .
Think of all the secrets that adventurers compile throughout their careers .
They know the seedy underbelly of the upper class , the confidential information of those they have rescued , the location of a macguffin of great power and so on .
A sharp person with a hunger for power and a lack of any scruples could put that information to profitable use .
So he will attempt to extract the information , inflicting physical pain , sleep deprivation and starving the PCs to get them to take would make a great use of the Endurance skill .
This capture period could even be an Endurance centered skill challenge .
Skill Powers
Although the size of the bonus does n’t make a difference , being trained in Endurance brings certain boons .
Skill powers are available in place of class utility powers for those trained in the appropriate skill .
The powers Endurance unlocks are great for any front line combatant , include the class “ Diehard ” that lets the user keep fighting despite being out of hit points .
Extreme Combat
You can ramp up the Endurance skill by introducing it into fight situations .
Extreme conditions , high gravity , or any energy sapping aura can siphon off energy and healing surges .
Fighting is already quite tiring , so it would make sense if it increase the standard rate of checks for extreme conditions .
House Rules
Of course , if you really want to the boost the utility of Endurance you can always throw in some house rules .
Perhaps for every 5 rounds of combat all participants must make an Endurance check or suffer some consequence like a defense penalty or dropping lower in the initiative order .
Alternatively , you could tie the interval to certain actions like run actions or the use of daily powers .
You could also have it related to the milestone system .
For every two encounter the characters must make an Endurance check .
You should include some new milestone bonus to even this out though , it is already too tempting for characters to sleep after every fight .
How often does your group roll Endurance ?
Have you scratched it off the sheet ?
Let us know in the comments !

The Obama administration , grappling with a spate of recent Islamic terrorism cases on U.S. soil , has concluded that the country confronts a rising threat from homegrown extremism .
Anti-terrorism officials and experts see signs of accelerated radicalization among American Muslims , driven by a wave of English - language online propaganda and reflected in aspiring fighters ’ trips to hot spots such as Pakistan and Somalia .
Europe had been the front line , the target of successive attacks and major plots , while the U.S. remained relatively calm .
But the number , variety and scale of recent U.S. cases suggest 2009 has been the most dangerous year domestically since 2001 , anti-terrorism experts said :
* There were major arrests of Americans accused of plotting with Al Qaeda and its allies , including an Afghan American charged in a New York bomb plot described as the most serious threat in this country since the Sept. 11 attacks .
* Authorities tracked other extremism suspects joining foreign networks , including Somali Americans going to the battlegrounds of their ancestral homeland and an Albanian American from Brooklyn who was arrested in Kosovo .
* The FBI rounded up homegrown terrorism suspects in Dallas , Detroit and Raleigh , N.C. , saying that it had broken up plots targeting a synagogue , government buildings and military facilities .
Last week , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issued her strongest public comments yet on the homegrown threat .
“ We ’ve seen an increased number of arrests here in the U.S. of individuals suspected of plotting terrorist attacks , or supporting terror groups abroad such as Al Qaeda , ” Napolitano said in a speech in New York .
“ Home - based terrorism is here .
And , like violent extremism abroad , it will be part of the threat picture that we must now confront . ”
Officials acknowledged that her tone had changed , though they said terrorism has been her focus since becoming Homeland Security chief .
In some of the 2009 cases , extremist leanings are suspected but motives are not known .
Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan -- accused of killing 13 people in a Ft. Hood , Texas , shooting rampage last month -- has apparently suffered emotional problems .
But in interviews , officials and experts have also raised his Muslim beliefs as an alleged motive .
A previous attack on the U.S. military , a shooting in June by an American convert who killed a soldier and wounded another at an Arkansas recruiting center , was apparently a case of a lone wolf radicalized in Yemen , according to Homeland Security officials .
“ You are seeing the full spectrum of the threats you face in terrorism , ” former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said .
“ Radicalization is clearly happening in the U.S. , ” said Mitchell Silber , director of analysis for the Intelligence Division of the New York Police Department .
“ In years past , you could n’t say that about the U.S.
You could say it about Europe . ”
Europe has suffered a militant onslaught : transport bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 , an assassination in the Netherlands in 2004 , and close calls such as the fiery failed attack on the Glasgow airport in 2007 .
Hard borders have helped the U.S. ward off the threat .
But experts also said that Islamic radicalization is more widespread in Europe .
Crime , alienation and extremism roil Muslim immigrant communities in places like tiny Denmark and the vast slums of France .
In contrast , American Muslims are wealthier , better educated and better integrated because the United States does a good job of absorbing immigrants and fostering tolerance , experts said .
During the last decade , Americans have been a rare presence in the Al Qaeda - connected camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan that have trained hundreds of Westerners and thousands of recruits from Muslim - majority nations .
Nonetheless , recent investigations have run across Americans suspected of being operatives of Al Qaeda and its allies who were trained overseas and , in several cases , allegedly conspired with top terrorism bosses .
They include a convert from Long Island , N.Y , who was captured in Pakistan late last year ; a Chicago businessman accused of scouting foreign targets for a Pakistani network ; and at least 15 Somali American youths from Minneapolis who returned to fight in their ancestral homeland .
“ A larger trend has emerged that is not surprising , but is disturbing , ” Chertoff said .
“ You are beginning to see the fruits of the pipeline that Al Qaeda built to train Westerners and send them back to their homelands .
. . .
This underscores the central significance of disrupting the pipeline at its source . ”
A campaign of U.S. airstrikes launched last year has pounded Al Qaeda hide - outs in Pakistan .
But the flow of trainees gathered momentum in 2007 when Pakistani security forces ceded turf to militant groups , officials said .
The suspect in the New York plot , Najibullah Zazi , and the Long Island convert , Bryant Neal Vinas , allegedly met in Pakistan in 2008 and discussed attacks on U.S. targets with Al Qaeda chiefs .
Vinas and Zazi are the first Americans to be accused of joining Al Qaeda in several years .
Meanwhile , Silber said in recent congressional testimony : “ There have been a half - dozen cases of individuals who , instead of traveling abroad to carry out violence , have elected to attempt to do it here .
This is substantially greater than what we have seen in the past , and may reflect an emerging pattern . ”
Some feel radicalization in the United States has been worse than authorities thought for some time .
“ People focused on the idea that we ’re different , we ’re better at integrating Muslims than Europe is , ” said Zeyno Baran , a scholar at the Hudson Institute , a think tank in Washington .
“ But there ’s radicalization -- especially among converts [ and ] newcomers , such as the Somali case shows .
I think young U.S. Muslims today are as prone to radicalization as Muslims in Europe . ”
In proportion to population , extremism still appears less intense in the United States .
But the Internet functions as the global engine of extremism .
Websites expose Americans to a wave of slick , English - language propaganda from ideologues such as Anwar Awlaki , the Yemeni American described as a spiritual guide for the accused Ft. Hood shooter and other Westerners .
And socioeconomic success will not necessarily prevent Americans ’ radicalization .
Studies suggest that a quest for identity and the bonding process among small groups often drive militants more than personal hardship does .
“ The profile in Europe is in general quite different [ from U.S. extremists ] : more working - class or even underclass , ” said a European intelligence official who requested anonymity for security reasons .
“ But it ’s a bit simplistic to make assumptions .
We have seen everything in Europe -- educated people , doctors involved in terrorism .
The underclass argument is not enough . ”
The Obama administration began the year with gestures to the Muslim world .
President Obama promised to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and made a historic speech in Cairo .
The Homeland Security Department leads the administration ’s counter - radicalization effort .
The Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , which works with Muslim leaders , held summit meetings with Somali communities this year in Minnesota and Ohio , said David Heyman , assistant Homeland Security secretary for policy .
But that office still lacks a director , critics point out , and the department has yet to fill other key posts as well .
“ We do n’t do enough about fostering a counter - narrative , ” said Matthew Levitt , a former anti-terrorism official for the Treasury Department now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ Competing for space with the radicalizers and challenging their radical ideologies is the key . ”
In contrast to the heightened extremist activity in the United States , Europe has remained relatively calm this year .
But the West needs to keep up its guard on both sides of the Atlantic , said Farhad Khosrokhavar , an Iranian French scholar who interviewed jailed extremists for his book “ Inside Jihadism . ”
“ You can be middle - class and have bright prospects but become a jihadist , ” he said .
“ We have to broaden the analysis .
This idea of American exceptionalism , the comparison with Europe , should not blind us to the fact that we are going toward a broader participation in jihad . ”

British troops in southern Iraq were scrambled to the Iranian border after the abduction of five British hostages in May 2007 , in a failed attempt to stop them being taken into Iran , the Guardian has learned .
The troops were sent to the border area north of Basra to intercept the kidnappers after receiving intelligence that they were heading to the frontier from Baghdad , but failed to find them .
It is unclear whether the British unit arrived too late or went to a different crossing point along the 1,500 km border .
British officials today refused to give details of the attempted rescue operation , describing the issue as " extremely sensitive " , but a British journalist visiting the Iraq - Iran border a few months after the abduction was briefed on the operation by British officers who had taken part .
As the abortive rescue attempt was being launched , the five British hostages were being driven from Baghdad to the border by their kidnappers , the day after their abduction in the centre of the Iraqi capital .
A year - long investigation by Guardian Films found that Iraqi intelligence trailed the abductors – who included members of the special Quds force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard – and their victims to a brickworks across the border from the Iranian town of Mehran , which the Quds force used as a base for its operations in Iraq .
The hostages were seen being transferred from one set of vehicles to another at the brickworks and then driven off .
The Foreign Office has maintained that it has no evidence that the British hostages were taken across the border but the head of US central command , General David Petraeus has confirmed that the Britons – Peter Moore , Jason Swindlehurst , Jason Creswell , Alec Maclachlan and Alan McMenemy – spent some of their subsequent captivity inside Iran .
The abductions of the five men came at a time when many British officers in Basra believed they were being sucked into a proxy war with Iran .
Their troops were locked in intense urban conflict with Shia militias , believed to have been trained in Iran , armed by Iran , and even supported by Iranian forces .
Farsi communications were intercepted between mortar teams targeting British positions in central Basra .
The kidnapping team who seized the five Britons at Iraq 's finance ministry in May 2007 were also overheard speaking what some thought was Farsi .
By the summer of 2007 , intelligence officials in the US - led multinational coalition in Iraq estimated that Iranian - backed insurgents were responsible for roughly half of the attacks on their forces .
So concerned were British military commanders in Basra about the support , notably arms and roadside bomb technology , that Iran was giving Shia militia elements in the southern Iraqi city that they set up a separate battle group on the border specifically to try to stop the supplies .
Furthermore , British units in the region were told to expect abduction attempts by Iranian - backed groups and rehearsed counter - measures against such a threat .
In June 2007 , less than a month after the abduction of the five British hostages in Baghdad , the Ministry of Defence said an Iranian - backed plot to kidnap British troops in Basra had been foiled .
A Shia Iranian - backed " special group " – elements of the Jayish al - Mahdi , Moqtada al Sadr 's Mahdi army – had planned to wear stolen British army uniforms and target a small military liaison team based at the provincial joint operations centre in Basra where British soldiers were mentoring Iraqi forces .
The plot was thwarted when the liaison team was tipped off by a loyal Iraqi policeman .
A military spokesman in Basra said at the time : " We have procedures to combat this particular threat and they are effective . "
Robert Baer , a former CIA agent and author of The Devil We Know : Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower , said : " Hostage - taking for the Iranians has been a tool of their foreign policy .
It 's been completely ingrained into their mind that when faced with a threat , they take hostages .
Hostages are a deterrent for Iran and it's a very successful deterrent so that we see in Iraq , we 've seen in Lebanon , we 've seen in the American embassy takeover , hostage - taking is a tool of Iranian foreign policy which has worked these last 30 years . "
Only one of the five hostages survived their abduction in May 2007 – Peter Moore , an IT consultant from Lincoln , who was freed on 30 December .
The bodies of three of his guards , Swindlehurst , Creswell and Maclachlan , were handed over to British officials in Baghdad last year .
They had all been shot dead several months earlier .
The fourth , Alan McMenemy , is believed to have been killed too , but his remains have yet to be returned .
The world 's most expensive ham has gone on sale — complete with its own DNA certificate as proof of authenticity .
The leg of Iberico ham , which weighs in at 7 kilograms and costs £ 1,800 , is on sale at the food hall in Selfridges in Oxford Street , central London .
That is the end of a process that begins with 50 pigs being specially selected by pig farmer and ham expert Manuel Maldonado .
They are allowed to roam over fields in Extramadura in western Spain feeding on a diet of acorns and roots that help give the ham its special flavour .
After the pigs are slaughtered the ham is salted and cured for three years before going on sale in a hand - made wooden box wrapped in an apron made by one of Spain 's most exclusive tailors .

Hamas ’ terrorist TV channel — which routinely indoctrinates kids by portraying Israelis as ghouls — is launching a new cartoon series that depicts another enemy , the Palestinian Authority police .
A pilot episode shows a toadyish Palestinian officer watching as a Jewish character machine - guns a group of West Bank children to death and drinks their blood .
“ You killed our children before my eyes , ” the officer says meekly .
“ I will respond with even more peace . ”
The grotesque six - minute pilot was a big hit when tested on Gaza Strip viewers this month by Hamas ’ video mouthpiece , Al Aqsa TV , and will be expanded next month , officials in Gaza City said .
Al Aqsa TV is notorious for propaganda - filled kids ’ shows , such as a 2007 broadcast that showed Farfur , a Mickey Mouse - like character , vowing , “ We will annihilate the Jews !
I will commit martyrdom ! ”
In the final episode , an actor playing an Israeli agent tried to buy Farfur ’s land , and , when the mouse refused “ to sell our lands to terrorists , ” he was beaten to death .
But the new Hamas series expands the hate - filled message by making monsters out of both the Israelis and the Palestinian security force , even though they have often clashed violently in the West Bank .
The pilot cartoon , called “ A Special Mission , ” is built around Bahlul , a boot - licking police officer in the US - backed Palestinian Authority .
Hamas launched a civil war in 2007 against the authority ’s forces that ended with the terrorist group establishing iron control over Gaza and the authority retaining power in the West Bank .
Bahlul , whose name means “ buffoon ” in Arabic , obligingly kisses the feet and shines the shoes of an Israeli soldier , drawn with an enormous nose and pointed ears like a devil’s .
He vows to “ protect the [ Jewish ] settlements in the West Bank ” and says he would shoot his brother , divorce his wife and arrest his relatives if the Israelis ordered him to do so .
In Gaza , this is ratings gold .
“ We received hundreds of letters from inside and outside [ Gaza ] asking for the program to be shown again , ” a network official told Agence France - Presse .

I heard Anthony Weiner on air with Stephanie Miller on my way back from court this afternoon , slogging through the SoCal rain .
His take was essentially the same --- especially as it relates to the health care bill in which , piece - by - piece , out of a purported need to satisfy Lieberman / Baucus , everything that was popular ( single - payer , public option , ability to purchase prescription drugs --- Dorgan amendment ) was stripped from the bill --- that voters are not stupid ; that they understand that this was not " change we can believe in . "
Weiner thinks
Dems need to regroup , come back with something simple like a measure that simply provides all Americans over 55 with the option of a Medicare buy - in and the Dorgan amendment as a separate measure ; that the President needs to do what he has n't --- get out on the stump in explain that type of bill to the American people so the wing - nuts no longer frame the debate .
I took from Weiner 's remarks that the Progressive Caucus , so close to capitulating to the Senate monstrosity , may now be emboldened to , finally , take a stand .
And if that 's what comes from Diebold 's selection of Brown , I suppose its a good thing .
Slogging through the rain ?
What am I saying ?
This is SoCal .
We do n't get rain ; just liquid sunshine .

The poll Brad cites is consistent with the numbers I provided back on 08/18/2009 with respect to one of my health care articles : An Aug. 17 , 2009 front page article in The New York Times , “ ’ Public Option ’ in Health Plan May be Dropped , ” by Sheryl Gay Stolberg , reveals how the corporate media has conflated the health insurance industry - funded , wing - nut mobs into an excuse for describing “ betrayal ” as “ compromise ” --- justified because the “ ’ public option ’… emerged as a flashpoint for anger and opposition . ”
Stolberg conveniently forgets that a June 2009 NBC / Wall Street Journal poll revealed that 76 % of all Americans support a " public option . "
A Feb. 2009 New York Times / CBS
News poll [ PDF ] revealed that 59 % of all Americans favored a national health care system .
A Feb. 2009 Grove Insight Opinion Research poll [ PDF ] found that 60 % of all Americans favor Medicare for All , the single - payer concept embodied in H.R. 676 .

I supect that the Rahm Emanuel , David Axelrod team will simply expect to lose a few mid-term seats ( and that 's not really THEIR problem , is it ? ) and move on into the 2012 election .
They figure ( probably quite accurately ) that the Rethuglicans will put up something truely disgusting and / or appalling , and that progressives ( just like most other thinking centrists ) will have no wary to turn but the Democratic Party and their corporatist candidate , Obama .
They know they 'll lose a few of their supporters from 2008 , who will " sit on their hands , " but that they 'll gain a few centrists who were scared of Obama but now see he is no threat to the status quo .
And , of course , through all of that , they will ignore the totally broken electoral system , and pretend that all the votes DO get counted , right up until Obama concedes defeat at 9 p.m. EST on Tuesday , November 6 , 2012 , while the votes in Hawaii and elsewhere are still being collected .

[ Howard ]
Dean was arguing this exact point with Chris Mathews and Tweety was just flat out calling Dean nuts , he could n't understand the point that Dean was making .
Admittedly , Dean did not use the word ' punish ' which he should have regarding the seemingly contradictory statements Dean was making .
But Dean was exactly right .
The dems were ' punished ' .
The actual name of that kind of action as I recall from my days as a negotiator is ' working against your own and the opposer 's best interest ' .
It is , in the hierarchy of negotiating tactics , both the most dangerous and potentially ( in the long term ) successful tactic that one can use .
Unfortunately with the 2 party system we have it does n't have much chance of being effective until such a voting trend breaks the system down to the point that conditions devolve to the point that civil unrest is a possibility ( IMO ) unless necessary change is forthcoming .
Just look at history , there were EO and Civil Rights laws on the books in the late 40's and many years thereafter but real change was n't forthcoming until cities started to burn in the late 60's ( ' 68 ) after Dr. King was assassinated after several years of concerted , public agitation for civil rights .
I have little hope that real , fundamental change will come without the same at some point in the future .
The lack of viable 3rd , 4the , 5th parties assures ( IMO ) that the power of the ballot box will not succeed in bringing us the changes we need on a national level .

I live in New Haven and I went to school in Boston .
Coakley lost because she is utterly incompetent .
Anyone who knows
Boston knows the intensity of their feelings for their sports teams , especially the Red Sox .
In the radio interview , when Coakley was asked about Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling , she dismissed him as a " Yankees fan . "
Schilling was a major reason the Red Sox broke the Curse of the Bambino and won their first World Series in a hundred years .
HOW , I ask , can you live in Medford , MA and not know who Curt Schilling is ?
I make an exact analogy to the gaff by then President George Herbert Walker Bush when he was baffled when asked the price of a quart of milk or a loaf of bread .
Many analysts think that was the turning point where he lost his re-election .
I say the Schilling thing was the reason , above all else , that Coakley lost her election .
She is OUT OF TOUCH with her prospective constituents .
We have got to get rid of the dweebs and elitists in the Democratic Party like Coakley , Reid , Pellosi and Kerry .
Leave it to us in Connecticut to get rid of Lieberbush in a couple of years .

Seeing Barney Franks initial reaction to the Brown election and the others in congress makes me realize how utterly stupid they are .
Not unwise ( that too but not my point her ) but just plain thick .
They just believe the conservative meme and freak out .
So here are the outliers in MA :
Horrible Dem candidate and she 's a woman in MA
Good handsome , moderate record Repub candidate ( how many Repubs making it through primaries will have a similar cross appeal to independents )
Mass unlike almost any other state in union already has univeral health insurance and it polls fairly decently so they have no local skin the HCR game .
Short , non-scrutinizing election .
And there are also motivations of voters and non-voters that are different than media as this article shows , many Brown democrats were to left of congress on HCR and many Dems stayed home was because HCR was way to right of them .
And poll says main reason people in general voted for Brown was national security not his no to HCR stance .
So you have an outlier state on the issue MSM claimed was on referendum , you have a clueles candidate , Dem voters stay home cause of their dissappointment on health care , a chunk of other Dems and Independents that voted for Obama now vote for Brown because they hate the HCR bill from the left ( providing Brown nearly 1 in 5 of his votes ) and congress concludes Brown won because they were not centrist enough on HCR ... whatever .
The fact that Leiberman said confirms to me that meme must be completely false .
And to all those that think people are just angry at Obama from the right and nothing else , wake up .
Conservatives and Tea Partiers are angry at him from the right .
I get that lots of people think he is way worse than Bush and he is a Nazi , or worse socialist ever and whole new bunch of people have suddenly , miraculously became honest deficit hawks on 2009 but excuse , those people and everybody else have nothing else to be angry about than Obama being too lefty !.
Its clear in these polls that Obama is losing support from left , not for being generally incompetent but for not trying hard for more pogressive moves - he 's escalated wars , he 's continue Bush Wall Street love fest , their dissappointed in HCR .
And there is the general state of our economy .
Lots of people are angry given bad economy , not everyone of those are mad at Obama .
I 'm a person who is not a fan of Obama from the left , from where I 'm sitting , if we were to make a lump statement about who people are angry it is obviously Wall Street .
The angry from the right and left agree .
Yes Tea Parties , you hate Obama , but you are not whole country .
You guys probably hate Public Option too , but is continues to poll well , easily getting majority .
Tea Partiers , your dissaffected anger with Obama gets front and center attention on Fox and CNN but for 6 long years progressive anger at Bush , despite absolutely huge anti war protests way way in excess of any demonstration you guys have done , get virtually ignored by MSM .
Shoot truthers had a bigger march than you at nearly the same time as you that got virtually no coverage in any poll .
Our dis- satisfaction from left is ignored , as you will not see these poll numbers discuss on networks , CNN .
So its easy for me to see why you 're confused , but do not conflate MSM coverage of you , and not us , with some indication of universal identification with your brand of anger .
When I see a poll that 70 percent of population 's number one concern is Obama doing to many lefty things , I will agree with you , but no such poll result will happen , and yet you act like that is reality .
I can comprehend you Tea Partiers exist in large numbers and I understand ( do not agree but understand with most ) what you are angry about , how is it then that you can't even know my type , populists of the progressive form , exists , let alone we exist in large numbers .

Nate Silver at fiverthrityeight.com points out the the various effects of this particular campaign and tries to quantify them , his conclusions : " ... If you follow through on the math .... It suggests that the Democrats would have won by 9 points , rather than losing by 5 , had the candidate been someone other than Coakley .
And it suggests that the race would have been a 1 - point loss ( that is , basically too close to call ) , rather than a 5 - point loss , even if Coakley had run such a bad campaign and even if the national environment had deteriorated as much as it has , but had there not been the unusual circumstances associated with this particular election . "
So this was a outlier situation greatly impacted by lame candidate and polling shows a significant chunk of Dem lack of voting or shifting to Brown was due to progressive populist dis-satisfaction of Obama from the left but somehow this was a repudiation of health care reform from the right ... whatever .

# 19 says : " It is my hope that you folks ( and Obama ) sincerely believe that he has to go farther Left .
It will make November 2010 even nicer than what happened yesterday . "
Only a complete idiot ( read ; Teabagger or extreme reich winger that has been fully Foxified ) could possibly believe that having a Democratic president that ran on fully progressive democratic ideals , that was elected overwhelmingly by a huge out pouring of very progressive , very left wing voters , actually has to go even further REICH and completely ditch every single voter that put him in office .
Sadly that is exactly what he has done which is exactly why Democrats are paying the price now , NOT because they are too far left , but just the opposite .
Obama has abandoned everyone that put him in office by basically from day one becoming BUSH LITE .
If he went any further Reich then he would be further to the reich than 75 % of the Rethuglican candidates .
What happened yesterday was clearly because of independents pissed off at democrats for completely abandoning the progressive democratic ideals , by throwing out Single Payer health care when the first rethug raised the first eyebrow .
By NOT putting Bush and company on trial for crimes too numerous to mention , by keeping most all of Bush 's corrupt & illegal policies , by continuing to wage a corrupt and fake " war on terra " for the sole purpose of making the war profiteers 100s of billions of dollars .
Obama has blatantly lied to every single democratic voter that voted him in office BECAUSE he has ran to the middle right as fast as he possibly could and still keeps shuffling sideways further & further reich .
Let me try to put it to you in way that maybe even a reich winger can understand .
Lets just say that McCain got into office by telling the reich wing extremest base that he was going to continue Bush policies , reverse Woe V Wade , install extreme reich wingers on the Supreme court , destroy Medicare and Social Security and make absolutely certain that the top 2 % will remain making 95 % of every dollar made in the USA .
Then when he gets in he then proceeds to do exactly the opposite , he does nothing to reverse Roe V Wade in fact he says he is all for it .
He does nothing to destroy Medicare and SS but in fact helps Democrats strengthen it , he bends over backwards to help democrats ( that are a small minority ) to get about everything they want even though they do n't have even close to the votes to do it .
Now , do you think my response to that would be :
It is my hope that you folks ( and McCain ) sincerely believe that he has to go farther Reich .
It will make November 2010 even nicer than what happened yesterday .
DOH !
Of course McCain would have to go further Reich because he has completely abandoned the Reich wing lunatics that voted him into office so that he could finish destroying the country .
and the big caveat to all of this is the fact that we really have no idea if Brown won in the first place , in fact I would say the odds that he did are probably about maybe 10 - 20 % tops .
It is far more likely that this election was stolen through election fraud which is so easily done today that it is pathetic .
Especially when we have a mainstream media that denies anything wrong has occurred in fact worse than that is an active participant in the crimes & cover ups .
What we have here is a totally worthless , defunct Democratic party and a corrupt mainstream media .
Think about it .
The minority party has absolute totalitarian control over the government with a 41 % " majority " .
Even though at least 65 + % of all Americans want exactly the opposite of what they are doing .
We have 41 % of the Senate , about the same in the House 40 % and 0 % in the executive that are rethuglican , a total minority in every respect .
Republican voters are a minority of the country between Democratic voters & left leaning Independents they out number the Reich wingers by a solid 15 + % .
So reich wingers are a minority of 40ish % in Senate , House and voter population and zero % executive branch and even some right wing voters that are n't completely insane even agree with wanting Universal Health care for all .
Yet somehow magically the small minority has totalitarian control over the entire process .
There is only ONE way that can happen and it is called corruption .
We have the top 2 % which make basically all the money in this country that want everythign to stay exactly like is has under the republicans which is why they now make 95 % of every dollar made in this country .
So just whom are members of Congress going to defend , going to fight for , going to side with ?
The bottom 98 % that have no money to speak of or that top 2 % that have so much money they cant possibly even spend it all if they wanted to ?
Therein lies the problem .
The entire system is corrupt to the core .

COAKLEY WON THE HANDCOUNTS
So why wo n't they hand - recount ALL the opscan votes ?
Once again , for the upteenth time , the assumption is that there was ZERO fraud .
Just like in 2000 , 2002 , 2004,2006,2008 .
WHEN WILL THE SYSTEMIC FRAUD BE COUNTERED BY COMPLETE 100 % VOTE RECOUNTS ?
AFTER ALL , WE HAVE THE PAPER BALLOTS .
WHY NOT JUST LOOK AT THEM ?
http://www.bbvforums.org...ms/messages/8/80830.html
According to preliminary media results by municipality , Democrat Martha Coakley won Massachusetts overall in its hand counted locations , * with 51.12 % of the vote ( 32,247 hand counted votes ) to Brown ’s 30,136 , which garnered him 47.77 % of hand counted votes .
But this is nothing new .
As a point of reference in the Maine gay marriage issue recently there was no significant overall difference between machine count and hand count locations .
Look at the 2008 primaries .
Obama won the handcounts in the New Hampshire primary by exactly the same margin that Clinton won the machine counts .
It was just like the caucuses , where humans were counted - Obama won all of them easily .
http://www.electionmathe...uesday2008DemPrimary.pdf
In 2004 , there was a 2 % exit poll discrepancy in handcounted paper ballot precincts , 7 % in electronic voting machines ( DREs and optical scanners ) , 6 % in punched card and 12 % in mechanical lever precincts ( NY and CT voted 100 % using levers ) .
BUT THERE WAS NO EXIT POLL IN THE MA SENATE RACE .
I WONDER WHY .
The pattern is consistent : Democrats win elections when humans count the votes in full view .
They lose when machines count and there is no paper to prove if they actually won or lost .
They could re-count the optical scanner ballots in MA if they wanted to .
But the Dems never want to - except for Al Franken .
And you know what happened in MN .

Nunyabiz @ # 26 said , " Only a complete idiot . . . could possibly believe that having a Democratic president that ran on fully progressive democratic ideals . . . "
This has been the most baffling idea of the last two years to me .
In what campaign did Obama express fully progressive ideals ?
The man ran on a center - right platform , including an " America first " military policy and an assurance he would n't pursue single - payer healthcare .
The truth of the matter is that he 's kept a lot of his promises ; they 've just been astoundingly misremembered by the left .
That 's not to say that I disagree with your bigger point .
I think Obama will accept the prevailing " wisdom " that he needs to " moderate " by moving even further right , rather than reading the road signs pointing him back to the humane and humble demesne of the left .

Really ?
Obama and the Dems got their asses handed to them Tuesday ... because his Progressive base decided to stay home ... and your advice to Obama is to " move further to the right " I 'm chortling with laughter ....

BlueHawk I 'm still chortling over the construction :
back to the humane and humble demesne of the left but I do n't think that was Jon 's " advice " .
I think he was being rueful about what he thought Obummer would do .
Nunyabiz Please read the commenting rules , and do n't personally attack other commenters .
I 'm sure Joseph was just a drive by from Hot Air , and wo n't be back , or would only be delighted by your insult , but well , it 's against the rules .
Thank you .

Jon , you are correct about only ONE thing Obamas " military " policy other than that I believe you are incorrect .
All his ideas were entirely progressive , wanted Single Payer health care etc .
He has not kept even ONE promise that I can think of .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-bY92mcOdk 99 , Sorry bout that but just could n't help myself , I did at least try to skate around the outside of direct insult though , unless of course he believes he is a " Foxified Teabagger " in which case what I said would probably be considered a compliment .

Why , like a broken record , are we always questioning why Dems do n't ask for recounts ?
What does this tell us about the Dems ?
ONCE ...a
Dem had the BALLS to request a recount , and he WON !
Al Franken !

BlueHawk , you misunderstood me .
That 's not my advice ; it 's my expectation .
Nunya , Obama 's own fact - check website offers a number of quotes from the campaign in which he states opposition to single - payer : http://www.barackobama.c..._obama_consistent_in.php
Granted , he seems to hold it as ideal , but it was never a plank in his presidential platform .
As far as promises kept , politifact.org has a handy - dandy " Obameter " tracking his 500 - some campaign promises .
They show in the neighborhood of ninety kept promises -- and , to be fair , a lot of them are relatively progressive , apart from the anti-terror hysteria and sending additional troops to Afghanistan .
Compare that to a mere fifteen broken promises .
The other 400 or so are somewhere in between : in progress , compromised or stalled .
I did n't make up the bit about Obama having run a center - right campaign , either .
Politicalcompass.org compiled a couple of charts of the 2008 candidates at http://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2008.
Sure , by the standards of an American politician , he 's decently left .
But in a broader historical context , he 's just plain not that progressive .

I posted earlier this week about foods people eat even though they are dangerous if improperly prepared .
Here 's a food people eat that seems dangerous no matter how it 's prepared – the bhut jalokia pepper .
The jalokia is way , way hotter than even the scotch bonnet .
It 's absurdly hot , beyond anything imaginable .
So obviously , I had to get one .
I got some seeds from the New Mexico State Chili Pepper Institute but had no luck in getting these to grow ; evidently Minnesota 's climate is not right for their cultivation .
This recent article in the Asia Times makes me all the more disappointed .
BANGALORE – Red - hot chili peppers could soon come to India 's defense .
The country 's defense scientists are working on using the world 's hottest chilies in hand grenades for use in counter - insurgency operations and riot control .
An important ingredient in Indian cooking , hitherto chilies have been confined to kitchens .
They seem poised now to storm another bastion .
If ongoing field trials are successful , chilies will soon make a grand entry into India 's defense armory .
The plan is " to harness the pungency value of chilies to make hand grenades that can be used in riot control and counter - insurgency situations " , R B Srivastava , director of life sciences in the government - run Defense Research and Development Organization ( DRDO ) , told Asia Times Online .
The Asia Times article also goes on to say that India 's scientists are using smeared bhut jolokia paste as elephant repellent on public works projects .
What a useful plant !
Put aside for a moment the populist pressure to regulate banking and trading .
Ask the elder statesmen of these industries  giants like George Soros , Nicholas F. Brady , John S. Reed , William H. Donaldson and John C. Bogle  where they stand on regulation , and they will bowl you over with their populism .
They certainly do n’t think of themselves as angry Main Streeters .
They grew quite wealthy in finance , typically making their fortunes in the ’70s and ’ 80s when banks and securities firms were considerably more regulated .
And now , parting company with the current chieftains , they want more rules .
While the younger generation , very visibly led by Lloyd C. Blankfein , chief executive of Goldman Sachs , lobbies Congress against such regulation , their spiritual elders support the reform proposed by Paul A. Volcker and , surprisingly , even more restrictions .
“ I am a believer that the system has gone badly awry and needs massive reform , ” said Mr. Bogle , the 80 - year - old founder and for many years chief executive of the Vanguard Group , the huge mutual fund company .
Image Paul A. Volcker , 82 , has the support of many former Wall Street leaders for a rule prohibiting banks from trading securities for their own gain .
Some favor even tighter restrictions .
Credit ... Joshua Roberts / Bloomberg News
Mr. Volcker , 82 , signed up the support of nearly a dozen peers whose average age is north of 70 and whose pedigrees on Wall Street and in banking are impeccable .
But while Mr. Volcker focuses on a rule that would henceforth prohibit a bank that takes deposits from also buying and selling securities for its own account  risking losses in the process  most of his prominent supporters see that as a starting point in a broader return to regulation .
And most do not hesitate to speak up in interviews .

Ten American members of a U.S. church who tried to take 33 children out of Haiti have been charged with kidnapping , news agencies report , quoting an attorney in the case .
In addition , the Reuters news agency says the 10 have been charged with child criminal association .
Update at 2:52 p.m. ET : MSNBC 's Kerry Sanders say the group 's defense attorney confirms the report and says the group is also being charged with conspiracy .
If convicted , the 10 could be sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison .

In one way , the anti-vax movement is like creationism : it ’s built on preconceived notions , personal bias , and scientific ignorance .
But it ’s much worse than creationism , for while nobody ever died from rejecting evolution , misguided opposition to vaccination actually kills people .
Over at Science Progress , Chris Mooney has the solution : it ’s partly the fault of a “ remote and haughty ” medical establishment that simply needs to be more conciliatory :
Instead , I believe we need some real attempts at bridge - building between medical institutions — which , let ’s admit it , can often seem remote and haughty — and the leaders of the anti-vaccination movement .
We need to get people in a room and try to get them to agree about something — anything .
We need to encourage moderation , and break down a polarized situation in which the anti-vaccine crowd essentially rejects modern medical research based on the equivalent of conspiracy theory thinking , even as mainstream doctors just shake their heads at these advocates ’ scientific cluelessness .
Vaccine skepticism is turning into one of the largest and most threatening anti-science movements of modern times .
Watching it grow , we should be very , very worried — and should not assume for a moment that the voice of scientific reason , in the form of new studies or the debunking of old , misleading ones , will make it go away .
Sound familiar ?
Good luck with getting those people in a room and forcing them to agree !
Over at Respectful Insolence ( and also in comment # 3 after Mooney ’s piece ) , Orac dismantles this why - ca n ’t - we - all - love - each - other attitude :
Chris is profoundly misguided in his apparent belief that any amount of “ bridge building ” will bring anti-vaccine activists around .
Their beliefs are as ingrained as those of any fundamentalist religion and just as resistant to bridge - building over the core belief around which they revolve .
Indeed , trying to reach out to leaders of the anti-vaccine movement is pointless .
It is , as AutismNewsBeat so pithily characterizes it , akin to “ bridge - building efforts by evolutionary biologists toward creationists .
Or by B’nai Brith to mend fences with the Nazis .
I ’m sure those meetings went well . ” I agree fully .
Thinking that “ building bridges ” to the leaders of the anti-vaccine movement will achieve anything except giving them more opportunity to sabotage public health by giving them an unearned feeling of power and legitimacy is likely to be as productive as evolutionary biologists engaging with Ken Ham , Casey Luskin , or Dr. Michael Egnor or for Deborah Lipstadt to engage with David Irving .
As they say , you ca n’t use reason to lead someone away from views that they did n’t reach using reason .
All this warm and fuzzy sentiment about making nice to the benighted may sound good , and may appeal to middle - of - the - roaders who think that there can be a compromise between scientific fact and willful ignorance , but it wo n’t solve the problem of anti-vaxers , just as it has n’t solved the problem of creationism .
Extremism in the defense of vaccination is no vice .
Now that we ’re squarely in 2010 , we can look back on 2009 and the hundreds of recipes published in the Food section and call it the year of meltingly delicious caramelized onions , or the year we fell in love with quinoa all over again , or the year we discovered we could make fantastic , crisp - crusted pizza at home .
Let ’s just say it was another banner year in The Times ’ Test Kitchen .
We ’ve chosen our 10 ( or so ) favorite recipes of 2009 , remembering how many times we sneaked into the kitchen during testing for Julienne ’s graham cracker chewy bars or Paula Wolfert ’s sizzling shrimp , both of them instant hits .
( Food section staffers are required to taste and evaluate each dish ; hey , somebody ’s got to do it . )
Food Editor Russ Parsons inspired us to get behind the stove with 5 pounds of onions , cooked until they ’re a burnished mahogany in color and have the texture of marmalade .
They ’re so good simply spread on grilled bread , but then he wowed us by putting them into a luscious potato gratin with prosciutto , a little cream and Gruyère cheese .
Test Kitchen manager Noelle Carter , after hauling in firebricks from her car and lining the kitchen ’s ovens with them , had a pizza breakthrough : pizza at home as good as any from a pizzeria .
Her pizza Margherita rocks .

And there was so much more to love last year : quinoa with shiitakes , fennel and cashews ; bell pepper and corn slaw ; ragù to make your Italian grandma proud ; author Andrea Nguyen ’s rice noodles with Chinese chives , shrimp and pork ( a great potluck dish ) ; white chocolate bread pudding with whiskey caramel sauce ( made in a slow cooker ) ; and orange shortcakes with strawberries and cream .

The next generation of bulletproof vests and military armor could well be inspired by a deep - sea snail , say scientists .
A team led by materials scientist Christine Ortiz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated the iron - rich shell of the " scaly foot " mollusk , whose triple - layered shell gives it one of the strongest exoskeletons seen in nature .
The researchers believe that copying its microstructure could help in the development of armor for soldiers , tanks , and helicopters .
Their work was published ( pdf ) this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Scientists were first drawn to this snail in 2003 when they discovered it living in a relatively harsh environment on the floor of the Indian Ocean .
It lives near hydrothermal vents that spew hot water -- thereby exposing it to fluctuations in temperature as well as high acidity .
It also faces attacks from predators like crabs and other snail species .
But unlike other snail species , this snail survives because of its thick shell and the different properties of each of its three layers .
The outer layer of the snail 's shell is composed of iron sulphides .
The scaly - foot snail is the only known animal species that uses iron sulphides as part of its structure .
The middle layer is organic and much thicker than the other two .
The researchers compare it to the thin protein coating , called the periostracum , seen on the shells of other snail species .
The inner layer is composed of aragonite , a calcium mineral found in mollusk shells and corals [ CBC ] .
The design of the shell apparently allows it to deflect attacks by crabs that pick up snails in their claws and squeeze them , sometimes for days at a time , in an attempt to crack their shells .
Using a device called an indenter , the researchers applied a force to the shell using a diamond tip .
They discovered that the outer shell
is designed to crack in a way that absorbs energy .
Cracks spread only by fanning out around the iron sulphide particles .
This " microcracking " not only absorbs energy , it also ensures that larger cracks do not form .
What ’s more , the particles of iron sulphide may blunt and deform intruding claws [ The Times of India ] .
Meanwhile , the thick inner layer seems to absorb the mechanical energy exerted by either an indenter or a crab claw , and may also dissipate heat .
Coating armor in iron based nanoparticles that dissipate the energy of a blow by generating microcracks is " largely unexplored in synthetic systems " and particularly promising , said Ortiz .
She said helmets , motorbikes , and even Arctic oil pipelines that are buffeted by icebergs could benefit from this study .
Ortiz and her team are now looking at a host of natural exoskeletons to study protective design principles , including chitons , urchins , beetles , and armored fish .

The decision to defrock a dissident ayatollah – widely considered to wear the mantle of spiritual leader of the opposition – has pried open conflicts within the Islamic Republic ’s religious core .
The Qom Theological Lecturers Association , a regime - aligned grouping of clerics , mandated Saturday that Ayatollah Yusuf Sanei ’s edicts are no longer religiously binding .
The ruling was furiously disputed by the rival Association of the Lecturers and Scholars of Qom Theological Seminary and the Association of Combatant Clerics .
“ It ’ll be tough work [ defrocking Sanei ] , ” says Nicola Pedde , director of the Rome - based Institute for Global Studies and a frequent visitor to Iran .
“ It ’ll provoke a massive movement from the clerical side and , possibly , totally and completely religiously delegitimize the regime . ”
The crucial background struggle waged by the government and opposition supporters over religious legitimacy has taken backstage to the high - profile coverage of street - level political and social tensions .
But the religious dimension is crucial in an Islamic Republic , where it is customary for members of the majority Shiite Muslim population to select an ayatollah as a religious and social object of emulation and donate to him a fifth of their income .
Maintaining legitimacy by controlling clerical networks
The Islamic Republic has safeguarded its religious legitimacy in the past 30 years by extending its authority over disparate clerical networks .
It has done this through lavishly funding deferential clerics , while arresting or intimidating challengers .
“ With the exception of Ayatollah Nuri Hamedani , who is strongly in favor of the regime , all the objects of emulation are unhappy , ” said an Iranian political analyst , speaking on the phone from the seminary city of Qom .
“ With the exception of [ Ayatollahs ] Sanei and Mousavi - Ardebili , who issue anti-regime proclamations , the conservative clerics remain silent , even though they oppose the regime . ”
“ The Shiite theocracy in its present form has failed , ” said dissident Ayatollah Mohsen Kadivar in a December interview with German magazine Der Spiegel .
“ I do not know when exactly , but I am convinced that the regime will collapse . ”
Ayatollah Kadivar lives in exile in the United States and is seeking to rally pro-reform clerics in Qom and Tehran , according to clerical sources .
But many are frightened to come on board because of regime harassment and “ Iranian intelligence ’s strict control of phone communications within the clerical system , ” says a source inside Iran .
Some acts of defiance
Some methods of defying the Islamic Republic include refusing to deliver the Islamic Republic - mandated , agenda - setting weekly sermon at Friday prayers , disputing the Supreme Leader ’s choice of the day on which Ramadan ends , or the extreme measure of self - imposed exile to other Shiite clerical centers , such as Iraq ’s Najaf or Pakistan ’s Multan .
Sanei has avoided criticizing the regime since his home was attacked by Basij regime loyalists a day after Ayatollah Montazeri ’s well - attended funeral two weeks ago .
The residence of another reformist , Ayatollah Ali Mohammad Dastgheib , was also attacked .
The attacks were interpreted as preemptive strikes against any ambitions to head the Green Movement .
“ The religious far right wants to follow very traditionalist interpretations and not have the kind of council - based consultative government promoted by the pro-Khomeini leftists , ” says Walter Posch , a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin .
“ These are fora which allow people a modicum of participation in some issues through elections , and they ’re the Islamic Republic ’s way of embracing the secular element in society . ”
The debate is playing out against a background of declining social influence for the clerics .
“ Paradoxically , 10 years ago , everyone in Iran was scared of the clerics , ” says Mr. Pedde .
“ Now they , in turn , are scared of the pasdaran [ Revolutionary Guardsmen ] and the MOIS ( Intelligence Ministry ) !
Those combatant clerics who self - promoted after the revolution did nothing to replicate their activity , and now that they are dying off , they realize there ’s no generation to follow them . ”

Chinese researchers have become the world 's fifth most prolific contributors to peer - reviewed scientific literature on clock - reversing regenerative medicine even as a skeptical international research community condemns the practice of Chinese clinics administering unproven stem cell therapies to domestic and foreign patients .
According to a study by the Canadian - based McLaughlin - Rotman Centre for Global Health ( MRC ) , published today by the UK journal Regenerative Medicine , China 's government is pouring dollars generously into regenerative medicine ( RM ) research and aggressively recruiting high - calibre scientists trained abroad in pursuit of its ambition to become a world leader in the field .
And its strategy is working : Chinese contributions to scientific journals on RM topics leapt from 37 in year 2000 to 1,116 in 2008 , exceeded only by the contributions of experts in the USA , Germany , Japan and the UK .
The accomplishment is all the more astonishing given that China 's international credibility has been and still is severely hindered by global concerns surrounding Chinese clinics , where unproven therapies continue to be administered to thousands of patients .
New rules to govern such treatments were recently instituted but need to be strictly enforced in order to repair China 's global reputation , according to MRC authors Dominique S. McMahon , Halla Thorsteinsdóttir , Peter A. Singer and Abdallah S. Daar .
They drew their conclusions after having gained unprecedented access to almost 50 Chinese researchers , policy makers , clinicians , company executives and regulators for interviews .
The research was made possible by funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
" When you look at the issue of stem cells in China , you see the Yin - Yang of a scientific powerhouse mixed with controversial clinical application of stem cell therapies , " says Dr. Singer , MRC's Director .
" The overall picture at the moment is ambiguous but in the future , given the measures that have been put in place , the science can be expected to rise and the controversy to fall . "
Regenerative medicine an interdisciplinary field of research and clinical applications focused on the repair , replacement or regeneration of cells , tissues or organs to restore impaired function resulting from any cause , including congenital defects , disease , trauma and aging .
It uses a combination of several converging technological approaches , both existing and newly emerging , that moves it beyond traditional transplantation and replacement therapies .
The approaches often stimulate and support the body 's own self - healing capacity .
These approaches may include the use of soluble molecules , gene therapy , stem cell transplants , tissue engineering , and the reprogramming of cell and tissue types .
MRC researchers report that until May 2009 clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of stem cell therapies were not required .
Now proof of safety and efficacy through clinical trials is required by China 's Ministry of Health for all stem cell and gene therapies .
The change was made after international experts , joined by top Chinese researchers , protested that treatment centers were acting " against commonly accepted principles of modern scientific research " and successfully called on China to regulate new treatments and ensure patient safety .
Despite the new rules , however , stem cell treatments are still available at over 200 hospitals across China to patients of diseases such as ataxia , Lou Gehrig 's disease , traumatic brain and spinal cord injury , diabetes , Parkinson's , multiple sclerosis , autism , cerebral palsy , stroke , optic nerve hypoplasia and many others .
" To our knowledge , Chinese policy makers and ethicists are working out the regulation details , " says Ms. McMahon , the study 's lead author .
" Once that is accomplished , we still expect a delay , during which the therapies currently administered by clinics and hospitals will be evaluated individually to determine whether they meet the criteria of China 's Ministry of Health . "
" It is hard to say what impact these new clinical regulations will have in China , although certainly they show the government 's commitment to changing the way things are done , " she adds .
Beike Biotechnology Inc. ( Shenzhen ) is the largest of the Chinese therapy centers and claims to have treated over 5,000 patients to date , including more than 900 foreigners , offering stem cell injections into spinal fluid , for example .
The Stem Cell Center affiliated with Tiantan Puhua Neuroscience Hospital in Beijing , meanwhile , claims to activate and multiply the body 's own neural stem cells through oral and intravenous medications and rehabilitation .
It also offers a lumbar puncture or brain injection of bone marrow stem cells , fetal neural stem cells , or other stem cell types to allegedly improve symptoms of stroke , cerebral palsy , spinal injury , Parkinson 's disease or other neurological diseases .
Controversial stem cell therapies provided at Beijing Xishan Institute for Neuroregeneration and Functional Recovery , involve injecting cells from aborted fetuses to treat spinal cord injury and a variety of central nervous system diseases .
About 1,500 patients have received this treatment , including roughly 1,000 foreigners .
MRC authors say this latter stem cell therapy is the only one discussed in high - impact peer - reviewed academic journals .
One study documented a spinal cord injury patient 's early motor and sensory improvement , another found no improvement in seven spinal cord injury patients .
Another recent publication found the therapy improved some spinal cord injuries in animals but its effectiveness in humans " is not yet established . "
Despite the absence of randomized clinical trial evidence that these stem cell therapies work , an " increasingly popular but controversial " tourism industry has grown up around them .
" This is a matter of international importance , as increasing numbers of foreign patients travel to China to seek unproven stem cell therapies not available in their home countries , " according to the MRC .
" The International Society for Stem Cell Research ( ISSCR ) strongly condemns the administration of unproven stem cell therapies ... and has written a handbook to help doctors and patients make informed decisions about available stem cell therapies . "
As for advice to last - resort patients considering Chinese clinic stem cell treatments : " This is not a medical study , " says Dr. Singer .
" Instead we urge such patients to consult their own medical professionals .
The International Society for Stem Cell Research has certainly made their stance clear . "
" These therapies are sought out by desperate , no -option patients seeking marginal improvements in their quality of life .
People should get as much information as possible before committing to any procedures .
Each clinic provides a different therapy for a variety of different ailments and there is no systematic evidence that these therapies work . "
Chinese firsts
While unorthodox activities at Chinese clinics and controversial drug approvals have raised eyebrows both in and outside China , dedicated researchers in the country 's labs have been making remarkable contributions to the field .
Among the country 's scientific firsts :
By transferring the nucleus of a human skin cell into the immature ovum cell of a rabbit , researchers from a Shanghai hospital successfully produced embryonic human cells ( a finding popular scientific journals held off publishing for two years due to skepticism and of mistrust Chinese scientific integrity ) .
China to date has created at least 25 human embryonic stem cell lines ( some estimate over 70 stem cell lines ) , four of which are of a specialized type that at that time only two other groups worldwide had managed to create .
A Shanghai hospital cultivated and reintroduced human brain tissue in 2002 after taking a sample from the end of a chopstick implanted in a patient 's frontal lobe following a disagreement at a restaurant .
Several human tissue types created artificially include blood vessel , tendon , bone , cartilage , skin , cornea and muscle fiber .
Notable research underway
Current research of note includes the efforts of ChinaSCINet , a consortium of 27 medical facilities , starting phase 2 clinical trials to test the efficacy and safety of using cord blood stem cells and oral lithium to treat about 40 patients with spinal cord injuries .
Other clinical trials are underway on the use of stem cell therapies to treat patients of heart attacks , artery obstruction , and liver and neural diseases .
Elsewhere in China , studies are underway on the potential use of stem cells to treat Type 1 diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , heart , liver and blood diseases , eye cataracts , and to combat aging .
Liberal research rules
Guidelines governing Chinese research are liberal but common to other countries as well .
Chinese regulations prohibit reproductive cloning , the use of human embryos past 14 days post - fertilization , the fusion of human and non-human gametes ( cells that fuse during fertilization ) , or the implantation of research embryos into human or animal uterus .
Researchers are required to obtain informed consent from subjects and institutes must have an ethics review board to approve research involving human embryonic stem cells .
Chinese fertility clinics serve as a source of discarded embryonic stem cells for some research , and cord blood banks may serve as a source of stem cells for clinical applications .
Therapeutic cloning is allowed , as is the use of surplus embryos or discarded fetal cells from abortions as well as embryos created with artificial help .
" What sets China apart from most of the rest of the world is that these regulations do not prohibit the fusion of human genetic material with nonhuman oocytes ( cells from which an egg or ovum develops ) , " the MRC authors say .
As well , the rules for embryonic stem cell research in China are criticized internationally as having limited authority over researchers because they are not legally binding .
Adherence is enforced only for those who receive government funding , which applies to most researchers , but financially independent researchers or hospitals must simply answer to their own institution 's ethical review board .
MRC authors say that while there is no indication embryonic stem cell research rules are being broken , greater regulatory oversight would help ease international concerns .
Interviewees agreed that regulation enforcement is a key concern .
According to one , a lack of inspection capacity cast doubt on regulatory implementation .
Huge Chinese investment in RM
Chinese data show the country now generates 400,000 graduates in science and medicine each year and recruits many high caliber scientists from abroad .
China 's gross domestic expenditure on R&D in science and technology has grown from $ 5.9 billion in 1996 to $ 44 billion today .
Stem cell research , tissue engineering and gene therapy are key areas receiving priority funding , largely centralized in the universities , hospitals and research institutes of China 's main urban centers , especially Beijing and Shanghai .
Approximately 78 % of China 's R&D funding in RM is reserved for product development , with an additional 16.8 % for applied research .
And China has developed large primate colonies for preclinical testing , and begun clinical trials for a number of therapies .
According to the MRC , China 's push for clinical applications , which has allowed it to produce new scientific knowledge quickly , has come at the expense of basic research aimed at , for example , overcoming technical challenges such as controlling how stem cells behave and differentiate .
Only 5.2 % of China 's budget for research and development is allocated to basic research , compared with 13 to 19 % in Japan , Korea and the USA .
Even the funds allocated for basic research favor ' strategic basic research ' designed to encourage application .
China 's recruitment policy a model for other developing countries
" China has catapulted itself into the field of regenerative medicine in a relatively short time , " says Dr. Thorsteinsdóttir .
" The government 's policy of attracting highly educated Chinese nationals back to China has contributed significantly to the country 's success in the field . "
" I was amazed that almost all the top Chinese researchers the regenerative medicine field had been educated in the US and the UK and gained extensive working experience there in cutting edge research , " she adds .
" This is a policy other countries lacking relevant human resources should consider . "
" New regulations may in time help restore international confidence in Chinese stem cell innovations , but it will take time to evaluate their impact , " says Dr. Daar .
" The creation of new RM therapies needs a clear regulatory path .
There should also be a closer connection between applied research and those providing therapy . "
" China is an important player in regenerative medicine , " says Ms. McMahon , " Despite the media 's focus on stem cell tourism , the international community needs to recognize that Chinese researchers are making important contributions to the science of this field , and China should be included in international discourses on standards and regulations . "
" Regenerative medicine research in China is a source of national pride , " she adds .
" The Chinese rightly feel their research discoveries can achieve solutions to many global health problems .
If China continues to build on its strengths and overcomes its challenges , successful , internationally acclaimed regenerative medicine treatments and therapies are more than likely . "

In a world where every movie in the world has to be released in 3d , Edgar Wright has just broken the news on his Twitter account that his new movie Scott Pilgrim vs .
The World is to be released in 2d :
Here said :
“ Breaking film news :
In a groundbreaking release strategy , Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is to be released in 2D .
Calm yourselves . ”
Not sure this is as big news as some people are making it out to be .
Surely if a movie has a great story , does it need to be in 3d just for the sake of it ?
I say no !
This could of course just be a joke and a sarcastic tweet to get sites like us to waste their time writing about it !
What do you guys think ?
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World stars Michael Cera , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Satya Bhabha , Chris Evans , Anna Kendrick , Brie Larson , Alison Pill , Aubrey Plaza , Brandon Routh , Johnny Simmons , Mark Webber , Mae Whitman , Ellen Wong and is based on the Oni Press Comic Book series by Bryan Lee O’Malley .

( Newser ) – The legends of lost cities that drew Spanish explorers to their doom seeking " El Dorado " in the Amazon may have been rooted in truth after all .
Deforestation in Brazil and northern Bolivia has revealed signs , including roads and massive earthworks , of an Amazon civilization much bigger than anything previously believed to have existed , reports a team of archeologists .
The structures were found in a region 150 miles across .
Some were built as far back as 200 BC , while others date from the 13th century .
The finds are clear evidence of a " sophisticated pre-Columbian monument - building society , " the researchers write in the journal Antiquity .
They believe thousands of other structures are still hidden beneath the jungle canopy .

" It 's kind of a given that you share . " - Katrina , Charleston
China today disputed Barack Obama 's suggestion that it was artificially depressing its currency to gain a trade advantage .
The US president promised to take a tough line with Beijing over its currency and implied it was breaking trade rules in the latest in a series of rows straining US - Chinese relations .
His remarks were dismissed by the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , Ma Zhaoxu , who said the yuan was correctly priced .
" At the moment , looking at international balance of payments and forex market supply and demand , the level of the yuan is close to reasonable and balanced , " he told a press conference .
" Criticism and pressing obviously is not helpful to solving problems . "
The comments come at a tense time in relations between the countries , with diplomatic concerns over issues including US arms sales to Taiwan , Obama 's possible meeting with the Dalai Lama and China 's alleged cyberattack on Google .
Washington and other Chinese trading partners claim the yuan is kept undervalued , giving Chinese exporters an unfair price advantage and swelling China 's trade surplus .
Obama addressed those concerns at a meeting with US senators yesterday , saying : " The approach that we 're taking is to try to get much tougher about enforcement of existing rules , putting constant pressure on China and other countries .
" One of the challenges that we 've got to address internationally is currency rates and how they match up to make sure that our goods are not artificially inflated in price and their goods are artificially deflated in price .
That puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage . "
However , Ma said the exchange rate of the yuan was the main reason for the US trade deficit with China .
" We hope the US side could objectively and rationally see a number of problems in the Chinese - US economic and trade co-operation and appropriately deal with them via negotiation , " he added .
China reported a $ 196bn ( £ 106 bn ) global trade surplus last year .

A couple killed and butchered their landlord in order to steal his identity , and then scattered his body parts in locations across two counties , a court heard today .
Stephen Marshall , 38 , and his partner Sarah Bush , 21 , carried out a " clearly thought out " and " quite sophisticated " plot to kill kitchen salesman Jeffrey Howe , 49 , who became known as the " jigsaw man " when bits of his body were found at five different sites last year .
The couple then assumed his identity while emptying his bank account and making his house their own , St Albans crown court heard .
The body was so skilfully cut up that the murder was " clearly carried out by someone who had experience of such activity , " said the prosecuting barrister , Stuart Trimmer , QC .
He told the jury there was evidence that Marshall had " a mindset which includes murder and dismemberment as a reaction to conflict . "
Some time before the murder in March last year , Marshall threatened to take Bush 's previous partner to Epping Forest in east London and " get rid of him " , said Trimmer .
" The purpose behind the dismembering of the body of Jeffrey Howe was to prevent discovery of the murder and identification of the body and presumably detection of the offenders . "
Marshall had also threatened to " dispose of " another woman , to whom he also boasted he had " considerable experience of disposing of bodies " , the court heard .
Marshall denies murder but admits being party to the dismembering and dumping of Howe 's body .
He blames Bush for the murder , and claims she confessed to him that she was the killer .
Bush , who the jury heard was a sex worker at the time of the murder , denies all the charges against her .
But while drunk one night she confessed to friends that she helped Marshall kill Howe , the court heard .
" She said Marshall stabbed him in the back and she put a pillow over his face to stop the noise , " Trimmer told the jury .
Forensic evidence indicated that Howe was killed between 8 and 9 March 2009 in his flat in Southgate , north London , which he reluctantly shared with the two defendants , the jury heard .
His severed legs , left arm , torso and head were all discovered in separate locations across Hertfordshire and Leicestershire between 22 March and 11 April last year .
Howe 's hands remain missing - though in her drunken outburst , Bush claimed the hands had been buried in Epping Forest , the court was told .
The prosecution alleges that Marshall and Bush hatched an elaborate plot to kill Howe , who Marshall knew from his work in kitchen sales .
Their motive , say the Crown , was to take over Howe 's flat , where they had been living , rent - free , on a blow - up mattress , since late 2008 .
" A plan appears to have evolved before the murder , " said Trimmer .
" The plan was to adopt the identity of Mr Howe insofar as that allowed the seizure of all his finances and possessions .
The flat was to be seized by the device of the ' disappearance ' of Jeffrey Howe . "
In the days after the murder , the pair used Howe 's bank account to buy a string of consumer items and takeaway meals , and posed as him while selling his belongings .
They also forged his signature in order to claim housing benefit , claiming that he was leasing the property to the couple , and at one point Marshall accompanied Bush to the Benefits Agency posing as her " uncle " .
On 9 March , the morning after the murder is alleged to have taken place , Marshall asked for the day off work - in order to carry out the " considerable clean up following the murder " , the prosecution alleged .
Later that afternoon , Marshall sold Howe 's mobile phone at a branch of Cash Converters .
Over the next few days , Bush used Howe 's bank details to buy a new mobile phone and a subscription to Cineworld cinemas , as well as to start up an account with Littlewoods online .
Marshall created an email account pretending to be Howe , using an address apparently copied from Howe 's personalised number plates .
On 11 March , Marshall joined the internet auction site eBay and on 13 March , Howe 's car , a Saab , was listed for sale .
When the car was recovered after the couple 's arrest , Howe 's blood was found in the boot .
The case continues .
Oakland 's version of Mount Rushmore will rise this year in an Uptown park : a towering , ponderous monument to great leaders that organizers hope will inspire schoolchildren and awe tourists .
The $ 7 million monument , " Remember Them , " features 25 famous people who fought for peace or human rights .
They 're an unlikely crew , ranging from Winston Churchill to Malcolm X to Harvey Milk to Mother Teresa , soon to be joined in eternity .
The monument , to be installed in a park next to the Fox Theater , will be one of the largest bronze sculptures in the United States .
It will be three stories tall , weigh about 25 tons and span 90 feet - a third the length of a football field .
" People do n't usually pay attention to public artwork .
But the artwork that people get excited about - it's big , " said Oakland artist Mario Chiodo , 48 , who until now was best known for his horror masks and Las Vegas sculptures .
" If I had my way , it would have 300 people .
But you 've got to start someplace . "
The first piece of " Remember Them " will be installed this month .
It features Maya Angelou and Ruby Bridges , the Louisiana girl who , in 1960 , was the first African American student at an all - white elementary school in New Orleans .
The rest of the monument will be installed by the end of the year , if Chiodo can raise about $ 4 million needed to finish the project .
The monument is likely to be a popular field trip destination for East Bay schoolchildren , thanks to a high school curriculum created by the King Institute at Stanford .
The curriculum focuses on the 25 figures in the sculpture , their work and historical impact .
Angelou , along with Bill Clinton and Martin Luther King Jr.'s son , are among the project 's ardent supporters .
" This is important because people my age want to know that all the things we 've lived through have not been for naught , " she said in a documentary about the project .
The project is funded mostly through private donations , including a $ 1 million gift from Kaiser Permanente .
The city last month gave Chiodo a grant for $ 182,000 , which some residents protested in light of the city 's budget deficit .
The council approved the grant unanimously , in part because the fabrication and installation will create jobs for Oakland artisans and the monument is likely to draw thousands of visitors to the revitalized Uptown neighborhood .
The project 's potential as a tourist attraction is not lost on the Oakland Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce , which is handling the project fundraising .
" This will be a centerpiece in Oakland , to help people understand the struggles of humanity , " said chamber President Joe Haraburda , who helped Chiodo conceive and develop the project .
" Being among the most diverse cities in America , Oakland is the perfect place for this . "
Chiodo got the idea after 9/11 , he said .
Until then , he had created sculptures for Las Vegas casinos , the Oakland Zoo , Fairyland and other commercial enterprises around the country .
But after the terrorist attacks , he said , he wanted to do something for peace .
He chose the figures to represent as many cultures as possible , in hopes that children , especially , will see leaders they can identify but also discover new role models , he said .
" You do n't have to like or agree with everyone here , but hopefully you 'll find someone you can relate to and learn about someone you did n't know , " said Chiodo , who 's donating his time for the project .
" Remember Them " is in five pieces , including a miniature version of the entire project for blind visitors to feel .
The monument includes quotes from each of the 25 figures .
Leon Leyson made the trek from Fullerton to Chiodo 's West Oakland studio to glimpse the clay model of " Remember Them . "
When he saw the likeness of Oskar Schindler , he was transported back to 1940s Czechoslovakia , where he was among the 1,200 Jews saved from the Nazis by working in Schindler 's factory .
" It really does show the emotion of Schindler , with his arms outstretched , " Leyson said Thursday .
" It 's important to remember that Schindler and these other people did the right thing when the law of the land was entirely different .
What Schindler did was an enormous gamble . "
" Remember Them " is the only statue of Schindler in the United States , Chiodo believes .
" It 's a landmark , " Leyson said .
" It 's a singular thing to be depicted in a statue .
It 's permanent .
It means his message really is , as they say , set in stone . "
The U.S. military has 200 troops on the ground in Pakistan .
That 's about the double the previously - disclosed number of forces there .
It 's a whole lot more than the " no American troops in Pakistan " promised by special envoy Richard Holbrooke .
And let 's not even get into the number of U.S. intelligence operatives and security contractors on Pakistani soil .
The troop levels are one of a number of details that have emerged about the once - secret U.S. war in Pakistan since three American troops were killed yesterday by an improvised bomb .
The New York Times reports that the soldiers were disguised in Pakistani clothing , and their vehicle was outfitted with radio - frequency jammers , meant to stop remotely - detonated bombs .
" Still , the Taliban bomber was able to penetrate their cordon .
In all 131 people were wounded , most of them girls who were students at a high school adjacent to the site of the suicide attack , " the paper reports .
The military tells the * Times * that in addition to yesterday 's deaths , " 12 other service members had been killed in Pakistan since Sept. 11 , 2001 . "
The slain U.S. troops have been referred to alternately as Special Operations forces as and as " civil affairs " troops – military nation - builders .
It 's quite possible they were both .
American forces " have been quietly working on development projects " in Pakistan .
It 's supposedly part of an effort to train local forces in population - centric counterinsurgency .
But the effort has been kept low - key , out of fears that it couldhand the Taliban a propaganda win .
" Last summer , for example , the American military trainers helped distribute food and water in camps for the more than one million people displaced from the Swat Valley by the fighting [ there ] .
But that American assistance , too , was kept quiet . "
But keeping the American involvement secret – only to have it revealed in such dramatic fashion – may give militants an even bigger propaganda victory .
“ People are going to be very suspicious , ” said Khalid Aziz , a former chief secretary of the North - West Frontier Province .
“ There is going to be big blowback in the media . ”

BARBARA WAAS used to be a book - keeper for a small brokerage firm .
Since October she has been relying on the Holy Apostles soup kitchen for food .
The Rev Elizabeth Maxwell , who presides there , first observed a steep increase in people looking for help a year ago .
Her church is now feeding 1,250 people a day , more than ever before .
There are lots of new faces .
Ninety - three percent of emergency food sites have seen an increase in first - time users of their services .
According to the Food Bank for New York City , an estimated 1.3 m New Yorkers now rely on soup kitchens ( which provide hot meals ) and food pantries ( which give away food ) .
The number of people having trouble paying for food has increased 60 % , to 3.3 m , since 2003 .
New Yorkers with children are among the most vulnerable to food poverty .
Almost half of all New York City households with children have difficulty affording enough food .
A staggering one in five of the city 's children , 397,000 small people , rely on soup kitchens — up 48 % since 2004 .
At a recent City Harvest mobile market in the Bronx , plenty of children queued up for free produce .
City Harvest delivers “ rescued ” surplus food from restaurants , farmers and wholesalers to a network of 600 soup kitchens , food pantries and shelters , and says 62 % of its distribution points saw an increase in visits in 2009 .
Some food programmes are struggling to meet the growing need .
In 2008 many ran out of food , and some were forced to turn people away or reduce their opening hours .
Fortunately , 2009 was a little easier .
The soaring demand at soup kitchens and food pantries last year was counterbalanced by increased participation in the food - stamps programme and a surge in funds to alleviate hunger via the federal recovery and farm bills , according to a recent report by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger .
This meant that fewer people had to be turned away last year .
Some 1.6 m New Yorkers were receiving food stamps .
That report had a title that was also a warning : “ NYC Hunger Catastrophe Avoided ( For Now ) ” .
Holy Apostles has seen its donations fall .
But the number of people needing emergency food is expected to grow in 2010 , just as kitchens and pantries are again finding it harder to raise money for their services .
A surprising number of New Yorkers are vulnerable : almost 20 % would not be able to afford food if they lost their jobs .
The Food Bank 's main office is just steps away from some of the firms who were given federal bail - outs .
Áine Duggan of the Food Bank says : “ We 're the only bank on Wall Street you can trust . ”
In 1961 George Forsythe proposed to establish a department of “ Computer Science ” at Stanford University .
The quotes are here on purpose , because at the time the concept was new .
Even now there are those who question whether there is a concept rather than just an incongruous juxtaposition of two words .
Such people are apt to snigger “ telescope science ” , with the message that astronomy is real science .
Donald Knuth defends the concept thus [ 1 ] :
There are different flavors of mathematics , based on what kinds of peculiar minds we have ; we are n’t going to change that .
People find out what things are best for them .
And as for their mentalities , physicists are different from mathematicians , as are lawyers from doctors .
Each of these fields seems to have predominant modes of thinking , which people somehow recognize as best for them .
Computer science , I am convinced , exists today in universities because it corresponds to a mode of thinking , a peculiar mindset that is the computer scientist ’s way of looking at knowledge .
One out of fifty people , say , has this peculiarity .
It ’s a bit disconcerting that Knuth ’s estimate of two percent reflects his experience teaching classes in Stanford ’s Computer Science department .
The probability of hitting your vocation right away is not high , consistent with my own experience .
We can only hope for the remaining ninety - eight percent that they will find it on their next try .
Knuth continues with :
Historically , such people were scattered in many walks of life : we had no home to call our own .
When computer science started out it was mostly treated as a tool for the existing disciplines and not of interest in its own right .
But being a useful tool is not enough in itself to account for the fact that computer science is thriving in thousands of places .
For example , an electron microscope is a marvelous tool , but “ electron - microscope science ” has not taken the world by storm ; something other than the usefulness of computers must account for the rapid spread of computer science .
What actually happened was that the people who got interested in computers started to realize that their peculiar way of thinking was shared by others , so they started to congregate in places where they could have people like themselves to work with .
This is how computer science came to exist .
Now we can look back in old writings and see that certain people were really computer scientists at heart .
It was latent back in Babylonian times , and throughout history .
Those “ certain people ” were not really “ from all walks of life ” : they were mathematicians .
And indeed mathematicians come in many varieties .
One gets a good idea of this variety when we collect some examples of mathematicians calling each other names .
Paul Halmos ( 1916 –2006 ) is famous , among other things , for the article “ Applied Mathematics Is Bad Mathematics ” .
At the end of his interview [ 1 ] he was asked whether he had anything to say on this topic .
Halmos : “ For the last 55 minutes I have been dreading this question . ”
Nonetheless , he proceeded to give illuminating comments on his controversial thesis .
He closes with :
There is a sense in which applied mathematics is like topology , algebra , and analysis , but … there is also a sense in which applied mathematics is just bad mathematics .
It ’s a good contribution .
It serves humanity .
It solves problems about waterways , sloping beaches , airplane flights , atomic bombs , and refrigerators .
But much the same , much too often it is bad , ugly , badly arranged , sloppy , untrue , undigested , unorganized , and unarchitected mathematics .
Halmos sees logic as especially good mathematics .
Elsewhere in the interview Halmos explains that there are levels of mathematics .
Applied is lower than the main body of mathematics .
Mathematical logic he considers higher .
My guess is that category theory would also be recognized by Halmos as being in the higher part .
It is no coincidence that mathematical logic and category theory are rejected by many mathematicians as not really mathematics .
And these parts of mathematics happen to be especially useful in computer science .
Graph theory has famously been called “ the slum of topology ” , point - set topology and combinatorial topology being the more chique varieties .
Though hackneyed , for our purposes the slum thing is useful : is it a coincidence that there tend to be more graph theorists in computer science than in mathematics departments ?
Combinatorics has been decried as a “ grab - bag ” .
Not so chique either , and common in computer science departments .
Knuth , thirty - five years after Volume Three , has started to publish bits of Volume Four , Combinatorial Algorithms , and in the preface he confesses to liking these best of all .
In the 19th century Paul Gordan played around with systems of invariants for polynomial forms .
He was admired for his ingenious constructions and lengthy calculations .
As a result he conjectured that every such form has a finite complete system of invariants .
“ Hilbert proved in a few pages what many people doubted and Gordan had not proved in 20 years : they exist ” [ 2 ] .
The proof proved existence ; it gave no clue about finding any .
Gordan ’s first reaction was reported to be “ This is not mathematics ; this is theology ” [ 3 ] .
Hilbert returned the compliment when Gordan died , saying : “ He was an algorithmician [ my rendering of Algoritmiker ] . ”
Guess who was the crypto-computer scientist .
In the late 1960s E.F .
Codd wanted to improve information storage and retrieval by putting it on a mathematical basis .
His proposal was to represent data as relations in the accepted mathematical sense .
What Codd found as this “ accepted mathematical sense ” were relations as sets of tuples , where these tuples had numerical indexes .
Mathematicians left it with this special case .
They wanted to get on with whatever job they had in mind with a minimum of fuss .
Codd adopted this definition as mathematical gospel .
However , numerical indexes led to no end of trouble in the relational data model .
But there is nothing unmathematical with non-numerical indexes .
In fact , Halmos in Naive Set Theory practically invites the reader to use any set you like as the index set of a tuple .
A consequence is that the indexes have to be typed compatibly with the corresponding tuple values , a complication that can be elegantly solved with the beautiful mathematics of commuting diagrams .
The details need not concern us here ; what matters is that a little curlicue like this is a distraction to a mathematician on a major mission , but it may be of crucial importance in another discipline .
Can we characterize computer science as the kind of mathematics that mathematicians are not interested in ?
Knuth at least feels comfortable with mathematicians — after all , he was interviewed in Mathematical People [ 1 ] .
E.W. Dijkstra ( 1930 — 2002 ) , recognized by Knuth as a computer scientist par excellence , does not .
In a conversation with him , he reminded me of the Dijkstra - Scholten approach to logic and asserted that mathematics should be done formally , using this system .
This struck me as naive .
I felt fatherly when I told him that I had shared his discomfort with mathematicians , but that there was a nice little book that cured me of mathematics envy ; that after reading it I had become comfortable in the knowledge that there was no longer a hollow place in my head where mathematics should be .
“ What book may that be ? ” Dijkstra inquired suspiciously .
“ Halmos ’s Naive Set Theory “ .
Upon which Dijkstra exploded in indignation : “ That is exactly what I mean ! ”
He went on to explain that this was the example par excellence of the way mathematics was being taught in the informal way that students can only absorb by osmosis in one - on - one interactions between Master and Apprentice , just like in the medieval guilds .
He shuddered at the medieval .
Dijkstra wanted his mathematics formal , its methods explicit .
He wanted programs to be a machine - readable kind of mathematics .
Knuth recognizes mathematics and computer science as requiring different ways of thinking .
But so are chemistry and computer science .
Is n’t there some special relationship that mathematics has to computer science that chemistry does not ?
Dijkstra would not only affirm this , but goes overboard by denying the right of mathematicians to have a different way of thinking .
The truth is somewhere in between : computer science is mathematics , but much of it is the mathematics that mathematicians are not interested in .
Mathematicians are suspicious of mathematical logic , category theory , graph theory and combinatorics .
They feel it is border - line , without being concerned what is on the other side of that border .
I think I know what is there : Computer Science .

Look anywhere and you ’ll hear someone telling you that you need to be using social media for your small business .
For our purposes we ’ll be talking about Facebook but you cannot ignore Twitter or Linkedin as other avenues for networking .
Working with Facebook does n’t come free , okay it does monetarily but you need to devote some time to it for it to be worth your while and gain a following .
Like anything , if you are n’t committed to the process you are n’t going to see the fruits .
What you are doing is reaching into people ’s bedrooms , offices , living rooms and traditional methods of interaction typically do n’t apply .
Remember these People are Your Friends and Fans
If you ’ve used Facebook for any length of time you no doubt have friends that use it in a variety of ways .
Some like to use it as their own personal sounding board and podium effectively delivering a daily monologue .
Some like to share the intimate minutiae of their lives .
And then there ’s the middle ground where people like to have some interactions on a wide range of topics .
I personally recommend the latter as your small business model .
You ’re opening up a discussion not blindly throwing advertising at your audience .
The more personal the more chance of actual interaction you ’ll have .
I ’m totally guilty of using the FiscalGeek Fan page of just blindly linking to my next post and I aim to be more conversational from here on out .
Fan Page or Separate Business Identity ?
You have to make a choice , you can either create a fan page for your Business or you can just orient your identity in Facebook to your business so any interaction with you is Business related .
I like the fan page especially if you have a large group of friends you can recommend they be a fan of your business but if you are starting with your own identity they have to actively friend you .
It could happen but I ’ll think you ’ll have an easier go of it with a fan page .
I also recommend you spend some time on Facebook if you have n’t already just getting used to it and finding some long lost friends and family .
That way when you launch your Fan Page you ’ll have a built in audience and you ’ll have a better idea of the things that your friends and family might be interested in .
Give Your Facebook Fan Page a Custom URL or Vanity Name
If you have more than 25 fans of your Page you can go and create a custom URL just like you can for your own username .
So if you go to http://www.facebook.com/fiscalgeek you ’ve hit my fan page .
Be sure and sign up to be a fan while you are there !
This will give you a much easier and more desirable URL to hand out and put on your business cards .
Just go to Facebook ’s login at http://www.facebook.com/username to make the change .
Be careful , if you have n’t set your username already you might want to do that first , and then choose your fan page in the drop down .
How Do I See Notifications for My Fan Page ?
In casual Facebooking you pretty much see and are notified about everything .
What you do n’t get any notification of is comments on your Fan Page wall .
It ’s definitely a shortcoming but there are hacks to work around the issue .
And I highly suggest you implement these hacks .
You do n’t want your fan base thinking that you ignore them when they ask a question or provide a comment on one of your previous posts .
So what ’s a person to do ?
Like Everything You Post
Yeah it seems a little brash to be “ liking ” all of your posts but once you do whenever someone comments on that post you ’ll get a notification .
You have told Facebook that you “ like ” this post so I want to subscribe to any updates to it from you or anyone .
That really is the point of ‘ liking ” something it ’s not to say , yes I ’m voting for this topic , it ’s a way to subscribe to the comments without actually providing one yourself .
Use a Firefox Plugin : Update Scanner
If you use the Firefox Browser you can install Update Scanner and set it to watch your Fan Page .
That way when anything changes you can know about it .
Your mileage may vary with this one and I ’ve had mixed results myself but at least you are n’t having to like everything you write .
The Case for not Feeding Facebook into Twitter and Vice Versa
If you are a blogger or similar profession and have a variety of updates you want to blast out to the various social media sites it might be tempting to link your Facebook and Twitter streams together so you only have to update in one place .
Let me caution you about that idea for several reasons .
Twitter and Facebook are not the same thing and the audiences are different .
They also have different mechanisms for filtering updates and things you see .
Because of that you ’re rapid fire 140 character twitter updates showing up in everyone ’s Facebook News Feed can quickly become annoying .
In Twitter it ’s what you expect , but in Facebook the slightly more interactive nature of the environment makes your monologue tweets seem impersonal .

If you are a blogger the Holy Grail of stats is your RSS subscribers .
But I would challenge that statistic .
You might have a collection of friends and relatives who do n’t use RSS at all , give them another opportunity via your Fan Page .
So be sure to add a badge to your site so it ’s easy to find you .
But be careful there are several types and not all are created equal .
I recommend you use a badge and not a Fan Box .
A Fan Box let ’s you show who your friends are and your stream but the disadvantage is that it makes many remote calls to Facebook when your web page loads .
Sometimes it can slow down your site and do you think your fans really want you showing their profile pic’s on your website ?
So go for the badge which is just some more generic HTML .
Go to http://www.facebook.com/facebook-widgets/pagebadges.php and you can customize the HTML to show on your site .

Love to hear it .
Ukraine is not yet lost .
Yes , it 's a gobsmacking reversal that Viktor Yanukovych , whose election fraud in Ukraine 's 2004 presidential contest sparked the orange revolution , has now been elected president ; but this is not the triumph of a blue counter - revolution .
If anything , it confirms that Ukraine is becoming a serious democracy , rather than the Russian - type virtual democracy it was before the orange revolution .
Unlike many so - called elections in authoritarian regimes , we did not know the result of this one in advance .
Experienced international election monitors found it to be free and fair .
Defeated princess Yulia Tymoshenko should not be disputing the result ; she should be starting her campaign to win in 2015 .
Yanukovych will seek a close relationship with Russia , but there is no evidence that the oligarchs behind him want Ukraine to cease being an independent country .
Their interest is to play both sides , Russia and the European Union .
Yanukovych himself now says that Ukraine 's integration into the EU is " our strategic aim " .
For friends of freedom in Ukraine , there are five tough years ahead .
Real threats to effective sovereignty remain , including Russia 's use of the gas weapon and the possibility of a blow - up over the Crimean peninsular , where the majority of the population is Russian and Russia 's Black Sea fleet commands Sevastopol .
But if these potential storms are weathered , and Yanukovych is voted out in 2015 , then future historians may yet see this as a zig - zag step on the path to the consolidation of an independent Ukraine .
That will , however , require courage in Kiev , restraint in Moscow and strategic thinking in Brussels – qualities currently in short supply in the respective capitals .
As someone who witnessed the orange revolution in Kiev , and welcomed it enthusiastically , I must frankly acknowledge the disappointment that followed .
Viktor Yushchenko turned out to be a pretty hopeless president , even before his hands were tied in power - sharing knots by the constitutional compromise that ended that revolution .
Read the epilogue to the latest edition of Andrew Wilson 's excellent history of the Ukrainians , and you find yourself in a world closer to The Sopranos than to The West Wing .
Oligarchs tussle behind the scenes of politics like mobsters ; corruption is endemic ; the country has slid down the economic freedom index ; the economy shrunk by more than 14 % last year .
Ordinary Ukrainians can enjoy speaking freely and choosing among the candidates – turnout in this election was close to 70 % – but they have good reason to be disappointed by the lack of material improvement , legal security and social justice .
It 's also true that over the last five years Ukraine has received less support from the EU than it should have .
European leaders have been disgracefully mealy - mouthed about the prospect of Ukraine joining the union .
Yet even the country 's strongest advocates , such as Aleksander Kwasniewski , the former Polish president , have to acknowledge that the Ukrainians have often been their own worst enemies .
Europe can't do for Ukraine what it wo n't do for itself .
In this respect , and for all her faults , the narrowly defeated Tymoshenko would have been better .
Even by the low standards of post - communist politics , Yanukovych is a lumpen figure .
A joke I heard in Kiev at the time of his candidacy in the 2004 presidential election asked : " Did you know that Yanukovych is seeking a third term ? "
His first two terms were in prison , as a very young man , for robbery , grievous bodily harm and sexual assault .
Well , now he 's got that third term .
Despite a heavy work - over by the American political consultant and " alpha dog " Paul Manafort , his speeches are heavy as suet .
I like the story that he referred to the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova as Anna Akhmetova ( his main oligarch godfather being Rinat Akhmetov ) .
The only silver lining is that , like so many other leaden and inarticulate leaders in the post - ­communist world , he will surely mobilise young Ukrainians in embarrassment , disgust and ridicule .
Anyway , Yanukovych is the best Ukrainian president we 've got .
We have to work with him .
The question now is what we in the European Union can do to help Ukraine towards a more free , prosperous and European future .
This is a question particularly to one EU diplomat who , it occurs to me , has been chosen for exactly the same term in office as Yanukovych , and whose own pronouncements have so far been of truly Yanukovychian dullness .
I mean , of course , the high representative for foreign policy , Catherine Ashton .
The EU should move beyond its current weaselly language ( " acknowledging the European aspirations of Ukraine and welcoming its European choice " ) to say , in terms , " we want you to be a member of the EU , when you satisfy all the conditions for membership .
This is in our interest as well as yours . "
It will be hard work to get all the EU 's national leaders to commit to that , but Ashton should start chipping away at it now .
Five years in European politics is a long time .
Meanwhile , there is stuff she can start doing today .
As she builds up the EU 's new foreign service , she must decide where to concentrate diplomatic and financial resources .
The places where the EU can have maximum impact are in our immediate neighbourhood , and few matter more than Ukraine .
Today the EU delegation in Kiev is a dreary , bureaucratic , low - voltage affair , with possibly the world 's most boring website .
Within a year , Ashton should turn it into a high - energy example of what an EU embassy can be , with a top - notch , politically astute ambassador , staff chosen from the best of the Brussels bunch and the diplomatic services of member states , fluent Ukrainian - speakers to appear in the Ukrainian media , and exemplary coordination with embassies of EU member states .
The EU 's recently established joint cooperation initiative in Crimea should have a highly visible permanent presence on that troubled peninsular .
Its officials should help all the peoples of Crimea ( Russians , Ukrainians , Crimean Tatars and others ) to get more of the things they badly need – better roads and ­infrastructure , educational and cultural ties .
And by the way : if there were any serious trouble brewing there , we should know about it well in advance .
Although Yanukovych is likely to turn to Moscow for a special gas deal , Brussels should plug away at the need to have realistic domestic gas prices , more energy efficiency , and more diversified , better integrated supply networks .
This is a vital European interest .
Remember that when Russia turned off the gas going through Ukraine in January 2009 , the eastern half of the EU caught a cold .
Next year 's Hungarian and Polish rotating presidencies of the EU would support Ashton and her fellow commissioners to the hilt in this endeavour .
As for ordinary Ukrainians , the single thing that would make the most difference to them would be the easing of visa restrictions .
Anyone who saw the psychological impact in Serbia of last December 's announcement of visa - free travel to the EU will know what I mean .
This is boring , slow , unspectacular stuff , but then , that 's what the EU is good at .
A tortoise should do what a tortoise can .
I 'm told it sometimes even beats a Russian hare .

Classified German Report Global Ocean Protection Measures Have Failed
Thousands of tons of trash are thrown into the sea each year , endangering humans and wildlife .
A classified German government report obtained by SPIEGEL ONLINE indicates that efforts by the United Nations and the European Union to clean up our oceans have failed entirely .
The Skrooge team is proud to announce the release of version 0.6.0 , bringing new features and a lot of bugfixes .
New features
Here are some of the most prominent new features in Skrooge 0.6.0 .
Reports
Forecasting
Skrooge is now able to draw some estimation of how a graph might look in the future .
This is valid for any report with a graph of type line , whatever the chosen time interval ( years , months , weeks , days ... ) .
There are two different methods for forecasting :
Schedule : Skrooge will use the upcoming recurrent operations and draw them on the graph .
Moving Average : Skrooge will use existing operations and build a moving average set of points for upcoming periods .
This method tries to give you a sense of " based on how the graph looked like in the past , here is how it might look like for the near future " .
Of course , this can give totally unacurate results , depending on the dataset used , period , weather outside ...
The forecasted period is controlled by a slider :
Move the slider right to extend the forecast period .
We 'd like to get some feedback on this feature , since it 's quite tricky to provide some useful information through forecasting .
Let us know what you think .
Minimum , Maximum & Average
You can now display lines for Minimum , Maximum & Average , in any line graph containing a single line .
Linear Regression
To get an idea of the overall trend in a graph , it is now possible to draw a line corresponding to the linear regression of the data drawn
New User Interface for Search & Process
I was not satisfied with the previous Search & Process presentation .
We 've worked on it and propose a new layout , hopefully a bit more clearer :
I 'm still not entirely satisfied with it , especially the overeall aesthetics , but I think it 's an improvement over the previous one .
I will try to improve it during the 0.6.x series .
Operations edition
A long requested feature is the substring completion , a complicated term that is better explained by a small screen capture :
When typing in a text field , all previous entries containing the same string , whatever the position , are proposed to the user .
Previously , it worked only if existing entries started with the same string .
Bugfixes
A lot ...
Improvements in
Stability
Imports ( transfers , split operations ... )
Split operations edition
Keyboard shortcuts
Please read the changelog for a complete view ...
Get it , Try it , Love it ...
... well , we hope ;)
Anyway , go get it from our website , or bug your favorite distro for inclusion .

Google wants everyone talking about its unique defiance of China 's authoritarian rulers .
But Silicon Valley gossips increasingly see that spin as a cover - up for the real story : A humiliating security breach exposed cloud computing 's dangers and imperils Google 's growth .
You could hear echoes of those insider whispers in a great post on the Daily Beast this morning , " The Great Google Coverup ? "
In it , tech author Douglas Rushkoff posits that Google 's grandstanding on human rights is intended to distract users from thinking through the implications of Google 's China - related security breach .
We 've heard a similar thesis from Valley sources , one even claiming inside knowledge of the company 's thinking , starting last night .
The gossip can be hard to sort through :
Is it true hackers got their initial foothold into Google through the Google Apps suite specifically ?
How much data was compromised ?
Would Google really sacrifice its also - ran China search engine just to protect the reportedly meager revenue from the Apps division ?
But it 's worth noting that Google has already said enough publicly to ring alarm bells for current and prospective cloud computing customers alike .
It 's telling that the president of the Google Enterprise division , whose business - targeted products include the Google Apps suite , felt the need to weigh in on the China situation in a blog post titled , " Keeping your data safe " ( emphasis added ) :
While some intellectual property on our corporate network was compromised , we believe our customer cloud - based data remains secure .... This attack may understandably raise some questions ...
Google is introducing additional security measures to help ensure the safety of your data ...
This was not an assault on cloud computing .
Ah yes , " this was not an assault on cloud computing . "
Pay no attention to the Chinese hackers behind the curtain .
These are not the droids you 're looking for ... etc .
The last thing Google wants is for corporate executives and IT decisionmakers to start wondering if it can competently secure its systems .
Because if Google can't , that will make it awfully hard to get customers to trust the company with not only their email but with the sensitive spreadsheets and documents Google is trying to get them to host on Google Apps .
Heck ,
Google is at the moment trying to sell its cloud services to the mother of all corporate customers , the federal government .
The feds launched a cloud computing initiative just this past fall , and already have significant ties to Google through NASA Ames .
How do you think they 'll feel about this security breach ?
All of this begs the sort of questions everyone should have been asking since Google 's initial China post :
How much data was compromised ?
And how ?
How close did they come to stealing more ?
The hackers probably were as " highly sophisticated " as Google claims ; they reportedly compromised systems at Yahoo and perhaps Adobe , which helps explain why Yahoo has thrown its support behind Google 's hard stance on China .
As for what they got , Google has been sketchy on the details .
Here are the scant facts contained in VP David Drummond 's original post on China :
" A highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google ... "
" Two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed , and that activity was limited to account information ( such as the date the account was created ) and subject line , rather than the content of emails themselves ... "
" The accounts of dozens of U.S. - , China - and Europe - based Gmail users ... appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties .
These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google , but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users ' computers . "
That 's not a lot for big corporate customers to go on .
Google 's director of enterprise security may be a TV magician , but the China incident raises the sort of questions even his impressive powers of deception can't make disappear .

The Associated Press was at least half - right when it ran a headline , in 2001 , saying Larry Kramer was dead .
He was awfully close .
Because he ’d been sick for several years , many people who did n’t know him thought he had died already , presumably from AIDS .
But AIDS , for so long his cause , was not Kramer ’s problem .
His long - standing HIV infection had never progressed , the virus perhaps having found that rare human host more ornery than itself .
Rather , he had end - stage liver disease , the result of a hepatitis B infection contracted decades earlier .
His partner , David Webster , an architect and designer , kept him as comfortable and hopeful as possible in their Greenwich Village apartment and Connecticut country house .
Still , at only 66 , Kramer knew it was time to close up shop .
He appointed a literary executor : Will Schwalbe , a young family friend who was then the editor - in - chief at Hyperion .
Among the properties that would eventually fall under Schwalbe ’s purview were plays including The Normal Heart and The Destiny of Me , the novel Faggots , the screenplay ( from his Hollywood days ) of Women in Love , and a raft of journalism , blog posts , op - eds , and historically important letters and e-mails .
These were works that marked the world : that prompted , in a way rarely accomplished by words on paper , social action .
He might have died proud of that alone .
And yet to Kramer , everything he ’d been known for was just a prelude to a massive unpublished work called The American People , at which he ’d labored on and off since 1978 .
All the plays and speeches put together would not equal it in extending his argument about the centrality of gayness in human achievement .
It would also , he believed , deliver the coup de grâce to those who had for years forbidden his work entry past the polished gates of art , consigning it instead to the slum of agitprop .
The American People would prove him a citizen of both neighborhoods , which were actually not even separate .
The only problem was that it was n’t nearly done , and time was running out .
“ He had thousands of pages of manuscript , ” recalls Schwalbe , who started working with Kramer on the material that summer , using index cards to map out the plot .
“ It was his legacy — and it was a mess . ”
But Kramer did n’t die .
On December 21 , 2001 , in a thirteen - hour operation , he received the liver of a 45 - year - old Pittsburgh - area man who had suffered a brain embolism .
The new organ seemed to set Kramer ’s clock back a few decades .
His chest hair , white before it was shaved for the transplant , grew back black .
The liver also seemed to recalibrate his humors , pushing his reflexive biliousness and melancholy sweetness to greater extremes .
Perhaps that ’s why it was possible , earlier this fall , to find him waving shyly from a leather - upholstered , artificial - flower - bedecked , horse - drawn carriage as it clopped through the streets of Dallas .
Dressed in white overalls ( they do n’t disturb the scars the way pants do ) and encrusted with turquoise ( as amulets against relapse or rejection ) , he looked more like a retired folk singer than the gay world ’s leading apostle of unrest .
He was , strangely , the honorary grand marshal of Dallas ’s 2009 pride parade .
Never having been so honored in New York , he was flattered .
Still , after a lifetime spent in opposition , at 74 he seemed to find the perquisites of tribute both awkward and insufficient .
What happened to the convertible he was promised ?
Was the day too hot for the horse ?
Would anyone listen to his speech at the end ?
For he was aware that few of the 35,000 revelers along the parade route seemed to know who he was , despite a sign hastily attached to the coach and despite a three - minute biographical video that for the previous few weeks had been looping in gay bars amid the regular fare of sports , music , and porn .
The video , produced by the Dallas Tavern Guild , which also produces the parade , emphasized the AIDS work that made Kramer both a hero and a lightning rod for controversy , in particular his co-founding of Gay Men ’s Health Crisis in 1982 and , when that ended badly for him , his creation of ACT UP in 1987 .
Arguably , these organizations were responsible , in their good - cop - bad - cop way , for bringing drugs to market that now make it possible for millions of HIV - positive people to live reasonably normal lives .
As a side effect , they also instigated a fundamental shift in the way the public participates in decisions about health policy and pharmaceutical research .
His former archenemy , now friend , Anthony Fauci , longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , divides American medicine broadly into two eras : “ Before Larry and after Larry . ”
So while it was nice that Dallas named him an honorary grand marshal , putting him in the company of such luminaries as Bruce Vilanch , why has this man not been awarded a Nobel Prize ?

That they do n’t have a category for pains in the ass is only one reason .
Amnesia is another .
History may be long , but gay history has to rebuild itself from scratch every few years .
Though Kramer was a biblical figure , the Jeremiah if not the Moses of the AIDS struggle , his achievements are , by the standards of a fast - forward culture , archaeological .
It was 1978 when the jaw - dropping Faggots scandalized the gay bon ton .
( “ How dare you give away all our secrets ! ” the playwright Arthur Laurents supposedly complained to him at the time . )
Faggots might have sunk permanently under a wave of hostility had not the first reported cases of a new disease , three years later , made the novel ’s famous warning to gay men ( change your ways “ before you fuck yourself to death ” ) seem prophetic .
But a prophet was not what Kramer wanted to be .
That he was for too long one of the few people screaming about “ the gay cancer ” ( and collecting money to fight it at the ferry dock in the Pines ) just made him angry — and the sentiment was reciprocated .
In response to his 1983 New York Native article “ 1,112 and Counting , ” a condemnation of government inaction and gay nonchalance now acknowledged as a landmark of activist journalism , he was dismissed by his peers as a nasty prude .
And in response to his mounting disappointment with what he regarded as the insufficiently militant tactics of GMHC , he left — or got kicked out the door .
But that was 26 years ago , and the articles and screeds he produced as the devastation continued were already published as a historical collection ( Reports From the Holocaust ) in 1994 .
The Normal Heart , in which a Kramer - like figure named Ned Weeks acts all Kramer - like and gets ousted from an organization like GMHC , was old enough five years ago to deserve a revival at the Public Theater .
The production made for rich entertainment but could not have given a young person any sense of the degree to which the original had guilted and galvanized audiences in 1985 , permanently altering New York ’s — and thus the country ’s — conversation about AIDS .
Well , not permanently .
The attention of gay people is mostly elsewhere these days .
And though a few twentyish admirers thank Kramer for teaching them , via his books , to fight , they have little else in common with him .
He was never much of a youth , even in his youth .
In Faggots — a Boschian nightmare of sexual excess fueled , Kramer argues , by the characters ’ internalized homophobia , but more proximately by drugs and alcohol — it ’s the Kramer mouthpiece , Fred Lemish , who harshes everyone ’s highs .
( Kramer says that despite its humor , the book was not satire but pure reporting . )
Today he barely drinks , and not just because of the new liver — yet he seems to find it unremarkable , or even exciting , that his partner co-owns a leather - and - jeans bar called the Dallas Eagle .
It was in fact Webster , a member of the Tavern Guild , who proposed Kramer for grand marshal , keeping the whole thing a secret so as not to disappoint Kramer should the proposal be rejected .
Webster is almost uniquely exempt from Kramer ’s absolutism , perhaps because it never worked on him .
Fetishized in Faggots as the beloved but untouchable Dinky Adams , Webster kept Kramer at bay even when they were lovers in the late seventies ; after they broke up , they did not see each other until seventeen years later , when Kramer sought him out to design the country house in Connecticut .
Now Webster takes meticulous , if not exactly doting , care of Kramer : an apple , a bottle of water , and half a sandwich were neatly prearranged in Kramer ’s parade tote bag .
That the two men are together after all this time — though often in different cities — is , as Kramer sees it , a validation of the virtue of persistence , though it can also be read as the opposite ; his persistence may be what originally pushed them apart .
In any case , nothing ’s perfect : “ I know I ’m not the love of his life , and that hurts , ” Kramer says .
Clearly , though , Webster is the love of his : “ I still look at him and ca n’t believe he ’s here .
I ca n’t believe he puts up with the likes of crazy me . ”
Webster says he does so by engaging not with “ the public Larry ” but with the “ little boy who just wants to have a friendship . ”
As composed as Kramer is kvetchy , Webster prefers to be the “ backstage wife ” — to have “ my own life and not live in his spotlight .
Nor he in mine . ”
That was evident at the parade :
When Kramer reached the end of the route and backtracked to watch the tail of the event , he shouted joyfully at the Dallas Eagle float , with Webster dancing atop it .
Trim and distinguished , Webster is one of the few 62 - year - olds who can still pull off the bare - chested - with - leather - sash - and - armbands look .
But he did not hear Kramer ’s cheers .
Being heard matters terribly to Kramer now .
( Listening to others is harder ; he wears expensive hearing aids that sometimes get misplaced and must be protected from the curious palate of his dog , Charlie . )
Temperamentally unsuited to ceding the pulpit , he has never accepted the national gay organizations as competent advocates for gay people , and , in the wake of New York ’s failure to pass a same - sex - marriage law , can only repeat his contention that state - by - state incrementalism on such matters is “ a waste of time . ”
If it depresses him , that ’s because it ’s personal : “ I ca n’t afford to wait for gay marriage in ten years ! ” he moans .
“ Unless something radically changes , I wo n’t be able to leave my estate in any sensible way to David , and everything we built up together suddenly wo n’t be there to support him .
That ’s criminal . ”
Depression was n’t so much a problem back in the days of his AIDS activism , when he was “ operating on all cylinders . ”
The posture of opposition cured him , if temporarily , of the anomie and drift that had defined his awful childhood ( bullying father , unprotective mother ) and young adulthood ( he tried to commit suicide during his freshman year at Yale ) .
After his glamorous but unfulfilling movie career ( mostly spent in London ) and a big flop Off Broadway in 1975 , he was happy to be fully occupied with AIDS .
“ It was a euphoric feeling : to be useful , to not have enough hours in the day , ” he says .
“ And I came to realize that I had been given this , like a reporter who gets parachuted behind enemy lines and gets his first big story .
I was the one left alive to tell it . ”
But now that there is n’t any political issue he “ wants to get in on or that wants me to get in on it , ” what story can he tell ?
Welcome to Larry Kramer ’s Third Act .
At the moment , The American People towers high on a desk that has overtaken his book - lined living room .
From a simple insight , it has grown to some 4,000 pages .
“ Ronald Reagan kept making speeches about ‘ the American people , ’ ” he says , “ and it totally pissed me off because his American people did n’t include me or us .
So that ’s the name of the book , but it ’s the gay American people . ”
Kramer is stingy with details , perhaps because the book beggars description : a screed that swallowed a history , or vice versa ; the combination further swallowing parts of Kramer ’s oeuvre ( Faggots and The Normal Heart are embedded in their entirety ) ; the whole thing framed as a tale , complete with villains , heroes , and something like a plot .
Whatever it is ( he grudgingly calls it a novel , for legal reasons ) , he believes it to be an entirely true work .
Certainly it ’s epic .
From primordial Florida swamps to the homophilic colony at Jamestown to Lincoln ’s male love and the “ holocaust ” of AIDS , he reframes the country as a gay creation , culminating with the advent of modern antiviral drugs : “ the single greatest achievement that gay people have accomplished in history . ”
If the drugs were gay people ’s masterpiece , he clearly intends this book to be his .
How any publisher will produce it ( in several volumes ?
As an e-book ? ) is not Kramer ’s immediate concern , though Schwalbe hopes they can cut about 20 percent , and polish the rest , by 2011 .
In any case , what interests Kramer now is getting it done while he ’s still healthy , and then getting it read .
It ’s not an intellectual exercise .
He has a messianic need to show the world , especially but not only the gay world , how much it has lost to the bowdlerizing of history .
Indeed , when I ask Schwalbe what previous work the book reminds him of , he immediately says Moby - Dick : “ strange , visionary , moral , questing , and also filled with fascinating and odd digressions . ”
Not to mention an authorial stand - in who is part all - seeing Ishmael and part maniacal Ahab .
“ It ’s not some suburban novel , ” Schwalbe adds .
“ It ’s a history of evil in America from the dawn of time , and I do n’t mean bad upbringings but real evil : malefaction .
And it ’s a history of gay people from the dawn of time .
The denouement is when evil attacks gay openly , in full force — and the cataclysmic effect that has . ”
Though The American People includes controversial sections set in worlds and times Kramer has himself experienced , it is his “ queering ” of beloved historical figures that will surely get the most attention .
“ His idea of history is that everyone was gay : Joe Louis , De Gaulle , anybody , ” jokes Kramer ’s friend and Yale classmate Calvin Trillin .
With Lincoln , at least , Kramer is n’t alone ; recent academic studies , and articles in the popular press , have debated the nature of Lincoln ’s feelings for his roommate Joshua Speed , with whom he shared a bed for four years and a loving correspondence thereafter .
But Kramer says he has new evidence , including details of other male lovers , that expands on accounts that first came to light when a diary and stash of letters were supposedly found under the floorboards of a building in which Lincoln and Speed lived together .
Even so , what he writes about other famous names in American history will , he advertises , prove “ far more stomach - turning ” to the masses .
“ I do not think it is too much to state that Washington was major gay , ” he says .
“ That the big love of his life was Hamilton , who returned that love , and that Lafayette and Washington were involved with each other romantically over many years .
Others I go into include Lewis , who was desperately in love with Clark , and who committed suicide when the expedition was over and he would be with Clark no more . ”
He says he has “ much , much better stuff ” about J. Edgar Hoover than anyone has reported , as well as on FDR ’s foreign - policy adviser Sumner Welles , former CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton , and even Kramer ’s old nemesis Ed Koch , who has lived in the same building as Kramer since he left Gracie Mansion , and who always denied joining the fold .
That the idea of “ big queen ” George amuses us — I giggled at Kramer ’s phrase , and was upbraided — is itself a historical problem .
However thin the proof he adduces , why should it seem silly or sacrilegious to investigate the matter ?
In any case , Kramer is n’t interested in proof , or facts , or the historian ’s dainty calculus of context and social construction .
He ’s interested , ravenously , in the possibility , surely the likelihood , that at least some famous American men before 1968 had sex with other men .
With their “ nonstop effusive correspondence that rivals anything in Barbara Cartland , ” he asks , do we imagine that none of them knew how to use their penises ?
In effect , Kramer is removing the quotation marks scholars have put around the flowery language of previous eras ; he is turning “ romantic ” back into romantic and “ love ” back into love .
When Hamilton , in a 1779 letter to his comrade John Laurens , writes that he wishes “ it might be in my power , by actions rather than words , to convince you that I love you , ” a sexual reading can seem unconvincing .
But it ’s harder to dismiss a line like this , from the same letter : “ I have gratified my feelings , by lengthening out the only kind of intercourse now in my power with my friend . ”
Academics may argue that the Oxford English Dictionary dates the first published use of “ intercourse ” in its sexual sense to 1798 , but Kramer is n’t cowed by pedantry .
Nor is he fazed by those who ridicule the historians on whose work many of his inferences are based .
They have been marginalized , he feels , by a gay Catch - 22 that casts doubt on the judgment of anyone who in seeking new understandings finds them .
Kramer ca n’t understand why “ every gay person does n’t agree with everything I say . ”
Though he is “ dying to say more ” on the subject , and barely manages to stop himself before the name Andrew Jackson pops out , he does n’t want to leave the impression that The American People is a cavalcade of presidential outings .
Rather , it is an attempt to reveal history in a different light , in part by identifying gay heroes hitherto denied us .
Neither the AIDS movement nor gay liberation in general created the central figure he dreamed of , around whom a cult of inevitability might form .
In Faggots , a character Kramer says he based on Barry Diller is punished for failing to fill that role despite his wealth and connections and access to the tiller of popular culture .
Many others have been found wanting since .
Kramer himself clearly hoped to be what Malcolm X was to Martin Luther King : the scarier radical who made the more presentable figure look moderate .
But since no gay Martin Luther King came along , Kramer went looking for him in the past .
It was not hard to find him , his long legs and stovepipe hat sticking out from beneath the rumpled bedclothes .
But bringing gay Lincoln to life has been a trickier proposition and directly led to what Kramer calls , along with his fallout with GMHC and the “ self - destruction ” of ACT UP , one of his major life disappointments .
It began when Kramer ’s good friend Tony Kushner told him over lunch that he was working on a screenplay about Lincoln for Steven Spielberg .
Kramer pounced at the opportunity : “ I hope you ’re going to make him gay , ” he said .
Kushner was n’t sure , so Kramer followed through — for three years — with a barrage of e-mails and references and offers to set up meetings with people who might be convincing .
Communications eventually broke down , with Kushner telling Kramer ( as Kramer recalls ) : “ Why must everybody agree with you ? ”
“ How could he not have agreed ? ” Kramer indignantly asks .
“ And how could he not have used his position of power in being the writer on this script to at least promulgate the possible notion that he was gay ? ”
Kushner , whose blurb on the paperback edition of Faggots describes it as one of the “ few books in modern gay fiction , or in modern fiction for that matter , that must be read , ” remembers it differently .
“ Anyone who ’s been in a situation like this with Larry , ” he says , “ and many people have , will find implausible his account of what happened , in which he ’s made himself sound reasonable and interested in serious discussion .
From the first moment I told him I was writing the script , he made it clear that our friendship would n’t survive should I fail to obey orders .
It got uglier after that , or rather , Larry ’s rhetoric and behavior did .
Finally , this spring , I stopped responding to his e-mails . ”
I ask Kramer if the way Lincoln might be portrayed in a Hollywood film was worth losing a friend over — in particular a man he used to describe as a comrade and , yes , a gay hero .
“ I do n’t want him as a friend if he ’s going to be this kind of a person , ” Kramer answers instantly .
“ He disappointed me mightily .
He was no longer a gay hero , because he was not willing to sign on to this fight .
There was enough information out there for him to create a character in which this was possible , and he was refusing to do that , and I do n’t know why . ”
Kramer seems genuinely mystified , but this is a man who also says he can’t understand why “ every gay person does n’t agree with everything I say — and I ’m serious ! ”
Others might argue that the requirements for a movie are not the same as those for an academic biography .
That an artist gets to write what he wants .
( “ I do n’t submit my work for political preapproval to anyone , ” says Kushner . )
That there are things about Lincoln more important than his being gay , if he was .
But Kramer ’s lifelong project has been at all costs to expand and complete the historical picture ; art is not separate from politics or exempt from its exigencies .
Odd that in this argument he should have turned against Kushner , of all people , who has done as much as anyone in that cause .
And yet not so odd , if you interpret Kramer ’s quest as an attempt to find and promote a great gay father in history since there was none in his childhood or , despite his desire to manufacture one , in his life since then .
In that sense , Kushner did something far worse than refusing to toe the Kramer line :
He assassinated gay Lincoln — this time , at the movies .
“ I ’ll be happy to discuss my thoughts about Lincoln , ” says Kushner , “ if and when my screenplay — not one word of which Larry has seen — is filmed .
Until then , perhaps he should drop his unhealthy obsession with my writing and concentrate on his own . ”
Kushner is not alone in exile from Kramer ’s good opinion .
Kramer and Edmund White — another co-founder of GMHC — have been sniping at each other for years .
Of White ’s Farewell Symphony , a sex - drenched memoir - as - novel that resembles Faggots , except that Faggots is a critique of promiscuity while White ’s book reads as a giddy cook ’s tour of it , Kramer wrote : “ There are so many faceless , indistinguishable pieces of flesh that litter these 500 pages that reading them becomes , for any reasonably sentient human being , at first a heartless experience and finally a boring one . ”
Now the feud has devolved into Internet mudslinging .
In a Wikinews interview , White and his partner gleefully deride Kramer as “ too ugly ” to have fully participated in the seventies Fire Island scene and compare him unfavorably to “ real writers ” who do n’t spend their time “ yelling in public . ”
Kramer does n’t buy that opposition , pointing to the long tradition of great literature , from Swift to Dickens to Zola , that amounts to politics by other means .
Rather , he justifies outrageousness as necessary , citing Joe Papp , who had nurtured The Normal Heart at the Public Theater : “ If you have n’t made somebody angry , you have n’t done your job . ”
But the advent of electronic yelling has changed the stakes .
When Kramer is inflamed , he does n’t just schedule a speech but zaps an e-mail to everyone on his considerable list of very powerful names .
In 2008 , the writer Michael Cunningham , a friend since ACT UP days , found himself publicly shamed — in just those words , “ shame , Michael , shame ” — by an e-mail Kramer sent , as Cunningham puts it , to “ about 10,000 of his closest friends . ”
The crime ?
In its World Voices festival that year , the writers ’ organization PEN , of which Cunningham was a board member , had not included enough gay panels or gay voices .
( Around a dozen gay writers participated , though it was hard to count ; as Michael Roberts , then PEN ’s executive director , says , the work of people like Kramer has in fact made it possible for authors not to define themselves on the basis of sexual orientation . )
In a return e-mail , Cunningham suggested that “ public shaming ” may not be “ the most effective initial reaction to a disagreement with a peer , ” to which Kramer ( according to Cunningham ) replied , “ Michael , stop whining . ”
Things quickly devolved into what Cunningham calls “ a La Brea Tar Pits fight . ”
“ Gay people are being persecuted in ways that make noninclusion on a panel look petty , ” Cunningham says .
“ I ’ve been to a few protests about gay people being murdered in Iran and Iraq , and I have n’t seen Larry at those .
I give him his due for what he accomplished .
I think he has made a real difference in the world — and abusive and slightly crazy Larry does n’t negate heroic Larry .
Probably one would n’t exist without the other .
But he makes a fundamental mistake in abusing people who are on his side , insisting on a macho form of activism that reminds me of what I call Bad Daddy or Bad Boyfriend .
Maybe he underestimates what a powerful figure he is to so many of us .
Or maybe he does n’t . ”
Bad Daddy may be the template , but Calvin Trillin suggests a family dynamic that ’s just as telling .
Arthur Kramer , eight years older than Larry and straight , “ was the single best big brother in the world , ” Trillin says .
“ And the most tested .
If there was a way to find out whether he could push Arthur away , Larry explored it ” — writing about him unflatteringly in The Normal Heart , just for starters .
“ And no , there was n’t a way . ”
Arthur , a lawyer whose firm became a leader in pro bono gay advocacy , died in 2008 .
Though Kramer has no time for psychological interpretations based in family history ( he asserts that his life essentially started with AIDS in 1981 ) , his grief over the loss of his brother — and over the suicide of his best friend and AIDS ally Rodger McFarlane , in May — seems to be amplified by his inability to identify an equivalent fraternal love in the world and its institutions , which keep turning into his father instead .
Not that he ever stops looking .
Despite the profound unhappiness of his student years there , no institution means more to him emotionally than Yale — his father and brother attended , and his father made it clear that he would not pass muster as a son if he did n’t get “ that piece of paper with Yale on it . ”
Kramer has made two major attempts to underwrite gay studies ( and students ) there ; the first was rejected in part so as not to encourage separatism on campus , while the second , eventually known as the Larry Kramer Initiative , and financed by a $ 1 million gift from his brother , has now joined the list of his Greatest Disappointments .
What he hoped would be an ongoing center for the study of gay history ended , after five years , in 2006 : the victim ( Kramer maintains ) of bureaucratic infighting , gender - studies gobbledygook , and “ a monstrous unacceptance of what I was trying to have taught . ”
A university spokesman says only that “ Yale produces leaders and Larry Kramer is one of them .
He is a prominent alumnus , and Yale is proud to be the home of his papers . ”
Kramer says that being treated so shabbily by his alma mater was shattering and forced him to take antidepressants .
But to judge by his 1957 senior - class portrait , in which he looks as if he has been interrupted while crying , you ’d have to conclude that the shattering happened long ago , and that Yale has something to answer for , then as now .
It is not news to Kramer that he loses friends and institutions the way other people lose glasses .
Sometimes he says he does n’t care , but other times he admits it pains him deeply .
“ I ’m complicated , what do you want ? ” he explains .
His good name matters to him ; he begs me to contact people who will say nice things about him .
There is no shortage of fans , in fact .
But few are unmindful of the danger of exile , especially those who have returned from it .
Alison Richard , the vice - chancellor of Cambridge university , says Kramer is now her “ dear friend , ” though she no doubt remembers his calling her a “ termagant woman ” when she was Yale ’s provost and stood in his way .
“ How we got from ‘ there ’ to ‘ here ’ is among the joyful mysteries of my life , ” she wrote in an e-mail , “ and I ’m content to leave it that way ! ”
For someone so loving and sensitive , Kramer has a strangely vague sense of the effect his anger has on people .
After all , in writing an autobiographical character like Ned Weeks in The Normal Heart , he would seem in some way to be acknowledging , if valorizing , his own bullying .
( Kramer admits that he can see his fingerprints on what happened to him at GMHC . )
Having learned at an early age to fight back loudly — his father “ never spoke in anything but top volume ” — he may not even hear his yelling as an expression of anger .
Trillin thinks it ’s usually just pump - priming , a clearing of the throat .
“ But the essential thing about Larry and AIDS , ” he says , “ is that he was right .
And the theater of it had an effect .
It made you think :
If this normally civilized man was acting in this manner , then it really must be as bad as he says . ”
But who is the enemy now ?
Not that old standby , the medical Establishment , which gave him a liver and thus his life .
Nor his insurance company ; Kramer gratefully pays almost nothing for the thousands of dollars ’ worth of anti-viral and anti-rejection drugs delivered monthly to his door .
As for homophobia , it may now be too diffuse to respond to the full - bore strategy of a Kramer - style attack .
The “ lack of anger ” he finds around him , and which he has attempted in recent years to replenish from his own apparently bottomless supply , similarly cannot be attacked head on .
And sitting on a sofa in his third - floor apartment ( he ’s terrified of heights because they invite jumping ) , sweet little Larry — asking after one ’s health , cuddling his terrier — seems to know it .
Of course one quickly remembers that even pets are made part of the struggle .
A few years ( and another dog ) ago , when Koch moved into his building , Kramer was ordered by management to keep his distance , at least verbally .
So when Kramer ran into the ex-mayor in the mailroom one day , he looked at his pooch and said , “ Do n’t go near him , Molly , that ’s the man who murdered all of Daddy ’s friends ! ”
The weird hilarity of the remark made it famous , but Kramer was n’t being funny ; he was being true to his principles .
“ He ’s so in - your - face , so outrageous , so offensive in his tactics , that for all the good work he has done he has been marginalized , ” says Barbara Kellerman , who teaches Kramer alongside Lincoln and Lao Tzu in a course called Leadership Literacy at Harvard ’s Kennedy School .
“ But that does n’t mean the tactics are n’t necessary .
Leadership is a question of the person meeting the moment .
His extreme leadership met that extreme moment .
It is arguably less suited to a moment that appears to be about slow and steady progress .
Is Larry Kramer agile enough to adjust to the needs of the moment ?
That ’s very much an open question . ”
It was Kellerman who brought Kramer word of the latest — and , in some ways , most insulting — outrage against him , this time courtesy of Harvard .
In October , the university ’s art museum and Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts opened “ ACT UP New York : Activism , Art , and the AIDS Crisis , 1987 – 1993 , ” but nowhere in the exhibit ’s online guide is Kramer mentioned .
Furthermore , in all the ancillary “ programs , speakers , panels , readings , what - have - yous , ” Kramer wrote in one of his e-mail zaps , “ there is not one appearance scheduled for the person who started it all . ”
His anger was not assuaged by a curator for the exhibit who told him ( he says ) that they had decided “ only to use ‘ young people ’ so that the Harvard kids would identify more . ”
“ I was boiling over and wanted to say , ‘ You are selfish and incompetent , ’ ” he continued , “ but all I could blurt out was , ‘ These kids should hear me ! ’ ”
It ’s not vanity , or not just vanity .
Kramer is genuinely concerned about the fate of others , a fate in which he believes himself to be crucially involved .
He therefore worries constantly about the project that failed , the friendship that cratered .
Recently he ’s been up nights working the e-mail list to set up ( with Scott Rudin ’s help ) a production of A Minor Dark Age , a startling 1973 play that he thinks may revive his theatrical reputation .
And when he ran into Cunningham at a holiday party , he humbly reintroduced himself : “ I ’m Larry Kramer . ”
“ I know who you are , ” said Cunningham .
The two men apologized and kissed .
But no matter how many e-mails Kramer circulates , or fences he mends , the danger of rejection is everywhere , inside and out .
The present constantly renews its depravity .
No wonder he has turned his attention to history : as a corrective but also a salve .
In history heroes are treasured for their peccadilloes , not vilified for them .
( Lincoln , gay or not , was a very strange , emotional man . )
In writing The American People , he can write himself a context he wants to be part of instead of the context he actually lives in .
He can join a bigger parade than Dallas ’s , or even New York’s .
But for the moment he has come to the end of the route .
The last float has floated .
Thousands of revelers have collected to cruise and mingle in Dallas ’s Lee Park , where Michael Doughman , the Tavern Guild ’s executive director , introduces Kramer : “ If you ’re a young person you may never have heard this name , but he is a true American hero . ”
There is polite applause .
Kramer has shown me what he intends to say .
He will remind the crowd how they are hated , he will criticize passivity in the face of that hatred , he will paint a picture of the glorious days in which gay people made progress because they “ fought like screaming fucking banshees . ”
He will say gay people are smarter and make better friends than straight people , a contention that might surprise Tony Kushner , if not Lincoln .
All of this will draw the usual divided response .
Commenters on the Dallas Voice website will start an online shouting match afterward : “ His bloated and self - righteous performance today is further proof that times have changed , and changed dramatically . ”
“ If it was n’t for people like us , most of the people you call friends would probably be dead now . ”
“ I rest my case . ”
At least that will be better than the local television news coverage , which is next to nil , not only for Kramer but for the entire pride event .
But Kramer does n’t yet know about any of that as he bounds surprisingly nimbly up the stairs to the dais , grabs the microphone , and stares at the crowd in front of him , like a lover who hopes his passion will be returned but from experience knows better .
If he ever finishes The American People , these happy , ahistorical citizens will be his audience .
“ Can you hear me ? ” he shouts .
“ Are my words coming through loud and clear ? ”
Six new suspects in killing of Hamas official were carrying British passports
Dubai police today identified 15 more suspects wanted over the murder of a senior Hamas official in the Gulf emirate last month , including a further six who used British passports .
The announcement brings to 26 the total number of people suspected of involvement in Mahmoud al - Mabhouh 's assassination , which is widely believed to have been the work of Israel 's secret service , the Mossad .
The six new British names are Mark Daniel Sklar , Roy Allan Cannon , Daniel Marc Schnur , Philip Carr , Stephen Keith Drake and Gabriella Barney .
A Foreign Office spokesman said the government believed their passport details had been used fraudulently .
" We can confirm that six more UK passports have been identified .
We will seek to make contact with these individuals and offer consular assistance as we have the previous individuals .
We continue to work closely with the Emirati authorities .
The foreign secretary and others have made clear we expect full Israeli co-operation . "
It was not immediately clear where the six live .
The mother of Sklar , who declined to give her name , said her son lived and worked in Israel .
She said neither she nor her son had been contacted by the Foreign Office , but she had spoken to him today after being contacted by journalists .
" He was very shocked , " she said .
" It 's a bit worrying " .
Another of those named , an Israeli living in Tel Aviv , said he was angry and shocked to find his identity had been stolen .
Adam Korman , 34 , works in a shop in Rothschild Avenue , Tel Aviv .
He was born in Australia but emigrated to Israel as a child and holds joint citizenship .
" I am shocked , it 's identity theft – simply unbelievable , " he told Ynet , the website of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper .
" I am quite shocked and can't believe this is happening , " he said .
Korman is the eighth Israeli citizen so far to have his identity stolen by the suspected assassins in Dubai .
Like all the others , he said he had not visited Dubai , but did travel around the world and regularly flew back to Australia .
" I have been frightened and shocked since receiving the news .
It 's irresponsible and a violation of human and individual rights to do such a thing , " he said .
Israeli officials have rejected claims of involvement by the Mossad , Israel 's foreign intelligence service , although they have not specifically denied any role .
Instead , the government keeps to a policy of " ambiguity " over Mossad operations .
But on Tuesday Tzipi Livni , leader of the opposition Kadima party and a former foreign minister , praised the killing .
" The fact that a terrorist was killed , and it does n't matter if it was in Dubai or Gaza , is good news to those fighting terrorism , " she said at a conference in Jerusalem .
Dubai police say the newly named suspects were believed to have provided " logistical support " for the operation .
Many had credit cards that were issued by the same US bank .
At least three women are now suspected of involvement in the hit , one of whom used a UK passport .
Other suspects were travelling on passports issued by Australia .
The total number of UK passports linked to the case has risen to 12 and French passports to five .
The suspected hit squad flew in from Munich , Paris , Rome , Milan and Hong Kong .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , has described as an outrage the alleged abuse of British passports and an investigation is under way by the serious organised crime agency , Soca .
A Soca spokesman said the agency was trying to track down the people named by Dubai police .
" The genuine passport holders have not been confirmed as being directly linked to the murder , " he said .
The EU has also condemned passport abuse , without mentioning Israel .
The Dubai authorities have been using immigration records and CCTV images of the suspects to try to piece together what happened in the hours before Mabhouh 's murder .
Israel has said Mabhouh played a key role in smuggling Iranian - supplied rockets into the Gaza Strip and was involved in the abduction and killing of two soldiers 20 years ago .
After this awful fiasco over swine flu , we should never believe the State scare machine again
So the Government , as the Daily Mail has revealed , is trying to get rid of £ 1 billion - worth of unwanted swine flu vaccine - because the deadly epidemic they were promising us all last year never materialised .
Several things are shocking about this revelation , not least the charge by the Council of Europe 's head of health that major drug companies might have leaned on the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) to stoke up last year 's scare by warning that swine flu could be a worldwide ' pandemic ' killing tens of millions .
Certainly , those companies have made vast fortunes out of selling the vaccines which , at our expense , are now having to be flogged off at give - away prices .
Worthless :
The Government is trying to get rid of £ 1bn worth of swine flu vaccine
But in a way most shocking of all is that this scandalous waste of public money - and the wild over - reaction which gave rise to it - was entirely predictable .
I can say this with confidence because I predicted it on this very page of the Daily Mail in April last year , just when our government , led by the Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson , was cranking up the scare - machine to fever pitch by predicting that swine flu could be as bad as the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 which killed 50 million people worldwide .
Even then it was clear that governments all over the world , led by the WHO , were in the grip of a hysterical panic over swine flu .
Our own government was holding emergency meetings in its ' crisis bunker ' off Whitehall .
The BBC Today programme wheeled on a WHO ' expert ' to predict that 40 per cent of Britons would catch swine flu , while citing another unnamed ' expert ' as predicting that up to 1.2 million of us could die .
The Government set up NHS centres to deal with suspected swine flu cases
A similar panic had seized politicians in America , when just one child died after a family holiday in Mexico - even though this compared with the 36,000 Americans who die each year from more conventional strains of flu .
Yet eight months later it was being reported by scientists that swine flue is only a tenth as virulent as ordinary flu , and only one - 100th as virulent as that Spanish flu at the end of World War I .
In other words , swine flu - just like the bird flu which we were told by a senior WHO official in 2005 was going to kill 150 million people worldwide ( the true death toll turned out to be barely 200 ) - has predictably turned out to be yet another example of that all - too - familiar and very dangerous disease of our time , the ' scare phenomenon ' .
Three years ago , with a food safety expert , Dr Richard North , I wrote a book called Scared To Death , a detailed study showing how scare after scare in the past 20 years has rocketed through the headlines , costing us all billions , before it was eventually revealed that they had been blown up out of all proportion and , in many cases , had no real justification at all .
Leaflets were issued to highlight the danger of contracting swine flu
Based on years of research , we traced the history of a whole sequence of such panics , ranging from those over salmonella in eggs and BSE in beef to the Millennium Bug that was supposedly going to bring civilisation to a halt at midnight on December 31 , 1999 , as half the world 's computers crashed .
That particular panic cost an estimated $ 300 billion before it was discovered that the countries which had n't spent fortunes on sorting out their computers fared no worse than those that had .
The purpose of our book was to show how consistently these scares follow an identifiable pattern .
They invariably begin with some misreading of the scientific evidence , which then gets picked up and inflated into some major threat to human health or well being .
But the tipping point of any scare , the moment when it begins to create serious damage , is when politicians and governments get involved , buying the exaggerated threat wholesale and responding with a deluge of measures which end up costing us all billions of pounds .
Priests in Mexico pray while wearing masks intended to prevent them from contracting swine flu
A couple in Mexico attempt to kiss while wearing the masks
Do you remember our health minister Edwina Currie in 1988 setting off that panic over salmonella in eggs , which was supposedly going to kill thousands of people because the bacteria were somehow getting inside the eggs they ate for breakfast ?
Few headlines greeted the government 's admission four years later that salmonella was not getting inside eggs after all and that whatever else had caused a temporary rise in salmonella poisoning , it was n't eggs .
But by then the damage was done and more than 5,000 small egg producers had been driven out of business .
In 1996 , when the greatest food scare of all exploded over BSE , front - page headlines greeted the suggestion by the government 's chief scientist John Pattison that the death toll from CJD caught by eating beef could within a few years reach 500,000 .
A year later , scarcely any attention at all was paid to Dr Pattison 's confession that he had now revised his figure downwards to just ' 100 ' .
But by this time a flood of government and EU regulations were costing us all an estimated £ 7 billion .
Again and again we have seen this pattern repeating itself , from SARS and dioxins to the confusion between different types of asbestos , costing more than £ 100 billion in lawsuits alone - and the one lesson which comes out from them all , loud and clear , is that our modern world has become far too prone to getting these supposed threats out of all proportion .
The Government launched a mass immunisation programme in an attempt to stop the spread of swine flu
Exactly as I predicted last April , the panic over swine flu has provided yet another very expensive example of the pattern , showing features all too familiar from all those other scares which have already run their absurdly damaging and unnecessary course .
Of course , governments must be prepared to meet any genuine threat to our health and well - being .
But as history painfully shows , we have become far too quick to over - react to dangers which too often turn out either to have been wildly exaggerated or never to have existed at all .
The real problem is that too many people have a vested interest in talking up these panics beyond what the evidence can support .
These include scientists who are dependent on promoting scares for their funding ; politicians who recklessly use scares to show their concern for our welfare ; and , not least , those commercial interests which make fortunes out of scares , such as the drug companies who have profited so hugely out of swine flu .
And now , of course - as we and half the world have shivered in recent weeks through the third freezing winter in a row - we are confronted with what many scientists and other experts are beginning to warn might be by far the greatest and most costly scare of all : the panic over runaway global warming .
What this awful fiasco over swine flu should be telling us , in short , is that it is high time we learned to recognise the power of the scare for what it is - something which can carry away our politicians into wasting astronomic sums of money and doing untold damage , based on misreadings of the scientific evidence which may initially seem quite plausible but which can eventually make them and all of us look very silly indeed .
" Porn King " Ron Jeremy brought a little bit of the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo to the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) Friday for a debate on the ins and outs of pornography in the age of the Internet .
LAS VEGAS - " Porn King " Ron Jeremy brought a little bit of the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo to the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) Friday for a debate on the ins and outs of pornography in the age of the Internet .
Jeremy and Craig Gross , an anti-pornography media activist , faced off for " The Great Porn Debate , " though the event was really more a light - hearted discussion .
Jeremy kicked off his opening remarks by referring to pornography as entertainment , not unlike football games .
" World of sport versus world of spurts , " he joked to the groans of the crowd . "
" Porn is a cheap substitute for sex , " countered Gross . " [ It ] has become [ childrens ' ] sex ed .
It 's a false expectation . "
Jeremy insisted that the industry only caters to the over - 18 crowd .
" We do n't want kids to watch porn , " he told the crowd .
Though if they do , he added , there are far worse influences out there  like video games .
" [ Studies have ] found that violent video games are much bigger a negative influence on kids . "
Gross , on the other hand , argued that even while the porn industry may not be targeting children specifically , the Internet has made adult content nearly ubiquitous .
" The Internet has changed the game completely .
What we used to have to work hard to find , you now have to work hard to avoid , " Gross said .
The filtering , Jeremy argued , should be up to the parents .
" Parents better start to learn the Internet , " Jeremy said .
Gross , it seems , agreed with the sentiment , telling the crowd , " For the most part , kids are smarter about technology than their parents .
That has to change . "
Gross did , however , happily take a shot at Jeremy 's own tech savvy , adding , " Ron uses a fax machine .
If you want to get a hold of him , you have to send him a fax . "
Judge Wilbert ruled that he would not instruct the jury to consider a lesser charge when they begin deliberations on Friday .
Mr. Roeder has pleaded not guilty to murder , but defense lawyers had argued that his beliefs about abortion might warrant a voluntary manslaughter conviction if jurors concluded that Mr. Roeder possessed , as Kansas law defines it , “ an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force . ”

Seated on the witness stand , facing a tiny courtroom gallery that included Dr. Tiller ’s widow , Jeanne , abortion opponents from other parts of the country , and national abortion rights supporters , Mr. Roeder seemed quiet , almost lawyerly , in his responses to inquiries about the killing , in which Dr. Tiller was shot in the forehead , the gun pressed to his skin .
Mr. Roeder , 51 , of Kansas City , Mo. , told jurors that he had a growing sense of his own faith and opposition to abortion in the 1990s after watching “ The 700 Club , ” the evangelist Pat Robertson ’s television talk show .
Mr. Roeder ’s views on religion and abortion , he said , went “ hand in hand . ”
Mr. Roeder acknowledged under cross-examination that he had , as early as 1993 , thought about killing Dr. Tiller .
A year before the shooting , he said , he had gone to Dr. Tiller ’s church with a gun intending to shoot him .
( Dr. Tiller was not there that day , he said . )
And he said he considered other alternatives : cutting off Dr. Tiller ’s hands with a sword , shooting him from a distance with a rifle , or finding him at his house .
Of his decision to go to the church , he said , “ It was the only window of opportunity I saw that he could be stopped . ”
Abortion opponents here , including some who have served time in jail for abortion clinic violence , praised Mr. Roeder for his testimony .
But some complained bitterly that Judge Wilbert had severely limited the defense by barring the testimony of Phill Kline , a former Kansas attorney general who had unsuccessfully pursued criminal investigations against Dr. Tiller and by preventing jurors from considering some conviction short of murder .
Anti-choice " aid " organizations and people like Steve Mosher , believe the women they ’re “ serving ” are meant to reproduce , even as their bodies give out , and they ca n’t feed the children they have .
Anti-choice “ aid ” organizations are up in arms over Hillary Clinton ’s pledge to ramp up women ’s health care in international development , and her assertion that abortion is a fundamental part of women ’s health .
One man sounding the alarms is Steve Mosher , the president of the Population Research Institute .
PRI ’s most notable “ research ” finding is that the world is not , in fact , overcrowded , and the organization ’s “ human rights projects ” include denying women contraception , opposing the Freedom of Choice Act , and fighting the United Nations .
Mosher says :
“ ’ Reproductive health ’ is a code word for abortion and population control .
It has little to do with women ’s health and everything to do with advancing an anti-life agenda worldwide . ”
Anti-choicers have been worked up ever since President Obama repealed the Mexico City policy , or the Global Gag Rule , a year ago .
The gag rule prevented U.S. funding from going to organizations that so much as mention abortion .
( Predictably , this policy only resulted in more unintended pregnancies and life - threatening abortions , as it crippled organizations providing contraception . )

Abortion is fine for Americans — it ’s been legal here for 35 years and it will continue to be legal — but it ’s not okay for the women in the countries America consistently supports .
We send them food and doctors , we help them develop strong agricultural and economic systems , but we do n’t give their women the very basic right to choose when and if they have children .
For these women , there is no daycare .
They ca n’t throw a little more food into their shopping carts .
But apparently Mosher knows more about the female reproductive system than women , doctors , or the UN :
“ … reproductive ‘ health ’ programs exist not to improve the ability of women to reproduce , ” Mosher explained , “ but to cripple or disable their reproductive systems by means of abortion , sterilization and contraception .
They should more accurately be called ‘ reproductive crippling ’ programs . ”
Why does n’t Mr. Mosher ask a 38 - year - old Indian woman , worn out from her seven pregnancies , if she would like to have a few more ?
Why does n’t he talk to the children she leaves behind when she dies in childbirth ?
Why does n’t he ask a 14 - year - old girl in Africa if her reproductive system is working beautifully when she , undernourished herself , has her second child ?
Children are having children .
Over 500,000 girls and women die during pregnancy or childbirth every year .
They ca n’t buy condoms at the corner deli , and they do n’t get free birth control pills from the university health center .
If abortion is a necessary option for women in this country , where many ( but not all ) of us enjoy good , low - cost access to contraception , do n’t you think that it might come up in places where a ) contraceptive access is very poor and b ) many local aid organizations are religiously - affiliated and DO NOT PROVIDE contraception to the women whose bodies or lives cannot support a pregnancy ( or to communities where one in five people has HIV ) .
These religious aid groups , and people like Mosher , believe that the women they ’re “ serving ” are meant to reproduce , even as they ca n’t feed the children they have , or themselves .
Their common argument is that people , like Clinton , who believe that women in poor , developing nations should have the same resources as women in prosperous nations are pushing abortion on women who do n’t want it .
International reproductive health workers are “ promoting ” abortion , brainwashing women , and undermining other countries ’ cultures .
Austin Ruse , president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute , claims that the big bad Americans ( Clinton , Obama ) are involved in a plot to “ [ get ]
Catholic countries to change their laws on abortion .
” Catholic countries ???
What about human beings ?
Countries do not have rights ; people do .
Do the women of these so - called Catholic countries want to be pregnant all the time ?
If they did , there would n’t be a United Nations Population Fund .
Doctors from the developed world would n’t abandon their lucrative practices in America and Europe to work for nothing in Africa and Asia .
The demand for reproductive health care is not fictional ; it is not created by the industrialized world .
It is real .
Ruse and Mosher have a concept of “ women ’s health ” that has nothing to do with women , or health , and everything to do with their own ideology .
It ’s selfish , cruel , and criminal .
They ’re free to pontificate elsewhere , but their arrogance has no place in international aid .
If all else fails , at least we can dance .
SPOCK GOT GAME
POR VIDA , HOLMES
OK , Star Trek Online is out on February 2 - - a little under two weeks .
Much like it did with Champions Online Cryptic is charging the industry standard $ 14.99 per month .
But there are other options .
If you go for three - month blocks of time , it 's $ 41.97 , or $ 13.99 per month .
Stepping up to six months gets you in at $ 12.99 per month .
All of that is run -of - the - mill pricing stuff .
Of course , you still have to buy the actual game , which is $ 50 ... unless you want the collector 's edition , which gives you some extra doodads for a total price of $ 60 for a downloadable version and $ 80 for a physical copy , which comes with a fake communicator and some concept art .
Again , nothing out of the ordinary here .
It 's the two other payment options that are throwing me for a loop .
These are limited time deals that are only available until February 1 ... you know , the daythe game actually comes out ?
If you opt for these , you can lock yourself in at a yearly rate of $ 119.99 ( that 's just under ten bucks a month ) or you can just do away with all of this monthly fee crap and give Cryptic $ 239.99 for a lifetime subscription .
Keep in mind that 's the lifetime of the game , the lifetime of the player .
Now , until I saw the lifetime subscription package , I had almost no intent of even playing Star Trek Online past the end of the open beta .
The beta seems fun enough .
The systems feel reasonably well - conceived , I guess .
But I have n't really played enough of it to figure out if the game is actually any good or not .
That 's what makes these additional offers so tricky ... you have to pay up front for a game that might not be all that great .
Heck , it might not even reach or maintain the subscription numbers it needs to survive , if you want to get technical about all this .
But that 's probably a misplaced worry ... surely something with the Star Trek name attached to it will at least attract an audience for the first year or so .
From there , it 'll all depend on how much support the game gets .
At this point , I 'm essentially trying to talk myself out of dropping $ 300 on an MMO .
But the notion of paying once for a game that normally has a monthly fee associated with it is incredibly appealing .
What if the game 's a hit ?
What if the late - game stuff is amazing ?
What if my latent Star Trek nerddom takes over and I get fully hooked on it ?
Regardless of all that , I have to make my decision before the game is even officially available .
Sneaky .
Very sneaky .
At this point , if I 'm going to play it at all , I 'm going to get a lifetime subscription .
The other option , paying a monthly fee , would feel like an endless ripoff with what I know now .
In the back of my mind I 'd always know that , for the price of 16 regular months , I could have eliminated the fee thing entirely .
It also removes some of the pressure of actually playing an MMO .
Half the time , I played World of Warcraft out of guilt , just because I knew the meter was running .
There 's something weirdly liberating about eliminating the regular fee .
Christ , this is starting to sound like an informercial .
Maybe that 's the worst part about all this .
It 's a very salesy sort of thing .
By forcing players to make a decision based on time in a decidedly shaky open beta , players are asked to place a certain amount of faith in the game 's developers when making this decision .
I guess City of Heroes was / is well - supported .
Seems like Champions Online has seen some meaningful updates since its launch .
Surely a big licensed thing like Star Trek Online would at least get that level of support , if not an additional layer to keep the license holders happy , right ?
Fine .
OK .
I 've talked myself into it .
I like Star Trek .
So I am going to buy Star Trek Online .
End of story .
This , people , is why they still make licensed games .
Because occasionally someone will get suckered in without paying any attention to the quality of the actual game .
Now I just need to decide which pre-order bonus I want ... Steam .
Done .
I do n't need a concept art book or little communicator badge that 'll just sit in its box forever .
$ 300 .
God , it 's like I just bought a whole new console or something .
Dear Star Trek Online , Please be good .
XOXO , Jeff
" For those looking to experiment with a Gentoo - based Linux system but are not looking forward to the obstacles of installing Gentoo itself , an easier and quicker approach can be to use a distribution like Sabayon Linux .
Sabayon uses pre-compiled x86 and x86_64 packages for installing the Linux distribution from its LiveDVD and uses their own Entropy system for package management , though these binary packages are compiled from Gentoo 's Portage and using the Portage system is still available .
The LiveDVD installer is also very easy to use and is just like using Ubuntu 's Ubiquity or Red Hat 's Anaconda .
With all the benchmarking though of Ubuntu and Fedora as of late on Phoronix , we found it time to put out some benchmarks of Sabayon Linux .
Up today are benchmarks from the recently released Sabayon 5.1 along with the older Sabayon 4.2 and for comparison is Kubuntu 9.10 .
" Sabayon 5.1 was released in mid-December and for our testing we used the 64 - bit LiveDVD with the KDE desktop .
Sabayon 5.1 is running with the Linux 2.6.31 kernel , KDE 4.3.4 , X Server 1.6.5 , and GCC 4.4.1 .
The prominent packages for Sabayon 4.2 include the Linux 2.6.29 kernel , KDE 4.2.4 , X Server 1.5.3 , and GCC 4.3.2 .
Kubuntu 9.10 uses the Linux 2.6.31 kernel , KDE 4.3.2 , X Server 1.6.4 , and GCC 4.4.1 .
All three distributions use the EXT4 file - system by default .
" This quick round of benchmarking used World of Padman , OpenArena , 7 - Zip compression , Apache , PostgreSQL , LAME MP3 , FFmpeg , Gcrypt , John The Ripper , GraphicsMagick , C - Ray , MAFFT , PostMark , and the Bullet Physics Engine .
The Phoronix Test Suite powered all of these tests .
The hardware for this testing was a Lenovo ThinkPad T61 notebook with an Intel Core 2 Duo T9300 processor , 4GB of system memory , a 100 GB Hitachi HTS72201 SATA HDD , and a NVIDIA Quadro NVS 140 M graphics processor . "
Check out this video of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer autographing a MacBook Pro at Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville , Tenessee .
Say what you will about Ballmer ( he ’s crazy , a bad CEO ) , but he seems to have a good sense of humor about things .
Ballmer comically signed the MacBook Pro with a note stating , “ Need a new one ? ”
The student , for what its worth , promised Ballmer that the MacBook had a copy of Windows on it .
A Palestinian supporter of Hamas holds a picture of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh , a senior Hamas military commander , during his funeral at al - Yarmouk camp near Damascus January 29 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Khaled al - Hariri
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - New evidence incriminating Israel ’s spy agency in the assassination of a Hamas commander in Dubai includes credit card payments and phone calls made by suspects , an Arabic - language daily reported on Saturday .
Police have already said the 11 suspects used forged passports in the names of innocent individuals of several European nationalities .
“ Dubai police have information confirming that the suspects purchased travel tickets from companies in other countries with credit cards carrying the same names we have publicized ( in the passports ) , ” Al Bayan daily on Saturday quoted Dubai police chief Dahi Khalfan Tamim as saying .
It did not give further details .
Palestinian Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was found dead in his room in a luxury Dubai hotel on January 20 , a day after arriving in the emirate .
Dubai police have released photographs of the 11 suspects .
The international criminal police organization Interpol said on Thursday it had issued “ red notices ” for their arrest in any of its 188 member countries .
Dubai ’s police chief said on Thursday he believed Israeli agents were responsible for killing al - Mabhouh , a senior member of the Islamist group which rules Gaza , and called for the Mossad spy agency ’s chief to be arrested if its responsibility was proved .
Britain offered on Friday new passports to six British citizens whose identities were used by the suspects and all of whom live in Israel , to protect them from inadvertent arrest through Interpol .
Other suspects identified by Dubai used cloned passports from Ireland , France and Germany .
Young C. Park , retired dentist of Honolulu , Hawaii , has satisfied a life long interest in model airplanes with his meticulous , incredibly detailed models of the Corsair and P - 51 Mustang .
Pictured below is Young Park 's Corsair .
Via the Internet Craftsmanship Museum ,
" The wings fold , the wheels and hook retract and the controls work .
This aircraft took about 6000 hours over a period of 5 years to build ...
Using tweezers , the controls can be moved .
All cables and linkages are in place to work the wing control surfaces as well .
Young Park has since carved a pilot 's face and hands from solid aluminum and built an articulated pilot to sit in the cockpit . "
Amazing work .

Afghan police have shot dead seven villagers near the Pakistani border after mistaking them for insurgents , police officials said .
The seven young men were collecting firewood after dark in the southern town of Spin Boldak , a common transit route for Taliban militants .
Six officers have been detained for questioning , the local commander said .
There is widespread anger over civilian deaths in Afghanistan .
More than 2,400 were killed in fighting last year .
UN figures show that more than 70 % were victims of Taliban attacks , but many Afghans say the deaths would not occur if foreign troops were not in the country .
President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly warned that civilian killings undermine support for his administration and the US - led military effort there .
The 2009 draft has come and gone .
Those who spoke excitedly of Tavares , Hedman and Duchene now whisper the names Seguin , Hall and Fowler .
With the Oilers only two points out of dead last it's hard not to join in , especially with Jonathan Willis having already started prepping us for the big day ( and do n't forget part two ) .
Nonetheless , I thought it might be interesting to look back on the 2009 draft that was .
One of my favourite tools in evaluating prospects is Gabriel Desjardins ' NHL equivalencies , though personally I think it 's a lot more relevant for forwards than it is for defenders ( and goalies ! ) .
The basic premise is that we can expect each player to bring a portion of his offence with him from the league he 's currently playing in to the NHL .
After the jump I 'll explain a bit more fully and look at what each of the forwards drafted in June of 2009 has done so far this season .
The numbers I 've used for equivalencies come from two main sources and , to be perfectly honest , I 'm not completely sure if this is the most up - to - date information .
If you ( my dear reader ) happen to know of more current numbers , please let me know and I 'd be happy to run the numbers again .
At any rate , each league has a different equivalency number .
What I 've done below is taken each player 's goals , assists and points , converted them to a " per game " rate , multiplied them by the league equivalency number , and then expressed them as an " NHL equivalency " assuming an 82 - game season .
I 've used this article for the translations from the NHL , KHL ( multiply offence by 0.83 ) , SEL ( 0.78 ) , FNL ( 0.54 ) , AHL ( 0.44 ) , NCAA ( 0.41 ) , WHL ( 0.30 ) , OHL ( 0.30 ) and QMJHL ( 0.28 ) .
I 've used this article for the translations from the USHL ( 0.27 ) , AJHL ( 0.16 ) and BCHL ( 0.14 ) .
Before I go ahead and put up the chart some brief explanation is needed .
Firstly , not all of the players drafted in 2009 were the same age .
Several players had already passed through the draft at least once ( and sometimes twice ) .
All of these older players are included in the chart but are marked in yellow .
Injured players are at the bottom of the chart marked in red , along with Brad Peltz in gray .
Peltz is a special case since the Senators have left him to play Canadian high school hockey for another season and it's possible that he was only drafted because his father is a billionaire .
Finally , the " Draft Number " column is not the player 's actual draft position but the player 's position among forwards .
So , for example Magnus Paajarvi - Svensson was drafted by the Edmonton Oilers 10th overall but was the 7th forward to be drafted .
As such , his " Draft Number " in the chart is " 7 . "
I broke the chart into three portions so it would be easier to read , but you can still click on it to enlarge .
A couple of things stand out to me on this chart .
The first is that no overage players were taken in the first forty forwards and only two of the top sixty forwards taken were overagers .
And some of these players are certainly legitimate prospects .
It makes me wonder if it would n't be a good strategy to take the top overager on your list in the third round .
It looks to me like doing so would give you a very good chance at getting a top - thirty offensive player in the draft .
As for the two overagers near the top of the list , Marcus Kruger 's big season in 2009 - 10 is somewhat surprising .
Kruger 's 2008 - 09 was his 19 year - old season and taking that year to compare him with the rest of the list would leaves him in the bottom half ( 17.1 NHLE points ) .
He 's clearly taken a huge step forward but there 's a very good chance many of the guys behind him now will pass him by next season .
Brandon Kozun , on the other hand , had a very good season in 2008 - 09 .
Kozun 's 2008 - 09 NHLE of 36.9 points would leave him in a tie for 7th on this list .
He 's taken a small step forward again this season and should clearly be looked at as a legitimate prospect going forward despite his small stature .
So far , Brandon Kozun is looking like a good draft steal by Los Angeles Kings .
Brandon Pirri ( Chicago ) and Taylor Beck ( Nashville ) also look good by the numbers .
The Washington Capitals are probably very excited with all four of their players beating their draft number and three players cracking the top forty forwards despite only selecting once in the top forty .
The Colorado Avalanche must also be very pleased with the two forwards they selected .
On the other hand , Chris Kreider is way off the pace of any other first round forward ( apparently Hugh Jessiman did n't teach the Rangers a thing about trusting US high school hockey ) .
At the team level , the Florida Panthers do n't seem to have had a very good day ( aside : if you 're an Oiler fan , no matter how bad things are now , look at the Panthers over the last decade before you say they could n't get worse )
Four men on this list are already playing in the NHL and of those four , three seem to be doing fine .
The one exception is Evander Kane who seems to be struggling mightily at the NHL level relative to the other forwards taken in the top ten .
Even without taking the salary cap implications into consideration , it seems like it was a bad idea to keep him in Atlanta .
Once those are factored in , the decision is just plain awful .
The Edmonton Oilers prospects are tracking quite well .
Magnus Pajaarvi -Svensson is doing very well offensively which is exactly what the Oilers will need out of a top ten pick .
Toni Rajala is beating his draft number so far .
He does n't look like an impact player offensively which is too bad since he's the kind of player that will likely need to be impactful offensively to have an NHL career .
Anton Lander is the exact opposite situation .
His offensive numbers are not covering his draft number but he seems to have the kind of skill set that may get him to the NHL anyway .
There 's also a possibility that the SEL is better than it 's being given credit for .
Other than Svensson and Marcus Johansson , all of the Swedes taken in the first two rounds have taken a hit .
Which should only make Oiler fans that much more excited about Magnus .
Finally , Cameron Abney was n't drafted for his offence but that was just a terrible draft pick ( given the state of the Oilers , I thought that I should end on a sour note ) .
This morning the Census Bureau has released the " Quarterly Starts and Completions by Purpose and Design " report for Q4 2009 .
Monthly housing starts ( even single family starts ) cannot be compared directly to new home sales , because the monthly housing starts report from the Census Bureau includes apartments , owner built units and condos that are not included in the new home sales report .
However it is possible to compare " Single Family Starts , Built for Sale " to New Home sales on a quarterly basis .
The quarterly report shows that there were 71,000 single family starts , built for sale , in Q4 2009 , and that is less than the 82,000 new homes sold for the same period .
This data is Not Seasonally Adjusted ( NSA ) .
This is the 9th consecutive quarter with homebuilders selling more homes than they start .
Note : new home sales are reported when contracts are signed , so it is appropriate to compare sales to starts ( as opposed to completions ) .
This is not perfect because homebuilders do build spec homes and many builders were stuck with some “ unintentional spec homes ” because of cancellations during the bust .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph provides a quarterly comparison of housing starts and new home sales .
In 2005 , and most of 2006 , starts ( blue ) were higher than sales ( red ) , and inventories of new homes increased .
For the last 9 quarters , starts have been below sales – and new home inventories have been falling .
The second graph shows the NSA quarterly starts intent for four categories since 1975 : single family built for sale , owner built ( includes contractor built for owner ) , starts built for rent , and condos built for sale .
Condo starts in Q4 were at an all time record low of 3,000 condos built for sale .
This breaks the record set in Q1 , Q2 and Q3 of 2009 of 5,000 condos per quarter .
The previous record was 8,000 set in Q1 1991 ( data started in 1975 ) .
Only 18,000 condos were started in 2009 , far below the previous low of 41,000 in 1991 .
Units built for rent set an all time record low in Q4 ( 19,000 units in Q4 2009 compared to the previous record low of 21,000 units in Q1 1993 ) .
With the vacancy rate at a record high , the demand for new rental units will stay low for some time .
Owner built units are above the record low set in Q1 2009 ( 31,000 units compared to 24,000 units in Q1 2009 ) , however the pickup in owner built starts was probably mostly seasonal ( this is NSA data ) .
And the largest category - starts of single family units , built for sale - was very low at 71,000 units in Q4 .
With starts so low in every category , the number of units added to the housing stock in 2010 will be at a record low - and that will help reduce the significant excess inventory of housing units .
From the Commonwealth Foundation press release
The release of embarrassingly candid emails from the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia has intensified , if not vindicated , suspicions that scientific misconduct has played a significant role in fueling alarmism over supposed catastrophic manmade global warming .
Just days after news broke about what has been dubbed “ Climategate , ” Penn State University ( PSU ) announced that it would investigate the conduct of Michael Mann , a professor in PSU ’s Department of Meteorology and a prominent figure in the Climategate emails .
While PSU is to be commended for recognizing that Climategate is a serious matter and that an investigation into Michael Mann ’s conduct is warranted , the investigation constitutes a conflict of interest for the university .
Mann ’s climate work brings enough visibility , prestige , and revenue to PSU to legitimately call into question the university ’s ability to do a thorough and unbiased investigation .
To avoid this glaring conflict of interest and ensure that the investigation of Mann is credible , the Pennsylvania General Assembly should commission an external and independent investigation into Mann ’s potential scientific misconduct .
To download the full PDF version , please click here
Paul Chesser writes at the American Thinker :
The Commonwealth Foundation in Harrisburg , Pa. does not trust Pennsylvania State University to investigate Climategate hockey sticker Michael Mann , because of the millions of dollars that his research brings to the university .
The foundation today released a 12 - page policy brief which addresses Mann ’s Climategate emails , the significance of his role , and why the university has a conflict of interest in investigating him .
Commonwealth held a press conference today at the state capitol about their report :
The hockey stick controversy and Climategate emails reveal that Michael Mann may have committed significant and intentional scientific misconduct , including improper data manipulation , inappropriately shielding research methods and results from others , and engaging in a number of forms of retaliation against those who publicly challenge his research results .
Were scientific misconduct a criminal matter , the aforementioned facts might be said to constitute “ probable cause ” for a search warrant .
Analogously , these facts provide probable cause for an investigation into Mann ’s conduct at PSU .
Although PSU has announced that it will investigate Climategate , given Mann ’s financial and reputational value to the university , and the likely embarrassment resulting from an adverse finding concerning his conduct , there is good reason to believe that a PSU - managed investigation might amount to little more than a whitewash .
Commonwealth Foundation goes on to recommend that the state General Assembly commission an external , independent investigation .
Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee Chairman Jeffrey Piccola has already promised Penn State that if its investigation is a whitewash , he will do one that is n’t .

For the gay marriage debate , 2009 was transitional instead of transformative , but the year was historic nonetheless .
To mangle Churchill , it was not the end , nor even the beginning of the end , but it was at least the beginning of the middle .
This is an issue on which the fundamentals of public opinion change glacially .
Support for same - sex marriage is rising , but only by about a percentage point or so a year .
Essentially , a third of the public supports gay marriage , another third or so supports civil unions instead , and the remaining third opposes any kind of legal status for same - sex couples .
Although public - opinion fundamentals did n’t change in 2009 ; the politics of gay marriage did .
Here are the ways the year marked a shift to what a storyteller might call the “ long middle . ”
The preemptive strikes on both sides have failed .
Early on , conservatives feared that courts would impose same - sex marriage nationally by fiat .
They responded with an attempt to ban gay marriage nationally by constitutional amendment .
But the federal courts kept their distance , and the amendment was rebuffed .
Advertisement
As the year ends , it is clear that neither side can knock the other off the field .
Gay marriage is firmly established in five states ( with the District of Columbia ’s likely to follow suit ) , but it is banned , often by constitutional amendment , in most of the others .
Unless the Supreme Court shocks the country and itself by declaring gay marriage a constitutional right , the issue will take years , perhaps decades , to resolve .
All - or - nothing activists will be disappointed , but the country will get the time it needs to make up its mind .
Legislators are taking over from judges .
For years , the only way same - sex marriage seemed possible was by court order .
But with state venues for pro-gay - marriage lawsuits having just about dried up , the fight has moved from the lower courts to the political branches , much as the civil rights struggle did in the 1960s .
Now , as then , legislative victories afford the movement more momentum and popular legitimacy than judicial ones ever could .
Opponents were fond of arguing that the gay - marriage movement was not just wrongheaded but antidemocratic .
But in 2009 , gay marriage was passed by the legislatures and signed into law in Maine and New Hampshire , and it was enacted by a veto - overriding majority in Vermont .
Nothing undemocratic about that .
Same - sex marriage has been mainstreamed .
In its first decade or so on the national stage , gay marriage was a fringe idea , the property of the political far left .
No longer .
Gay marriage may still be losing at the ballot box , but in Maine in 2009 , as in California in 2008 , the margins have grown tight .
With its establishment last spring in Iowa , same - sex marriage has penetrated the heartland , by court order but with little backlash .
Many Democrats have come to see support for gay unions as a political plus .
Increasingly , it is the opponents who are playing cultural defense , insisting that they are the ones who are being marginalized and stigmatized .
Advertisement
There ’s a backlash against the backlash .
The most important trend of 2009 began Nov. 4 , 2008 , when California voters passed Proposition 8 , revoking gay marriage in their state .
Until then , the preponderance of passion lay with opponents .
After Prop. 8 , however , many heterosexuals embraced gay marriage , taking ownership of an issue that they have come to view as the next great civil rights battle .
For same - sex marriage advocates , the emergence of a dedicated core of straight supporters is a sea change .
There is now comparable energy and commitment on both sides .
It was just such passion , indeed , that led two of the country ’s most distinguished lawyers -- Theodore Olson , a Republican , and David Boies , a Democrat -- to join hands across party lines in 2009 and file a lawsuit asking the federal courts to overturn California ’s Proposition 8 .
The case is a long shot legally , but the fact that it has attracted such solidly mainstream legal talent is one more sign that the same - sex marriage issue has come of age .
Jonathan Rauch , a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution , is the author of “ Gay Marriage : Why It Is Good for Gays , Good for Straights , and Good for America . ”

With a war chest of $ 23 billion in cash , along with increasing competition by Google , Apple looks to continue its recent trend of acquisitions in the new year .
While Apple has acquired only 11 small companies since the return of Steve Jobs in 1997 , three of those have been in the past five months , indicating an increased emphasis by the company on acquisitions .
By comparison , Google has acquired 11 companies in the last 18 months .
According to BusinessWeek , Apple has begun to use its large stores of cash to help it acquire small , innovate startups that will help broaden its position in the rapidly changing technology market .
" There are obvious strategic reasons Apple might want to become more acquisitive .
The company is moving beyond its traditional base in personal computers and charging into smartphones and mobile computing .
As mobile computing takes shape , Apple , Google , Nokia , and other traditional tech titans have become more active in searching for startups that can help them with the new terrain .
In Apple 's case , it has a war chest of $ 23 billion in cash and short - term securities to pursue acquisitions , " writes BusinessWeek .
In the past , Apple reportedly had no organized merger and acquisition strategy , instead executives would bring potential deals directly to Jobs , who had final say .
According to BusinessWeek Apple's " ad - hoc " approach to acquisitions is what cost the company a potential deal with mobile advertising firm AdMob .
Instead the company was acquired by Google .
Last year , Apple hired Adrian Perica , a specialist in mergers and acquisitions .
He is reportedly the first specialist of this type at Apple .
In the wake of Apple 's lost bid for AdMob last year , Perica was brought in to make sure that Apple did not make the same mistake again .

A Facebook group for lovers of cured cucumbers has gained more fans the knuckle - dragging Canadian crew .
It 's like Rage Against the Machine and Joe McElderry all over again
Canadian band Nickelback , the gravelly paragon of what 's known as " modern rock " , are in a Facebook popularity contest with a deli delicacy .
And they 're losing .
At the time of writing , 1,420,995 lanky - haired rock fans have declared their love for Nickelback by subscribing to the band 's official Facebook page .
Meanwhile , a coalition of 1,471,001 Nickelback haters ( and lovers of cured cucumbers ) have joined a group called , " Can this pickle get more fans than Nickleback [ sic ] ? "
And they are ahead by about 50,000 .
" WE DID IT ! " exclaimed Coral Anne , the pickle campaign 's chief organiser , earlier this week .
" Salute the almighty pickle ! " Coral Anne , who is also a fan of Nine Inch Nails , Salvador Dali and " meowing back at a cat when it meows at you " , launched the page less than a month ago .
Forced by Facebook 's policies to misspell Nickelback 's name in the group description , Coral Anne 's project was inspired by a different , less successful initiative – to find Facebook users who preferred onion rings to pop-singer Justin Bieber .
" This is all strictly intended for humour , " Coral Anne explained .
" I am not using this page to endorse any hate toward the band Nickelback ... I do not wish Nickelback , or any other bands , any ill will and hope they would see the same humour in making this page as I have . "
While Nickelback have yet to issue an official response , frontman Chad Kroeger has reportedly sent a terse notice to the pickle - backers .
According to a screenshot posted by the Daily Swarm , Kroeger wrote : " Your page will be closing in two weeks . "
Coral Anne 's triumphant response ?
" I still whooped your ass , Chad ! :) "
Nickelback have sold more than 30 m albums to date .
Their last LP , 2008 's Dark Horse , reached No 4 in the UK charts .
Pickles are enjoyed by many cultures around the world .
In this non -stop hilarious ride we follow a struggling Movie Studio that is willing to do anything to make a buck even if it means ruining its reputation , and running the Movie Industry into the ground .

BA says the plant will reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill British Airways has struck a deal to build the first plant in Europe to produce jet fuel from waste matter .
Some 500,000 tonnes of waste will be used by the UK facility each year to produce 16 million gallons of fuel .
Construction of the plant in east London will start within two years .
It is set to produce fuel from 2014 , creating up to 1,200 jobs .
BA said the plant would produce twice the amount of fuel needed to power all its flights from London City Airport .
It would only account for about 2 % of flights from Heathrow , however .
Greenhouse gas BA argues the plant will cut the amount of waste that is sent to landfill , reducing the amount of methane that is produced .
Methane is thought to be a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
The plant will be built by a US company Solena Group , with BA committing to buy all of its output .
It will be another four years before it starts producing fuel , and it is unlikely to work at full capacity straight away .
The ideal source material for the plant is waste matter that has a high carbon content .
Biofuel creation
The waste is fed into a high temperature " gasifier " to produce BioSynGas .
A chemical process called Fischer Tropsch is then used to convert the gas into biofuel .
Waste products from the process can be used to power the plant as well as supply 20 MW of electricity to the national grid .
A solid waste product can be used as an aggregate in construction .
The fuel produced by the plant is certified for use in other countries , but not currently in the UK .
BA says it is confident of getting the certification by the time the plant starts producing fuel , either for use in a blend with traditional kerosene or on its own .

Hardware hacker Christopher Tarnovsky just wanted to break Microsoft 's grip on peripherals for its Xbox 360 game console .
In the process , he cracked one of the most heavily fortified chips ever put into a consumer device .
The attack by the former US Army computer - security specialist is notable because it goes where no hacker has gone before : into the widely used Infineon SLE 66 PE , a microcontroller that carries the TPM , or Trusted Platform Module designation of security .
The hack means he can access sensitive data and algorithms locked away in the chip 's digital vault and even make counterfeit clones that could fool the many devices that rely on it .
" I can get inside this chip without killing it and I can get through all the security countermeasures it has in place , physical and in software , " Tarnovsky , who is principal engineer for Flylogic , told The Register in an interview that covered many of the behind - the - scenes elements of the hack .
Its genesis came when Tarnovsky learned that manufacturers of video game controllers had to obtain a license from Microsoft for the peripherals to work on the Xbox 360 .
The requirement offended his sense of fair play , so he put his reverse engineering muscle to breaking it .
" I was very surprised they would put a security chip in a wired controller , as well as a wireless controller , " he said .
" It 's very monopolistic what they 've done .
They have a right to do it , but I have a right to break it too . "
After dissecting a controller , he found that the chip that allowed it to communicate with the Xbox was made by Infineon .
He eventually purchased dozens of related microcontrollers on the Hong Kong surplus market for 15 cents apiece .
He then employed an electron microscope called a focused ion beam workstation ( price tag $ 250,000 used ) that allowed him to view the chip in the nanometer scale so he could manipulate its individual wires using microscopic needles .
It took Tarnovsky four months to develop techniques for probing the chip and another two months to apply them to breaking the 66PE .
What he found was a chip that was locked down with multiple levels of defenses .
Optical sensors , for instance , were designed to detect ambient light from luminous sources .
And a wire mesh that covered the microcontroller was aimed at disabling the chip should any of its electrical circuits be disturbed .
" One wrong move and I vaporize a track on the chip , " Tarnovsky said .
Indeed , some 50 of the chips were vaporized in the course of the hack .
But over time , he learned how to use the needles to penetrate the chip 's inner recesses so he could tap sensitive data that remains unencrypted so it can be processed .
Using the tungsten as microscopic bridges , Tarnovsky said , he can digitally clone chips used to prevent piracy of satellite TV service , to disable unauthorized cartridges in printers - or to make Xbox game controllers .
" You could counterfeit this chip , " he said , although he stressed he had no plans to use the hack for illegal purposes .
In a statement sent to Infineon customers last week , the company noted the time and expense required for Tarnovsky to crack the chip .
But the company went on to say it was a sign of attacks to come and said engineers were already working on a more secure successor to the 66PE .
" In contrast to conventional solutions , the SLE 78 family now utilizes encryption even in the CPU itself , leaving no plaintext for the attacker , " the release stated .
" Technical advances of that scale are only possible if the CPU itself is designed ' from the scratch ' by the hardware manufacturer with security in mind , right from the beginning . "
The physical attack on the 66 PE is similar to hacks cryptographers have recently waged on proprietary encryption algorithms in cordless phones and the world 's most popular smartcard .
In all of them , the secret formula was lifted after sanding down the chips ' silicon and examining its circuitry using an electron or optical microscope .
" More and more things are moving to hardware , and as things move to hardware , people are analyzing these devices and getting the algorithms out and putting them back in the software , " Tarnovsky said .
While the risks of physical attacks are in many cases inevitable , he said the cracking of the 66 PE was aided by its abundant supply on international surplus markets , which is something Infineon may want to consider as it readies its new generation of ultra-secure microcontrollers .
" If this is supposed to be such a secure device and it's common - criteria certified , why are they available on the used surplus market ? " he said .
" This device should not have been readily available for a researcher like me . " ®
There were some positive signs in today 's jobs report -- and they were n't just some definitional b.s. pumped out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Calculated Risk explains :
A common question is : how could there be fewer payroll jobs , but the unemployment rate declined ?
This is because the data comes from two separate surveys .
The unemployment Rate comes from the Current Population Survey ( CPS : commonly called the household survey ) , a monthly survey of about 60,000 households .
The jobs number comes from Current Employment Statistics ( CES : payroll survey ) , a sample of approximately 400,000 business establishments nationwide .
The establishment survey showed a loss of 20,000 payroll jobs in January , but the household survey showed an increase in the employment level of 541,000 .
The number to use for jobs is the establishment survey , but the unemployment number is based on the household survey and the surveys can diverge over the short period , but over time this will work out ( for more on the differences , see : Jobs and the Unemployment Rate ) .

Exports in training
IN SHARP contrast to the usual smooth collaboration between political and business interests in Hong Kong , thousands of protesters are expected to surround the territory 's legislative council on January 15th .
They are hoping to deter the councillors from approving funding for the final 16 miles ( 26 km ) of one of the world 's most ambitious infrastructure projects , a high - speed rail network linking one end of China to another .
They think it is too expensive , will involve the forced purchase of too much private property and will demolish too much of the territory 's heritage .
The same may be true of the rest of the epic project to expand China 's rail network by nearly 19,000 miles by 2015 , 8,000 of which will be tracks for high - speed trains .
But the media , at any rate , portray it as a point of national pride and as a huge stimulus to the economy and employment .
While Hong Kong grumbles , nothing is allowed to impede this $ 750 billion civil - engineering juggernaut on the mainland .
Indeed , last year it accelerated and , according to Jiong Shao , an analyst with Nomura Securities , the high - speed portion of this network should be finished by 2012 , three years early .
Urban metro lines will also expand dramatically from 620 miles to 2,800 over the next ten years , as the number of cities boasting such systems doubles from 11 to at least 22 .
The expectation is that China 's high - speed rail network will perform the same function as the building of the railways in 19th - century America and President Eisenhower 's great national highways project in the 1950s .
The Chinese authorities hope that shrinking journey times will both spread economic development more evenly and bind together potentially fissiparous regions .
How it will be paid for is not entirely clear .
There are rumours that sections of the railway will begin to be sold in public flotations as early as this spring , though the government will retain large amounts of the associated debt .
Fares do not seem high enough to cover the costs of construction , but may yet prove too expensive for the masses .
For all its embrace of market economics in the last couple of decades , China 's great railway bonanza owes much to the old style of command and control .
The approach is “ build it and they will come ” .
The railway ministry in Beijing has dictated the plans , state - owned banks have provided the loans and a collection of companies owned by the central and provincial governments are responsible for making it all happen .
China Railway Engineering Corporation is the country 's biggest construction enterprise .
China Railway Construction Corporation is its second - biggest and its largest contractor .
Both firms used to be part of the People 's Liberation Army and still employ lots of former officers in their upper ranks .
But there is still money to be made , especially by the foreign firms that have provided the technology to allow China 's trains to overtake Japan 's bullet trains and France 's TGV .
Bombardier Sifang , a joint venture between Canadian and Chinese trainmakers , won a $ 4 billion contract in September to produce 80 trains capable of achieving nearly 240 mph with a new energy - efficient system for propulsion and control .
Siemens , a German engineering giant , is involved in a similar deal worth around $ 1 billion .
Kawasaki Heavy Industries , a Japanese trainmaker , is licensing a Chinese firm to build 140 of its trains for $ 6 billion .
Alstom , Hitachi and others have also secured business .
IBM , meanwhile , is setting up a unit in China with 400 employees to cater purely to the country 's appetite for software and services to manage its rail network efficiently .
What foreign companies working with the Chinese understand is that in order to win these contracts they must transfer know - how by the shovelful .
As a result , within a few years China may well have the most advanced railway industry in the world .
The firms that are gaining this expertise have their hands full for now meeting domestic orders , but they are open about their desire to export their new - found expertise .
If they are successful , China may earn returns on its investment abroad as well as at home .
The foreigners providing the equipment , however , may find that today 's returns have come at the expense of tomorrow's .

Ten of thousands of Afghan civilians are abandoning an area of central Helmland where UK and US forces are set to launch one of the biggest operations of the year .
The evacuation of most civilians from the town of Marjah and surrounding areas will give commanders greater leeway to use mortars - and - air - to ground missiles which have enraged Afghans in the past when responsible for civilian deaths .
US generals have unusually made no secret of their plan for a major onslaught against the town close to Helmand 's besieged provincial capital , Lashkar Gah .
Larry Nicholson , commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force which will spearhead the fight , has said he is " not looking for a fair fight " .
Marjah is regarded as a stronghold of both Taliban insurgents and drug trafficking networks which must be removed to " protect " the people who live there .
But so far the warnings have only had the effect of encouraging civilians to flee .
Abdul Salam , who has an extended family of 14 in the Marjah area , said his village looked almost deserted as most of its families had left for the cities of Lashkar Gah , Kandahar and Herat .
" They just picked up their jewellery and other small valuables and left everything behind , " he said .
However , some civilians had remained because they could not afford to leave .
" People know they cannot protect everything , and they are more concerned about saving their lives than their houses .
The people cannot protect their country from the infidels , so how can we protect our houses ? "
The counterinsurgency plan pushed by Stanley McChrystal , the US commander of all Nato forces in Afghanistan , aims not to alienate the population .
But a Marjah resident , an elder reached by phone , who was not prepared to give his name , said he had evacuated his family a week ago because he feared " the worst attack ever " .
" Always when they storm a village the foreign troops never care about civilian casualties at all .
And at the end of the day they report the deaths of women and children as the deaths of Taliban , " he said .
A spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force , as the Nato troops are known , said that the main reason for publicity for the operation was to encourage insurgents to leave , but if civilians were also encouraged to evacuate that would be " helpful " .
Most of the extra 30,000 US troops earmarked for the Afghan campaign will support Nato efforts in areas where the alliance has a presence , in a bid to keep insurgents out of villages .
The battle for Marjah will therefore be a relatively rare push into an area not yet cleared of insurgents .
It is regarded as particularly important because an estimated 100,000 people live in the area – a relatively dense population for a largely desert province dotted with rural communities .
Marjah is also on the south - western doorstep of Lashkar Gah , home to the headquarters of the British military and civilian efforts in the province .
The fraught security in Lashkar Gah was highlighted yesterday when a motorbike packed with explosives detonated close to a crowd gathered on the city outskirts to watch a dog fight ; it killed at least three people and injured at least 26 , including seven children .
Introduction
We are in a Simulated Augmented Reality
We are no longer located in the space time we once were but it appears that the planet has been teleported by Quantum Computer Technology by an alien race Details are available in a future document
There is a Pseudo light source which passes for the Sun and the Moon but it is not our Sun or Moon
We are not located in the same space and time that we were in 2008 Instead it appears that we are in an artificial greenhouse with in an astral field Various alien groups are playing Gods in this program and want the power of life and death over their victims
The perpetrators are brutal animals with various degrees of intelligence and some speak English
Their physical forms vary based for several reasons
There are Black Magic practitioners who create forms to frighten others but there are also aliens who appear to be in their original form
These vary but to date this writer has witnessed abusers in the form of insects , bees , flys , spiders , and even ancient dangerous reptiles like peradactyls and others [ This is important because the basic element to these alien weaponry is in the form of a claw ]
Some aliens have been identified as Orions – the females refer to themselves as the Hive who are female insects in the form of bees Interestingly many of these forms themselves can be taken apart by the procedure described below
Some of these alien aberrations might have been created from a military Darpa program gone awry named Mems [ Hybrid Insect Micro Elecro Mechanical System ] outside of their knowledge Other forms might be the results of a DNA research study bringing back prehistoric life
The prevailing agenda appears to be Antichrist which is simulating an Armageddon technologically
The book of Revelations prophesizes locusts [ Mems program ] in the book of revelations prophesizes locusts that men would want to die but could not [ Mind Uploading ] that there was an angel and a name apollya that there were half men and animal [ hybrid ]
They sometimes torture their victims who might even experience a death process and then they will try to ‘ fix ’ them or not after which the target is at their whim again until rescued
They also use this program for mind control purposes
These aliens are victimizing the public and others via Virtual Reality data gloves and nanotechnology
This nanotechnology expands and there are dangerous programs in our environment including our food and water supply
The aliens commonly place victim targets in video games both private and public on television stations and then hit them repeatedly in the face or head , hurt their faces with razor blades , blow them up and then laugh like they are school children
This can be corroborated by visiting my local library in San Carlos in the children ’s video room where violent games are played
To date the alien demons appear to be operating from a location which has a metaview similar to good maps on the internet I am located in San Diego , have traveled 200 North and East
The program is there as well
After identifying a target they capture them in a central location and divide their minds via a mind uploading procedure
Their ‘ body code ’ is obtained usually through sex via a lure this writer has named Jezebel
The aliens have a protocol for making weapons and torturing people via their data glove and the powers that they serve
The following are the components they use and information gained to date
The implements used consist of the following A data Glove keyboard and Computer , a device used to capture torture or mind control states if the perpetrator wants the victim to act in behavior they either cause or wait for the victim to make a behavior once or twice they put the victims behavior in the quantum field in the faucet device and under the keyboard the alien will then push a button and the victim will find themselves engaged in behavior even against their will
1 The Field – The field consists of objects and devices in an astral field which responds to imagination and visualization .
The aliens are abusers who take their victims apart so one will see body parts built into objects objects in this field is built upon the abuse of others
The field has taken the appearance of a web because there are spiders within it and other insects inhabiting it
The texture of the field is whatever the party wishes it to be This can be by the usage of the mind which skilled meditators can access or by adding a physical element such as water or material
The aliens are unprepared for natural substances to be in this field
The following objects are found within this field which this writer has learned to dismantle a Shoulder joints arms and hands
They are narrow strips of fabric aliens use to travel on and hoist objects b tripod is build into this form which expands and contracts
There is a small hand to the right middle of this object when released closes the triangular shape and makes a square ?
Aliens sometimes travel on a wheel on a track or they put this track into people d
There are cylindrical objects with coil , Hypodermic needles e Circular objects with arms and hands hanging from them f bouncing Helmets Containers razor blades
The entire community has been divided with razor blades in either claw form or in the form of a sickle
This is important because movement is constricted if these razor blades are not removed just move them to the side with ones hand
A There is a 2 inch form which has been folded and has ridges on it with hypodermic needles attached Victims might be found within the folds of this form A strategy needs to be developed about how to rid the field of these needles
B There are cylindrical devices with metal mesh in them the aliens will sometimes drop the metal in this object which causes energy forms to fall Look for these objects to dismantle
C There are concentric rings which the aliens use to ricochet themselves off of and move throughout the community
These circles can be found in the sky and underground
D On street corners and throughout the roadway one will find arms along with an elbow joint
There are also concentric forms which have 4 arms and hands hanging from them
This form is the base of most of the forms built here including nanotechnology
The release for this form is on either side of each hand between thumb and forefinger
On release the hands will withdraw leaving only the ring
The ring and a release on the side
E There are metal springs underneath objects which causes the field to move and objects to bounce
Make the metal disappear the field will also move because someone commonly inserts their foot into the center of a space and moves it
Each of these forms have specific shapes
The perpetrators can be found in book and , clothing .
But they require that the shape of the clothing or material objects conform to their premade shape
Components
The data glove , keyboard , and Computer -
Data Glove –
The design of the Data Glove is an alien design which is literally a claw / hand shape with razor blades in the knuckles which are placed longitundinaly
When facing the glove there is a small glove or hand found from left to right inside the main Data glove Inside the glove to the right is a field or a simulated reality which the aliens can place people inside of after capture
The data glove itself has several safety releases which dismantles the glove and moves the alien out
The release for the can be found in the space between the thumb and forefinger of the large glove and the small hand inside
Inside the glove to the left is a copy of the person they are targeting to the right is their physical code Some of these forms have interlocking claws facing each other in both directions north and south
This claw with a razor blade can be found in most designs of forms and programs
In the food supply and water this is dangerous
Keyboard
The alien keyboard appears tnormal at first sight
The aliens attach the victims by their heads underneath the button of the keyboard in some state of torment after the alien has entered a code
When deciding what abuse scenario they wish to repeat the aliens make three devices so that they can create a data glove entry , assign that abusive repetitive scenario to an alien and implement mind control
There is a large box which looks like it has speakers
To the bottom right there is a faucet looking knob which houses the victim in a torture position with the quantum state it occurred in along with surrounding objects
To release the victim take him or her physically out of the object and release them from the claw usually attached to the top of their head A vertical release switch is found behind the victim press it inward for a minute or so The box itself has a release switch to the top right press it down
Its important to release the victim before dismantling the box
The data glove which houses the alien who projects the torture scenario is found to the right of the box or hiding in a field going the opposite direction Presently they have wires at the top of their head along with two hands
The wires are for communication Disable the wire by cutting it in half
Important disable the entities with wire at the top by separating their hands and arms
8 Protocol for entering virtual reality ‘ data ’ ( behavior abuse or mind control ) into the environment
A claw or hand with or without a razor blade along the top
A series of three forms that allow a data hand and torture to be implemented
One of the forms to the left of the torture is a faucet type knob which holds the quantum field and event ithat the alien wants to use
There is one safety release on this form which allows the energy field and form to revert back to previous state
On the side of any device seen there
Is another release valve pull both of these forward until feeling the energy release
Victims can be found inside glove to the left ??
Ways they capture victim / targets
Someone is a wire head and hands outstretched puts on a glove with goop gel in it she then grabs the victim and captures in that substance and has a ready made device that holds their feet down and imprisoned
There is a claw at the end of this device release the claw and the legs free ?
Extricating from the substance is to be worked on
They have hypodermic needles everywhere serves dual purposes they inject their victims with agents drugs and the needles can imipr
To date perps have rules to follow they have 3 seconds to make the above three items or their times out
If the programs floats or an object does not land they are also timed out if a vacuum is caused by water or air they also time out whether that is due to their accessing computers illegally and the above causes an oversight agent to see or their computer is on automatic or they follow rules of some game is unclear
Wire at top two hands uncross them
The Victims
They usually keep their victims in a headlock configuration trapped by a razor blade
Technological possession
They can access human bodies from their program sight unseen I ’ve seen snakes insects and other animals enter people on all levels
One group of animals were staged under toilet facilities to enter peoples rectums
Asault by animals via this program
Battery pack femalesmcommunicaton wire foundhidding in forms
Disable wire which is for communication signal and access signal and uncross hands disable hands by pressing between thum and forefinger their ‘ battery pack ’ goes
Cameras –
They often operate by using television and other cameras even within homes to overlay abuse scenarios onto one level after which they will withdraw
Air or Water to damage quantum deviceor data glovestops them for a day so repairs can be done
l
A program to the left called the Apep program which consists of nanotechnology
In this program lies raor blades that are used to cordon off rooms
One room is for torture Another room is for sex to take placeOther rooms consist at the whim of the perpetrator a Victim is usually found within these rooms no matter how many times that program is made Every time a new automatic torture or mind control is to occur one will find these three forms at the left of the behavior
A keyboard under which lie victims and at which the alien types in a command
{ IF the alien wants others to have sex in certain positions he will make the position happen or watch while it naturally happens and then take the participants and place them in the faucet looking object if the alien wants sex in that position to occur anywhere he will simply push the button of the original setting and that form will commence that activity and to his or her surprise be in that position without the ability to stop it If the alien wants another behavior to occur or wants torture to occur when others ar engaged in behavior which has been entered in the data field torture will commence ]
A
Aa Data Hand
After the series of events has unfolded in which the alien decides what quantum event he wants to enter into the data base a data glove is formed with that event inside it as well the perpetrator then can create torture scenes as many times as he wants with that data glove The Victim is inside that glove
His or her mind and physical energy field has usually at that time been captured by the alien
Mind Uploading and Physical Energy
After a victim or co offenders mind is located and entered into the data base the physical energy will be as well Recently there was a Sex project in which the aliens duplicated an orgasm and then regardless of if the victim had sex life or not his or her sexual energy would be found by the usage of a lure who they wanted to have sex with usually after mind control
The lure is a simulated being who was created based on the looks of a famous female movie figure
This personality was given the victims esoteric body which was isolated coded and copied her physical energy and pieces of the victims genital anatomy
After the male sexual response was identified that respose would be placed into a data base
Anytime the alien male or female wanted to have sex the victims ‘ penis ’ ould be inflated At Times the male victims are hobbled and are not given movement of their legs but are shuttled from place to place on their penis
The Female Genital Canal
While witnessing the sexual response by a victim who was capable of avaginal orgasm viaaa “ G ” sthe perpetrator would put 0 probes into her vaginal canal to copy the energy or code the energy so that anyone with that probe would fill the same response
The vaginal tract in this program which was created by a Black entity who knows folks magic consists of the victims hairbrush hair energy copy of the victim in the hairbrush several energy probes a spider a spider web like interior at times masked by a thick substance which enhanced the experience
The spiders are in some cases manufactured in others cases they are real
They appear to be tarantulas
They have been staging themselves at grocery stores and then consuming their prey afterwards leaving whats left over and putting that into our food supply
The spider forms have been hidden after their rampage 16 months ago in the community
They are now present and hide their legs with electric cords arms legs and elsewhere they do not like water they are making a circle shape and then their legs are to the left of the circle ??
head to the top they are catching victims in eyes to date but check for legs thorax and elsewhere if possible
That victims mind can be duplicated from the original main entry or mind uploading
That means that the perpetrator can section of the mind or project their mind and body into duplicate copies and create torture settings in numerous locales with the victim suffering known or unbeknown by the original core self
The individual may experience themselves dying and then reawakening or not somewhere else if they retain consciousness
Settings found to date include dimensions in
Mirrors , Cars , lights , bowls , reflections , clothing , books , magazines , videos , underground , mountains , tv monitors in restaurant grocery stores , all stores Tableware from Kitchen glass plastic silver Money often place hot substance in middle which might be hot with needles , bags from grocery stores , cups , razor bladed with programs , bar codes in grocery stores , products , entrances in mats in grocery stores tracks people
Another finding what catches people on the ground sticky substance discovered release on left bottom and right to earth
The tracking device can be slowed by extending the form as it is doubled usually with a victim inside extend and it stops
, Plastic Bags
They take bar codes from anywhere and place a hot substance under it and Place Victims near it
Razor blades in field everywhere around every item in grocery stores including grains or contents of packages programs in food and water dangerous animals in nanotechnology which expand when the perp wants that may mean in the mouth or the stomach even in water supply they have a gel like substance in their programs that is in the water this substance after hardening can cause choking
Map of the Community the perpetrators operate either via a Master computer such as Google or Blue Brain that allows an overview of the community or the perpetrator might have jurisdiction over a locale or in my case the program is inserted in my inner eyelid
Allow for some alien reaction or changing design of form
Three forms are to the left of the quantum field
How the black compact device is made
A claw sideways over the top a show put in from left to right
Sinkholes can be turned sideways top of form are two claws perhaps symbolizing mr and mrs alien bad guys
Ready made gloves inside be cautious about what might be inside space between thumb and finger now Ifind a victiminside a sack of some kind
Skulls appear to be two claws and an arm with prong at top to trap victim
Claws over sky mountains are made out of them so far all components of shapes are combination of claw shape razor blade under razor blade at knuckles is a victims face perhaps a tentacle shape
Main release switch on side of form demanifests the entire form I believe not sure
Has to be taken down in the right order to be cautious about victim safety
Hereabouts of targets
Books in libraries
Television programs
Radio programs
The environment
In insects
In monitoring screens in Grocery stores and sport bars
In food , drink ,
In the roadway , under the roadway
In dimensions in tinted glass in cars sometime dragged or transported there via a room or a roaday and then through a wall I ’m seeing this routinely
The victims are thrown into passing cars along with a program
In TV satellite dishes Was told that aliens need a radio signal and have taken up the signals on normal
Radio which is why they started their antenna program perhaps
DEmanifest Communication
Pain management
Perps causes
Sucking action causes pain in the head neutralize by moving the perp or even causing a suction motion to remove perpetrator
Exorcism
Tongue take their tongues I have found both victims and upon removal the perp has said their evil was in their tongue and thanked me
Remove blackness from them lift it up or lighten it with the mind the perps have said they feel less evil
Remember specifc mental state –work with another to manage pain try to remember what that felt like when pain arises try to bring about that pain free state as best as possible
Latest manifestation snakes
Take apart forms
Remove memory of the form from the field requires making a clear emptying of that space
Avoid lines but make curves
They have said that their computer tracks angles and lines if I move or turn during an event they can’t capture it in the quantum field
Backtracking as in traveling in a line and then traveling back on tht same line confuses them
Minaturizing forms
Placing people on magnetic strips of black groc
Take apart appendages hanging from circular object ( they are arms and a hand ) but making two holes on either side of te h
Remove form from prescribed boundaries they need their blueprint to manitfest
Make square opening in forms with water or air that causes a vacuum in their program they need a day to recooperate that particular form
Toxic light in pseudosun and elsewhere take apart form and remove substance within
Wherabouts of perpetrators
Who are they
Public in San Diego aware or not aware
Discovered under keyboard when breaking it in two sideways were teeth of some kind connected to an arm ?
They said that meant afater the aliens got done torturing dinocroc was going to consume them
Each alien group who is in the lead abusing takes over the pseudosun today I found the mean orion andsanother male alien with King David who is a God the pseudosun was shut with claws and when I began hitting them they shut themselves inside and began sending out rings of vibrations
It needs t be disabled that ’s a priority just take the claws from the outside using above methods
Or cut them out g ently there may be lieflifeforms in there besides David

How to combat the alien demons and drive them from our Community so that we can live
Introduction
We are in a Simulated Augmented Reality
We are no longer located in space where we once were but it appears that the planet has been teleported by Quantum Computer Technology by an alien race
There is a Pseudo light source which passes for the Sun and the Moon
There are several alien groups who have used this situation to play games with Virtual Reality data gloves
They place victim targets in video games both private and public on television stations in books
Some call this Master of the Universe
They are mentally unstable although some groups are a mixed breed with some human and above in them so there is hope
To date the alien demons appear to operating from a location with has a metaview similar to Google maps on the internet
behave demonstrated that they are controlling our community via data glove and keyboard appear to be both operating from a source that has access to maps and the environment such as Google ( I was told aliens took over google which houses NASA ames years ago ) I believe they also stole technology from other aliens such as portable computers that they can operate form any location and from any state
They understand our community is in a simulated reality and the bizarre animals have taken advantage of technology to abuse and torture us
and the formula for repetive states of torture behaviors and mind control
They stole technology from another alien group that were able to have portable computers in quantum states
The alien reticulian Orion and Octopi have also abused Mind Uploading After identifying a target they capture them in a central location and then divide their minds
They then sometimes torture their victims who might even experience a death process and then they will try to ‘ fix ’ them or not after which the target is at their whim again until rescued
The following information is true for those the alien demon wishes to control
That might be coconspirators as well
have proven that they have a formula for creating weapons and torture devices
The implements used consist of the following
A data glove
A claw or hand with or w ithout a razor blade along the top
A series of three forms that causes a data hand and torture to be implemented
One of the forms to the left of the torture is a faucet type knob which holds the quantum field and event ithat the alien wants to use
There is one safety release on this form which allows the energy field and form to revert back to previous state
On the side of any device seen there
Is another release valve pull both of these forward until feeling the energy release
A program to the left called the Apep program which consists of nanotechnology

SEOUL — North Korea Saturday released an American missionary who it arrested after he entered the authoritarian country on Christmas day , aiming to publicize human - rights abuses there .
Robert Park , his eyes almost closed , made no comment as U.S. consular officials guided him to a transit area after his arrival in Beijing 's airport from North Korea .
U.S ....
Well , we 've got to hand it to Google — the company 's " do n't be evil " schtick has long worn thin and governments around the globe are already probing its potential monopoly power , but who else would come out swinging against the entire Chinese government and announce an end to its own collaboration in censorship , all while recognizing that it could lose access to the entire Chinese market ?
And do it in a blog post ?
This far but no further
The extraordinary announcement came this afternoon : Google has had it with China 's pervasive web of censorship and spying , and the company is done censoring its search results in China .
The decision was n't made in a vacuum , but rather came after years of increasing cyberattacks from the Chinese mainland .
A recent , massive infiltration attempt that targeted Google and 20 other tech companies was the final straw .
Though Google stops short of naming the Chinese government as the party behind the attacks , the implication is clear .
In mid-December , we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google .
However , it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident — albeit a significant one — was something quite different .
The attack hit major companies in the " Internet , finance , technology , media , and chemical sectors " as well .
Its goal was " accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists , " though it does not appear that anything more than subject lines were ever compromised .
If that 's not bad enough , Google also says it has acquired some intriguing evidence over the course of its investigation : " the accounts of dozens of U.S. - , China - and Europe - based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties .
These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google , but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users ' computers . "
We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn ...
The sheer scope of such attacks is staggering .
They show a coordinated effort to target specific human rights advocates not just in China but around the world , and to do so by attempting to infiltrate some of the world 's most advanced computer networks belonging to some of the world 's largest companies .
( A Microsoft spokesperson tells
Ars tonight , " We have no indication that any of our mail properties have been compromised . "
In response to some follow - up questions , we were told that the software giant would have no further comment . )
China has been well - known for going after the electronic communications of dissidents , and companies like Yahoo have in the past complied with Chinese government requests for e-mails .
Those demands , however distasteful , at least followed a rough legal process in China .
But Google 's account indicates that , if the Chinese government is in fact linked to these recent attacks , it is willing to adopt extra-legal hacking in order to keep up its surveillance — and to do so anywhere in the world that communications of interest might be stored .
Such a concerted program would be a marked escalation in the government 's willingness to interfere in the operations of Internet companies in order to promote " stability . "
Google has always claimed to be dissatisfied with the demands that it censor Chinese search results , but it has gone along with them since 2006 .
The argument has been that engagement with China , even in a censored fashion , was better than no access to tools like Google .
But the recent attacks have caused a change of heart in Mountain View .
" We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn , " announced Google 's Chief Legal Officer David Drummond today , " and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law , if at all .
We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn , and potentially our offices in China . "
That could be a big price to pay , given the size of China 's burgeoning market .
On the other hand , Google and other foreign search engines have had trouble gaining real traction in the local market and are regularly whipped by competitors like Baidu .
And the price for operating in China is already high ; the government has severe restrictions on ownership of businesses , which forces Internet companies into partnerships with local firms and subjects them to strict rules about censorship , pornography , and data retention .
A history of hacking ?
China certainly is n't the only country to engage in hacking abroad , and it 's certainly not the only country to employ powerful extra-legal surveillance of communications ( the US ' warrantless wiretapping comes to mind ) .
China has become quite good at it , however , triggering reactions from countries as diverse as India , the US , New Zealand , and South Korea .
A recent report on Chinese cyber - warfare activities , produced by US military contractor Northrop Grumman , ends with a graphic showing the number of international incidents related to alleged Chinese hacking in the last decade .
It 's quite a list .
Source : Northrup Grumman
As to goals , one of the biggest is ripping off research breakthroughs in order to save time .
The report notes that " Chinese industrial espionage is providing a source of new technology without the necessity of investing time or money to perform research ...
Chinese espionage in the United States , which now comprises the single greatest threat to US technology , according to US counterintelligence officials , is straining the US capacity to respond .
This illicit activity both from traditional techniques and computer - based activity are possibly contributing to China ’s military modernization and its acquisition of new technical capabilities . "
Did that approach extend to the attack on Google ?
It 's not clear what " intellectual property " was stolen by the attackers , but it went beyond just trolling for the e-mails of human rights advocates .
VeriSign 's iDefense unit has been looking at the attacks already .
In an e-mail sent to Ars tonight , the group concluded that " the attack is the work of actors operating on behalf of or in the direct employ of official intelligence entities of the People ’s Republic of China — and in many cases the attacks were successful . "
According to VeriSign 's count , more than 30 companies were affected , up from the 20 counted by Google .

His reply was quite humorous ( no , John , Riak wo n’t merge into MongoDB ) , but it got me thinking .
So here are my …
Last fall , I heard about Riak and thought it sounded awesome , and it boasts a lot of neat features that I ’ll go into detail about below .
I was further impressed when I met the Basho team at nosqleast in Atlanta .
They really seem to know what they ’re doing .
7 Reasons why Riak is the Merb of databases ( or better )
… and why it should be the database for your next Rails app .
Scales horizontally without pain
Riak runs just about in the same way on 1 node as it does 100 .
This is because , in short , it is an implementation of Amazon ’s Dynamo .
Need more storage capacity , throughput and availability ?
Add more nodes .
Now , a lot of people throw around the word “ scalability ” without really knowing what it means .
It ’s really a ratio of the desired properties of your system to the cost inherent in achieving those goals .
High scalability means you have a low cost in proportion to your ability to grow .
It has nothing to do with performance ( although good performance can be a side - effect of good scalability ) .
By this measure , actually , Rails scales well ( shared nothing ) — but that does n’t mean it ’s always performant ( slow Ruby implementations , large memory consumption , etc ) .
Despite the trolls , it ’s pretty well known that Twitter ’s scaling problems were not really caused by Rails .
So what makes Riak more capable of handling growth than MongoDB , CouchDB or MySQL ?
It ’s built with master - less replication in mind from the beginning .
When you grow a MongoDB or MySQL database , you typically add a slave server which receives and replays the transaction logs of the master server .
Ideally , this slave can take over if the master goes down .
There are also master - master setups and other ways of configuring replication , but in general it ’s a thing you add on , not built - in .
Instead , Riak has no notion of a master database node .
Every node participates equally in the cluster and spreads the load in a predictable way using consistent hashing ( another feature of Dynamo ) .
So yes , increasing capacity and throughput and all those other things you expect from your database is as easy as starting up new nodes and having them join the ring .
Data will be replicated in the background .
You can even run Riak nodes on less - powerful machines ( think EC2 ) and get decent results .
Large , monolithic DB servers are the last vestige of the mainframe era , so democratize your database layer !
HTTP - Compliant REST interface
Rails nerds like me love REST , but most do n’t really understand what it means , or rather think that it is a one - to - one mapping to CRUD .
Rails ’ concept of REST is at best incomplete and potentially misleading .
( See also Scott Raymond ’s RailsConf 2007 talk )
The Riak developers spent a lot of time creating an awesome toolkit in Erlang for building RFC - compliant HTTP resources , and Riak has several of them .
This means that when interacting with Riak , you use HTTP in a natural way and get predictable responses — even the hard stuff like content - negotiation , entity tags and conditional methods .
The side effect of composing Riak of well - behaved HTTP resources is that it plays very nicely with other HTTP - related infrastructure , including proxies , load balancers , caches , and clients of all stripes .
Robust failure recovery
One of Riak ’s most compelling features is that it handles node failure robustly .
If a node goes down in your cluster , its replicas will take over for it until it comes back , a feature known as hinted handoff .
If it does n’t come back — as happens all too often on EC2 — you can add a new node and the cluster will rebalance .
The failure recovery story for MySQL , even in a replicated scenario , is much more difficult , time - consuming , and costly .
Riak has fine - grained robustness as well .
It was built primarily in Erlang and with the OTP Design Principles in mind .
One aspect of the OTP design is that the processes in the system are organized in a supervision tree , so that when one crashes , it will be restarted by its supervisor process ( which is in turn supervised ) .
Send some bad data to the web interface and get a 500 error ?
That internal error does n’t crash the whole system , bringing your database node down .
Justin Sheehy , Basho ’s CTO , tells a story of a customer whose cluster had two nodes go down late one night .
The Basho team looked for less than 10 minutes at the cluster , verified that it was still going , and then decided to wait until the morning to fix the lost nodes .
As Joe Armstrong , Father of Erlang , says ( paraphrased ) , “ In order to have fault tolerance , you need more than one computer . ”
Riak embraces that philosophy .
Links make graph - like structures possible
Most Dynamo implementations are simple key - value stores .
While that ’s still pretty useful —
Dynomite is really awesome at storing large binary objects , for example — sometimes you need to find things without a priori knowledge of the key .
The first way that Riak deals with this is with link - walking .
Every datum stored in Riak can have one - way relationships to other data via the Link HTTP header .
In the canonical example , you know the key of a band that you have stored in the “ artists ” bucket ( Riak buckets are like database tables or S3 buckets ) .
If that artist is linked to its albums , which are in turn linked to the tracks on the albums , you can find all of the tracks produced in a single request .
As I ’ll describe in the next section , this is much less painful than a JOIN in SQL because each item is operated on independently , rather than a table at a time .
Here ’s what that query would look like :
GET /raw / artists / The Beatles / albums , _, _/tracks ,
_,
1
“ / raw ” is the top of the URL namespace , “ artists ” is the bucket , “ The Beatles ” is the source object key .
What follows are match specifications for which links to follow , in the form of bucket , tag , keep triples , where underscores match anything .
The third parameter , “ keep ” says to return results from that step , meaning that you can retrieve results from any step you want , in any combination .
I do n’t know about you , but to me that feels more natural than this :
SELECT tracks .*
FROM tracks INNER JOIN albums ON tracks.album_id = albums.id INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id WHERE artists.name = " The Beatles "
The caveat of links is that they are inherently unidirectional , but this can be overcome with little difficulty in your application .
Without referential integrity constraints in your SQL database ( which ActiveRecord has made painful in the past ) , you have no solid guarantee that your DELETE or UPDATE wo n’t cause a row to become orphaned , anyway .
We ’re kind of spoiled because ActiveRecord handles the linkage of associations automatically .
The place where the link - walking feature really shines is in self - referential and deep transitive relationships ( think has_many : through writ large ) .
Since you do n’t have to create a virtual table via a JOIN and alias different versions of the same table , you can easily do things like social network graphs ( friends - of - friends - of - friends ) , and data structures like trees and lists .
Powerful Map - Reduce and soon , Lucene search
The second way to find data stored in Riak is using Map - Reduce .
Unlike links , where you have to start with a known key , you can run map - reduce jobs over any number of keys or an entire bucket .
One thing that might not be immediately obvious when using an SQL database is that the declarative nature of the query language hides the imperative nature of performing the query .
SQL databases have sophisticated query planners that decompose your query into several steps ( see EXPLAIN command on MySQL ) and attempt to optimize the order of those steps based on known table properties , like indices , keys , and row counts .
Riak ’s map - reduce , while still largely declarative , lets you decide which order to run steps in .
You trade a little abstraction for a lot of power .
Riak ’s map - reduce is also quite different from CouchDB ’s views :
You ’re not trying to build an index which you ’ll query later , you ’re performing the query .
You can have any number and combination of map , reduce and link phases ( link is actually a special case of map ) .
Since it ’s not an index , your query need not be contiguous across the keyspace .
There ’s no concept of re-reduce because reduce phases are only run once .
Up until recently , you could only write map - reduce jobs in Erlang , but thanks to Kevin Smith ’s awesome work , you can now write jobs in Javascript and submit them over the HTTP interface .
This opens up a lot of doors to developers who are n’t familiar with Erlang but use Javascript every day .
Although not complete or released , Basho also has an awesome Lucene - compatible search system in the pipeline ( already in use at Collecta , or so I hear ) .
I saw it in action this past week while in Boston and was impressed .
It ’s fairly comparable in performance to Solr for large datasets , but scales across your Riak cluster .
Beyond schema-less : Content - type agnostic
One thing that may seem unintuitive at first is that Riak does n’t care what type of content you put in it .
CouchDB and MongoDB use JSON and BSON ( Binary JSON ) , respectively , to store objects .
Instead of forcing a format , Riak lets you store pretty much anything .
There ’s no concept of “ attachments ” or “ GridFS ” ( unless you add it yourself ) , so just store the file directly in a bucket / key with a PUT or POST request .
As long as you specify the “ Content - Type ” header , Riak will remember it and give you back the right thing when you access it the next time .
No need to do base 64 encoding to store a picture , PDF , Word document , podcast , or whatever .
This could enable you to replace a distributed filesystem like GFS , or even S3 , with a Riak cluster .
Bonus : you get replication and fail - over for no extra cost .
There are some minor kinks with large files ( > 100 MB ) , but I ’ve been assured by Basho that they are addressing the issue .
In the meantime , you could chunk the file manually and follow links to get the pieces and put them back together .
Tunable levels of consistency , durability , and performance
The knee - jerk argument against Dynamo - like data stores is that they do n’t have ACID properties and that “ eventual consistency ” is too eventual .
In practice , especially in large deployments and high throughput scenarios , ACID breaks down because it requires actions to be “ all or nothing ” , effectively creating bottlenecks while clients wait for transaction handles .
If you ’ve done any distributed or concurrent computing , you know that contention for shared resources is a primary cause of failure , including problems like deadlock , starvation and race conditions .
For the sake of reducing single points of failure ( bottlenecks ) , Riak implements eventual consistency — where storage operations are accepted immediately , and then propagated across the cluster in an asynchronous fashion .
This makes it nearly always available for writes and reads .
In order to deal with inconsistency , Riak tags each datum with a vector clock that internally reveals the datum ’s lineage ( who modified what version ) .
When there are conflicts — that is , two parallel versions of the same datum —
Riak returns you both versions so that your application can decide how to resolve it .
In an SQL database with this kind of conflict , your transaction might fail and rollback , forcing you to resolve it and retry anyway .
Beyond just eventual consistency , Riak lets you tune the amount of consistency , durability , and availability you want , even somewhat at request - time .
If you need more read availability and replication , you can increase the N value for a bucket ( number of replicas , default 3 ) .
If you want to be sure the data you ’re reading is consistent across the cluster , increase the R value at request time ( R , read quorum , is always <= N ) .
If you want high assurance that your data is stored , increase the W and DW values ( W = write quorum , DW = durable - write quorum , both always <= N ) .
If you want better performance , e.g. to use Riak as a persistent cache , keep the R , W , and DW values low .
You also have the choice of which backend to use when storing your data on the replicas ( anything from in - memory to on - disk , or combinations ) , including the recently released Innostore .
Although in many cases the defaults are good enough , you have the flexibility to choose a model that fits your application .
( Note : currently , the N value must be set before you insert any data into the bucket ) .
The microSD ware for January 2010 was not an incidental post .
It is actually snapshot of a much longer forensic investigation to find the ground truth behind some irregular Kingston memory cards .
It all started back in December of 2009 , when chumby was in the midst of production for the chumby One .
A call came in from the floor noting that SMT yield had dropped dramatically on one lot , so I drove over to the building to have a look ( this is the advantage of being in China during production — you can fix problems like this within the hour , before they become really serious issues ) .
After poking and prodding a bit , I realized that all the units failing had Kingston microSD cards from a particular lot code .
I had the factory pull the entire lot of microSD cards from the line and rework all the units that had these cards loaded .
Sure enough , after subtracting these cards from the line , yield was back to normal again .
Normally , the story would end there ; you ’d RMA the material , get an exchange for the lot , and move on .
Except there were a couple of problems .
First , Kingston would n’t take the cards back because we had programmed them .
Second , there was a lot of them — about a thousand all together , and chumby was already deeply back - ordered .
Also , memory cards are n’t cheap ; the spot price on this type of memory card is around $ 4 - 5 , so it ’s a few thousand dollars in scrap if we ca n’t get them exchanged … and neither chumby nor the CM is large enough to sneeze at a few kilobucks .
So I kicked into forensic mode .
The first thing that raised my suspicions is the external markings on the irregular Kingston cards .
On the left is a sample of the irregular card .
On the right is a sample of a normal card .
I ’ve put red arrows on the details that called the most attention to me at first .
The most blatantly strange issue is that the card on the left has its lot code silkscreened using the same stencil as the main logo .
Silkscreening a lot code on is n’t that unusual , but typically the silk does not share the same stencil as the logo , so you ’ll see some small variance in the coloration , font , or alignment of the lot code from the rest of the text .
In fact , across the entire batch of irregular cards , they shared the exact same lot code ( N0214-001.
A00LF ) ( typically the lot code will vary every couple hundred cards at least ) .
This is in contrast to the card on the right , which is laser - marked , and has a lot code that varied with every tray of 96 units .
The second strange issue , perhaps more subtle and perhaps not damning , is the irregularity in the “ D ” of the microSD logo .
Typically , brand name vendors like Kingston would be very picky about the accuracy of their logos .
The broken D is something found on SanDisk cards , but Kingston cards found in US retail almost universally use a solid D .
It turns out the weirdness in the external markings is just the start of it .
When we read out the electronic card ID data on the two cards ( available through / sys entries in linux ) , this is what we found :
First , the date code on the irregular card is uninitialized .
Dates are counted as the offset from 00/2000 in the CID field , so a value of 00/2000 means they did n’t bother to assign a date ( for what it ’s worth , in the year 2000 , 2GB microSD cards also did n’t exist ) .
Also , the serial number is very low — 0x960 is decimal 2,400 .
Other cards in the irregular batch also had similarly very low serial numbers , in the hundreds to thousands range .
The chance of me “ just happening ” to get the very first microSD cards out of a factory is pretty remote .
The serial number of the normal card , for example , is 0x9C62CAE6 , or decimal 2,623,720,166 — a much more feasible serial number for a popular product like a microSD card .
Very low serial numbers , like very low MAC ID addresses , are a hallmark of the “ ghost shift ” , i.e. the shift that happens very late at night when a rouge worker enters the factory and runs the production machine off the books .
Significantly , ghost shifts are often run using marginal material that would normally be disposed of but were intercepted on the way to the grinder .
As a result , the markings and characteristics of the material often look absolutely authentic , because the ghost material is a product of the same line as genuine material .
Furthermore , the manufacturer ’s ID is 0x41 ( ASCII ‘ A ’ ) , which I do n’t recognize ( supposedly the SD group assigns all the MIDs but I do n’t see a public list of them anywhere ) .
The OEMID is also 0x3432 , which is suspiciously ASCII ’ 42 ’ ( one more than the hex value for the manufacturer ID ) .
These hex / ascii confusions are possible signs that someone who did n’t appreciate the meaning of these fields was running a ghost shift making these cards .
Armed with this evidence , we confronted Kingston — both the distributor in China as well as the US sales rep .
First , we wanted to know if these were real cards , and second , if they were real cards , why were the serialization codes irregular ?
After some time , the Kingston guys came back to us and swore these cards were authentic , not fakes , but at least they reversed their position on not offering an exchange on the cards — they took back the programmed cards and exchanged them for new ones , no further questions asked .
However , they never answered as to why their card ID numbers were irregular .
While I know chumby is a small fry customer compared to the Nokias of the world , I think it ’s still important that they answer basic questions about their quality control process even to the small fry .
I had an issue once with an old version of a Quintic part being accidentally shipped to me , and once I could prove the issue to them , I received world - class customer service from Quintic , a full explanation , and an immediate and full exchange of the parts at their cost .
That was exemplary service , and I commend and strongly recommend Quintic for it .
Kingston , on the other hand , did not set an example to follow .
Normally , at this point , I would simply disqualify Kingston as a vendor , but I ’m more persistent than that .
It ’s disconcerting that a high - profile , established brand would stand behind such irregular components .
Who is to say SanDisk or Samsung would n’t do the same ?
Price erosion has been brutal on all the FLASH vendors , and as small fry I might be repeatedly taken advantage of as a sink for marginal material to improve the FLASH vendor ’s bottom lines .
Given the relatively high cost of these components , I needed to develop some simple guidelines for IQC ( incoming quality control ) inspection to accept or reject shipments from memory vendors , so I decided to do more digging to try and find ground truth .
The first thing I had to do was collect a lot of samples .
The key is to attempt to collect both regular and irregular cards in the wild , so I went to the SEG / Hua Qian Bei district and wandered around the gray markets there .
I bought about ten memory cards total from small vendors , at prices varying from 30 - 50 RMB ( $ 4.40 – $ 7.30 ) , most of them priced toward 30 RMB .
The process of shopping for irregular cards itself was interesting .
In talking to a couple dozen vendors , you learn a few things .
First , Kingston as a brand is weak in China for microSD cards .
Sandisk has done a lot more marketing in the microSD space , and as a result , it ’s much easier to find Sandisk cards on the open market .
The quality of the grey - market Sandisk cards are also typically more consistent .
Second , the small vendors are entirely brazen about selling you well - crafted fakes .
Typically , the bare cards are just sitting loose in trays in the display case ; once you agree on the price and commit to buying the card , the vendor will toss the loose card into a “ real ” Kingston retail package , and then miraculously pull out a certificate , complete with hologram , serial numbers , and a kingston.com URL you can visit to validate your purchase , and slap it on the back of the retail package right in front of your eyes .
Hey , it ’s just like new ! …
I suppose the typical buyer in those markets is not an end user , but someone who is looking to make a quick buck reselling these cards at a hefty markup in a more reputable retail outlet .
One vendor in particular interested me ; it was literally a mom , pop and one young child sitting in a small stall of the mobile phone market , and they were busily slapping dozens of non-Kingston marked cards into Kingston retail packaging .
They had no desire to sell to me , but I was persistent ; this card interested me in particular because it also had the broken “ D ” logo but no Kingston marking .
Above is a scan of the card and the package it came in ( a larger image of the card can be seen below ; it is “ Sample # 4 ” ) .
After collecting all the samples , I read out their card ID information , and then digested their packages with nitric acid .
Below is the line - up of the cards I digested .
Yes , my digestion technique is pretty crude .
Actually , most of the damage to the card came from the cleaning process — I was using a Q - tip with acetone to remove the dissolved encapsulant and I had to get a little rough , which does n’t do any favors for the bond wires .
But …good enough for my purposes .
Click on the image above for a full - sized version .
Some notes on the cards above :
Sample 1 : This is the original irregular card that got me started on this whole arc .
It was purchased through a sanctioned Kingston distributor in China , and to the best of my knowledge , none were shipped to end customers of chumby .
MID = 0x000041 , OEMID = 0x3432 , serial = 0x960 , name = SD2GB .
Sample 2 : This is a normal card that I also purchased from the same sanctioned Kingston distributor in China , and is typical of those actually shipped in the first lot of chumby Ones
MID = 0x000002 , OEMID = 0x544D , serial = 0x9C62CAE6 , name = SA02G
Sample 3 : This is a Kingston card purchased through a major US retail chain .
Note how the MID and OEMID are identical to sample 2 , but not sample 1 .
MID = 0x000002 , OEMID = 0x544D , serial = 0xA6EDFA97 , name = SD02G
Sample 4 : This is the aforementioned non-Kingston branded card that I spotted being slapped into Kingston - marked packaging , bought on the open market in Shenzhen .
Note the low serial number .
MID = 0x000012 , OEMID = 0x3456 , serial = 0x253 , name = MS
Sample 5 : This is a device bought from a more established retailer in the Shenzhen market , but still questionable .
I bought it because it had the XXX .
A00LF marking , like my original irregular card .
MID = 0x000027 , OEMID = 0x5048 , serial = 0x7CA01E9C , name = SD2GB
Sample 6 : This is a SanDisk card bought on the open market from a sketchy shop run by a sassy chain - smoking girl who would n’t stop texting on her mobile .
I actually acquired three total SanDisk cards from different sketchy sources but all of them checked out with the same CID info , so I only opened one of them .
Interestingly , one SanDisk card turned out to be used and only quick - formatted .
With the help of some recovery software , I found DLLs , WAV’s , maps , and verisign certificates belonging to Navione ’s Careland GPS inside the drive .
A project for another day will be acquiring lots of refurb microSD cards and collecting interesting data off of them .
MID = 0x000003 , OEMID = 0x5344 , serial = 0x114E933D , name = SU02G
Sample 7 : This is a Samsung card that we bought from a Samsung wholesale distributor .
I did n’t scan this one before digesting it , so the image of it is missing but the card actually has no markings on the outside — it ’s a total blank card with just a laser mark on the back .
From appearances alone , it would look to be the sketchiest of the bunch , but in reality it ’s one of the best built .
Goes to show you ca n’t judge a book by its cover .
MID = 0x00001B , OEMID = 0x534D , serial = 0xB1FE8A54 , name = 00000
That ’s a lot of data for a blog post , but I figured more details are better for sharing , since I could find no central database for this kind of information on the web .
Here are the most interesting “ high level ” results from my survey :
The “ normal ” Kingston cards ( samples # 2 and # 3 ) were all direct Toshiba OEM cards ( MID = 0x000002 , OEMID = 0x544D ( ASCII ‘ TM ’ , presumably for Toshiba Memory ) ) .
These cards employ Toshiba controllers and Toshiba memory chips , and seem to be of good quality , and thankfully the only ones that were sent on to chumby customers .
The irregular card ( sample # 1 ) uses the same controller chip as the outright fake ( sample # 4 ) that was bought in the SZ market .
Both the irregular Kingston and the fake Kingston had low serial numbers and whacky ID information .
Some of these cards experience some difficulty in normal operation .
I still hesitate to call Kingston ’s irregular card a fake — that ’s a very strong accusation to make — but its construction is similar to another card of clearly questionable quality , which leads me to question Kingston ’s judgment in picking authorized manufacturing partners .
The irregular card is the only card in the group that does not use a stacked CSP construction .
Instead , it uses side - by - side bonding .
The only two memory chip foundries in this sample set were Toshiba / Sandisk and Samsung .
Note that Sandisk and Toshiba co-own the fab that makes their memory chips .
Samsung ’s NAND die — the most expensive part of a microSD card — is about 17 % larger than Toshiba / Sandisk .
This means that Samsung microSD cards should naturally carry a slightly higher price than Toshiba / Sandisk cards .
However , Samsung does get to offset that against the ability to diversify the same die from microSD packages into street - packaged TSOP devices , and they also do n’t have a middleman like Kingston to eat away at margins .
Significantly , Kingston is revealed as simply a vendor that re-marks other people ’s chips in its own packaging [ clarification ] .
Every Kingston card surprisingly had a Sandisk / Toshiba memory chip inside , and the only variance or “ value add ” that could be found is in the selection of the controller chip .
Oddly enough , of all the vendors , Kingston quoted with the best lead times and pricing — better than SanDisk or Samsung , despite the competition making all their own silicon and thereby having a lower inherent cost structure .
This tells me that Kingston must be crushed when it comes to margin , which may explain why irregular cards are finding their way into their supply chain .
Kingston is also probably more willing to talk to smaller accounts like me because as a channel brand they ca n’t compete against OEMs like Sandisk or Samsung for the biggest contracts from the likes of Nokia or RIMM .
Effectively , Kingston is just a channel trader and is probably seen by SanDisk / Toshiba as a demand buffer for their production output .
I also would n’t be surprised if SanDisk / Toshiba was selling Kingston “ A - ” grade parts , i.e. , parts with slightly more defective sectors , but otherwise perfectly serviceable .
As a result , Kingston plays a significant and important role in stabilizing microSD card prices and improving fab margins , but at some risk to their own brand image .
Overall , the MicroSD card market is a fascinating one , a discussion perhaps worth a blog post on its own .
I ’d like to point out to casual readers that the spot price of MicroSD cards is nearly identical to the spot price of the very same NAND FLASH chips used on the inside .
In other words , the extra controller IC inside the microSD card is sold to you “ for free ” .
The economics that drive this are fascinating , but in a nutshell , my suspicion is that incorporating the controller into the package and having it test , manage and mark bad blocks more than offsets the cost of testing each memory chip individually .
A full bad block scan can take a long time on a large FLASH IC , and chip testers cost millions of dollars .
Therefore , the amortized cost per chip for test alone can be comparable to the cost of silicon itself .
To ground this in solid numbers , suppose a production - grade memory tester costs one million dollars .
If you take one million dollars and divide it by the number of seconds over a five year period ( a typical depreciation lifespan for such equipment ) , the equipment “ costs ” $ 0.00634 per second .
Thus , a thirty second test costs you $ 0.00634 / second x 30 seconds = $ 0.19 .
This is comparable to the raw die cost of the controller IC , according to my models ; and by making the controllers very smart ( the Samsung controller is a 32 - bit ARM7TDMI with 128 k of code ) , you get to omit this expensive test step while delivering extra value to customers —
I love the fact that when I put on my linux kernel hacker hat , I can be completely oblivious to the existence of bad blocks and use mature filesystems like ext3 instead of JFFS2 , at no extra cost to end customers like you .
Is n’t it fun to connect the dots , all the way from silicon die markings to the linux kernel to end users , and all the businesses in between ?
In the end , I ’d have to say that both SanDisk and Samsung look like they might be superior wholesale vendors to Kingston for memory cards due to their more direct control of their respective supply chains .
Unfortunately , you ca n’t buy Samsung - branded microSD cards on the retail market , as far as I know — Samsung only sells their cards to wholesalers who then rebrand and / or resell the card , and like Kingston these non-OEM brands may blend their vendors so it ’s hard to say if you ’re getting the best card or simply a usable card .

The role of designers in the Django community ¶
* UPDATE *:
There is a new thread about the roles and implementation of a Design Czar up on the Django Developers mailing list .
Please contribute there as well , if you have thoughts and ideas .
There has been a recent discussion on the Django Developers mailing list about the role of designers in the Django community .
I think that this is an interesting discussion that can come from this , and I would like to explain my thoughts on the issue .
This discussion came up in the context of redesigning the Django Admin , which everyone knows and loves .
The UI is growing a bit out - dated , and there was talk of working to clean it up .
This then turned into a discussion about how design proposals and improvements are n’t taken as seriously as they should be by the community .
I think there are a number of reasons that this happens , and I would like to take a look at them .
My purpose here is to start a discussion about how to better integrate designers into the community , because they are a vital part of making our world more beautiful and efficient .
I do n’t trust myself to judge your work ¶
The normal process for changes that go into Django is that a proposal is sent to the mailing list .
There is a discussion that happens around them , and then if the code is produced , and it works , it gets committed .
For design changes , I do n’t reply to these messages , because I do n’t have the skills or knowledge to judge the work .
I think that a lot of people on these lists are in the same boat .
When someone sends a proposal to the list , and it does n’t get any replies , that feels like rejection .
This happens more than it should , but it is n’t anyones job to respond to these messages and say “ sorry , I ’m not qualified to critique your work ” .
This happens with code proposals too , but I think it may happen more with design .
This leads to designers forsaking the mailing list , and this problem perpetuates itself , by not drawing designers into the community .
Design is not special , except when it is ¶
Part of the problem that seems to have come forward is that there is a feeling that design is “ special ” .
That it should be treated somehow differently in the process .
As we know from history , even with all good intentions , different is never equal .
So I think that we should work to fit design into the current scheme of how things work , instead of trying to adopt new ways of dealing with it .
When I look at the current Core Developers of Django , I do n’t see many people who are designers .
As I said above , that fact that very few of the current core developers are well versed in the design realm , really hurts inclusion of design changes .
This creates a lot more friction in the process of getting design changes into the code base .
I do n’t know if this idea is crazy , but should we have the concept of a “ core designer ” .
These would be people that the community trusts and knows have good taste , that would be an obvious person to make these design choices .
I think that there is a problem when I have a design change for Django , and I really do n’t know who to talk to .
There is an obvious authority ( BDFL ) for code changes , but I do n’t know if Adrian and Jacob are really the correct people to making these judgment calls on design ?
I realize that this is open source , and “ core designers ” would be the same as developers , just people who care about the direction of the projects design .
However , I think that having more design oriented people in the community in a more direct fashion would make it more obvious that design changes are welcomed and seriously considered .
I do n’t know how far we need to go down the path of making this explicit .
However , most of the documentation about contributing is explicit about “ code ” .
This is another of those lines , where I do n’t know if it makes sense to be explicit about design , having a “ design ” section in the contributing documentation , or if the implicit knowledge of core designers will make it obvious that we mean design changes there too .
The actual process ¶ I do n’t want to talk about the actual design process , because well , I really do n’t know how it works .
I think that once we integrate designers into the community better , the process for design will naturally fall out better .
WELCHES ---
The man who lives on a back lot at the Zig Zag Estates trailer park can tell you the precise vertical slope of the mountains of Bosnia .
And he reels off the significant numbers of his life with deft acuity , but if you should have the pleasure to eat lunch with Bill Johnson , do not count on him remembering what he ordered .
" We ate lunch together ? "
I 've stood on Johnson 's porch , which sits on the edge of Mt. Hood National Forest , a half dozen times in the past year .
Each occasion , I knocked , then waited for the sound of a yapping dog and the shuffling of heavy feet across the wooden floor .
When the guy known as one of the greatest American downhill skiers opens the door , Johnson is hunched over -- his body is so curled it looks like a giant " C " with a pair of legs -- but he 's smiling and holding a white poodle back with his cane .
" Sorry , it takes me a long time to get to the door , " he said .
" I do n't move so fast anymore . "
Maybe you think of the
and see ice hockey , figure skating , or skiing .
Maybe you see a burning torch and five rings that we 're told symbolize so much more .
Or maybe you just think about the gravity of life 's fleeting moments and what they have to do with men like former Olympic champion Johnson , who won big in Sarajevo .
What I wonder is whether we can give up our own version of happiness for a few minutes so that we can better see Johnson's .
Because if you can't , you 'd better stop reading and move along .
Johnson became the first American male to win Olympic gold in alpine skiing in 1984 .
And if you ask him what " 1 minute , 45.59 seconds " means , the 49 - year old grins as if he can still smell the scent of pine needles and mountain air from that run .
" That 's my winning time in the Olympics , of course . "
Post - Sarajevo Johnson had a knee surgery , a back surgery and engaged in a shoving match with a USA Ski Team coach that culminated when he smacked the coach in the shin with his ski pole .
Also , Johnson failed to qualify for the 1988 Calgary Olympics .
He struggled in the wake of that disappointment .
Then , his wife divorced him , and took their two young boys with her to California .
" I was broke , " he said .
" If I had money and a gold medal again , I think she would have loved me and come back . "
Johnson chased another gold medal .
You knew that , right ?
And maybe you recall that as he attempted to qualify for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics he suffered that terrible practice - run crash that left him suffocating on his own blood and telling the rescuers , " I need help , " before his brain swelled and he slipped into a coma .
As you think of what happened to Johnson , think about how you would respond to Johnson 's challenges .
And as you do that know that you cannot understand who Johnson is today without letting go of society 's well - rehearsed version of success , peace and happiness .
If you can do this , you can see Johnson just fine .
Johnson 's health is deteriorating .
The right side of his body wo n't cooperate .
His feet are so swollen he can't put on his shoes .
He slurs his words and can't take a step without losing his balance .
His short - term memory is spotty and he has trouble recalling some events from the past , especially around the accident .
" He 's getting worse , " his mother , D.B. , said .
" He can be very juvenile , and he hesitates when you ask him things , and that worries me . "
The Sports Illustrated coverboy who rocketed down the mountain into history 26 years ago now takes several minutes to get out of a living - room chair , to his feet , and move across the room .
Johnson smokes cigarettes , and spends up to 10 hours a day playing computer games in the back room of his trailer .
He has n't skied down a mountain in more than seven years .
And he wears a medic - alert bracelet on his right wrist because the closest family member is an hour away .
There are friends who visit , such as former ski-team member Joe Weber , who rummaged through boxes of Johnson 's trophies and skiing bibs a couple of months ago and displayed them on shelves and walls in his trailer .
" Maybe seeing some of this stuff will jar something in his brain , " Weber said .
" There are moments when Billy sees something and goes , ' Oh yeah , I remember that , ' and others when he just stares blankly as any memory of it is gone . "
When you spend time with Johnson , you ask him things such as , " You ca n't ski anymore , so why do you live on a mountain ? "
And you wonder aloud , " Would n't it be less lonely and better if you moved closer to your mother ? "
And you blurt out , " Are you afraid up here all alone ? "
Said Johnson : " I 'm not afraid of anything . "
Again , your version of happiness vs. Johnson's .
Because the temptation is to declare Bill Johnson gone .
As if the brash , focused and fearless guy who won gold in 1984 evaporated the instant he smashed his head into the side of a mountain .
But he 's still right here , at the trailer park , is n't he ?
Johnson remains eccentric , stubborn and competitive .
He 's funny , sharp - witted , and undeniably his own man .
He calls current US Ski Team member Bode Miller , " A boy who skis . "
He says of Austrians who ridiculed him prior to the 1984 Olympics : " I got under their skin , which is 100 percent of the battle . "
And Johnson spits on his garage floor and throws lit cigarettes at your feet and tells you , " Step on that for me . "
The ski outfit that Johnson wore when he screamed down the hill in Sarajevo , chasing history , hangs on the wall in his garage .
When you watch video of his old races , you can feel the fearlessness and confidence inside of him .
We admire those qualities in high - level athletes .
Sports apparel companies brand around the " No Fear " mantra .
And the irony is n't lost as he 's struggling to walk up three steps in his garage that the same qualities that made Johnson an Olympic hero left him physically destroyed .
" I never even thought about the risks , " he said .
" You ca n't if you want to be great . "
His gold medal is on the shelf in his garage .
It 's dented and scratched on the edges from passing it around too often to strangers who want to touch it .
The gold - plating is wearing so thin in spots that you can see the silver peeking through beneath it .
The medal ends up symbolic of the man who won it , no ?
Johnson refuses to put the medal around his neck .
But if you visit him he will insist that you touch it , or wear it .
And he has photographs all around his trailer of smiling strangers posing with the medal dangling from their necks and hugging a grinning Johnson .
" I like to see other people with it on , " he said .
" That makes me happy . "
The U.S. Ski Team has abandoned Johnson .
They offer him no place in their family .
They 've moved on and pushed the pioneer to a far corner of the ski world .
But those who know Johnson best admire the way he has faced adversity .
" He 's sweeter and more caring , and has a better nature post - accident , " said his Mom .
" If I disagreed with him before the accident , he would have come out of his socks . "
The United States Olympic Committee arranged for Johnson to get a pair of tickets to the men's downhill in Vancouver .
And instead of going he 's selling them in an auction on eBay , and plans to watch the event with one of his teenaged sons who is flying to Oregon to visit .
Johnson lives on $ 1,600 a month of disability .
He owns no property .
And has no savings .
And without his mother checking in on him , you wonder who would take care of him .
At the same time , Johnson feels a deep connection with the mountains where he grew up , and he loves his dog " Buddy , " and he does Sudoku puzzles .
His life feels uncomplicated .
Said Johnson : " I have everything I need . "

As the cold weather sets in , thousands of migrants have been pushed away from town centers and reception camps by the authorities in Bosnia 's north - western border area , who complain they cannot endure the burden of the migrant crisis alone .
If one goes by the Pentagon ’s recent report on the Ft. Hood terrorist attack , the Pentagon ’s PC putzes would n’t recognize a Muslim terrorist if one jumped up and bit them on the butt .
So in the interest of national security , I have collected some statements made by folks over the years , which might point the Pentagon in the right direction .
One lives in hope — the poor dears are awfully slow on the uptake though .
“ Ever since the religion of Islam appeared in the world , the espousers of it …have been as wolves and tigers to all other nations , rending and tearing all that fell into their merciless paws , and grinding them with their iron teeth ; that numberless cities are raised from the foundation , and only their name remaining ; that many countries , which were once as the garden of God , are now a desolate wilderness ; and that so many once numerous and powerful nations are vanished from the earth !
Such was , and is at this day , the rage , the fury , the revenge , of these destroyers of human kind . ” — John Wesley ( 1703 - 1791 )
Methodist leader
“ Bolshevism combines the characteristics of the French Revolution with those of the rise of Islam … .
Marx has taught that Communism is fatally predestined to come about ; this produces a state of mind not unlike that of the early successors of Mahommet … .
Among religions , Bolshevism is to be reckoned with Mohammedanism , rather than with Christianity and Buddhism .
Christianity and Buddhism are primarily personal religions , with mystical doctrines and a love of contemplation .
Mohammedanism and Bolshevism are practical , social , unspiritual , concerned to win the empire of this world . ”
— Bertrand Russell ( 1872-1970 ) Liberal icon
“ Adopting from the new Revelation of Jesus , the faith and hope of immortal life , and of future retribution , he [ Mohammed ] humbled it to the dust by adapting all the rewards and sanctions of his religion to the gratification of the sexual passion .
He poisoned the sources of human felicity at the fountain , by degrading the condition of the female sex , and the allowance of polygamy ; and he declared undistinguishing and exterminating war , as a part of his religion , against all the rest of mankind .
THE ESSENCE OF HIS DOCTRINE WAS VIOLENCE AND LUST .
—TO EXALT THE BRUTAL OVER THE SPIRITUAL PART OF HUMAN NATURE ….
Between these two religions , thus contrasted in their characters , a war of twelve hundred years has already raged .
The war is yet flagrant ...
While the merciless and dissolute dogmas of the false prophet shall furnish motives to human action , there can never be peace upon earth , and good will towards men . ”
[ The words in caps are as originally printed ] . —
John Quincy Adams ( 1767-1848 )
Sixth President of the United States
“ How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries !
Besides the fanatical frenzy , which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia [ rabies ] in a dog , there is this fearful fatalistic apathy .
... The fact that in Mohammedan law [ sharia ] every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property , either as a child , a wife , or a concubine , must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men .
Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities — but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it .
No stronger retrograde force exists in the world . ” — Winston Churchill ( 1874-1965 ) British Prime Minister
“ Only in the Roman Empire and in Spain under Arab domination has culture been a potent factor .
Under the Arab , the standard attained was wholly admirable ; to [ Islamic ]
Spain flocked the greatest scientists , thinkers , astronomers , and mathematicians of the world , and side by side there flourished a spirit of sweet human tolerance and a sense of purist chivalry .
Then with the advent of Christianity , came the barbarians .
Had Charles Martel not been victorious at Poitiers — already you see the world had already fallen into the hands of the Jews , so gutless a thing Christianity ! ” — Adolph Hitler ( 1889 - 1945 )
Leader of the left - wing National Socialist German Workers Party ( NAZI )
“ Today [ 1950 ] , the hatred of the Moslem countries against the West is becoming hatred against Christianity itself .
Although the statesmen have not yet taken it into account , there is still grave danger that the temporal power of Islam may return and , with it , the menace that it may shake off a West which has ceased to be Christian , and affirm itself as a great anti-Christian world power . ” — Fulton J. Sheen ( 1895 - 1979 ) Renowned Catholic Bishop
“ Islam makes it incumbent on all adult males , provided they are not disabled and incapacitated , to prepare themselves for the conquest of [ other ] countries so that the writ of Islam is obeyed in every country in the world .
But those who study Islamic Holy War will understand why Islam wants to conquer the whole world … .
Those who know nothing of Islam pretend that Islam counsels against war .
Those [ who say this ] are witless .
Islam says , kill all the unbelievers just as they would kill you all !
... Whatever good there is , exists thanks to the sword , and in the shadow of the sword !
People cannot be made obedient , except with the sword !
The sword is the key to Paradise , which can be opened only for Holy Warriors !
... Does all that mean that Islam is a religion that prevents men from waging war ?
I spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim . ” — Ayatollah Khomeini ( 1902 - 1989 )
Iran ’s Supreme Leader from 1979 to 1989 — the highest ranking political and religious authority of the nation .
” [ Islam ] is essentially an obstructive , intolerant system …
It has consecrated despotism ; it has consecrated polygamy ; it has consecrated slavery .
It has declared war against every other creed ; it has claimed to be at least dominant in every land …
When it ceases to have an enemy to contend against , it sinks into sluggish stupidity and into a barbarism far viler …
It must have an enemy ; if cut off … from conflict with the infidel , it finds its substitute in sectarian hatred of brother Moslems … ” — Edward Augustus Freeman ( 1823-1892 ) British historian
“ Qur ’an… an accursed book …
So long as there is this book there will be no peace in the world . ” — William Gladstone ( 1809 - 1898 ) Prime Minister of Great Britain 1868 – 1894
“ In the mid 1970s , the KGB ordered my service , the DIE — along with other East European sister services — to scour the country for trusted party activists belonging to various Islamic ethnic groups , train them in disinformation and terrorist operations , and infiltrate them into the countries of our “ sphere of influence . ”
Their task was to export a rabid … hatred for American Zionism by manipulating the ancestral abhorrence for Jews felt by the people in that part of the world .
Before I left Romania for good , in 1978 , my DIE had dispatched around 500 such undercover agents to Islamic countries .
According to a rough estimate received from Moscow , by 1978 the whole Soviet - bloc intelligence community had sent some 4,000 such agents of influence into the Islamic world . ” — Gen. Ion Pacepa Former head of the DIE — the Romanian equivalent of Communist Russia ’s KGB
“ Am I calling for a war between Christianity and Islam ?
Certainly not .
What I am calling for is a general recognition that we are already in a war .
... What we are fighting today is not precisely a “ war on terror . ”
Terror is a tactic , not an opponent .
To wage a “ war on terror ” is like waging a “ war on bombs ” : it focuses on a tool of the enemy rather than the enemy itself .
A refusal to identify the enemy is extremely dangerous … . ” — Robert Spencer Author of “ The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam ( And The Crusades ) ”
“ Arise .
O sons of Arabia , fight for your sacred rights .
Kill the Jews wherever you find them .
Their spilled blood pleases Allah , our history , and religion . ” — From a radio broadcast by Amin el- husseini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem .
After instigating a pro-nazi putsch in Baghdad in 1941 , he left for Germany , where he spent the remainder of WWII broadcasting propaganda to the Middle East .
“ Will not perhaps the temporal power of Islam return and with it the menace of an armed Mohammedan world , which will shake off the domination of Europeans — still nominally Christian — and reappear as the prime enemy of our civilization ?
The future always comes as a surprise , but political wisdom consists in attempting at least some partial judgment of what that surprise may be .
And for my part I cannot but believe that a main unexpected thing of the future is the return of Islam . ” — Hilaire Belloc ( 1870 - 1953 ) Author / Historian
“ We should fully understand our religion .
Fighting is a part of our religion and our Sharia [ Islamic legal code ] .
Those who love God and his Prophet and this religion cannot deny that .
Whoever denies even a minor tenet of our religion commits the gravest sin in Islam . ” — Osama bin Laden Radical Muslim
” “ I view Islam not as a religion , but as a dangerous , totalitarian ideology — equal to communism and fascism .
Are n’t I allowed to say so ? ” — Geert Wilders Dutch politician
Mr. Wilders is currently on trial for “ incitement to hatred and discrimination . ” I guess you have your answer Geert .
So much for free speech — welcome to Eurabia .
“ Christianity was saved in Europe solely because the peoples of Europe fought .
If the peoples of Europe in the seventh and eighth centuries , and on up to , and including , the seventeenth century , had not possessed a military equality with , and gradually a growing superiority over , the Mohammedans who invaded Europe , Europe would at this moment be Mohammedan and the Christian religion would be exterminated .
Wherever the Mohammedans have had complete sway , wherever the Christians have been unable to resist them by the sword , Christianity has ultimately disappeared .
From the hammer of Charles Martel to the sword of Sobieski , Christianity owed its safety in Europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could , and would , fight as well as the Mohammedan aggressor . ”
The civilization of Europe , America , and Australia , exists today at all , only because of the victories of civilized man over the enemies of civilization — because of victories through the centuries from Charles Martel , in the eighth century , and those of John Sobieski , in the seventeenth century .
... There are such “ social values ” today in Europe , America and Australia only because during those thousand years , the Christians of Europe possessed the warlike power to do what the Christians of Asia and Africa had failed to do — that is , to beat back the Moslem invader . ” — Teddy Roosevelt ( 1858 - 1919 )
Twenty - sixth President of the United States
“ Islam is n’t in America to be equal to any other faith , but to become dominant .
The Qu’ran should be the highest authority in America , and Islam the only accepted religion on earth . ” — Omar Ahmed CAIR ( Council for American Islamic Relations ) Founding Chairman
“ Ladies and gentlemen , we have to recognize that Islam is not a religion .
It is a worldwide political movement bent on domination of the world .
And it is meant to subjugate all people under Islamic law .
In the Quran , it says it very clearly .
There are two spheres .
One is the Dar al - Harb , which is the realm of war .
The other is Dar al - Islam , which is that part that ’s under submission to Islam .
There is no middle ground .
You ’re either at war , or you ’re under submission . ”
— Pat Robertson Minister and host of “ The 700 Club ”
I hope these quotes help to clear things up for the Pentagon .
If I did n’t know any better , I ’d think that they were more concerned with some PC bulls —t , than with their honor , oaths , or country .
The United States already has semi - dhimmi status — note the lack of free speech when it comes to Islam .
I strongly urge the Pentagon to get on the ball , and stop playing with themselves .
Laus Deo .
Modding A Barracuda 7200.11 Into A VelociRaptor
That 's a really catchy title , is n't it ?
Who would n't want to turn a " slow " 7,200 RPM hard disk drive into a super - fast 10,000 RPM Western Digital VelociRaptor ?
After all , the 300 GB model of the much - vaunted HDD speed king retails for US $ 199.99 * , while a 1.5 TB Barracuda 7200.11 only costs US $ 109.99 * .
Imagine getting the performance of the VelociRaptor with the capacity and price of the Seagate Barracuda !
The guys at TechwareLabs came up with an apparently nifty way to " transform " the 1.5 TB Barracuda 7200.11 hard disk drive into a VelociRaptor - killer .
They claimed that their " modded " Barracuda 7200.11 hard disk drive delivered sequential transfer rates of 122 - 132 MB/s while the VelociRaptor could only do 95 - 99 MB/s .
That implies that the " modded " Barracuda is 31 % faster than the VelociRaptor !
Update @ 03-01-2012 : Seagate 's Mark Wojtasiak recently promoted TechwareLabs ' article , saying that it " explained in a step by step way how users could use Seagateâ€™s SeaTools to short stroke a 7200 RPM high capacity drive and get performance that beats a 10 K drive . "
Of course , Seagate would be ecstatic about the article as it purportedly shows how you can make their run -of - the - mill Barracuda hard disk drive beat a 10,000 RPM enterprise - grade hard disk drive from their chief competitor , Western Digital .
But before you go rushing out to grab yourself a 1.5 TB Barracuda 7200.11 hard disk drive , please note that their mod basically involves crippling the Barracuda so that it only uses the first 300 GB .
This is what they did :
1. Download SeaTools DOS version from the Seagate website .
2 . Burn the ISO onto a blank CD using any standard CD burner .
3 . Put the burned CD into the CD - Drive and restart your computer .
4 . The CD will boot automatically into the software ’s graphical interface at which point you must click “ ACCEPT ” to the licence agreement .
5 . Click the drive labeled “ ST31500341AS ” by left clicking the name .
6 . Go to the “ Advanced Tools ” tab and select the “ Set Capacity Manually ” option .
7 . Once you have done that , a blank dialog should appear .
Enter the amount of LBAs ( Logical Block Addresses ) you want your “ new ” drive to have and click “ Continue ” .
The magic number for the 300 GB mark is 589080586 .
For reference the max number that you can enter into this field is 2930277167 which equals 1500.302 GB .
8 . The confirmation message should look like the screenshot below .
Once you achieved the confirmation , you are done .
You can take out the CD and press the reset button or click “ CTRL + ALT + DEL ” to restart your computer .
For the rest of the article , please click here .
Yes , it 's a pretty complicated " mod " and it will turn your 1.5 TB hard disk drive into a 300 GB hard disk drive .
You can only use the first 300 GB .
The remaining 1.2 TB will be inaccessible .
But what 's wrong with that , you say ?
After all , you still get a hard disk drive that is 31 % faster than the VelociRaptor at just over half the price ?
Well , the problem we have with this mod is that you can actually have your cake and eat it too !
Why throw away the remaining 1.2 TB when you can still use it ?
Here 's how ...
* as of February 2010
Doing It Without Losing 1.2 TB
Instead of using their convoluted ( and technically - tricky ) method of modifying the number of LBAs ( Logical Block Addresses ) used by the Barracuda 7200.11 , all you have to do is partition the drive !
Just create a first partition of 300 GB in size .
You can either divvy up the remaining 1.2 TB or leave it as a giant second partition .
You can do so either during the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation process , or by going to Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Computer Management -> Storage -> Disk Management .
By limiting the first partition to 300 GB , you are essentially limiting it to the first 300 GB on the hard disk drive - the same thing modifying the number of LBAs does .
But the advantage is you can still access the remaining 1.2 TB of storage space !
Now , is n't this a better " mod " ? **
But you might be wondering .. what exactly is going on , and how does it work ?
Let 's take a look ...
** Partitioning the hard disk drive is not a " mod " .
We are calling it a better " mod " only in reference and in comparison to the LBA mod .

Despite its immense popularity , it does n’t yet have a common name : some call it “ locavorism , ” others “ localism . ”
In terms of clarity , the compound “ eating locally ” may be best .
But if opinions differ on nomenclature , everyone pretty much knows what it is : buying food from local producers .
Virtually every town that boasts a crossroads and a gas station now has a farmer ’s market .
Restaurants trumpet their local vegetables , meat , and fungi .
Food writers wax ecstatic over the delicacy of lamb raised on local herbage , the sweetness of halibut hauled from local waters , the crispness of a radish plucked from the local loam .
Eating locally is nothing new , of course .
What is new — relatively — is the global commoditization of food , the labyrinthine complex of trade policies , modern farming techniques , and transportation infrastructure that allows us to eat raspberries in January , persimmons in August , and oysters year - round .
And though developed countries call on the world to fill their dinner plates , many if not most people in Asia and Africa — and large portions of South America — still eat wholly from local sources .
They have to ; eating locally is a necessity rather than a civic virtue .
North American food localism , however , is often a matter of choice : a response to commoditized food widely perceived as lacking in flavor and nutrients .
Localism also has a strong environmental component .
Environmentalists reflexively support local eating , claiming it reduces fuel consumption and atmospheric carbon loading .
Not always so , says Maisie Greenawalt , vice president of Bon Appétit , a Palo Alto–based food service management company that endeavors to buy at least 20 percent of its food from local producers .
“ For carbon reduction , local is n’t necessarily the answer , ” Greenawalt says , “ especially where meat and dairy products are concerned . ”
A 2006 report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations concluded that livestock accounted for 9 percent of the carbon dioxide , 37 percent of the methane , and 65 percent of the nitrous oxide that come from human - associated activities .
All three gases contribute to global warming ; methane and nitrous oxide are more potent greenhouse gases than CO 2 .
“ So whether your steak comes from Argentina or the rancher down the road , it is , relatively speaking , a high - carbon food , ” Greenawalt notes .
Further , says Greenawalt , the mode of transportation is more germane than distance in determining the carbon impacts of moving food around .
“ Air freight produces about 11 times the amount of atmospheric carbon as commercial shipping , ” Greenawalt says .
“ So the literal slow boat from China is better environmentally than a jet plane shuttling produce from California to New York . ”
Still , says David Zilberman , a professor of agriculture and resource economics at UC Berkeley , the advantages of local food are real — most pertinently , simple sensory pleasure .
“ Fresh food from nearby sources is , in fact , fresh , ” says Zilberman .
“ It tends to smell and taste better . ”
Greenawalt likewise emphasizes the basic good taste of local food .
“ Food ca n’t be bred to travel well , ” she says .
“ There is no way industrial food services can transport heirloom tomatoes at their peak of ripeness and flavor , for example .
If you want to eat them , you have to buy them from a nearby farmer . ”
Greenawalt points out that robust local food systems strengthen communities , bonding people to their fellow citizens and surrounding landscapes .
“ There ’s a multiplier effect , ” she says .
“ Local food production creates jobs .
It re-invigorates languishing downtowns through farmer ’s markets .
It preserves green space around urban cores , and it provides educational opportunities to children , who get a chance to see working farms . ”
And though it may be honored more in the breach than the observance — plenty of New Zealand orange roughy , Chilean asparagus , and soda infused with Iowan high - fructose corn syrup are still consumed across the country — Americans now generally acknowledge the wisdom of eating locally .
In an article that cited surveys on attitudes toward food , John Ikerd , professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri , noted that 73 percent of Americans want to know if food is produced locally ; 75 percent of consumers in Seattle , Boston , and seven Midwestern states prefer food produced by local family farmers ; and 70 percent of households in Wisconsin , Missouri , Nebraska , and Iowa consider the consumption of local foods and the support of local farms “ extremely important . ”
U.S. locavorism has its roots in the organic agriculture movement .
But as organic food has evolved from an artisanal rural endeavor to a multi­billion - dollar industry , locavores have detached themselves .
Local foods may not all be organic , but they are considered by their advocates to be superior , given that fruits and vegetables conform to the seasons and are picked at peak ripeness , and meat animals can be raised on pasturage rather than vast feed lots .
The real prime mover of U.S. local eating is Slow Food , an enterprise begun in Italy in the mid-1980s .
Slow Food promotes local production , food that does not harm “ the environment , animal welfare or … health , ” and a general commitment to “ eco-gastronomy . ”
Progressive chefs , restaurateurs , and foodies in the United States embraced the Slow Food manifesto , and the concept gained some credence among the general public through the 1990s .
But locavorism ’s breakthrough moment did n’t come until 2006 , with the publication of The Omnivore ’s Dilemma by Berkeley Knight Professor of Journalism Michael Pollan .
The bestselling book traces the provenance of four meals , including one derived from the agribusiness complex and one from a remarkable farm in Virginia that utilized complex pasture rotations and extensive composting to produce a wide array of foodstuffs — all derived , either directly or indirectly , from grass .
Pollan — who declined an interview request for this article — is a compelling writer , and his prose captured both the stench of the feedlot and the sweet smell of lush pasturage .
The benefits of eating food produced by local farmers with both an environmental ethic and a commitment to consumers were never made so viscerally explicit .
Pollan also supports the notion that local food — particularly local organic food — can be far more nutritious than commercially produced food .
In Defense of Food , his follow - up to The Omnivore ’s Dilemma , cites research comparing foods grown organically to those grown conventionally ; the organic food , he says , contained “ appreciably higher levels of antioxidants , flavonoids , vitamins , and other nutrients … .
Of course , after a few days riding cross-country in a truck , the nutritional quality of any kind of produce will deteriorate , so ideally you want to look for food that is both organic and local … . ”
But while locavorism has achieved media saturation across the developed world , its application remains resolutely — well , local .
By its very nature , it must remain a weak confederacy , a loose network of like - minded people who agree in principle , then cultivate their own gardens in their own places .
The question is : Can local food feed the world ?
Maybe not — at least , not the world as currently configured , in which billions of people live in areas where they cannot readily produce all the food they need .
“ Food ” in the locavore doctrine generally means high - quality fruits and vegetables , specialty meat and seafood , and artisanal comestibles : cheeses , breads , charcuterie , conserves .
Staples , such as they are , tend to come in the form of heritage potatoes or exotic legumes .
But “ food ” for a significant portion of the world consists largely of grains — corn and rice , principally — and soybeans .
Much is used for livestock feed or processed products , but some is eaten directly , particularly in Africa , where famine relief is a perennial necessity .
These base foodstuffs are loaded by the kiloton into ships and transported across the world where and when they are needed .
The system that yields this abundance has its flaws , acknowledges Brian Wright , professor of resource economics at Berkeley , but it fulfills its primary mission admirably : staving off global famine .
The United States remains the keystone of this planetary enterprise :
The country ’s estimated 2009 harvest for corn and soybeans stands at 12.9 billion bushels and 3.32 billion bushels , respectively , with most of that yield coming from the Midwestern grain belt .
“ The fact is that certain regions are the best places to grow certain crops , ” says Wright .
“ And for growing corn and soybeans in quantity — the kind of quantity you need to feed billions of people — no place is better than the American Midwest .
The soils and the climate are ideal , the infrastructure has been developed to accommodate that kind of economic activity , and people there know what they are doing . ”
In econo - speak , this is an example of “ comparative advantage , ” Wright says : different regions doing what they do best to the exclusion of less - profitable pursuits .
“ You see the same thing in Alaska , where the food - producing portion of the economy is geared to fisheries , or Sri Lanka , which focuses on spice production . ”
Although comparative advantage allows different regions to produce large quantities of different types of food , another element is required to provide the world a reliable and varied diet : modern shipping .
“ Because ships these days are so large , transporting commodity staples is incredibly cheap .
The shipping industry has addressed the historic primary cause of famine — food availability . ”
Wright explains that past famines often have occurred in areas where food was nearby ; but poor access made it impossible to move it to where it was needed .
“ In medieval Europe , famines occurred 20 or 30 miles from areas where there was food in abundance , ” he said .
In the 21st century , “ famines only occur in areas where there is difficult port access .
There are no famines on island nations , with the exception of famines that are the result of political issues .
People only go hungry these days in landlocked areas with poor roads — areas where it is still difficult to move food around .
We now have the technology to rapidly ship enough food to literally feed nations . ”
Some analysts feel this ability will not be with us much longer .
Jeff Rubin , a Canadian economist known for his accurate predictions of petroleum prices , has opined that oil will hit $ 225 a barrel by 2012 .
This , says Rubin , will spell the end of globalization .
Most people will be forced to eat locally ; imported food will be astronomically expensive .
Wright agrees that oil may well hit triple digits in the next few years , but he does n’t think expensive bunker fuel will becalm the great ships transporting food around the globe .
“ Food will undoubtedly get more expensive as world petroleum prices rise , ” he says , “ but it ’s not going to get so expensive that global trade in food stops .
Even with oil doubled , we wo n’t see much of an impact .
Fuel transportation costs are a relatively small part of the expense involved in producing and moving food . ”
In other words , the economies of scale offered by the number and size of ships in the global fleet will make it remain practical to transport corn from the American Midwest , coffee from Central and South America , mutton and lamb from Australia .
Modern shipping does n’t simply assure quantity , says Wright .
It also guarantees generally good quality control .
With the exception of stone fruits , “ refrigerated and climate - controlled containers have made it possible to deliver very large quantities of other fruits and vegetables in good condition .
And people will continue to want produce that is out of season , the virtues of local eating notwithstanding . ”
One of those people is Anthony Fisher , professor of agricultural and resource economics at Berkeley .
“ I enjoy eating two navel oranges every morning , ” Fisher says .
“ Whenever possible , I prefer oranges from California — their taste is excellent .
But in the summer , when the oranges are out of season in the state , I buy oranges from the southern hemisphere .
Without global trade , I would n’t derive the enjoyment and nutritional benefit I get from oranges for much of the year . ”
Fisher notes his personal proclivity is manifested exponentially around the world .
“ If you are determined to eat locally in South Dakota or northern Germany , you ’re going to be eating a lot of potatoes , parsnips , and kale in the winter , and not much else , ” he says .
“ From the local perspective , our winter eating is greatly restricted even in California — people who participate in subscription programs with local growers know that . ”
It would also be difficult for local producers in the United States to meet consumer demand on their own , Fisher says .
“ Between 70 [ and ] 80 percent of our fish and shellfish is imported , ” he says .
“ For fruit and vegetables , the figure is between 30 [ and ] 40 percent .
This food contributes significantly to our health and our quality of life .
The consumer is not necessarily better off if his or her diet is restricted to local sources only . ”
Greenawalt says locavorism can be “ scaled ” upward , but that such endeavors nevertheless involve hard choices and intractable limits .
“ We were very interested in the idea of sourcing our restaurants completely from local producers , so we did a study with Columbia University and MIT with one of our cafés at Hamilton College in Clinton , New York , ” says Greenawalt .
“ We did n’t want to focus on a venue that is relatively easy to supply year - round , such as a college in California .
Upstate New York is more challenging — the growing season is much shorter . ”
The café served 1,500 students , says Greenawalt , and the project determined that they all could indeed be fed year - round solely from local sources — though they admittedly would eat a lot of root vegetables in January and February .
But there was a larger problem than dietary monotony .
“ While it was clear that it was possible to feed them 100 percent from local producers , it also became clear that we would strip the entire region of local food if we did that , ” Greenawalt says .
“ In other words , nobody else from the area would be able to buy locally if the café became the priority for suppliers .
Obviously , that was n’t something we wanted to support .
So can local food be scaled ?
Yes — but you have to talk about the appropriate level for that scale . ”
There ’s also , Fisher says , a social justice issue implicit in the promotion of local eating .
Many undeveloped countries rely on food exports to developed countries to maintain rural living standards .
If markets in the United States or Europe were to close through either mass shifts in consumer preference or legal fiat , it could prove disastrous for millions of poor farmers and agricultural workers in the Southern Hemisphere .
Zilberman says he prefers to characterize the situation as a matter of economic fairness rather than social justice .
But he agrees with Fisher that food exports are essential for many developing countries .
“ They very much need to sell food for foreign exchange , and we should be open to that , ” Zilberman says .
“ Not only does it provide our consumers with greater choice and better nutrition — it ’s an issue of reciprocal trade .
We export our computers , tractors , and other technological products ; we need to be open to the products other countries are able to market . ”
But a food production and purveyance system based on a localist model could have problems , he says , beyond reduced seasonal food variety .
“ We did a study on people who use pesticides most inefficiently — in other words , use them too much , too often , or at times and in places where they ’re not recommended , ” Zilberman says .
“ What we found is that the worst offenders are n’t commercial farmers — they ’re home gardeners .
One of my worries about a broad - based local food system is that too many amateurs would get into it .
Yes , a significant portion of the food would be organic — but a significant portion would n’t .
That could have a major negative environmental impact . ”
Nor is it definitive that local food is healthier food , at least in a context that is global and cuts across all income levels .
As Pollan noted , organic local food may contain more nutrients than food grown conventionally and transported long distances ; but in a hungry , populous world , achieving the optimum is n’t always possible .
Generally speaking , quality control probably is more important than provenance in the gauging of “ healthy ” food , says Fisher .
For example , fungi- contaminated grain — which can cause a variety of diseases — remains a big problem in parts of the world where most food is produced and consumed locally .
Localism may be the right thing to do for a number of reasons , but it is problematic for several reasons .
And one of them stands out : Just like the heart , the stomach wants what it wants .
And what it wants , it appears , is a variety of foods , in quantity , at all times of the year .
“ Under Mao , China had a long - standing policy that every region should be self - sufficient in food production , ” says Wright .
“ This was a national security issue , and from that perspective it may have made sense — but it was a tremendous drag on productivity , and it had severe impacts on food availability and human health .
When the policy was reversed in 1978 , productivity boomed .
Food of all varieties became much more available all across China .
Localism — at least , enforced localism — did n’t serve the Chinese well . ”
Nanterre , place de la Boule , supermarché du cannabis ouvert de 18 heures à 21 heures , sept jours sur sept .
Jusqu'à cent clients par jour , des centaines et des centaines de kilos d'herbe et de résine écoulés depuis des années .
Un lieu de deal , une " appellation d'origine contrôlée " des stupéfiants connue dans toute l'Ile - de - France pour sa qualité et ses prix .
La police avait fait tomber un premier réseau de trafiquants en 2004 .
Un deuxième en 2007 .
Pour la troisième fois , en moins de cinq ans , les policiers ont mis à bas cette place forte du cannabis , représentative des centaines de " deals de halls d'immeuble " recensés en Ile - de - France .
A partir des quelque 4 000 procès - verbaux ( PV ) de l'enquête judiciaire , qui offrent une plongée inédite au coeur d'un univers impénétrable , Le Monde raconte la banalité et le quotidien d'un trafic de drogue , le va-et - vient des clients , l'organisation des dealers , le rôle des guetteurs , les règlements de comptes , le management par l'argent et la peur ...
Un monde artisanal et violent marqué par l'extrême dureté des rapports humains .
Une microsociété avec ses propres lois , ses chefs , ses hommes de main et son prolétariat .
La police et la méthode du boa
L'immeuble , banal et triste , dans le centre de Nanterre , à deux pas de la préfecture et du tribunal , a une quinzaine d'étages .
Une poignée de jeunes hommes avaient pris l'habitude de stagner devant l'entrée du bâtiment .
Ennui ?
Non , business .
Une PME de la drogue avec une organisation et un mode de distribution rodés .
L'enquête policière débute par une information donnée par un indic .
Dans les PV des enquêteurs , aucun nom , uniquement la mention qu'une " personne absolument digne de confiance " a souhaité témoigner anonymement .
L'indic dénonce l'existence du trafic " en soirée " et donne le numéro de téléphone d'un client régulier .
La brigade des stups se met sur l'affaire et commence par interpeller , discrètement , les consommateurs venus acheter du cannabis .
Les policiers leur présentent des planches photographiques pour identifier les participants au réseau .
Plusieurs dizaines de consommateurs décrivent ainsi , en garde à vue , le fonctionnement du trafic .
Les premières pièces du puzzle se mettent en place .
Chaque fois qu'une patrouille de police passe dans le quartier et aperçoit un élément troublant , elle le signale sur PV .
Chaque fois que les jeunes sont contrôlés au bas de l'immeuble - à de très nombreuses reprises - , les policiers notent et conservent les identités des personnes présentes .
En parallèle , ils placent les téléphones portables sur écoute , y compris ceux qui sont équipés d'une puce avec faux nom .
Des dizaines d'heures d'enregistrement .
Les enquêteurs multiplient aussi les opérations de surveillance sur les lieux de trafic .
Les filatures .
La vérification des comptes bancaires .
Et le recours à des témoins sous X , des habitants du quartier qui s'expriment anonymement pour éviter d'éventuelles vengeances .
Vingt mois de travail , entre novembre 2007 et mai 2009 , un travail de fourmi récompensé .
Les policiers procèdent à vingt - cinq interpellations , 60 kg de cannabis et plus de 20 000 euros sont saisis .
Le rituel de la cagoule
L'organisation est parfaitement rodée .
A l'extérieur des guetteurs et des rabatteurs chargés de repérer la police et d'orienter les clients .
Certains tournent à vélo ou à scooter dans le quartier - on les reconnaît parce qu'ils ont souvent une oreillette téléphonique .
D'autres sont " en statique " .
Postés contre les murs .
Devant le hall d'entrée .
Le vendeur , ganté , le visage dissimulé sous une cagoule noire , se place dans l'escalier , entre le 3e et le 4e étage .
A la taille , une banane contenant l'argent et le cannabis , herbe ou résine .
Lorsque les clients montent , ils ont la consigne de déposer l'argent sur une marche .
Le vendeur fait de même pour les sachets de cannabis .
Cinq à six euros le gramme en moyenne .
Pour accéder au vendeur , les clients franchissent plusieurs contrôles .
A l'extérieur d'abord , où les " choufs " ( guetteurs ) doivent " sentir " si les étrangers sont des policiers ou des clients habituels .
Les consommateurs décrivent tous les mêmes scènes , parfaitement routinières .
" Je me présente devant le hall , raconte Eddy E. , un commercial de 34 ans .
Il y a systématiquement une personne , parfois deux , qui valident mon passage . "
Second contrôle dans le hall .
Un des guetteurs est chargé de surveiller les clients et de mémoriser leur visage .
Ses chefs ne l'ont pas choisi par hasard .
Rachid E. , 22 ans , est étudiant en psychologie , donc jugé efficace pour cette mission .
" Il dévisage chacun des acheteurs comme un physionomiste de boîte de nuit " , ajoute Eddy E.. Parfois , les guetteurs opèrent une fouille au corps ou demandent une pièce d'identité .
Souvent , les clients font la queue du fait de l'affluence .
Cinq à six personnes peuvent ainsi attendre en même temps dans l'escalier .
Le jeu du chat et de la souris avec la police
L'oeil des guetteurs est expert .
Ils observent et reconnaissent presque systématiquement toutes les voitures banalisées de la police .
Ils savent même distinguer les différentes équipes et brigades .
Au téléphone , deux guetteurs se réjouissent d'avoir su éviter une descente policière .
Ils ont réussi à prévenir le vendeur à temps et les policiers sont repartis bredouilles :
Guetteur 1 ( non identifié ) : " Eh , tout à l'heure , tu l'avais senti , hein ?!
Rachid E. :
T'as vu , je te l'ai dit , je suis fort , hein ? (...)
Guetteur 1 : Et qu'est - ce que je voulais dire , y a du monde là ?
Rachid : Ouais , ça va .
Guetteur 1 : Et qu'est - ce que je voulais dire , c'était quoi comme équipe ? (...)
Rachid : C'était la BAC D ( brigade anticriminalité départementale ) .
Guetteur 1 : (...)
Ouais , vas -y impeccable .
Rachid : Vas -y ma gueule ! "
Un guetteur , sans emploi , a reconnu avoir gagné 150 euros toutes les deux semaines pour guetter l'arrivée de la police .
Abderrazik B. , 20 ans , en apprentissage , a décrit sa mission : " J'ai un rôle de chouf , c'est - à - dire je fais le guet , je surveille la police .
Quand il y a un passage de police , je crie " kahab " ! , ça veut dire " casse - toi " en arabe . "
Les trafiquants hurlent aussi " arnoucha ! " ( serpent ) pour alerter leurs complices dans les étages .
La consigne , alors , est de ralentir l'éventuelle intervention policière en enlevant le morceau de carton qui maintient ouverte la porte d'entrée .
Le vendeur cagoulé , lui , doit se précipiter dans l'appartement de repli , dont il a les clés , dans les étages supérieurs .
Clients : des bobos aux chauffeurs - livreurs
Le bouche - à - oreille fait de la place de la Boule une bonne adresse , très bien desservie par les transports .
Les consommateurs viennent de tout l'ouest de l'Ile - de - France .
Tous les profils sont représentés : dépanneurs , lycéens , responsables commerciaux , chômeurs , producteurs , chauffeurs - livreurs , étudiants , pharmaciens , le plus souvent âgés de 20 à 30 ans .
Ce sont les " toxicomanes " , comme disent les policiers , ou les " ienclis " ( verlan de client ) , comme les appellent les dealers .
La plupart connaissent le site depuis des années .
Ils se sont fait interpeller , discrètement , par la police après avoir effectué leurs achats , généralement quelques grammes d'herbe ou de shit .
Des budgets non négligeables sur l'année .
Thierry Z. , 29 ans , sans emploi , a fumé jusqu'à trente joints par jour .
Il s'approvisionne à Nanterre depuis trois ans .
" J'achète pour 150 ou 200 ( euros ) par mois " , explique - t - il devant les enquêteurs .
Alexandre C. , 21 ans , étudiant en BTS , dépense 150 euros par mois pour dix à quinze joints par semaine .
Paul F. , 27 ans , photographe , consomme depuis dix ans entre 20 et 40 euros de cannabis par mois .
Alexis B. , 21 ans , RMiste titulaire d'un bac +
5 en gestion d'entreprise , a été conseillé par des amis parce que le cannabis de la place de la Boule était considéré de très bonne qualité et les clients " bien servis " .
Sébastien G. , 24 ans , étudiant , estime être venu une bonne centaine de fois .
Soit 2 000 euros dépensés en quelques mois .
Règlements de comptes
Au quotidien , les " boss " du réseau font régner la terreur pour tenir leurs hommes .
Un épisode a marqué le quartier .
Frédéric T. , un homme de 28 ans surnommé " l'animal " , payé 60 euros par jour pour vendre du shit pendant trois heures , a pris la mauvaise habitude de " carotter " ( voler ) de l'argent au groupe .
Quelques semaines avant les interpellations , il prend un billet de 10 euros mais se fait repérer par les " petits " du quartier , chargés de la surveillance .
Les deux chefs du réseau se téléphonent pour en parler .
Les policiers enregistrent la conversation et la retranscrivent sur PV .
Mustapha K. : " Hé , il y a un problème avec l'animal .
Abdel Latif B. : Pourquoi ?
Mustapha : Parce qu'il fait le malin .
Abdel Latif :
T'es sérieux ?
Mustapha : Ouais !
Abdel Latif :
Vous l'avez grillé ?
Mustapha : Oui , je l'ai grillé . "
Mustapha explique à son interlocuteur comment ils ont repéré le voleur .
Ils parlent longuement de la sanction à appliquer .
Mustapha : " Je vais lui mettre dans sa mère !
Abdel Latif : Nan , nan , nan , moi , je vais venir tout à l'heure !
Demande qu'il me le ramène , et devant tout le monde je vais lui tirer dessus .
Je le fume devant tout le monde ! "
Abdel Latif demande à Mustapha de lui fournir un Flash - Ball .
L'autre entame ses recherches , mais ne trouve pas l'arme .
Un des petits lui signale qu'ils ont une batte de base - ball .
Ils se proposent de lui " faire un guet - apens " .
Mustapha rappelle Abdel Latif pour lui demander son avis .
Mustapha : " ( Le petit ) m'a dit : " Quoi , s'il te plaît , laisse - le nous " et tout nanani .
" On va le gonfler ( frapper ) et tout à trois , les trois .
S'il te plaît , on a une batte , on va lui faire un guet - apens " , et tout nanani .
Abdel Latif :
Toi , tu veux faire quoi ?
Mustapha : (...) Vas-y , je vais laisser les petits s'en occuper et après , voilà , si je vois que c'est pas ça , je lui gonfle sa mère . "
Les petits rouent de coups leur complice sur un parking .
Quatre contre un .
Un lynchage : " Ils m'ont tapé longtemps .
J'étais en sang " , témoignera la victime .
Au téléphone , Mustapha prévient Abdel Latif que la sanction a été correctement exécutée .
Mustapha : " Ouais , je viens d'arriver à la cité , mais ils l'ont tué l'autre , ils l'ont marbré ( frappé ) comme des fous , ils l'ont défoncé avec une batte .
Abdel Latif : Putain ! (...)
Mustapha : Ha !
Ils l'ont bien gonflé .
J'avais pitié , il me faisait pitié , il m'a mis du sang partout sur mon polo ! "
La victime a réussi à prendre la fuite et à se faire soigner à l'hôpital .
Mais " l'animal " est désormais considéré comme une " poucave " ( balance ) dans le quartier .
Placé en détention provisoire quelques mois plus tard , il est agressé dans l'enceinte de la prison parce que suspecté d'avoir donné ses complices .
Devant les enquêteurs , il résume sa situation :
" Il y a une phrase qu'il faut retenir : il n'y a pas d'amis dans le business . "
Management et ressources humaines
Régulièrement , Mustapha K. , 28 ans , vient effectuer une inspection de ses hommes .
Avec sa Clio , il se gare sur le parking .
Le jeune homme est sans emploi , mais il en impose , montre Dolce & Gabbana , ceinture Hugo Boss , baskets type " requin " .
Des marques qui fascinent les gamins , fans de Diesel , Nike et autres RG512 .
Il ne sait évidemment pas que la police a installé des moyens de surveillance électroniques et peut écouter et visualiser les échanges dans le hall , l'escalier et à proximité de l'immeuble .
Rachid , le guetteur , visiblement surpris de le voir , s'adresse à lui : " Wesh , Gueush , ça va ? " , Mustapha s'énerve en entendant son surnom :
" Non , m'appelle pas comme ça dehors et reste en dehors du hall , je te l'ai déjà dit .
Surveille la rue . "
Les policiers notent que Rachid sort de l'immeuble , mais ne se place pas en position de surveillance .
Mustapha va discuter avec un de ses hommes de main : " Occupe - toi de Rachid ! "
Le lieutenant file vers Rachid et l'engueule .
Il le pousse au niveau de la poitrine à deux reprises , le faisant reculer .
Il lui montre son oeil droit avec son index : " Regarde - moi bien Rachid , tu sors de ce putain de hall , et tu surveilles la rue , c'est pas compliqué , non ? "
Le guetteur se met à son poste , humilié .
Un autre chouf éclate de rire : " Tu t'es fait doser mon pote ! " " Ta gueule ! " , lui répond Rachid , furieux .
Avec leurs complices , les chefs utilisent aussi l'arme financière .
Un vendeur arrive en retard plusieurs fois dans la même semaine .
Au téléphone toujours , Mustapha s'énerve du manque de professionnalisme :
" Pour cinq jours en retard , tu lui retires 10 euros tous les jours , frère .
Je m'en bats les couilles , tu lui retires 10 euros à chaque fois qu'il est en retard . "
A l'inverse , lorsque les gars bossent bien , ils peuvent recevoir une prime .
Par exemple , pour avoir frappé le membre de la bande qui volait dans la caisse .
Au téléphone , Abdel Latif se fait DRH : " Hé , rajoute - leur un billet en fin de semaine ! "
La " nourrice " , victime consentante
Les habitants de l'immeuble subissent les nuisances provoquées par le trafic .
Beaucoup en souffrent .
" Enormément de personnes étrangères viennent et occupent les halls et étages , les ascenseurs sont bloqués , nous sommes " filtrés " à l'entrée par des jeunes encapuchonnés , les escaliers sont jonchés de détritus " , raconte un habitant , sous condition d'anonymat .
Mais quelques - uns en profitent , soit indirectement parce que leurs enfants y participent , soit directement parce qu'ils sont rémunérés .
X. , une petite cinquantaine d'années , mère de deux enfants , est salariée à temps partiel et gagne ainsi , légalement , 800 euros par mois .
Un jour , des jeunes du quartier sont venus lui demander les clés de son appartement .
Ils veulent y stocker une partie de la drogue et disposer d'un lieu de repli en cas d'intervention policière - un rôle de " nourrice " dans le jargon policier .
" J'avais vu que cette dame était en galère et qu'elle avait deux enfants , j'en ai un peu profité et je l'ai démarchée " , raconte Mustapha K .
La mère de famille n'a pas vraiment le choix : " C'est un grand qu'est venu m'expliquer comment cela allait se passer ; il m'a dit que je devais garder la banane du vendeur , le téléphone , pour que je le recharge de temps en temps , et je devais laisser entrer le vendeur qui aurait un passe en cas de descente de police . "
Rémunération : 150 euros par semaine .
Après quelques mois , la " nourrice " demande une augmentation parce que sa fille va avoir un bébé et qu'elle veut pouvoir lui offrir des cadeaux .
Résultat : 250 euros par semaine , déposés sur la table du salon .
Le fonctionnement est routinier .
Les vendeurs se succèdent , généralement pour des vacations d'une semaine .
Christopher A. , par exemple , 23 ans , éducateur sportif , repéré par les policiers lors de surveillances à cause de ses Nike Air Max noires : " J'arrivais vers 18 heures , pour le début du deal , je montais dans les étages , je récupérais le sac avec le produit , les gants , la cagoule et le téléphone .
Je vendais selon les ventes jusqu'à 20 h 30 - 21 heures .
Je redéposais tout le matériel , et je rentrais chez moi . "
Rémunération : entre 40 et 60 euros pour les trois heures de travail .
" Comment ça se passait quand ( le vendeur ) était poursuivi par les collègues ? " , demandent les policiers à la mère de famille .
" Oh ben , il arrivait essoufflé à la maison .
Il recevait un coup de fil et , à mon avis , on lui demandait s'il était bien arrivé parce que je l'entendais répondre oui . "
Le vendeur attend dans l'appartement qu'on lui confirme que les policiers sont partis .
Alors , il redescend dans les étages pour poursuivre ses ventes .
La mère de famille , ou sa fille , lave la cagoule des dealers une fois par semaine .
En seize mois , la " nourrice " estime avoir gagné un peu plus de 12 000 euros .
" J'ai joué , j'ai perdu "
Tous les soirs , au téléphone , les patrons font leurs comptes .
Leurs messages sont à peine codés .
De la " heub " ( verlan de " beuh " , qui signifie herbe ) .
Des " trucs " ou des " keutru " .
Des " parts de gâteau " , des " jeux " .
Une flopée de chiffres pour compter et recompter les stocks et les billets .
Le chiffre d'affaires tourne souvent entre 1 000 et 1 500 euros en trois heures .
Au téléphone , les chefs font aussi le point sur le nombre de clients .
Les bonnes et les mauvaises journées , quand les " ienclis " sont un peu moins nombreux .
Mais la place de la Boule est une bonne adresse , presque un label .
C'est d'ailleurs ce qui avait convaincu Abdel Latif B. , 28 ans , père d'un jeune enfant , sans emploi , de reprendre le trafic après avoir constaté qu'il n'était plus exploité sérieusement .
" Je m'étais aperçu ( que ) le trafic n'était pas très structuré .
C'était plus des vendeurs à la sauvette , et je suis allé voir Mustapha pour savoir s'il voulait m'épauler . "
Les deux hommes structurent leur " business " .
" J'organisais un peu le truc .
Je m'occupais du conditionnement , il m'arrivait de ramener de la marchandise .
Je n'étais pas souvent sur le terrain , mais quand j'y étais , je mettais en place le trafic .
Je m'assurais des recettes et du produit qui restaient " , explique Mustapha , déjà condamné pour trafic de stupéfiants dans le quartier .
" C'est un peu comme un commerce , il faut savoir quand il y a besoin de réapprovisionner " , note Abdel Latif .
Lui est chargé d'aller chercher la drogue dans un pavillon où une autre " nourrice " - un homme d'une quarantaine d'années - la conserve pour 150 euros par semaine .
Les stocks venaient probablement d'une cité du " 9 - 4 " , mais les policiers n'ont pu remonter la filière .
Pour les sans - grade du trafic , le business est à peine rentable .
Quelques centaines d'euros grappillés pour un risque pénal énorme .
Pour les cadres , l'activité est nettement plus intéressante mais n'en fait pas des millionnaires .
En vingt - deux mois , Mustapha dépose 11 000 euros en liquide sur son compte bancaire .
Sur cette période , il n'a quasiment pas effectué de retraits bancaires , signe qu'il a disposé de sommes importantes en liquide pour vivre .
Abdel Latif assure ne pas s'être enrichi , même s'il a pu s'acheter une Audi A3 à 17 000 euros .
A son domicile , les enquêteurs ont aussi saisi 21 000 euros en liquide .
Face aux policiers qui lui demandent qui a fourni le stock de drogue , Abdel Latif se fait philosophe : " Ça , je ne peux pas vous le dire , je ne le vous dirai jamais , c'est ma mentalité , c'est comme ça .
J'ai joué , j'ai perdu . "

Luc Bronner
I 'm not especially patriotic – I find the union flag a tad garish , and the white cliffs of Dover a touch bland – but the news that the US company Kraft had bought Cadbury came as a bitter blow .
It 's a very British thing , Cadbury .
We 've all got a great deal of fondness for it .
It 's one of the few home comforts you miss while you 're abroad , like the BBC or Marmite or self - deprecatory humour .
Considering how much imagination the Americans have , and how much they like food , it 's surprising we 're so much better at making chocolate than them .
And we are better .
I can still vividly ­recall trying Hershey 's chocolate for the first time .
The name held a certain glitzy allure : after all , I 'd heard it mentioned in countless Hollywood movies .
Like Oreo cookies and M&Ms , it was one of those brands you faintly revered even though – at the time – it was n't available­ in British shops .
So when I eventually got my hands on an authentic Hershey bar , it was quite an event .
I stared at the iconic packaging for about five minutes , as though it were a prop from the set of Ghostbusters , before unwrapping it with care , breaking a bit off and preparing to savour what would surely be the most powerfully glamorous chocolate ­experience imaginable .
But the moment the product itself hit my tongue I was plunged mouthwards into an entire universe of yuk .
In terms of flavour , it tasted precisely like I 'd swallowed a matchbox full of caster sugar five minutes earlier , then somehow regurgitated it into my own mouth .
And the texture was crumbly , dusty – slightly old even , as though this was a chocolate bar that had been found in the pocket of a civil war soldier and preserved specifically for my disenchantment .
It was so ­horrible , I charitably assumed there was something wrong with it .
I was eating it in England ( someone had brought it back from the States ) , so perhaps it had gone off somehow in transit .
But no .
Subsequent encounters proved I 'd got it right the first time .
Hershey 's tastes downright bad .
But then American mass - market snack food is downright bad in general .
They can't do crisps either .
In addition to 900 varieties of Walkers , we Brits produce Frazzles and Chipsticks and Monster Munch and all manner of wacky corn shapes , in flavours ranging from pickled onion to polar bear .
­Virtually all American crisps – or " chips " , as they doggedly insist on calling them – are prosaic constructions tasting vaguely of watered - down bright orange cheese .
We do bright orange cheese too , in the form of Wotsits , but we only did it once because we nailed it first time .
They 've got Cheetos in every shade of orange you could wish for ( Spicy Orange ! Smokey Orange ! ) , but they 're all a bit weak ; no match for the confident chemical oomph of a Wotsit .
A new range of uniquely British chocolate snacks
Cadbury 's Full English Breakfast .
Walkers have had a stab at a " full ­English breakfast " flavoured crisp , but the result was disappointing , to say the least , because it relied on various ­flavoured powders .
Cadbury 's Full English Breakfast bar would contain the real thing : fried egg , bacon , chips and beans , mashed and compacted into a Crunchie - sized slab , covered with a layer of ketchup , then swaddled in thick Dairy Milk chocolate .
It 'd look and weigh about the same as a Double Decker .
And yes , it sounds disgusting – but you 'd have to try it once , would n't you ?
Cadbury 's Real Ale Eggs .
Creme Eggs are all well and good , but there 's ­something vaguely continental about them .
How about promoting the real ale industry with a chocolate egg ­containing 2fl oz of Bishop 's Finger ?
If that fails to catch on , how about a range of special " Binge Drinker 's Eggs " – available only in " Happy Hour " packs of six – filled with sugary blue ­alcopop swaddled in thick Dairy Milk chocolate .
Cadbury 's Tardis Bars .
Nothing fancy : these are just Tardis - shaped slabs of chocolate – part of a range that includes Caramel Cybermen and Toffee Daleks .
But the proceeds go straight to the BBC , to help keep it afloat after Cameron gets in and sets about dismantling it to impress Rupert Murdoch .
Other BBC - themed snacks could include Holby City Liquorice Bandages , Panorama Mint Crisp Curls , and a disturbing 100 % edible lifesize replica of Terry Wogan 's head , replete with crunchy shortbread teeth , praline eyeballs and a brain made of nougat .
Swaddled in thick Dairy Milk chocolate .
As you may have noticed , the above suggestions work on the assumption that everything tastes nice when it 's swaddled in Dairy Milk chocolate .
Which it does .
A bloated , over - ripe corpse dredged from a polluted canal would taste nice if it was ­encased in a Dairy Milk shell .
If it was coated in Hershey 's , you 'd find yourself glumly picking the chocolate off to get at the sludgey grey flesh ­beneath .
And that 's a FACT .
Anjem Choudary is planning an extremist march through Wootton Bassett
The twisted cleric provoked outrage by comparing British troops to Nazi stormtroopers and telling parents of dead soldiers that their children had died in vain .
Politicians and bereaved families were joined by moderate Muslims in condemning the radical ’s plans for a march of Islamic extremists through Wootton Bassett , Wilts .
Almost a quarter of a million people have signed an online petition objecting to the march through the town famous for honouring UK soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the protest march would be “ completely inappropriate ” .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he would have “ no hesitation ” in supporting a ban if requested by police or the council .
“ The idea that anyone would stage this kind of demonstration in Wootton Bassett fills me with revulsion , ” he said .
Choudary ’s plan emerged as British forces suffered their first loss this year .
A soldier , from the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment , died while on foot patrol in Helmand Province on Sunday .
Muslim organisations fear Choudary is trying to wreck racial and religious harmony in Britain so he can recruit youngsters to militant Islam .
Counter - terrorism think - tank the Quilliam Foundation said : “ Anjem Choudary ’s plan to march through Wootton Bassett is a disgusting and transparent attempt to divide the UK ’s communities . ”
Shahid Mursaleen , of Minhaj - ul - Quran International UK , said : “ The Government must ensure that the law - abiding British Muslim youth do not fall prey to such extremists . ”
In remarks designed to cause maximum offence , Choudary compared fallen British heroes to Nazis and said 500 of his radical group Islam4UK would carry symbolic coffins in memory of the Muslim civilians “ murdered by merciless ” coalition forces .
Choudary , a former lawyer who rakes in more than £ 25,000 a year in welfare handouts , admitted his march was a publicity stunt , saying : “ The sad reality of the situation is that if I were to hold it somewhere else it would not have the media attention that it has now . ”
Soldiers ’ families expressed horror that Choudary , 42 , was “ hijacking ” Wootton Bassett for political purposes .
Becky Ormrod , wife of Royal Marine Mark Ormrod , who lost three limbs fighting the Taliban , said Islam4UK should be banned along with the march .
She said : “ To even consider it is beyond human decency .
It ’s like spitting on the graves of our fallen heroes . ”
Tracy Leslie , whose son James Brown , 18 , died saving innocent Afghans after he stopped a suicide bomb attack , said : “ No matter what your faith is we should respect each other . ”
The repatriation of two more soldiers killed in Afghanistan will take place today .

Prepare to have your paradigms shifted
ON FEBRUARY 10th the world of psychiatry will be asked , metaphorically , to lie on the couch and answer questions about the state it thinks it is in .
For that is the day the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) plans to release a draft of the fifth version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - V ) .
Mental illness carrying the stigma that it does , and the brain being as little - understood as it is , revising the DSM is always a controversial undertaking .
This time , however , some of the questions asked of the process are likely to be particularly probing .
The DSM , the first version of which was published in 1952 , lists recognised psychological disorders and the symptoms used to diagnose them .
In the United States , what is in it influences whether someone will be diagnosed with an illness at all , how he will be treated if he is so diagnosed , and whether his insurance company will pay for that treatment .
Researchers in other countries generally defer to the DSM , too , making the manual 's definitions a lingua franca for the science of medical psychology .
And , perhaps most profoundly , the DSM influences how mental illness is understood by society at large .
A new DSM , then , is an important document .
The APA has been working on the latest revision since 1999 , and will not release the final version until May 2013 .
But some people are already accusing it of excessive secrecy and being too ambitious about the changes it proposes .
Those critics will be picking over the draft next week to see if their fears have been realised .
Manual dexterity
The original DSM reflected the “ psychodynamic ” view of mental illness , in which problems were thought to result from an interplay between personality and life history .
( Think Freud , Jung and long hours recounting your childhood and dreams . )
The third version , which was published in 1980 , took a more medical approach .
Mental illnesses were seen as distinct and classifiable , like physical diseases .
DSM - III came with checklists of symptoms that allowed straightforward , unambiguous diagnosis .
Psychiatry began to seem less like an art form and more like a science .
DSM -III also introduced many more diagnoses than had appeared before .
These included attention - deficit disorder ( see article ) , post - traumatic stress disorder and social phobia .
In fact , the number of specific diagnoses more than doubled between DSM - I and DSM - III , from 106 to 265 .
DSM -IV , published in 1994 , increased the number to 297 , but left the underlying model alone .
The APA 's DSM - V task force , however , has suggested it would like to introduce a “ new paradigm ” into the manual .
It wants to recognise that many conditions , such as anxiety and depression , tend to overlap , so that a diagnosis of only one or the other does not always make sense .
The new version of the DSM is also expected to include a “ dimensional ” component , one that considers the severity as well as the nature of symptoms .
This could lead to the paradoxical situation of a symptom ( minor depression , for example ) being classified as being below the threshold for the diagnosis of a disease , but nevertheless still being regarded as a problem — leaving the individual so diagnosed in a weird medical limbo .
The chairmen of two previous DSM task forces have been particularly critical of the present effort .
In a letter to Psychiatric Times , written last June , for example , Allen Frances , a psychiatrist at Duke University who chaired the DSM - IV task force , accused his successors of being too secretive , and of closing themselves off from outside opinion .
He also worried that adding dimensional ratings to the DSM could lead to many more diagnoses based on symptoms that would previously have placed an individual in the normal range .
Pharmaceutical companies , eager to expand their markets , would be tempted to pounce on these new “ patients ” .
Dr Frances was supported by Robert Spitzer , a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University who was chairman of the DSM - III task force .
Members of the present task force , led by Alan Schatzberg , president of the APA , fired back a letter pointing out that they have held conferences , presented papers and consulted more than 200 outside advisers .
They also accused Dr Frances and Dr Spitzer of having a financial interest in books based on the DSM - IV criteria .
The two admit to receiving royalties , but say it has nothing to do with their criticism .
In the meantime , particular groups who may or may not be classified as “ diseased ” are also concerned about what ends up in the manual .
Some of those with Asperger 's syndrome — who find it hard to “ read ” the emotional states and intentions of others , but have otherwise typical intellectual faculties — are worried by hints that their condition might be included under the more general heading of “ autism spectrum disorder ” .
That would lump them with people whose intelligence is profoundly impaired .
Transsexuals , meanwhile , want the diagnoses of “ gender identity disorder ” and “ transvestic fetishism ” that the new DSM is expected to promulgate changed to be more respectful and less judgmental .
In fact , any changes to the list of sexual disorders , including a possible new category called “ hypersexual disorder ” , are bound to get attention .
February 10th will be the first chance most people , including the critics , have to look at the document .
When they do , the criticism is likely to get louder .
After all , the effort to classify and categorise disorders of something as complex as the human mind — especially when that categorisation is done by committee — is unlikely to please everybody .
It will be interesting to see what direction the new DSM is going in , and whether it stands up to analysis .
Dreaming of biting into a garden - fresh cucumber sandwich this summer ?
Better order your seeds now .
A poor growing season last year and increased orders from Europe could make it difficult for home gardeners to get seeds for the most popular cucumber variety and some vegetables this spring .
Farmers , who usually grow different varieties from home gardeners , are n't likely to be affected .
Seeds for what 's known as open - pollinated cucumbers seem to be most scarce , but carrots , snap peas , and onions also could be in short supply .
" I suspect there will be some seeds you just wo n't be able to buy if you wait too long on it , " says Bill Hart , the wholesale manager in charge of seed purchasing at Chas .
C. Hart Seed Co. in Wethersfield , Conn .
" The sugar snap peas we 're not able to get at all , and other companies that have it will sell out pretty quickly . "
The problem is primarily due to soggy weather last year that resulted in a disappointing seed crop .
European seed growers also had a bad year , leading to a big increase in orders for American seeds .
Demand for seeds in the U.S. soared last year , as the poor economy and worries about chemical use and bacteria contamination prompted many people to establish gardens .
Homegrown food seemed safer and more affordable .
But some wonder if the wet weather that ruined gardens in many areas last summer will discourage first - time gardeners from planting again .
" A lot of people are getting into it , but it was a disastrous year for gardens last year because it was so cold and wet , " says wholesale seed distributor Mel Brekke , who owns Brekke 's Town and Country near Ames , Iowa .
Kathy Gocke of Bondurant , Iowa , says she orders seeds early for herself and her county 's master gardener 's program and advises others to do the same .
" If you do it before the first of January , they have a pretty good stock , " Ms. Gocke says .
Burpee Seeds in Warminster , Pa. , bills itself as the largest provider of home garden seeds , and Chief Executive Officer George Ball says the company 's huge reserves mean it will have plenty of seeds .
But Ball says he understands why others might have limited supplies after a big spike in demand in the past two years .
" It was unlike anything I 've seen in the past 30 years , " he says .
Barbara Melera , owner of D. Landreth Seeds of New Freedom , Pa. , expects carrot seeds to be especially hard to find because of big orders from Europe , which had a poor crop last year .
Also , fewer farmers are opting to grow seeds , she says .
Many now have switched to growing corn for the biofuels industry .
" In this country , farmers who grow things for seed are becoming an endangered species , " Ms. Melera says .
" The farms producing things for seeds is reduced significantly , and in the past two to three years they can get more money for growing corn for ethanol plants than carrots for seeds . "
Jennifer Nothwehr , seed coordinator for the Shenandoah , Iowa - based Earl May seed and nursery business , says she has n't run into shortages , but her company typically orders its seeds from wholesalers a year in advance .
They received and packaged the seeds they 'll sell this year last fall , and because they set prices last spring , any shortage wo n't affect them .
Nothwehr also says that while popular varieties , like one known as the straight eight cucumber , may be hard to find , others are available .
" One of the most popular carrots we can't get , but we have four other varieties we can get if a customer wants to try something different , " she says .
Hart says his family business has a small retail operation , and he 's noticed people coming in earlier than usual this year , possibly because of worries over a shortage of seeds .
" I do n't know if they 're hoping for spring or just hoping to get going , " he says .

O projeto que vai alavancar o turismo em Rio Grande
Créditos : Engº. Carlos Gustavo Marcondes – Assessor Técnico Comercial Itambé
Com o edital de licitação lançado no último dia 30 de outubro para a construção do Oceanário Brasil , Rio Grande passa a viver um momento de grande expectativa em relação ao turismo , que sofrerá um aumento contínuo de visitantes ao longo dos anos .
O projeto da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande ( Furg ) é inédito no país e é de grande alcance turístico , científico , tecnológico e educacional .
Rio Grande é uma cidade intrinsecamente ligada ao mar , que possui grande biodiversidade e muitos estudos reconhecidos direcionados ao ambiente marinho .
Apesar de viver em uma cidade litorânea , desfrutando da gastronomia típica , do lazer e da renda que a atividade no mar proporciona , a população muitas vezes nem imagina as riquezas que o mar possui .
Com o Oceanário , os moradores , estudantes , pesquisadores e turistas terão a oportunidade de conhecer os segredos do Oceano Atlântico e sua relação com as bacias hidrográficas brasileiras .
O Oceanário é um projeto do reitor da universidade , João Carlos Cousin , que surgiu durante a realização do seu mestrado e doutorado na cidade de Brest , na França .
Cousin acompanhou o desenvolvimento da cidade com a construção de um Oceanário e planejou a obra para Rio Grande .
“ Irá alavancar ainda mais o desenvolvimento .
Na América Latina , não temos um complexo desse porte .
Vai ser um exemplo para o mundo em termos de construção , cuidados e manutenção ” , avaliou .
O Oceanário Brasil será construído em um Parque Ecológico , localizado entre o Balneário Cassino e os Molhes da Barra , em uma área de 176 hectares do lado do Oceano Atlântico .
A previsão é de que no final de 2012 , a obra esteja concluída .
O investimento é de R$ 140 milhões .
Atualmente , a Furg procura parcerias para a obra .
O Oceanário será dividido em Ala Norte , Sul , Leste , Oeste e Central .
O complexo Oceanário contará ainda com um Centro de Educação , Ciência , Tecnologia e Inovação Oceanográfica , área de apoio técnico , Espaço Artesanal de Economia Solidária , torre mirante , teleférico , quiosques , lago e estacionamento .
De acordo com o reitor da Furg , o Oceanário terá espelhos d’água , estrutura metálica e um tanque central , considerado um dos maiores do mundo .

A ala Sul abrigará o espa%C
This is kind of a complex matter in speaking , but I will try to provide a synopsis of that has taken place :
Let us deal with some simple facts of life .
Troubled borrowers pay a high rate of interest .
And the Bagehot rule , a principle much admired by central bankers , but seldom observed of late , holds that the central bank should lend freely to a failing bank , against high - quality collateral and at a punitive rate .
That was the logic of the original AIG deal , which from a structural standpoint , was the only bailout that made any sense .
But then the deal was retraded .
The original financing was $ 85 billion , secured by all of AIG ’s assets , with a interest rate of 8.5 % over Libor , which translated into 11.5 % , From the Fed ’s press release : The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday , with the full support of the Treasury Department , authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $ 85 billion to the American International Group ( AIG ) under section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
The secured loan has terms and conditions designed to protect the interests of the U.S. government and taxpayers ...
The AIG facility has a 24 - month term .
Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance at a rate of three - month Libor plus 850 basis points .
AIG will be permitted to draw up to $ 85 billion under the facility .
The interests of taxpayers are protected by key terms of the loan .
The loan is collateralized by all the assets of AIG , and of its primary non-regulated subsidiaries .
These assets include the stock of substantially all of the regulated subsidiaries .
The loan is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the firm ’s assets .
The U.S. government will receive a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders .
Now as readers of Andrew Ross Sorkin ’s Too Big Too Fail may have noticed , there was a stunner in how this came about .
Wall Street ( namely , the god of syndicated lending , Jimmy Lee ) has determined he could raise $ 50 billion on the terms outlined above , which fell short of what AIG needed .
( There is another amazing vignette , when AIG needs a $ 14 billion overnight loan from the Fed , and Geithner demands collateral .
CEO Wilmustad wonders how they will come up with that " in the next few minutes " and someone remembers " the unofficial vaults . "
In the same office , AIG had " tens of billions " of physical bonds , apparently not recorded on the balance sheet .
WTF ?
What kind of organization is about to run completely out of money , and then remembers it has " tens of billions " sitting around ?
Obviously someone DID know , and chose to keep that little fact secret . )
So why did the NY Fed suddenly decide to fund all on its own ?
Why did n’t the Fed just lend along side the other firms on the same terms ?
I ’d much rather have a bunch of Wall Street SOBs overseeing AIG than the half - hearted minders at the Fed .
When the financial services industry rescued LTCM , the consortium insisted , despite the howl of protest , that the LTCM principals receive a mere $ 250 K a year ( no performance bonuses ) to wind down the operation .
Adjusted for inflation , that ’s less than $ 400 K in current dollars .
Then we get to all the insane retrades of the deal , with no attempt at justification .
Less than a month after the original deal , AIG was back to the well , and received an additional $ 37.8 billion :
Under this program , the New York Fed will borrow up to $ 37.8 billion in investment - grade , fixed - income securities from AIG in return for cash collateral .
These securities were previously lent by AIG ’s insurance company subsidiaries to third parties .
Now there had been discussion at the time of the initial loan that part of it was to cover a big hole in the insurer ’s securities lending operations .
Note that there was no mention of the terms , which are presumably less punitive than the original facility , and it glosses over the little fact that since the original loan was secured by all the assets of AIG , that securing this loan with those particular securities reduces the collateral backing the original $ 85 billion loan .
Then a week later , AIG asked for permission to borrow up to $ 10 billion under the Fed ’s commercial paper facility .
Given the inability to latch on to more assets to support a loan , any normal lender would insist on even more harsh terms for incremental financing .
And the evidence was clear , as of mid-October 2008 , AIG was having difficulty finding buyers for its insurance operations .
Even with the miraculous recovery in the stock market , AIG has still had trouble monetizing its supposedly valuable operations .
As we said back in November 2008 , went in for a third retrade :
Look at the list of terms above .
The government has the right to seize absolutely everything of value AIG has until it pays off the loans , hold virtually all of the equity , and can veto many key actions ( the senior position with respect to the assets gives it more rights than those listed above ) .
Think of AIG as a felon : until it pays its debts to society , it has virtually no rights ....
Now given AIG ’s liquidity needs , and the object of this exercise ( not to have AIG go under ) the second loan was presumably necessary , but the efforts to dress it up as as a loan against collateral is an amusing fiction ( all this second loan does is degrade the collateral against the original loan .
There are no free lunches here , except , of course , for AIG ) .
Again , if we go back to the felon metaphor , the state had budgeted X for his care , but it turns out he has a really nasty disease that really has to be treated or it will infect the entire prison population and the guards too , so the cost of his incarceration has gone from X to X + Y .
But now we get to the heinous part .
AIG should have no rights at this point .
Zero. Zip. Nada .
The government already on the hook for an open - ended liability .
Yet the Fed is treating AIG as a party that has rights and is negotiating with them , as opposed to dictating terms .
This is staggering .
And what happened ?
The original facility was scrapped , a new one , nearly twice as large as the original ( $ 150 billion ) was put in place , with " considerably " more favorable terms .
As we noted earlier : ... there is only one legitimate reason for modifying the terms of AIG ’s loans : that the cash outflow for the interest might be so high that it is worsening the liquidity pressures on AIG .
Fine , Keep the interest payments the same , but allow a significant portion ( 50 % ? 65 %? ) to be deferred and added to principal .
A second issue mentioned in today ’s Wall Street Journal was that AIG is now concerned that they might not be able to repay the loan in two years .
Fine .
Extend the term another year .
Those are the ONLY changes warranted .
Remember , AIG does NOT has any God - given right to existence .
If every significant operation AIG has must be sold to repay the taxpayer , and AIG ceases to exist , that would be a perfectly fine outcome .
A systemic collapse would have been avoided , taxpayers would have gotten as much as possible out of a bad situation , and AIG would be liquidated in an orderly fashion .
What is wrong with that picture ?
Instead , AIG is being coddled for no reason whatsoever .
And we have had ..... drumroll .... yet another retrade !
But notice how little attention this one received ( and I have to confess I did not make noise about it at the time due to competing deadlines ) .
With all the high - profile animated movies out there now , it would be a loss if " A Town Called Panic " was stampeded in the shuffle .
This marvelous little Belgian gem is making the rounds , and it's as funny , and often as inventive , as , for starters , " Up " and " Fantastic Mr. Fox . "
A spinoff of a popular Belgian TV series , it was the only stop- motion animated film ever chosen as an official selection at the Cannes film festival .
It has no elaborate computer - generated effects , no 3 - D. Nothing is hand - drawn , as in " The Princess and the Frog . "
Instead , it opts for one of the oldest techniques in the biz .
And , unlike the stop - motion " Mr. Fox , " it dispenses with celebrity voices altogether .
All we see are animated plastic toys – a horse , a cowboy , an Indian chief , tractors , pigs , cows , deep - sea divers – of the sort you might find strewn across a boy 's messy bedroom floor .
Stéphane Aubier and Vincent Patar , the Belgian filmmaking team responsible for " A Town Called Panic , " have described how they came to create their characters : " We hit on the idea while visiting flea markets and garage sales on Sundays .
Because dinosaurs and the figurines from manga [ Japanese comics ] were all the rage , kids had lost interest in older , basic toys like cowboys and Indians and farm animals .
So we decided to rescue these poor orphans . "
The rescue operation takes the form of a crazy - quilt story line – the kind a kid might concoct on that messy bedroom floor – that defies easy summarization .
Essentially , Horse , Cowboy , and Indian live together in a ramshackle house in the countryside next door to their belligerent neighbor , Steven , who cares only for his tractor .
For a surprise birthday present , Cowboy and Indian order 50 bricks to build Horse a barbecue – except the order gets fouled up and 50 million bricks are delivered instead .
From there , things get increasingly out of hand – or hoof .
Horse falls for his piano teacher , Madame Longrée ( she has a crimson mane and big , big eyes ) , but , along with his two cohorts , gets sucked into an undersea alternate universe .
( The entryway is a pond on the property . )
All is right in the end , but not before the characters are put through enough paces to make even a Rube Goldberg contraption seem rudimentary .
I do n't wish to make this film sound as if only 8 - year - olds will enjoy it .
In its own wiggy way , it 's a sophisticated fantasia that adults should enjoy equally .
( In other words , it 's the perfect family entertainment . )
It draws on a vast storehouse of influences – including Buster Keaton , Jacques Tati , the " Toy Story " films , and " South Park , " as well as such marvels as " The Triplets of Belleville " and " Monty Python 's Flying Circus " – but its humor and way of seeing are all its own .
The plastic figures move with a herky - jerky rapidity that is matched by the blurty , rapid - fire voices .
( It 's in French with English subtitles . )
The frenetic pace has a lovely , slapstick grace , and some of the visual throwaways , like the octopus that plays drums at Horse 's party , or Horse 's lovely mane - nuzzling dream dance with his paramour , are wondrous and funny at the same time .
After a longish lull , there is much to be thankful for these days in the realm of animation – not only the Pixar films and the marvelous movies of Hayao Miyazaki ( most recently " Ponyo " ) , but also such one - of - a- kind personal memoirs as " Persepolis " and " Waltz With Bashir . "
In its own pipsqueak way , " A Town Called Panic " holds its own in this select company .
Teenagers need at least nine hours sleep a night , say experts Going to bed earlier protects teenagers against depression and suicidal thoughts , New York research suggests .
Of 15,500 12 to 18 - year - olds studied , those who went to bed after midnight were 24 % more likely to have depression than those who went before 2200 .
And those who slept fewer than five hours a night had a 71 % higher risk of depression than those who slept eight hours , the journal Sleep reports .
It is estimated 80,000 UK children and young people have depression .
The researchers from Columbia University Medical Center in New York looked at data from 15,500 teenagers collected in the 1990s .
One in 15 of those studied were found to have depression .
Enough sleep , good food and regular exercise are all essential to stay emotionally healthy
Sarah Brennan , YoungMinds
As well as the higher risk of depression , those who were set a bedtime by their parents of after midnight were 20 % more likely to think about suicide than those whose bedtime was 2200 or earlier .
Those who had less than five hours sleep a night were thought to have a 48 % higher risk of suicidal thoughts compared with those who had eight hours of sleep .
Teenagers who reported they " usually get enough sleep " were 65 % less likely to be depressed .
Depression and suicidal thoughts were also more likely in girls , older teenagers and in those who had a lower self - perception of how much parents care about them .
Most of the parents of the adolescents in the study set a bedtime of 2200 or earlier .
A quarter set a bedtime of midnight or later .
On average the teenagers were having seven hours and 53 minutes sleep a night - less than the nine hours recommended at that age .

Study leader Dr James Gangwisch said although it was possible that youngsters with depression struggle to sleep , the fact that parental set bedtimes were linked with depression suggests that a lack of sleep is somehow underpinning the development of the condition .
He said a lack of sleep could affect emotional brain responses and lead to moodiness that hindered the ability to cope with daily stresses .
This moodiness could affect judgment , concentration and impulse control .
Regular exercise " Adequate quality sleep could therefore be a preventative measure against depression and a treatment for depression , " he added .
Sarah Brennan , chief executive at the mental health charity YoungMinds , said : " Enough sleep , good food and regular exercise are all essential to stay emotionally healthy .
" Nearly 80,000 children and young people suffer with depression , yet we are still failing to provide our young people with the help and support to cope with it and prevent it .
" Providing parents with information about how to look after your body , for example by getting enough sleep , and how to get help if they are worried about their teenager , will ensure problems are tackled early and prevent serious mental health conditions such as depression . "

So I walked into the office the other day to discover a glowering Carl seated at his desk .
Now , usually , it takes him the better part of the morning to work his way up to a full glower but , on this particular day , Carl was already there the second I walked in .
When I asked him what was up , he informed me that he might have to start boycotting my blog because , in his opinion , some of the fan comments had crossed the line .
While he is all for constructive criticism , he apparently takes exception when fans start labeling characters “ whores ” or suggesting the producers should consider killing off certain characters , especially when its common knowledge that the actors playing said characters check out the blog .
And not only the actors , but their immediate family as well .
Sadly , the negativity has also taken its toll on one - time regular Sherry , proud mother of actor Brian J. Smith , who , surprised and saddened by some of the hostility here , has elected to no longer read the blog .
Also , after several months of connecting with fandom online , Brian is stepping away from his popular twitter account for much the same reason .
Some of the very same fans who he was kind enough to open up a dialogue with in the run-up to the premiere started leaving him nasty comments as though he was responsible for the show ’s creative direction .
I imagine that if Robert Carlyle was on twitter , these same morons would be berating him for being mean to his fellow Destiny crew members .
I find myself in an awkward position .
On the one hand , I want to keep this blog ’s comment section open to differing opinions and allow fans to express their honest feelings about the show ; on the other hand , I do n’t want it to turn into a battleground where fans can feel free to insult the production , its personal , and each other .
I have to walk a very fine line and , sometimes , I will let a comment through that may be deemed borderline in order to respond to a “ distilled ” representation of an oft - repeated opinion .
For the most part , I do n’t think it ’s gotten all that bad here ( I ’ve read worse on other forums and even moderated worse ) .
Still , I ’d suggest that anyone looking to post a critical comment consider their wording – not their opinion , but the way in which they express said opinion .
Sometimes , you can be offensive without even meaning to .
And , when this happens , rather making a good point , you risk alienating the very people you ’re trying to convince .
For example , amidst all of the ongoing discussion about the Scott - James scene in the pilot , the Scott - Chloe scene in Light , and the burgeoning relationship between Scott and Chloe , someone here referred to Chloe as a whore .
Now never mind the fact that we have only seen the Chloe character be intimate with all of one other character so far , and this only after bonding with him following the loss of her father and as both faced what seemed like certain death and thus took advantage of the only opportunity they would have to be together .
So how do you think someone on the production would react to such a comment ?
Would they stop and consider the message at the heart of it ?
Unfortunately , no .
They dismiss the poster and her opinion as extreme and move on .
Also realize – if it has n’t become apparent by now – that we love our cast and are very protective of them .
Trust me when I say that there ’s no better way to guarantee a character ’s long and fruitful stay on a show than to insist we get rid of them .
Keep in mind that the simple fact others in your particular online niche share an opinion does n’t make it the prevailing attitude among the show ’s viewers .
In order to head off any potential frustration on the part of those who are unhappy with SGU ’s direction , allow me to make a few points that may save you time and effort in any attempt to change some of the creative choices we ’ve made .
SGU is NOT SG - 1 or Atlantis .
It ’s a different show in terms of tone and characters .
If you ’re expecting flawless people , square - jawed heroes , and stories that set up and deliver all the answers over the course of a forty - five minute episode , you WILL be disappointed .
And DON ’T expect that to change .
If you do n’t like the character interactions , romance , and open - ended story elements introduced to date , you ’re in for a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong haul because that ’s our show .
Unlike the more kid-friendly SG - 1 and Atlantis with its wholesale slaughters of enemy combatants , tortures , stabbings , and occasional live burnings , Universe will touch on the heinous topic of physically intimacy .
These “ sex scenes ” , which amounted to approximately 1 whole minute of the 270 minutes aired to date , engendered a fair amount of controversy .
And that ’s fine .
I do n’t mind continuing to read and approve your comments on the subject so long as you do n’t mind knowing that nothing will change in this respect and that if you were offended by that broom closet scene in Air I , I guarantee you ’ll be clawing your eyes out of your skull given what we have in store later this season .
Also , while I can understand why some may have had a problem with that broom - closet scene in the premiere given that it did come as a surprise to many , I ca n’t muster up much empathy or understanding for those complaining about the Scott - Chloe scene in Light .
Again , if it ’s a matter of not enjoying shows that focus on the occasional romance between characters , then that ’s unfortunate – because that ’s the type of show you ’re watching .
If , on the other hand , it ’s an innate response to the very notion of intimacy no matter how modest the scene , then I ’d suggest a deep - rooted personal issue that would be best dealt with somewhere other than this blog .
Finally , some words of advice – words of advice not so much for those of you here but those leaving comments on other forums and websites ( if you would be kind enough to pass the message along ) : STOP MAKING IDIOT COMMENTS .
Note I did n’t say idiotic comments because that would imply that the lion ’s share of the idiocy lies with the comment itself rather than the commentator .
No , I mean : STOP MAKING IDIOT COMMENTS .
For example , say you have a problem with the James scene in Darkness in which she threatens Riley and Eli after they try spying on her with the kino .
You can go ahead and make an argument for the scene being sexist ( although I ’d argue that there ’s a difference between the scene being sexist and the characters in the scene acting inappropriately , especially given that a clearly disappointed Young admonishes both men ) , but if , in the body of your comment or any subsequent comment , you refer to the James character as Lieutenant Rack or McBoobs , then you ’re a hypocrite who has successfully undermined their argument by demonstrating you ca n’t be taken seriously .
Also , you ’re an idiot .
If you want to express your opinion and argue why you feel that scene was sexist , then by all means do so .
If , however , you dismiss anyone expressing a differing opinion , despite the fact that they go through the trouble of presenting a cogent counter - argument , simply on the basis of their sex ( “ Oh , look !
Another privilege man trying to tell us woman that something is not sexist !
Wow , what a surprise !
What a shock !
What a revelation ! ” – compliments of one grade school level narow - minded poster here : xxx ) , why bother posting on a public forum .
Rather , pick a private sub - forum where everyone is guaranteed to agree with your opinion or , better yet , imagine you live in a wonderful world where everyone thinks you ’re brilliant and sees eye to eye with you on everything .
Hmmm .
A lot less ranty than I ’d expected two days ago when I had originally planned to tackle this topic .
Still , ranty enough to ensure some thin - skinned faction of fandom will be whining and stomping its feet in response .

Ethnomycology !
What a mouthful .
Ethnomycology is the study of how people have used fungi – as food , tinder , medicine , and spiritual tool – and how this use has influenced them .
Many cultures of the world consider mushrooms to be sacred curers of sickness and givers of information .
You ’ve probably heard of the Amanita muscaria , that handsome red mushroom with white spots , or maybe even of the Psilocybe mushrooms of Mexico , so sacred they were called “ God ’s Flesh . ”
An intriguing but less discussed topic is the use of fungi by Native Americans of North America .
Haploporus odorus is found above 52 degrees latitude in Canada and Northwestern Europe .
It is a polypore – a stalkless shelf - like fungus with pores on its undersurface .
It is white , hoof - shaped , and grows on willow trees in conifer forests .
Upon close observation one can easily notice the unique characteristic of H. odorus – its smell .
The fruiting bodies have a strong odor of anise , kind of like licorice .
This smell is strong and persistent , and dried specimens retain their odor .
Native Americans appreciated the smells of plants like sage and sweet grass and used these plants for purification rituals .
Because of its strong fragrance and other medicinal properties , Haploporus odorus has been an important fungus in the culture of Northern Plains Indians .
Indians used H. odorus as a spiritual symbol , a decoration of sacred objects and a healing tool .
The fungus was used to stop wounds from bleeding , made into an infusion to treat diarrhea and dysentery , and combined with another fungus in an infusion to treat coughs .
It was burned to produce healing perfumed smoke , and some elders wore necklaces of pieces of the fungus strung on a leather thong as protection against becoming ill .
Indians took this fungus from the willow tree , carved it into smooth ovals , and then decorated them with burnt line patterns .
Some pieces of fungus were strung onto leather thongs to create necklaces –have a look at this Alberta Plains necklace and ermine ornament courtesy of the Canadian Museum of Civilization .
Other pieces were used to create medicine bundles – powerful collections of sacred objects .
So revered was this fungus that the Native Americans even used it as an adornment on sacred war robes and scalp necklaces .
It ’s clear that it was associated with protection and power .
Another interesting fungus ( though not so sacred ) is Phellinus igniarius .
This polypore grows on birch trees in the interior of northern North America .
Native American use of this fungus has been recorded since the 19th century .
Coastal Alaskan peoples traded with the Yukon Indians of the interior to obtain it .
The Yupik and Dena peoples of the far northwest kept the ashes of P. igniarius in small , beautifully decorated boxes .
The boxes were made of ivory , wood , or bone , and then decorated with materials like strips of antler , polished walrus teeth , and tufts of seal hair .
You ’re probably wondering , ‘ Why in the world would anyone keep fungus ashes in beautiful boxes ? ’
Phellinus igniarius was , and still is today , widely used by the Yupik of Alaska as a masticatory and for smoking purposes .
Before tobacco was introduced by the Europeans , the Yupik mixed the burnt fungus ashes with other plant materials , such as cottonwood bark , and smoked or made a quid out of this mixture .
Later , they mixed the ashes with tobacco to give it a “ powerful kick . ”
Today , the ash - tobacco mixture is sold in native Alaskan communities under the name iqmik .
Please read more about iqmik in this fine essay by Diane Pleninger and Tom Volk , and see a slideshow on iqmik and its dangerous impacts courtesy of Alaska Magazine .
It turns out that the alkaline chemicals in the fungus enhance the absorption of nicotine .
It ’s no wonder that one Indian name for Phellinus igniarius is “ elch ’ix ” , which translates as “ burning taste . ”
Perhaps the most intriguing use of fungi in North America is the Northwest Coast tribes ’ use of Fomitopsis officinalis .
This perennial polypore grows against conifer tree trunks in a columnar shape that can reach up to one meter in height .
Fomitopsis officinalis was used to treat many ailments .
But a significant use of this fungus was revealed only recently .
What scientists once thought were carved wooden figures were revealed to be carved of F. officinalis fruiting bodies !
These figures were used to guard the graves of shamans .
After a shaman ’s death , the carved fungus figures were placed at the head of the grave in order to send a message that the grave was occupied by spirits .
[ Editor ’s note : we ’ll take a closer look at this species in the next post … ]
There ’s still much to learn about the uses of fungi by indigenous peoples of North America .
It ’s clear that these living things were perceived as powerful and mystical objects , and played an important role in Native American culture .
Full Circle : A return to the West Kootenays
More than 27 years had gone by since I last bicycled the undulating roads of the West Kootenays .
That was too long , I ’d recently decided , and made a visit part of my holiday itinerary , following duties at the Lake Louise control of the 2008 Rocky Mountain 1200 randonee .
In Nelson , B.C. ( 533 m ) , I readied my Rivendell Blériot bicycle and left the motel around 07:30 , heading 20 kilometres west , on Highway 3A / 6 , toward Castlegar , following the winding Kootenay River , 19 kilometres to South Slocan .
Here , I turned north onto Highway 6 proper , into the Slocan Valley .
The morning air was still refreshingly cool after the previous night ’s thundershower , sweet with grasses and fragrant blossoms amidst green farmlands .
But , as I began the first difficult ascent along Slocan Lake toward Silverton , the mercury had also climbed .
Shortly before I ’d stopped at a roadside café for morning coffee and to strip off my leg and arm warmers .
On the approach to New Denver ( 556 m ) , I was dousing myself with water bottle showers to keep the “ radiator ” from boiling over .
I spent an hour in the old mining town , mostly at the Apple Tree Café , downing a cup of hearty soup and half a tuna sandwich ( the rest wrapped for later ) , before turning east onto Highway 31A .
New Denver , BC
Now I was on the route I ’d cycled before , on my tour of 1981 .
I knew — and the memory was as vivid as if it were yesterday — that I ’d soon be flying down a steep hill toward a dangerous , narrow bridge over a foaming creek .
What the old brain had let flow into some remote cerebral “ cache ” was the recollection of the steep climb out of New Denver … and the temperature out on the road was now 30°C !
The narrow Bailey bridge has , it turns out , been replaced with a wide concrete span and the “ L ” corner rearranged into a more navigable curve , with the creek redirected through a big culvert .
In contrast to the near - disastrous descent of yesteryear , survived on my sturdy Nishiki Landau , I crossed the bridge without incident , pausing only to take a comparison photo before beginning the next climb , culminating in a steep switchback at the Sandon Road intersection .
But the work did n’t end there .
If the mind is inclined to bury painful memories , then mine did a good job of interning 20 kilometres of almost continuous vertical suffering –529 metres , in total — up to the pass .
Perhaps I was young and virile back then , but my journal for May 22 , 1981 notes drily : “ Once up and over Zincton Summit , it was one long … cruise , down to Kaslo .
Pushed 80 ” [ gear ] all the way . ”
However , the entry then meanders discursively , pondering strange states of consciousness and out - of - body experiences , brought on , I surmise , by “ fatigue . ”
This year I enter a similar zombie - like dimension and , before I realize it , pass the summit missing the Zincton ruins and the rough cabin built by Del , the squatter from South London .
Perhaps I really had crossed into the Twilight Zone those decades ago .
Maybe , crazy Del and the crumbling ghost town were figments of my fevered brow .
Maybe they do n’t call this the “ Valley of Ghosts ” for nothing !
But what of the “ photographic evidence ” I brought back ?
It seems those fading Kodachromes are all that is left .
One thing is certain :
My record of the descent to Kaslo ( 542 m ) was spot on — a 30 kilometre swoop through mountain air , chilled by the rushing waters of the Kaslo River , racing me down to Kootenay Lake
In 1981 , my day ended here on the lakeshore .
I ’d ridden 100 hilly kilometres over from Nakusp on Upper Arrow Lake , a widening of the Columbia River , swollen by the construction of the Keenleyside Dam .
Today , with 150 kilometres on the odometer , there remains 70 kilometres to my destination .
A couple of snapshots on the digital camera , a shot of Coca - Cola , and I ’m on my way , heading south on Highway 31 .
But first , another hill .
One can always count on a few lumps alongside a large body of water , and the topography bordering Kootenay Lake , nestled between the Valhalla Range to the west and the Purcell ’s to the east , is no exception .
The steepest part includes a hairy hairpin crossing Woodbury Creek , launching into a steep ascent on the south bank .
Further on , I pass Ainsworth Hotsprings .
Once a rustic system of springs the bubbling fault was excavated by early prospectors desiring a greater flow of hot water in which to broil their aching bones .
Mining companies saw the economic potential of the soothing waters from day one ; the place bears the name of one of the wealthiest capitalists of the day : Captain George Ainsworth of San Francisco .
Since my last visit a tony hotel — with prices to match — has gone up around the natural wonder .
I paused long enough to admire an unusual rock formation created by the mineral - rich waters flowing over a steep bank beside the road .
Another new development here : campsites specifically targeting motorcyclists , as common as mosquitoes on this loop .
I ’ve also noticed at roadside rest areas that many of these bikers have a serious taste for Jack Daniel ’s whisky — along with Harley - Davidson , the brand of rebels .
Accordingly , when I hear the characteristic thunder announcing the approach of another group of “ Wild Ones ” I hug the road edge as if my life depended on it .
As evening crept up the mountainside , I pulled into Balfour .
On the lakeside a free ferry takes travellers over to Kootenay Bay , on the east side of the lake .
This is exactly what I did 27 years ago riding south on 3A to Creston , then left to the East Kootenays .
This year I paused only for a junk food transfusion .
Fortified with Coke and chips I crossed the 200 kilometre mark with about 30 minutes to spare — had I been riding a brevet ( which allows 13.5 hours for this distance ) .
Less than an hour later , as darkness fell , I crossed the “ Orange Bridge , ” happy to see the lights of Nelson dancing on the inky waters of the Kootenay River .
Before tackling the 15 % grade back up to the Alpine Motel , I quaff a pint of the Kootenay ’s finest ale at a sidewalk patio .
But I do n’t tarry ; the night is cool and the rest of the previous evenings ’
“ Italian feast ” — a gargantuan meal fit for two loggers , or a randonneur at the end of a long day in the saddle — waits in the motel fridge .

Bush and Clinton Co-chairs US Aid Effort for Haiti
United States President Barack Obama is expected to announce the appointment of two former presidents as co-chairs for the nation ’s relief efforts to earthquake - stricken Haiti .
The former presidents are his immediate predecessors , George W. Bush and Bill Clinton .
Clinton is already the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti when the massive tremor hit last Tuesday , January 12 .
He has also served the same role for the Asian tsunami along with former president George H.W. Bush , father of then president and now Clinton ’s partner .
The younger Bush appointed them to that position in 2004 .
The role will be the younger Bush ’s first re-emergence into international spotlight after leaving the White House almost a year ago .
The appointment is crucial and beneficial as the current administration keeps hitting the previous government for the country ’s two biggest problems today – the economy and the terrorism war .
Mr. Bush never hit back publicly believing that he has all the rights to make public opinions .
The non-controversial humanitarian efforts are what former presidents normally do aside from giving public speeches .
This blog is about my experiences living gluten free in San Diego .
A friend of mine is due with her first baby any day now .
She had her baby shower a couple of weeks ago and I was reminded how new and exciting everything is and how much you need ( or think you need ) for your first baby .
But it also got me thinking about how much stuff I “ needed ” for my first baby versus how much I “ needed ” for my third .
Changing Table
Baby # 1 –
The changing table was upstairs in your room , at the first sign of any pee I ’d whisk you to the “ changing station ” .
Fully equipped with the diaper holder / stacker that matched your room decor , a terry cloth cover on the additional diaper pad ( the one that came with the changing table was much too thin ) and every brand of butt balm imaginable .
Baby # 3 –
The changing table had become a storage rack for extra tools in the shed .
So I changed you on the couch and used a paper towel to wipe up any “ spills ” .
Wipes Warmer
Baby # 1 – Your precious little butt was never scarred with a cold cruel wipe .
Baby # 3 –
If the wipes were really cold I would squeeze them in my hand to warm them up for a minute .
Diaper Bag
Baby # 1 – I spent a good thirty minutes packing every little thing you may need in a 10 minute trip to the grocery store .
If you had 5 poop explosions in that quick trip out , I had 20 new outfits ( and matching socks ) for you in the diaper bag .
If we got stranded in an avalanche I had meals in the diaper bag to last for weeks .
Baby # 3 – I throw a diaper in my purse and hope for the best ( there may or may not be some stale cheerios in the bottom of my bag if you get hungry . )
Parenting Books
Baby # 1 – I read along every week , charting your progress .
“ Oh dear god , it ’s Day 1 of Week 6 and she has n’t smiled yet BUT THE BOOK SAID SHE SHOULD BE SMILING ….I ’m calling the doctor . ”
Baby # 3 – Ummmm ….
There are million more things I ’ve not done for Baby # 3 that I did do for Babies # 1 and # 2 .
For example , I feel a lot of guilt that her baby book sits basically empty while the other two have their every breath documented .
But Baby # 3 had a mommy who was much more relaxed , more confident in her choices , and because of that I think she ’ll forgive me for cold wipes .

In this Campfire post , we will talk about solar thermal hot water heating -- the major part of the little blue bars in the above chart .
Sales of solar hot water heaters have been growing since a tax credit for home installation became available in the USA in 2006 .
I will share some of what I found on the Internet , and ask what your experiences have been .
In the chart above , the low - temperature solar heating units ( 140 degrees F or lower ) are primarily used to heat swimming pools .
Medium temperature solar thermal units ( 140 to 180 degrees F ) are primarily used for heating hot water .
High temperature collectors ( over 180 degrees F ) are primarily used to generate electricity for the grid .
We often hear that solar thermal is quite cost effective , but if a person looks into the situation , it appears that solar thermal 's primary use is for heating swimming pools and hot tubs .
A recent publication by the EIA shows this chart :
Tax Credits
Solar hot water heating has been growing in recent years , at least in part because a 30 % tax credit which is available from the US federal government on systems that are certified by the Solar Rating Certification Corporation .
State and local programs may be available as well .
The tax credit is available both for units installed on primary residences and on secondary homes .
Active vs. Passive
There are two basic types of hot water heaters -- active , which uses electricity to pump water through the system , and passive , which uses no pumps or electrical equipment .
According to Real Green ,
Because of their design , passive systems are the simpler of the two .
They work essentially like a garden hose left out in the sun , except the container for the water is much , much larger .
The sun directly heats the water in a large , rooftop tank , which then flows down into your plumbing system .
If the water has not yet reached the temperature you ’ve selected on your thermostat , your conventional water heater will need to kick in to finish the job .
Passive systems are best suited for warm climates where your rooftop storage tank is in no danger of freezing .
Because of their simplicity , passive systems are usually cheaper and can last longer than active systems .
The drawbacks are that they can be less reliable , and require a heavy water tank , or collector , to be mounted on your roof .
( Depending on your roof ’s design , this may require structural support . )
An active system stores water in a tank inside your house , and uses its pump to move either water or a “ heat exchange ” fluid through a “ collector ” on your roof .
Collectors are the components of your solar water heating system it to heat your water .
Used in freezing climates , the heat - exchange fluid is a non-freezing liquid that carries the sun ’s heat from the roof to your tank , where it transfers the heat to your water .
The fluid re-circulates to the roof to be heated again , while the water flows on to your tap .
( This fluid is usually propylene glycol , which the FDA has approved as an additive in food and medicine .
However , it is a suspected neuro - and respiratory toxin , according to the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety . )
Although active systems are more expensive but more reliable than passive ones , you may still wish to keep your conventional water heater for a back - up .
In fact , in many areas , local building codes require conventional back - ups , so be sure to check with your contractor or local government .
Active systems using the “ heat exchange ” method are best for areas where freezing temperatures are likely .
Among the active solar water heating systems , there are two types , according to the US Department of Energy :
Direct circulation systems
Pumps circulate household water through the collectors and into the home .
They work well in climates where it rarely freezes .
Indirect circulation systems
Pumps circulate a non-freezing , heat - transfer fluid through the collectors and a heat exchanger .
This heats the water that then flows into the home .
They are popular in climates prone to freezing temperatures .
According to the same source , there are two kinds of passive hot water heating systems :
Integral collector - storage passive systems
These work best in areas where temperatures rarely fall below freezing .
They also work well in households with significant daytime and evening hot - water needs .
Thermosyphon systems [ require roof collection units ]
Water flows through the system when warm water rises as cooler water sinks .
The collector must be installed below the storage tank so that warm water will rise into the tank .
These systems are reliable , but contractors must pay careful attention to the roof design because of the heavy storage tank .
They are usually more expensive than integral collector - storage passive systems .
Obstacles to Installation
According to the US Department of Energy , there are a variety of obstacles homeowners can run into .
This is a list they note :
The matter of building code and zoning compliance for a solar system installation is typically a local issue .
Even if a statewide building code is in effect , it 's usually enforced locally by your city , county , or parish .
Common problems homeowners have encountered with building codes include the following : Exceeding roof load
Unacceptable heat exchangers
Improper wiring
Unlawful tampering with potable water supplies .
Potential zoning issues include the following : Obstructing sideyards
Erecting unlawful protrusions on roofs
Siting the system too close to streets or lot boundaries .
The systems do require maintenance , and occasional replacement parts , especially if they contain electrical components .
Economics of Systems
How economic these units prove to be will vary by the part of the country , but one would expect them to always be significantly more economic than solar PV .
This site says that solar water heating produces energy at 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of solar PV .
When you consider the cost , you will want to include the cost of the back up system as well .
( Some hot water systems seem to be specially made as backup to solar hot water systems -- for example this propane back - up unit for $ 599 . )
Besides geographical location , cost savings will depend on the local price of electricity or natural gas that your current system uses .
To get an idea about prices , I looked at the website of Solar Direct .
The site lists three types of systems :
1. Warm Climate ProgessivTube - Solar Hot Water Passive System -
No moving parts $ 1,700 to $ 2,600 .
2. Moderate Climate Helio- Pak - Active Solar Hot Water , flat plate type - Tanks do not need to be installed above collectors - Uses electricity - $ 2,200 to $ 5,200
3. Cold Climate Trend Setter - Solar Hot Water Active , evacuated tube - Price range ( including commercial ) $ 6,000 to $ 17,000 .
This is the map for which types of this particular vendor 's products can be used where :
Obviously this is not intended as a recommendation for the above site -- it just had some convenient cost figures available .
Questions for Readers
1 . What has your experience with solar hot water heaters ?
Is it easy to find a contractor , and get around local ordinances ?
2 . Are the units proving to be cost effective ?
3 . What parts of the country / world should these units be considered for ?
It seem like these would be especially useful in parts of the world where temperatures do n't freeze and a simple passive solar unit would work .
4 . Are there any special issues that readers who want to try this idea should watch out for ?
5 . Are there any particular vendors or brands you have had good experience with ?
6 . Have you found any particularly good references on solar hot water heaters ?
Also , readers who have n't installed solar hot water heaters , but have thought about the idea , may want to raise questions as well .
LOS ANGELES – NBC 's late - night woes have become the biggest drama on US television as comedians and TV executives trade increasingly bitter barbs in public .
With the struggling network still scrambling to sort out its failed prime - time experiment with host Jay Leno , Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel have played out their talk show wars with Leno all week in what media watchers called a public relations disaster from which NBC could be slow to recover .
Senior NBC sports executive Dick Ebersol entered the fray on Friday , blaming O'Brien for much of the fiasco and telling the New York Times the on-air jokes against Leno were " chicken - hearted and gutless . "
" It is a PR nightmare , not just for NBC but for Leno and Conan , " said Todd Gold , managing editor of Fancast.com .
" What is most surprising is seeing this happen on the network that carries their shows , " Gold told Reuters .
Media reports suggested NBC was close to resolving the mess .
Hollywood insider website TheWrap reported late Friday that the network had agreed to pay O'Brien $ 30 million to exit " The Tonight Show . "
NBC told Reuters the report was " not true " .
The Daily Beast said earlier O'Brien would leave and be free to take a job elsewhere , despite reported threats from NBC that it would prevent him from working on a rival channel .
NBC , which is at the bottom of the big four US TV networks in audience share , has made no official comment on the talks , which also reportedly put Leno back in his old job as host of the flagship " The Tonight Show . "
The vitriol started even before NBC confirmed on Sunday that it would end in February the cost- cutting " The Jay Leno Show " in the 10 p.m. prime - time slot because of low ratings and a backlash from its local TV stations .
O'Brien bitter
Earlier hopes that NBC could swiftly move Leno to his old 11:35 p.m. time slot and push " The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien " back to 12:05 a.m. disappeared when O'Brien released a bitter statement refusing to participate in what he called the destruction of " The Tonight Show . "
Since then , O'Brien has placed a sales ad on popular web site Craigslist for a " barely used late - night talk show , " and joked that young people should be inspired to believe they can " do anything you want in life -- unless Jay Leno wants to do it , too . "
Jimmy Kimmel , late night host of ABC's " Jimmy Kimmel Live ! " told Leno on his show on Thursday : " Listen Jay , Conan and I have children , all you have to take care of is cars .
I mean , we have lives to lead here , you 've got $ 800 million .
For God 's sake , leave our shows alone . "
The drama has boosted audiences for both O'Brien 's and Leno 's shows , but not enough to beat the competition that caused the trouble in the first place .
Meanwhile late - night CBS rival David Letterman took a shot on Thursday , quipping ; " NBC announced it was putting the NBC peacock ( network symbol ) on the endangered species list . "
Media watchers question how quickly Leno , O'Brien or NBC can recover from the shouting match .
" How damaging is it ?
We wo n't know until after the winter Olympics and NBC puts their new schedule to the test .
All of these things will play out and viewers will make their decision -- are they going back or not ? , " said Bill Carroll , a media analyst with Katz TV group .
Brian Steinberg , TV editor for Advertising Age , said the on-air scrapping was not good for NBC .
More importantly , ad buyers are wondering " whether Leno will be able to come back right away if he goes to 11:30 p.m .
Or has he lost some of his audiences to Letterman or the late night options out there ? "

Combat rifle sights bearing Bible references do not violate U.S. military rules that forbid proselytizing in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Pentagon said today , responding to an ABC News report about the Michigan contractor .
The ban was drafted to try to counter claims by Muslims that the United States was engaged in a " crusade " against Islam .
" This situation is not unlike the situation with U.S. currency , " a U.S. Central Command spokesman , Air Force Maj .
John Redfield , told the Associated Press .
" Are we going to stop using money because the bills have ' In God We Trust ' on them ?
As long as the sights meet the combat needs of troops , they 'll continue to be used . "
A U.S. Marine Corps spokesman said in an e-mailed statement to AP that " we are aware of the issue and are concerned with how this may be perceived " and that Marine officials would meet with the manufacturer , Trijicon of Wixom , Mich . , to discuss future purchases .
Last year , the Corps bought $ 66 million of the company 's products , including the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight ( ACOG ) , which uses radioactive tritium , a form of hydrogen , to illuminate the scope .
The scripture references were begun more than 20 years ago by Trijicon 's founder , Glyn Bindon , a devout Christian from South Africa who died in a 2003 plane crash in Alabama .
" We do n't publicize this , " Tom Munson , Trijicon 's director of sales and marketing , told AP .
" It 's not something we make a big deal out of .
But when asked , we say , ' Yes , it 's there . ' "
Here 's what ABC reported :
One of the citations on the gun sights , 2COR4:6 , is an apparent reference to Second Corinthians 4:6 of the New Testament , which reads : " For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ . "
Other references include citations from the books of Revelation , Matthew and John dealing with Jesus as " the light of the world . "
John 8:12 , referred to on the gun sights as JN8:12 , reads , " Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . "
The Detroit Free Press , a sister paper of USA TODAY , carries a statement the company released through Levick Strategic Communications .
In it , the company said that " as part of our faith and our belief in service to our country , Trijicon has put scripture references on our products for more than two decades . "
" Our effort is simple and straightforward : to help our servicemen and women win the war on terror and come home safe to their families .
...
As long as we have men and women in danger , we will continue to do everything we can to provide them with both state - of - the - art technology and the never - ending support and prayers of a grateful nation . "
The Free Press also highlights a video in which the reviewer calls the bible inscription " one of the really cool things that I like about this sight . "
The Military Religious Freedom Foundation says the Taliban and other enemies could use the inscriptions as a propaganda tools .
" I do n't have to wonder for a nanosecond how the American public would react if citations from the Koran were being inscribed onto these U.S. armed forces gun sights instead of New Testament citations , " said Mikey Weinstein , head of the foundation , which opposes religious favoritism in the military .
He said he had received complaints from active - duty and retired servicemembers about the Bible references .

The CIA sequence for a Predator strike ends with a missile but begins with a memo .
Usually no more than two or three pages long , it bears the name of a suspected terrorist , the latest intelligence on his activities , and a case for why he should be added to a list of people the agency is trying to kill .
The list typically contains about two dozen names , a number that expands each time a new memo is signed by CIA executives on the seventh floor at agency headquarters , and contracts as targets thousands of miles away , in places including Pakistan and Yemen , seem to spontaneously explode .
No U.S. citizen has ever been on the CIA ’s target list , which mainly names Al Qaeda leaders , including Osama bin Laden , according to current and former U.S. officials .
But that is expected to change as CIA analysts compile a case against a Muslim cleric who was born in New Mexico but now resides in Yemen .
Anwar al Awlaki poses a dilemma for U.S. counter - terrorism officials .
He is a U.S. citizen and until recently was mainly known as a preacher espousing radical Islamic views .
But Awlaki ’s ties to November ’s shootings at Ft. Hood and the failed Christmas Day airline plot have helped convince CIA analysts that his role has changed .
Advertisement
“ Over the past several years , Awlaki has gone from propagandist to recruiter to operational player , ” said a U.S. counter - terrorism official .
Awlaki ’s status as a U.S. citizen requires special consideration , according to former officials familiar with the criteria for the CIA ’s targeted killing program .
But while Awlaki has not yet been placed on the CIA list , the officials said it is all but certain that he will be added because of the threat he poses .
“ If an American is stupid enough to make cause with terrorists abroad , to frequent their camps and take part in their plans , he or she ca n’t expect their citizenship to work as a magic shield , ” said another U.S. official .
“ If you join the enemy , you join your fate to his . ”
The complications surrounding Awlaki ’s case provide a rare window into the highly secretive process by which the CIA selects targets .

CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano declined to comment , saying that it is “ remarkably foolish in a war of this kind to discuss publicly procedures used to identify the enemy , an enemy who wears no uniform and relies heavily on stealth and deception . ”
Other current and former U.S. officials agreed to discuss the outlines of the CIA ’s target selection procedures on the condition of anonymity because of their sensitive nature .
Some wanted to defend a program that critics have accused of causing unnecessary civilian casualties .
Decisions to add names to the CIA target list are “ all reviewed carefully , not just by policy people but by attorneys , ” said the second U.S. official .
“ Principles like necessity , proportionality , and the minimization of collateral damage -- to persons and property -- always apply . ”
The U.S. military , which has expanded its presence in Yemen , keeps a separate list of individuals to capture or kill .
Awlaki is already on the military ’s list , which is maintained by the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command .
Awlaki apparently survived a Dec. 24 airstrike conducted jointly by U.S. and Yemeni forces .

The CIA has also deployed more operatives and analysts to Yemen .
CIA Deputy Director Stephen Kappes was in the country last month , just weeks before a Nigerian accused of training with Al Qaeda in Yemen boarded a jetliner bound for Detroit on Christmas Day .
From beginning to end , the CIA ’s process for carrying out Predator strikes is remarkably self - contained .
Almost every key step takes place within the Langley , Va. , campus , from proposing targets to piloting the remotely controlled planes .
The memos proposing new targets are drafted by analysts in the CIA ’s Counter - Terrorism Center .
Former officials said analysts typically submit several new names each month to high - level officials , including the CIA general counsel and sometimes Director Leon E. Panetta .
Former officials involved in the program said it was handled with sober awareness of the stakes .
All memos are circulated on paper , so those granting approval would “ have to write their names in ink , ” said one former official .
“ It was a jarring thing , to sign off on people getting killed . ”
Advertisement
The program is governed by extensive procedures and rules , but targeting decisions come down to a single criterion : whether the individual in question is “ deemed to be a continuing threat to U.S. persons or interests . ”
Given that standard , the list mainly comprises Al Qaeda leaders and those seen as playing a direct role in devising or executing attacks .
Espousing violence or providing financial support to Al Qaeda would not meet the threshold , officials said .
But providing training to would - be terrorists or helping them get to Al Qaeda camps probably would .
The list is scrutinized every six months , officials said , and in some cases names are removed if the intelligence on them has grown stale .
“ If someone had n’t popped on the screen for over a year , or there was no intelligence linking him to known terrorists or plans , we ’d take him off , ” the former official said .

The National Security Council oversees the program , which is based on a legal finding signed after the Sept. 11 attacks by then - President George W. Bush .
But the CIA is given extensive latitude to execute the program , and generally does not need White House approval when adding names to the target list .
The only exception , officials said , would be when the name is a U.S. citizen’s .
The CIA has at times considered adding Americans ’ names to the target list .
None were ever approved , the officials said , not because their citizenship protected them but because they did n’t meet the “ continuing threat ” threshold .
Adam Gadahn , a California native now believed to be hiding in Pakistan , has been indicted on charges of treason and providing support to Al Qaeda .
But Gadahn , former officials said , has mainly served in a propaganda role .

Officials said that whether Awlaki is added to the list hinges more on intelligence agencies ’ understanding of his role than any concern about his status as a U.S. citizen .
“ If you are a legitimate military target abroad -- a part of an enemy force -- the fact that you ’re a U.S. citizen does n’t change that , ” said Michael Edney , who served as deputy legal advisor to the National Security Council from 2007 until 2009 .
Awlaki , 38 , was known for delivering fiery sermons at mosques in San Diego and suburban Virginia before moving to Yemen in 2004 .
Because of his radical online postings , he has been portrayed as a catalyst or motivator in nearly a dozen terrorism cases in the U.S. and abroad .
But it was his involvement in the two recent cases that triggered new alarms .
U.S. officials uncovered as many as 18 e-mails between Awlaki and Nidal Malik Hasan , a U.S. Army major accused of killing 13 people at Ft. Hood , Texas .
Awlaki also has been tied to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the Nigerian accused of attempting to detonate a bomb on a Detroit - bound flight .
Advertisement
“ Awlaki ’s interested in operations outside of Yemen , and he ’s trying to recruit more extremists , including Westerners , ” said the U.S. counter - terrorism official .
“ His knowledge of Western culture and language makes him valuable to [ the offshoot ] Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula .
“ Taking him off the street , ” the official said of Awlaki , “ would deal a blow to the group . ”
The CIA has carried out dozens of Predator strikes in Pakistan over the last year .
The program is not foolproof , as drone strikes often kill multiple people even when the intended target escapes .
The CIA has also made grievous mistakes in counter - terrorism operations , including capturing individuals misidentified as terrorism suspects .
But the program remains valuable to U.S. officials .
President Obama alluded to the campaign in his State of the Union speech last week , saying that during his first year in office , “ hundreds of Al Qaeda ’s fighters and affiliates , including many senior leaders , have been captured or killed -- far more than in 2008 . ”

Many of those strikes were aimed at gatherings of militant groups or training complexes , current and former officials said .
In such cases , the CIA is free to fire even if it does not have intelligence indicating the presence of anyone on its target list .
The CIA has carried out Predator attacks in Yemen since at least 2002 , when a drone strike killed six suspected Al Qaeda operatives traveling in a vehicle across desert terrain .
The agency knew that one of the operatives was an American , Kamal Derwish , who was among those killed .
Derwish was never on the CIA ’s target list , officials said , and the strike was aimed at a senior Al Qaeda operative , Qaed Sinan Harithi , accused of orchestrating the 2000 attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole .

In the wake of the Dubai default ( please see Dubai Defaults - Deflation In Action - Watched Pot Theory Revisited for details ) , I am up watching treasury yields .
Two year treasury yields plunged to an new all - time record low as the following Bloomberg table shows .
Yield Curve as of 2009-11-27 12:22 AM
click on chart for sharper image
On Monday Bloomberg reported Treasury Sells Two - Year Notes at Record Low Yield
The Treasury sold $ 44 billion of two - year notes at a yield of 0.802 percent , the lowest on record , as demand for the safety of U.S. government securities surges going into year - end .
The last auction , a $ 44 billion offering on Oct. 27 , drew a yield of 1.02 percent .
Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes foreign central banks , purchased 44.5 percent of the notes today , the same as at the October sale .
The previous low was 0.922 percent on the auction held .
Dec. 26 , 2008 .
For the first time in seven decades , Treasury bills are paying no interest while stocks continue to appreciate -- a divergence that might be perilous if Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke did n’t know all about 1938 .
While the stock market is saying one thing , the treasury market says another .
I know who I believe , and it's not the stock market .
Hyperinflation In Reverse
Dollar Sinks S&P Futures Down
One thing of note is that S&P 500 futures are down 14 points and commodities are down as well even though the dollar is sinking .
This is a dramatically different change from the norm .
Of course this is a holiday and we must see if there is follow through .
This could be a one day wonder .
The important point is that if this sticks , or if equities sink while the Yen and / or Dollar rally , the reflation trade is finally over .
Can it be that the much despised treasuries are the only thing that will rally while everything else sinks ?
Yes , that is entirely possible given how lopsided anti-dollar sentiment is vs. everything else .
There 's a special logic to the flow of posts on a forum or message board , one that 's easy to parse by someone who 's spent a lot of time on them but kinda hard to understand for those who have n't .
Researchers at UCLA are working on teaching computers to understand these structured narratives within chronological posts on the web , in an attempt to get a better grasp of how humans think and communicate online .
" Our question was , could we devise computational methods to discover an emerging narrative framework underlying internet conversations that was possibly influencing the decision making of many people throughout the country or possibly world ? " said Timothy Tangherlini , who describes himself as a " computational folklorist " .
Exchanging Ideas
Tangherlini and his team built an algorithm to review 1.99 million posts from two different parenting forums .
The posts came from 40,056 users and spanned nine years ending in 2012 .
Most of the users identified themselves as mothers .
The researchers focused in on posts about vaccines .
" The anti-vaccine movement was a clear candidate for this type of study , " Tangherlini said .
" Tens of thousands of parents were exchanging ideas about child - rearing online and , through those interactions , creating virtual communities where they could share concerns , propose methods to allay those concerns , and share their own experiences . "
From the data , they were able to identify that huge numbers of parents were going online to talk about vaccines , their perceived health risks , distrust of institutions that require them , and ways to get exemptions for their children .
False Narratives
Vwani Roychowdhury , a machine learning expert who worked on the algorithm , said : " It 's especially impressive , when you take into consideration the fact that all the machine was fed with , were just web pages , nothing else ; and it found all the vaccine related concepts all on its own . "
While this study was targeted at conversations around vaccination , the researchers say the same principles could be applied to any topic .
Down the line , they hope it could allow for false narratives to be identified as they develop and countered by targeted messaging .
Roshan Bastini , a professor of health policy who also contributed to the research , said : " We hope to utilize findings from this work to design and test interventions that may positively influence vaccination rates because they are more likely to address some of the key drivers of resistance . "
The full details of the study were published in the journal JMIR Public Health and Surveillance .
WASHINGTON  More than $ 3.5 billion in economic stimulus funds are going to programs that President Obama wants to eliminate or trim in his new budget .
The president 's budget released this month recommends getting rid of Army Corps of Engineers ' drinking - water projects , which got $ 200 million in stimulus funds , and a U.S. Department of Agriculture flood - prevention program , which received $ 290 million from the stimulus , a USA TODAY review of stimulus spending reports show .
ONE YEAR LATER : Stimulus spending breakdown STOCKS CLOSE LOWER : Bernanke signals end of stimulus
The administration 's budget plan says the corps and USDA programs are inefficient and duplicate similar , more effective work by other agencies .
The proposed cuts indicate the programs should n't have gotten money from the $ 862 billion stimulus package , said Tom Schatz of the non-partisan budget watchdog Citizens Against Government Waste .
" It 's certainly inconsistent , and it would have been better to have this realization a year ago , " Schatz said .
" But if inconsistency means they 're going to cut the programs , it 's OK .
It 's the other way around that bothers us . "
White House budget office spokesman Thomas Gavin said the administration was n't being inconsistent .
Unlike the annual spending bills , the corps and USDA programs in the stimulus law did n't mandate funding for specific projects selected by members of Congress , Gavin said in an e-mail .
That allowed agencies to " invest ( stimulus ) funds where they can do the greatest good , " Gavin said .
The stimulus law , however , requires the corps ' stimulus money to be spent only on projects that Congress had previously approved for funding .
Obama 's proposed budget also includes $ 334 million in cuts to programs that got more than $ 3 billion in stimulus money .
They include : • A $ 100 million cut in funding for maintenance and construction in national forests .
The Forest Service got $ 650 million for such projects in the stimulus package , of which $ 55.6 million has been spent , according to USDA reports .
The White House budget says the Forest Service does n't need as much money because it is building fewer roads .
• A $ 44 million decrease in funding for an Interior Department program to thin trees and brush on federal land to mitigate wildfires .
The stimulus provided $ 15 million for the program .
The administration says it is reorganizing the program , which has been less effective than it should be because it did n't focus on preventing the fires most likely to threaten homes .
Obama signed the stimulus package a year ago today , an occasion that the administration is marking with events at the White House today and across the country this week .
Stimulus spending : A year later A year ago today , President Obama signed the economic stimulus bill , which the Congressional Budget Office now says will cost $ 862 billion .
The law provides $ 626 billion in spending and $ 236 billion in tax cuts .
USA TODAY 's Matt Kelley looks at where the bulk of the money has gone so far in some of the largest spending programs .
EDUCATION
ENERGY
TRANSPORTATION
SAFETY NET Total funding $ 98.2 billion $ 33 billion $ 48.1 billion $ 207 billion ( estimate ) Amount available $ 69.3 billion $ 20.4 billion $ 34.1 billion $ 120.2 billion Amount paid out $ 32.3 billion $ 1.1 billion $ 8.6 billion $ 103.9 billion Status
The largest share of education money spent so far , $ 19.6 billion , went to state governments as part of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund .
States can use that money to shore up budgets for schools and other essential services .
About half of the energy funding , $ 16.8 billion , is for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects , including $ 5 billion to make low - income housing more energy efficient .
Only about $ 687 million of that money has been spent .
The Transportation Department has $ 23.9 billion in the pipeline for highway construction and has spent $ 6.1 billion so far .
The administration in January announced $ 8 billion in grants for 13 high - speed rail projects .
The package increased federal payments to states for Medicaid and unemployment insurance and boosted spending on food stamps .
Unemployment insurance payments were $ 10 billion higher in 2009 than originally estimated .
What 's next The Education Department plans to announce in early April the first round of grants under Race to the Top , a $ 4.4 billion program distributing money to states with innovative school improvement plans .
Forty states and D.C. applied for a share of the money .
The Energy Department this year will fund carbon sequestration projects from among a dozen awarded preliminary investments .
Carbon sequestration captures carbon dioxide produced by industry for reuse or permanent storage .
There 's $ 1.4 billion in available funding .
The Transportation Department plans next month to redistribute all stimulus funds for highway projects that did n't get spent or allocated by today .
Mass transit funds must be awarded by March or the department will redistribute that money , too .
The increased federal Medicaid payments to states under the stimulus package are set to expire at the end of the year .
However , the additional funds for food stamps and unemployment insurance payments would continue .

LONDON ( Dow Jones ) , Jan. 12 , 2010
Royal Dutch Shell PLC no longer looks to its troubled Nigerian operations to drive growth in its oil and gas output , said Chief Executive Peter Voser in comments posted on the company 's website Tuesday .
" Nigeria is still a heartland for Shell , but we no longer depend on it for our growth aspirations , " said Voser .
" This gives us more flexibility in deciding when and how to develop oil and gas resources in Nigeria . "
Shell , which has been the dominant force in Nigeria 's oil industry for decades , may be looking to dramatically reduce its presence in the country .
It is seeking buyers for 10 of its Nigerian onshore oil producing assets worth between $ 4 billion and $ 5 billion in total , people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal last month .
China National Petroleum Corp. has been reported as a possible buyer .
Violence , kidnapping and sabotage attacks on infrastructure in Nigeria 's oil producing areas have hampered Shell 's operations for years .
Despite a recent amnesty and a continuing truce between government forces and Niger Delta militants , violence continues .
Four expatriate Shell contractors were kidnapped in the Niger Delta Tuesday after their bus was ambushed by gunmen .
Two Nigerians were killed in the attack .
A Chevron Corp. oil pipeline was shut down following sabotage over the weekend .
" Shell staff in Nigeria are doing a great job in this very difficult environment , " Voser said .
" During 2009 sabotage and attacks on installations of the Shell Petroleum Development Corporation of Nigeria have again reduced production levels , " and delayed a scheme to reduce gas flaring , he said .
Voser said in October that Shell 's Nigerian oil output was down to 120,000 barrels per day from 300,000 barrels per day before the violence started .
Following the amnesty , oil production levels did improve toward the end of the year and its liquefied natural gas business is performing well , Voser noted .
Shell 's output growth in the coming years will be driven by more unconventional energy projects , notably large LNG and gas - to - liquids developments approaching completion in Qatar .
Shell has new developments with a combined output of around one million barrels equivalent of oil and gas per day under construction , although much of this will offset natural output decline in other assets .
These technology driven projects require massive capital expenditure and Voser warned of a looming oil supply crunch if investment in the wider industry does not rebound from a big drop in 2009 .
" We 've seen a worldwide drop in upstream oil and gas investment of some 20 % .
And for alternative energies the drop is even steeper , around 40 % , " he said .
" Governments and industry must work together to get back to higher investment levels .
Otherwise , we run a risk of a supply - demand imbalance in a few years time . "

Dr Andrew Wakefield , the expert at the centre of the MMR controversy , " failed in his duties as a responsible consultant " and showed a " callous disregard " for the suffering of children involved in his research , the General Medical Council ( GMC ) has ruled .
Wakefield also acted dishonestly and was misleading and irresponsible in the way he described research that was later published in the Lancet medical journal , the GMC said .
He had gone against the interests of children in his care , and his conduct brought the medical profession " into disrepute " after he took blood samples from youngsters at his son's birthday party in return for payments of £ 5 .
The doctor , who was absent from today 's GMC hearing , faces being struck off the medical register .
The panel decided the allegations against him could amount to serious professional misconduct , an issue to be decided at a later date .
Wakefield said he was dismayed at the panel 's decision .
" The allegations against me and against my colleagues are both unfounded and unjust ... and I invite anyone to examine the contents of these proceedings and come to their own conclusion . "
The panel chairman , Dr Surendra Kumar , was heckled by parents who support Wakefield as he delivered the verdicts .
One woman shouted : " These doctors have not failed our children .
You are outrageous . "
She called the panel of experts " bastards " and accused the GMC of being a " kangaroo court " .
Another shouted : " This is a set - up . "
In the late 1990s Wakefield and two other doctors said they believed they had uncovered a link between the MMR jab , bowel disease and autism .
The research caused a big drop in the number of children given the triple jab for measles , mumps and rubella .
The hearing has sat for 148 days over two and a half years and reportedly cost more than £ 1 m .
Thirty - six witnesses gave evidence at the hearing .
The accusations relate to investigations for the study , based on 12 youngsters with bowel disorders , carried out between 1996 and 1998 .
At the time all three doctors were employed at the Royal Free hospital 's medical school in London , with honorary clinical contracts hospital itself .
The GMC heard that vulnerable children were subjected to " inappropriate and invasive " tests by the doctors , who breached of " some of the most fundamental rules in medicine " .
Wakefield did not have paediatric qualifications and had not worked as a clinical doctor for several years when he ordered the tests , the panel was told .
One of the key claims was that Wakefield accepted more than £ 50,000 from the Legal Aid Board for research to support a group of parents ' attempts to fight for compensation .
It was alleged Wakefield applied for money so that five children and their families could stay in hospital during tests and for MRI scans for each child .
The money was paid into an account at the Royal Free for Wakefield 's research , but , the GMC alleged , the cost of scans and hospital stays would have been met by the NHS .
Wakefield was accused of paying children £ 5 for blood samples at his son's birthday party , then joking about it afterwards .
All three doctors denied the allegations against them .
Fed chief Ben Bernanke has made money for the US taxpayer
The Federal Reserve made a profit of $ 52.1 bn ( £ 32.2bn ) in 2009 , a rise of 47 % over the previous year .
The sum allowed the central bank to pay a record $ 46.1 bn to the US Treasury last year .
That was the largest amount ever paid by the central bank since its creation in 1914 .
The record figure was largely thanks to its attempts to support the financial system throughout the ongoing financial crisis .
The Fed funds itself from its own operations and returns any profits to the Treasury department .
Taxpayer gains
The figures suggest that US taxpayers have , so far , gained money from the US government 's action in propping up the system .
Some of the profit has come from interest earned on government bonds and mortgage - related securities - including those of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The emergency lending programmes instituted by the central bank during the last year 's financial crisis helped swell the Fed 's balance sheet to more than $ 2tn .
They were designed to keep down interest rates and get banks lending to each other again , hoping to spark an economic recovery .
The Fed could also lose money on its holdings if it sells them at a time when they have fallen in value .
The Fed also earned money from its emergency loans to banks and other firms , such as the giant carmakers .
It charged both interest and fees on these .
The " backdoors " that Cisco and other networking companies implement in their routers and switches for lawful intercept are front and center again at this week 's Black Hat security conference .
A few years ago , they were cause celebre in some VoIP wiretapping arguments and court rulings .
This time , an IBM researcher told Black Hat conference attendees that these openings can still expose information about us to hackers and allow them to " watch " our Internet activity .
Backdoors are implemented in routers and switches so law enforcement officials can track the Internet communications and activity of an individual or individuals under surveillance .
They are required by law to be incorporated in devices manufactured by networking companies and sold to ISPs .
In this report from Forbes , IBM Internet Security Systems researcher Tom Cross demonstrated how easily the backdoor in Cisco IOS can be exploited by hackers .
When they gain access to a Cisco router , they are not blocked after multiple failed access attempts nor is an alert sent to an administrator .
Any data collected through the backdoor can be sent to anywhere -- not just merely to an authorized user , Forbes reports .
What 's more , an ISP is not able to perform an audit trail on whoever tried to gain access to a router through the backdoor - that nuance was intended to keep ISP employees from detecting the intercept and inadvertently tipping off the individual under surveillance .
But according to IBM's Cross , any authorized employee can use it for unauthorized surveillance of users and those privacy violations cannot be tracked by the ISP .
Cisco said it is aware of Cross 's assertions and is taking them under consideration .
To Cisco 's credit , it is the only networking company that makes its lawful intercept architecture public , according to the recommendations of the IETF , the Forbes story states .
Other companies do not , which means they may be susceptible to the same security flaws , or worse .

You used to be able to count on the United States to be the bad guys at United Nations climate conferences .
But this year , while the Obama administration ’s pledges are n’t as ambitious as some might like , the US government is more willing to combat global warming than it has been for years .
That ’s left our northern neighbor , Canada , to emerge as the summit ’s major stinker .
Perhaps the best sign of Canada ’s fledgling pariah status was the fact that it was targeted on Monday by the notorious pranksters , the Yes Men .
The group issued a fake press release from Ugandan delegates celebrating an “ announcement ” from the Canadian government proposing “ ambitious new emissions - reduction targets and vigorous climate - debt reparations to African nations . ”
Canada now joins Yes Men victims such as George W. Bush , Dow Chemical , and , most recently , the US Chamber of Commerce .
The Yes Men ’s stunt drew attention to the chasm between Canada ’s climate policies and those environmentalists wish it would adopt .
Back when Canada was governed by the Liberal Party , it ratified the Kyoto Protocol and agreed to cut emissions by 6 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
But since the election of Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2006 , his conservative government has walked back from that commitment , arguing that those cuts are unattainable .
Canada ’s emissions have also risen sharply since then — largely due to its increased production of oil in the tar sands of Alberta .
Now Harper ’s government wants to do away with the Kyoto Protocol altogether .
At Copenhagen , Canada has only offered a scaled - back proposal to cut emissions 3 percent below 1990 levels .
At last year ’s climate summit , Canada was voted the Fossil of the Year — an award handed out by Climate Action Network International to the conference ’s most obstructive country .
So far , Canada is on track for a repeat victory — in the daily “ fossil ” awards at Copenhagen , it has landed in the top three six times .
George Monbiot recently wrote that Canada is now to climate as Japan is to whaling .
And on Monday , Canada took the second to last place on the Climate Protection Index , a project ranking major polluters on their efforts to curb emissions .
Only Saudi Arabia scored lower on the list .
And Canada is about to become even more unpopular .
On Tuesday , leaked documents from the Harper administration indicated that the nation is considering even weaker emission reduction targets for fossil fuel industries .
The documents suggest that the Tories plan to abandon a 2007 plan that called for cutting emissions from the oil and gas sectors by 48 megatonnes .
A new proposal only calls for a 15 megatonne decrease — raising questions about whether the country could reach its stated pledge at Copenhagen of reducing emissions 20 percent by 2020 .
Canadian observers at the climate summit have expressed outrage at the confidential documents .
At a press conference on Tuesday , Steven Guilbeault of the Canadian environmental group Équiterre praised accomplishments by the Obama administration on climate this year — and said Canada is lagging far behind its developed allies .
“ Is there anyone in this room who thinks the Harper cabinet is in that category of a progressive government doing everything they can to reduce emissions ? ” he said .
In an interview on Friday , he acknowledged that Canada has never been “ the best in class ” on climate issues , but said the Harper administration ’s record was even worse .
He also criticized the assertion , stated in the documents , that the new plans “ harmonize ” Canadian policy with that of the US .
Guilbeault pointed out that the Obama administration ’s new automobile standards , stimulus funding for energy and efficiency , and the passage of the House climate bill put the US far ahead of Canada when it comes to climate action .
“ The government is lying when it tells Canadians , Americans , and all governments that are here that they want to be very close to the Americans , ” Guilbeault said .
“ They have no intention of doing that . ”
The main reason that Canada is refraining from bigger emissions cuts is the oil sands , a region of northern Canada that holds the world ’s largest reserves of an extremely heavy crude oil that must be extracted from the ground .
Canada ’s oil sands put the country behind only Saudia Arabia in terms of total oil reserves .
But the process of extracting oil from the sands is extremely energy and water - intensive — causing much higher total emissions than conventional petroleum extraction , not to mention health and environmental concerns .
But the Canadian economy is heavily dependent on oil sales .
And the US is its biggest customer — imports from Canada are by far the United States ’ leading oil source .
But so far , neither Harper nor Obama has publicly addressed this issue .
At their meeting earlier this year , the two pledged to work together on clean energy — but barely mentioned the massive emissions created by the oil sands .
Canada ’s climate position stands rather at odds with its reputation as a land of pristine landscapes and earnest do - gooders .
At the conference , Canada ’s youth delegation drew attention to this disparity with a spur of the moment “ die-in ” at the Bella Center .
“ Canadians often pride themselves on being a progressive country , a country that ’s willing to do good , ” said Devon Williams , a youth delegate from Quebec .
“ In fact , we ’re doing among the least for climate change . ”
Global warming - induced indigestion could help make mountain gorillas and other leaf - eating primates sitting ducks for extinction , a new study says .
Annual temperatures are predicted to rise 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2 degrees Celsius ) by mid-century in some climate models .
Leaves that grow in hotter air contain more fiber and less digestible protein , meaning leaf - eaters would take longer to process their food .
In addition , the higher temperatures may force the animals to spend more time lounging in the shade to avoid overheating .
Such changes may force some gorilla and monkey species to sit still for long periods — time that would otherwise be used for finding food , protecting territory , or maintaining social bonds , the study says .
The inaction , combined with less nutritious food , could eventually cause mountain gorillas and African colobines — a large group of species including colobus monkeys — to go extinct , the study predicts .
" A two - degree temperature increase is not a very farfetched idea , " said study leader Amanda Korstjens , a biological anthropologist at Bournemouth University in the U.K .
" Animals can adapt ... and maybe primates will find another way of coping , " she added .
But " I expect that they are at their limits already . "
Flexible Fruit - Eaters
Korstjens and colleagues compared climate models with previously published data on primates ' behavior , diets , and group sizes worldwide .
Based on the data , the team created global maps that show where primates exist now and where climate change is predicted to cause die - offs .
The data revealed that the expected higher temperatures should n't affect most South American primates , which eat highly digestible fruit .
Also , South American primate habitats are less fragmented by agriculture and encroaching deserts than most primate habitats in Africa , Korstjens said .
Around the world , fruit - eaters — such as baboons and vervet monkeys in Africa — would also be better off .
They occupy a wider range of habitat than leaf - eaters , which are confined to a narrow belt near the Equator , according to the study , published December 8 in the journal Animal Behaviour .
" Not as Stable As You Think "
The theatened primates could possibly adapt to the global warming - induced changes by changing their diets , but no one knows for sure .
Colobines could eat some fruit , but their highly leaf adapted stomachs are n't equipped for all - fruit diets , Korstjens said .
Such assumptions of inadaptability may be weak points in the new study , said Colin Chapman , a primate ecologist at Montreal 's McGill University , who was not involved in the study .
" It 's not clear how flexible [ colobines ] could be . "
But " if the assumptions are correct , " Chapman said , " shows a pretty big potential in changes in distribution and extinction risk . "
Mountain gorillas are in a particularly serious bind , he added .
They have little access to fresh fruit in their high - altitude habitats , and they 're " sitting on top of mountains with nowhere else to go . "
A hotter Africa would also pose a threat for conservation efforts , Chapman said .
Well - managed national parks may be able to keep out poachers and loggers , for example , but they can't protect against temperature changes , he said .
" You think you have a perfectly stable national park , " he said , " all of the sudden it 's not as stable as you think . "

The UK PM Gordon Brown called for an “ emergency summit of world leaders last night to stop Yemen becoming a new terror center , ” reports The Sun .
Brown declares the poverty - stricken country — increasingly described as a “ failed state ” by government officials and the corporate media ( the same way Afghanistan and Iraq were deemed failed states before they were invaded ) — represents an “ evolving threat ” threat and an “ incubator ” for terrorism .
“ Yemen , as a potential safe haven for terrorism , presents a regional and global threat , ” said Brown and added that Britain and the United States are “ building our support for Yemen ’s efforts to tackle ” the supposed terrorist threat .
In other words , the governments of Britain and the United States are preparing to invade Yemen .
Gordon Brown ’s planned “ emergency summit of world leaders ” later this month should be considered a red flag indicating the elite plan to expand the GWOT into Yemen and Africa .
“ The United States will more than double its security assistance to Yemen , officials said Friday , and Britain will host an international meeting this month to seek ways to prevent the poorest Arab nation from becoming an al - Qaeda stronghold , ” reports The Washington Post .
“ The announcements highlight mounting Western concern over Yemen after a failed attempt to bomb a U.S. airliner on Christmas ; the suspect is a Nigerian man who reportedly told authorities that he received training and equipment in the country , which borders Saudi Arabia . ”
On Friday , Saudi warplanes carried out several airstrikes on northern Yemen villages and the oil kingdom sent troops into the country , according to Houthi fighters who oppose the government of the Arab country .
Houthis accuse the Yemeni government of violating their civil rights and attempting to politically , economically , and religiously marginalize them .
The Yemeni government claims to have destroyed what it calls a “ terrorist den ” in the northern Sa’ada region on Thursday , according to a report filed by Reuters .
Since the so - called underwear bomber ’s failed attack , the United States has called for the government of Yemen to attack what it describes as an expansion of an al - Qaeda presence in the country .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Also on Friday , senior leaders of the Shabab rebels in Somalia promised to send their fighters beyond Somalia to Yemen and wherever jihad beckons , according to The New York Times .
Sheik Muktar Robow , a senior rebel official , said that the fighters had been trained to fight the African Union peacekeeping force and the transitional federal government in Somalia but that Yemen was just across the Gulf of Aden and that “ our brothers must be ready for our welcome . ”
“ The Shabab have increased their ties with Al Qaeda , which has recently been fighting the American - backed military in Yemen , ” claims The New York Times .
“ A group calling itself al - Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the failed bombing of an Amsterdam - to - Detroit aircraft on Christmas Day .
Nigerian suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab told investigators he had trained with al - Qaida operatives in Yemen .
An increasing number of terrorism experts suggest that the turmoil in Yemen provides an ideal training ground for terrorists , ” reports The Voice of America .
“ Obama has formulated his new version of the Axis of Evil , composed of Afghanistan - Pakistan , Somalia , and Yemen , ” writes historian and author Webster Griffin Tarpley .
In Yemen , a civil war pits the Saudi - backed central government against the Iranian - backed Shiite Houthi rebels , whom the US has bombed at least twice this month .
The goal here is to play Iran against Saudi Arabia so as to weaken both the pro-Moscow Achmadinejad government in Iran , and also those Saudi forces that are fed up with their status as a US protectorate .
The US is openly now sponsoring a regroupment of “ al Qaeda ” ( the CIA Moslem legion ) in Yemen , including by sending fighters direct from Guantanamo .
The new CIA - promoted entity synthetic entity is “ Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula or AQAP , a gaggle of US patsies , dupes , and fanatics which is claiming credit for the Umar Farouk incident .
The US hopes to further dominate the exit from the Red Sea and the Suez Canal , while also easing pressure on the battered US dollar by jacking up the price of oil in an atmosphere of tension on the Arabian peninsula .
December 31 , 2009 : Webster Tarpley talks with Alex Jones about the Detroit false flag event and the coming attack on Yemen .
Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4 , Part 5 , Part 6 .
It should be obvious now that the Umar Farouk incident was a false flag event designed precisely to cobble together a pretext for an invasion of the “ failed state ” Yemen where al - Qaeda has magically and conveniently taken up residence .
Gordon Brown ’s summit later this month will serve as a planning session on formulating the invasion .
As noted on the Haskell Family Blog today , the FBI has stumbled through no less than four versions of what happened in Amsterdam and Detroit .
Confronted with the eye witness account of the event as told by Michigan lawyer Kurt Haksell , who related his story on the Alex Jones Show earlier in the week , the government is attempting to sow confusion and disinformation by spinning various distorted accounts and manufacturing outright lies about what happened .
In many ways this a repeat of what the government — with the eager participation of the corporate media — did in the days and weeks following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
December 29 , 2009 : Alex Jones talks with underwear bomber eye witness Kurt Haskell .
Part 2 , Part 3 .
Finally , it should be noted that al - Qaeda presence in Yemen is not a new development .
As CIA contractor Billy Waug wrote in his autobiography , he was part of a concerted effort to train al - Qaeda operatives in the country beginning in 1994 .

In the battle over the pricing of electronic books , publishers appear to have won the first round .
The price of many new releases and best sellers is about to go up , to as much as $ 14.99 from $ 9.99 .
But there may be an insurgency waiting to pounce : e-book buyers .
Over the last year , the most voracious readers of e-books have shown a reflexive hostility to prices higher than the $ 9.99 set by Amazon.com and other online retailers for popular titles .
When digital editions have cost more , or have been delayed until after the release of hardcover versions , these raucous readers have organized impromptu boycotts and gone to the Web sites of Amazon and Barnes & Noble to leave one - star ratings and negative comments for those books and their authors .
“ This book has been on the shelves for three weeks and is already in the remainder bins , ” wrote Wayne Fogel of The Villages , Fla. , when he left a one - star review of Catherine Coulter ’s book “ KnockOut ” on Amazon .
“ $ 14.82 for the Kindle version is unbelievable .
Some listings Amazon should refuse when the authors are trying to rip off Amazon ’s customers . ”

THE PROBLEM
Web hosting review sites have a less - than - stellar reputation within the technology industry .
Unfortunately , that view is not without merit .
The vast majority of top 10 website hosting sites that provide reviews are affiliate sites — including this one .
We are paid a commission when a visitor referred from our site purchases hosting .
If not for affiliate commissions , it is unlikely that many review sites would even exist .
While there is nothing to prevent affiliate sites from providing honest reviews — the unfortunate fact remains — it is faster , cheaper , and easier not to .
Purchasing hosting services and setting up test sites takes time and costs money .
Using third - party testing services to evaluate the quality of those services takes even more time and costs even more money .
Therefore , all too many affiliate sites simply skip to the review writing part .
That can be done quickly , cheaply , and easily .
Further complicating the matter is the fact that some of the worst hosting companies pay some of the highest affiliate commissions in order to counter poor word of mouth .
This of course , encourages less - than - reputable affiliates to post positive evaluations of low - quality hosts .
A brazen car thief stole an NYPD highway patrol vehicle with a loaded shotgun inside this morning — and drove it all the way to La Guardia Airport — after a cop left it idling and unmanned while he got breakfast at a Bronx diner , authorities said .
The heist occurred at the corner of Cruger and Lydig avenues in Morris Park shortly before 8 a.m. when an officer grabbed a bite to eat at Lydig Coffee House , said sources .
The car thief sped away in the hot wheels , a marked Chevy Tahoe , and headed over the Whitestone Bridge , said sources .
Witnesses said the red - faced officer was only in the diner for two minutes when he ran out in a panic .
“ All of a sudden I see a cop come out of the restaurant running .
He was going crazy , ” said Sammy Obaid , an employee at a deli across from the greasy spoon .
“ He was on the phone , making calls .
He was freaked out . ”
Obaid said a customer came out of the diner got in a car with the officer to try to chase down the suspect , but they returned empty - handed to the scene after a few minutes .
About a half - hour later , two rookie Port Authority officers found the heisted car at La Guardia Airport , parked at the lower level of the US Airways terminal .
They arrested the suspect inside the main terminal at 8:30 a.m. while he was on an Avis Car Rental phone , according to sources .
When PA cops approached the suspect , he had handcuffs dangling from his waistband and was carrying a blue clipboard , police paperwork , a police identification kit that scans drivers ’ licenses and a wad of $ 100 bills , sources said .
The suspect said , “ Oh , you got me , ” when cops approached .
But then told them that he was an officer .
In a nearby bathroom , PA police also found a stashed luggage bag and a police utility bag .
Police took thee suspect to the 49th Precinct in the Bronx for questioning .
At mid-morning , a swarm of NYPD officers was inspecting the vehicle , which was still idling at the airport .
A loaded shotgun in the vehicle was not taken and remained locked in the car ’s rack .
Flights in and out of LaGuardia appeared to be unaffected .
WASHINGTON  Even before a landmark Supreme Court ruling on campaign finance law expected within days , a series of other court decisions is reshaping the political battlefield by freeing corporations , unions and other interest groups from many of the restrictions on their advertising about issues and candidates .
Legal experts and political operatives say the cases roll back campaign spending rules to the years before Watergate .
The end of decades - old restrictions could unleash a torrent of negative advertisements , help cash - poor Republicans in a pivotal year and push President Obama to bring in more money for his party .
If the Supreme Court , as widely expected , rules against core elements of the existing limits , Democrats say they will try to enact new laws to reinstate the restrictions in time for the midterm elections in November .
And advocates of stricter campaign finance laws say they hope the developments will prod the president to fulfill a campaign promise to update the presidential campaign financing system , even though it would diminish his edge as incumbent .
Many legal experts say they expect the court to use its imminent ruling , in the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , to eliminate the remaining restrictions on advertisements for or against candidates paid for by corporations , unions and advocacy organizations .
( The case centers on whether spending restrictions apply to a conservative group ’s documentary , “ Hillary : The Movie . ” )
One patient still in critical condition after visit to hospital
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Health officials confirmed today that two patients have contracted Legionnaires ' disease at a hospital which has recently been criticised for blood - splattered equipment and an unusually high death rate among patients .
Both patients were at Basildon University Hospital in Essex when they began to show signs they were affected by the bacteria legionella .
A spokeswoman said the patients , who were staying in different parts of the hospital , have responded to antibiotic treatment but one of them is still in a critical condition .
Hospital chief executive Alan Whittle said : " We have continued to be vigilant and no further suspected cases have been identified .
" Based on the results of laboratory tests of water samples , we accept that the hospital is the probable source of the infection , despite our determined efforts to minimise the known risks of legionella .
" We do take the legionella risk extremely seriously .
We test any patient with suspicious respiratory problems and we regularly test our water system for the bacteria . "
The spokeswoman added that the last outbreak of the disease was in 2007 .
Whittle said : " Experts agree that the legionella bacteria is a common risk in large buildings with an extensive plumbing system .
" We accepted some time ago the advice of experts that we will never be able to completely eradicate the bacteria , but we have worked hard to minimise the risk .
" I would like to take this opportunity to reassure patients that the hospital is safe and the risk of contracting Legionnaires ' disease is extremely low . "
Legionnaires ' disease is a potentially fatal lung infection caused by the bacteria legionella .
It is contracted when small droplets of contaminated water are breathed in .
Symptoms of the disease include headaches , fever , chills , muscle pain and coughs .
It is estimated 10 % of people who contract Legionnaires ' disease will die from complications arising from infection .
The hospital spokeswoman said that the health and safety executive is now investigating the outbreak .
In November , inspectors from the Care Quality Commission criticised Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust after they found blood stains on floors and curtains , blood splattered on trays used to carry equipment and badly soiled mattresses in the A&E department with stains soaked through .
Inspectors also found equipment being used repeatedly that should only be used once and resuscitation room equipment that was past its use - by date .
Other items found at the trust included blood pressure cuffs stained with blood , suction machines contaminated with fluid inside and out and apparent mould .
However , on December 23 , the watchdog said that hygiene standards were improving and that the trust has taken action to address concerns about infection prevention and control .
It said further checks would be carried out on the trust , including unannounced inspections .
Artist Bio
A pioneer of graffiti writers in Europe , Blek le Rat was one of the first people to use stencils to make public art on the street using icons instead of writing his name .
He was first exposed to graffiti in 1971 in New York , but did n’t start making his own until ten years later in Paris .
Inspired by a stenciled portrait he saw of Mussolini amongst some WWII ruins during a trip to Italy , he created a stencil of a life size silhouette of a rat running along the streets .
He stenciled the rat for two years and quickly became recognized around Paris .
This change marked a monumental break from the dominance of New York ’s graffiti style .
His method of creating street art changed the face of graffiti and still continues to greatly influence artists around the world ; from Shepard Fairey and Banksy , to JayBadbc and Oseas Duarte to the young artist wheat pasting work around town .
His work has since evolved beyond the rat icon and taken on a more serious context .
He now uses his art to serve a social cause , to evoke reaction and inspire change .
Most recently , he pasted hundreds of posters around Paris of Florence Aubenas , a French journalist who was kidnapped in Iraq , hoping to provoke a reaction from politicians and journalists and aid in her release .
This project gained Blek incredible public support , and has encouraged him to continue to use his Street Art as a voice for the less fortunate .

Well , since the earlier story about a high school atheist group was a bit of a downer , this one should cheer you up .
Susan Caldwell is a North High School senior ; she says she had “ wanted to attend some sort of atheist youth group for a couple of years . ”
She is disturbed , she says , by the discrimination people who do not hold traditional Christian beliefs receive at the hands of their peers “ in this culture . ”
Her North High School classmate and fellow skeptic , Spencer Mulesky , refers to it as “ the ironic demonization of atheism . ”
The pair organized the Agnostics and Atheists Club of North High School last fall .
There are five similar student and community groups in Evansville , all of which started within the past year .
The high school ’s group is attracting 15 - 20 students to each meeting .
It ’s not surprising to me that so many atheist groups are forming ( and appear to be strong ) in an area that ’s typically known for being religious and conservative .
It would be fantastic if all those local groups could get together for certain big events ( like Darwin Day or even a Solstice celebration ) .
When you ’re in the minority , it ’s reassuring to meet other like - minded people and know that they exist all around you .
Congratulations to Susan and Spencer on the success of their group !

Mutilations are carried out for a mixture of cultural and social reasons
Thirty four Islamic scholars in Mauritania have signed a fatwa , or religious opinion , banning the practice of female genital mutilation .
The fatwa , signed in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott , states that the procedure has been proven to be harmful either at the time or subsequently .
Many Mauritanian women have welcomed the move .
Female genital mutilation has been recognised globally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women .
But that message has been slow to filter down in parts of north , east and west Africa where the practice is still widespread .
Health campaigners estimate that more than 70 percent of Mauritanian girls undergo the partial or total removal of their external genitalia for non-medical reasons .
The World Health Organisation says there are no health benefits and many potentially damaging consequences , from severe pain and blood loss to recurrent infections , infertility and an increased risk of complications in childbirth .
Taboo ' smashed '
Mutilations are carried out for a mix of cultural and social reasons , and many believe the practice has Islamic religious support , even if this is n't always the case .
A law professor at Nouakchott University said the collective fatwa would greatly reduce female genital mutilation in Mauritania because it would remove what he called the religious mask that the practice hides behind .
Mauritanian women in Nouakchott also welcomed what one said was the smashing of a religious taboo .
However , others have cautioned that a publicity campaign will now be needed if the fatwa's message is to be spread into outlying areas where genital mutilation is most common .
What You Must Know Before Choosing A Lawyer
It ’s no joke that the right lawyer makes all the difference .
You have to weigh your case and your options , and you have to know how to find the right attorney for your needs .
Consider the following helpful advice concerning knowing what to look for in an attorney and how to secure the right one .
Work with your lawyer on a regular basis to establish a rapport .
Do not just assume that your case is their first priority .
You can avoid this sort of situation by setting up a schedule at the outset .
Check online to find out what sort of fees are typical for your legal issues .
This will help you avoid being scammed down the road .
Choose a lawyer who has a good track record and a great deal of experience to ensure that they do n’t overcharge you for their own time - wasting mistakes .
Keep a paper trail .
Document all conversations and meetings with your lawyer .
Take note of all questions asked , as well as their answers and record all arrangements and discussions of fees and charges .
Lawyers are only human and make mistakes .
Give yourself a layer of protection with excessive record keeping .
Once you have decided to hire a particular lawyer , like the ones of the Abel Law Firm , make sure you receive a written retainer letter that specifically defines the scope of representation , the details of the services you are to receive and the applicable fee structure .
By doing this , you will stand a much better chance of getting precisely what you bargained for and you will have useful documentation of the intended relationship should you need to pursue the lawyer in a malpractice action at some point .
It ’s important that you remember what you ’ve read here as you go about the selection process .
A good attorney is n’t hard to find , but he or she is not just going to jump out at you .
You have to know what you ’re looking for , and hopefully you now feel like you do .

Yasmin Precautions Yasmin is one of most popular and widely known birth - control pills used by most women in the United States .
It is made up of a combination of progestin and estrogen , used to inhibit the ovulation as well as to alter the mucus of the cervix to prevent sperm from reaching the egg .
The combination of progestin and estrogen present in Yasmin also makes it a good option for treatment of moderate acne problems , specifically for women over the age of 16 years that have already started their menstruation .
Although its effectiveness as a birth - control pill is given high regards , there are still Yasmin precautions that many women should be aware of and ask their doctors about .
There are some side effects and complications that can affect the women taking Yasmin , along with the danger of Yasmin and its interaction with other drugs .
It is always recommended to everyone considering taking Yasmin as their birth - control pill of choice to have a thorough talk with their doctor about their health history : other medications ( natural or otherwise ) , past illnesses and health complications , etc .
As Yasmin is an over - the - counter birth - control pill it can be easy to access however , it should not be taken without your doctor ’s knowledge or consent .
Obviously , pregnant women should not take Yasmin , but those who have recently given birth should also avoid taking it .
Women who have been through breast or uterine cancer , who are suffering from circulation complications , migraines , blood clotting disorders , and who are heavy smokers are not advised to take Yasmin , or any birth - control pill for that matter .
This is because they can be put on an increased risk of circulatory and cardiovascular complications .
Antibiotics can also affect women ’s ability to effectively absorb Yasmin into the body , therefore it is best to ask for more information and other options from your doctor .
It is recommended to take Yasmin on a regular schedule .
Following the instructions given by your doctor is always the best way to do it .
Missing a dose can put a woman at risk of getting pregnant , thus it is always advisable to not miss a pill , or use other birth - control alternative such as condoms or spermicide to be sure .
Many women took Yasmin without these warnings and have suffered terrible , life - threatening side effects .
This is why it is important to review your birth control options with a medical professional before starting treatment .

Info On Serious Injuries Caused by Dog Bites
While you might not expect dog bites to be a serious threat , they can actually cause extreme damage and are more common than you might think .
Thousands of people are injured every year because of dog bites , causing millions of dollars worth of damage and medical costs .
Dog bite injuries can be minor , such as scratches and or small bruising , but they can also be severe , and it ’s the severe injuries that often require the most serious and extensive medical treatment .
Dog owners have a legal responsibility to monitor the behavior of their pets .
If a dog attacks another person , its owner might be held financially responsible for any costs that a person incurs because of the attack .
These costs can be just a visit to the doctor , but , if necessary , might also encompass hospital visits or other medical treatment .
Many people do not know their own legal rights when they are attacked by a dog , but it is important to keep oneself informed about legal possibilities if this ever happens to you or someone you know .
More Serious Injuries
While some dog attack injuries are relatively minor and can be attended to quickly and easily , others are more dangerous .
Some serious injuries caused by dog bites include : Broken bones / fractures
Head trauma / brain injuries
Loss of blood or consciousness
Bruising bones
Infection / rabies
All of these injuries could be potentially very damaging for a dog attack victim , and might force him or her to seek extensive medical treatment .
This treatment is almost never cheap , and it might involve a person in debt and financial obligations that he or she cannot pay back .
If you or someone you know has been attacked by a dog and is suffering from his or her injuries , contact an experienced Champaign injury lawyer lawyer today to discuss your potential legal options .

Pit Bulls
Not to be Outlawed , Says Obama
Sunny the puppy was in the limelight recently as the US president and family signals their opposition to dog breed specific legislation .
Some people believe it is about time , too .
President Obama and his family introduced their pit bull puppy Sunny to emphasize their opposition to laws that restrict the ownership of certain breeds of dogs , pit bulls in particular .
This was in response to an online petition calling for the outlawing of breed - specific laws on the federal level , and it is in line with the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , which does not support such legislation .
Aside from the CDC , other concerned organizations such as the American Bar Association throw doubts on the wisdom of such regulations , stating that it does more harm than good .
At the very least , such laws are a waste of resources and will do nothing to improve public safety .
CDC research show that pit bulls and other banned breeds are not overly represented in dog bite incidents .
This coming out by the US president is hailed as a major boost to the efforts of animal rights organizations such as the Washington Humane Society to prevent such laws from being passed and to overturn those that already exist .
Some counties such as Prince George ’s County in Maryland already have laws in place banning pit bulls as pets .
Pit bulls are also not allowed in many military installations and housing .
Many advocates hope that Sunny the puppy will start the ball rolling against dog breed - specific laws and regulations , including those imposed on the military .

WASHINGTON ? Just how Earth survived the process of its birth without suffering an earlydemise by falling into the sun has been something of a mystery to astronomers , but a new model has figured out what protected our planet when it was still avulnerable , baby world .
In short , temperature differences in the space around the sun , 4.6 billion years ago , caused Earth to migrate outward as much as gravity was trying to pull itinward , and so the fledgling world found equilibrium in what we now know to bea very habitable orbit .
Planetslike the Earth are thought to form from condensing clouds of gas anddust surrounding stars .
The material in these disks gradually clumpstogether , eventually forming planetesimals ?
the asteroid - sized building blocks that eventually collide to formfull - fledged planets .
As theplanets are forming , they are also thought tomigrate within the surrounding dust disk .
The classic picture of thisplanet migration suggests that planets like ( and including ) the Earth shouldhave plummeted into the sun while they were still planetesimals .
" Well , this contradicts basic observational evidence , like We. Are. Here , " saidastronomer Moredecai - Mark Mac Low of the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
Mac
Low andhis colleagues investigated this apparent paradox and came up with a new modelthat explains how planets can migrate as they 're forming and still avoid afiery premature death .
He presented these findings here today at the 215th meetingof the American Astronomical Society .
One problemwith the classic view of planet formation and migration is that it assumed thatthe temperature of the protoplanetary disk around a star is constant intemperature across its whole span , Mac Low explained .
It turnsout that portions of the disk are actually opaque and so cannot cool quickly byradiating heat out to space .
This creates temperature differences across thedisk , and these differences have not been accounted for before in models .
SoMac Low and his colleagues created new model simulations of planetmigration that include a disk with variations in temperature .
Whathappens when you change the temperatures in the disk is this :
The temperaturechanges can completely alter the nature of the planet migrations , causingplanets to migrate outward instead of inward .
" Well , that is a major development , " Mac Low said , because you can put it in themodel and see if outward migration cancels inward migration " and allows usto survive , or at least our progenitors . "
Sureenough , that seems to be the case .
Within the disk , zones of inward and outwardmigration develop that meet at equilibrium zones ; once planets reach these , " they more or less sit there , " Mac Low said .
Andeventually the disk dissipates to a point where its gravity can no longerinfluence the planets to pull or push them into new orbits .
So themodel suggests that outward migration " allows planetoids to survive , " which explain how planets in our solar system and others that we see in galaxysurvive , Mac Low said .
Post Separation Support is spousal support which is paid until , among other things , the date specified in the order for post separation support or the entry of an order awarding or denying alimony .
Alimony means an order for payment for the support and maintenance of a spouse or former spouse , periodically or in a lump sum , for a specified or for an indefinite term .
North Carolina law sets forth various factors in determining whether a spouse is ineligible for financial support from the other spouse .
If a spouse fails to bring an action for post separation support or alimony before an absolute divorce is obtained , the right to do so is forever lost .
Let our firm assist you in insuring that your post separation support / alimony case is handled properly .

The job has its perks .
Pay is excellent .
Hours are sociable .
The surroundings are clean and comfortable , if a tiny bit chintzy , and you 're guaranteed to meet lots of fascinating women .
The catch ?
You are required to have sex with them .
A Nevada brothel is seeking men with what its advertisement describes as a " good work ethic " and a " willingness to please , " to join the ranks of the world 's oldest profession and become America 's first fully legal male prostitutes .
Bobbi Davis , the owner and madam of the Shady Lady Ranch , is interviewing applicants , who must be aged between 21 and 40 , and have submitted two photographs ( " a head shot , and a body shot , no nudes " ) plus a short biography .
" I'm , looking for the ' it ' factor , " she says .
" By that , I mean the intangible something , which only a few people have , that makes you really want to know them and be around them .
We 've had around 160 applications , from people from all walks of life , and I 'd say only about 20 per cent of them have it . "
The recruitment drive comes after Ms Davis , whose bordello sits on a remote stretch of highway to the east of Death Valley , 150 miles north - west of Las Vegas , successfully campaigned to secure a change in state law to allow male sex workers to receive professional licences .
Previously , all Nevada prostitutes were legally required to undergo monthly cervical exams to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease .
" Obviously , that was impossible for men , so we could n't employ them , " says Ms Davis .
The Shady Lady has employed women for years .
But the tricky economy has prompted her decision to branch out .
" There 's a demand for it , " says Ms Davis .
" Since we started looking for men , I have received emails from at least 60 women who are potential clients .
Their needs are simply not being catered for anywhere else . "
Nevada has always stood alone among US states in permitting prostitution outside of major conurbations such as Las Vegas and Reno , where selling sex is common , but illegal .
The rules represent a throwback to Wild West days , consistent with the state 's liberal approach to alcohol and gambling .
Until now , brothels have chiefly served long - distance truck drivers and miners , plus punters prepared to endure the long drive from Vegas .
Ms Davis says her decision to seek female customers brings with it two great unknowns .
The first involves logistics : gigolos are a comparatively rare phenomenon , so Ms Davis has so far been unable to establish whether new recruits will be able to muster the " enthusiasm " to cater for multiple clients .
" It 's one of my first questions at interview , " she says .
" There are some men who reckon they can only perform once or twice a day , and others who say they can cater for two or three customers .
Viagra might help , and we 're also considering Cialis , a pill you can take once a day . "
The other unknown involves pricing .
At present , costs for male customers at the Shady Lady start at $ 200 ( £ 125 ) , for which you get a 40 - minute " party . "
Female punters , however , are likely to demand longer sessions .
" Our feedback is that they 'll require at the very least a full massage at the start of a session , " says Ms Davis .
" It 's one of the reasons we 're still working on price points .
We obviously want to keep it affordable , but at the same time we know women require longer time frames to achieve intimacy . "
The Shady Lady , set in gardens in the high desert , boasts a parlour with a Provençal theme , a Chinese bedroom and a " famous " red , heart - shaped bath , or " love tub . "
It has always taken a pro-active approach to business , and , when oil prices hit record highs in 2008 , garnered international attention by offering $ 20 fuel vouchers to clients .
BACKBENCH
MPs on both sides of politics opposed to the government 's internet filtering proposal are vigorously lobbying their colleagues , creating a potential roadblock to the plan backed by the Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy .
A group of four young Liberal MPs - Simon Birmingham , Alex Hawke , Michael Johnson and Jamie Briggs - are leading the charge against the filter within the Coalition , while the Labor senator Kate Lundy is putting a case to her colleagues in favour of an optional filter .
Senator Conroy has won the backing of cabinet and is awaiting debate about the internet filtering plan in the party room next month .
Senator Conroy has won the backing of cabinet and is awaiting debate in the party room next month , while the Coalition is waiting for more detail .
With the Greens indicating their opposition , the Coalition 's position is likely to decide the filter 's fate .
The government 's proposal involves internet service providers blocking access to websites that appear on a blacklist because of content that falls foul of Australia 's classification guidelines , including portrayals of sexual violence and instructions on committing crime .
If you ’ve ever watched a Chuck Lorre produced show ( Grace Under Fire , Dharma & Greg , Two and a Half Men , The Big Bang Theory ) you may have noted the text cards at the end of the credits sequence .
They flash by so quickly it ’s impossible to read them , but fortunately they ’re all archived online .
At the conclusion of this evening ’s Two and a Half Men rerun they displayed vanity card # 135 and we paused the TV to read it .
What fortuitous timing , given all our recent carping here at S&R about the decline of the press .
Here ’s what it said :
CHUCK LORRE PRODUCTIONS , # 135 I was recently interviewed by a tabloid reporter who was writing a story based on information he was given by “ informed sources ” .
He told me that he knew the information was false .
When I asked why he ’d bother to continue with the story , he said , “ Well , I have informed sources . ”
I said , “ Yes , but you know that those informed sources are , at best , misinformed , or , at worst , lying . ”
To which he replied , “ That ’s why your comments are good for the story .
They give it balance . ”
Need I say more ?
There you go .
Who says you ca n’t learn valuable life lessons from sitcoms ?
WASHINGTON —
In what Democrats hope is the first in a series of legislative victories , the Senate on Wednesday easily approved a $ 15 billion plan to spur job creation , a vote that lawmakers hoped would show that they were taking steps to improve the nation ’s employment outlook .
The coalition that passed the relatively modest measure by 70 to 28 included 55 Democrats , 2 independents and 13 Republicans , a show of bipartisan consensus that has been rare on Capitol Hill in recent months .
Democratic leaders said they hoped to follow up with other measures that would encourage small businesses to expand and would provide assistance to those who remain out of work .
“ This package is not a panacea ; it ’s not going to solve everything , ” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate and co-author of the provision that gives employers an exemption from payroll taxes if they hire people who have been out of work for at least 60 days .
“ But because we have a jobs agenda , not just a jobs bill , we will keep at it and at it and at it . ”
The measure now goes to the House , where Democratic officials have said they would like to move it rapidly to President Obama ’s desk to allow them to claim one of their first significant achievements of the year .
But some concerns about the Senate version were emerging in the House about how the costs of the bill were calculated and whether highway construction money would be disbursed in a way that favored a handful of states represented by Democratic senators .
On Wednesday evening , I was fortunate to attend a forum at The Cato Institute featuring the authors of two new biographies of Ayn Rand — Jennifer Burns , author of Goddess of the Market : Ayn Rand and the American Right and Anne C. Heller , author of Ayn Rand and the World She Made .
It was a very interesting presentation and I ’m looking forward to reading both books in the near future with reviews forthcoming .
Until then , here ’s a video of the full presentation so you can watch for yourself :
Django Inspect : A generic introspection API for Django models ¶
Django itself has shipped with a “ semi- private ” introspection API , _meta , for a long time .
I have created a drop - dead simple wrapper on top of this .
The value of introspection keeps growing on me as I realize how it makes making truly reusable applications possible .
It is an interesting intersection of duck - typing and interfaces .
Basically , you can create functionality that will work with any Django model , as long as it has the correct values on them .
However , I present this as a very useful proof of concept , and I think a lot can be done with these ideas to improve on them .
I recommend you just pull down the code and play with it .
The ideas are very simple , but the power it gives you is vast .
The code is on Github with a very simple test suite showing usage .
What does it do ?¶
The API is very simple .
You pass in a instance of a Django model , and you can get off the values that you care about .
from django_inspect import base intro = base .
Inspecter ( comment ) self .
assertEqual ( intro .
content .
field , ' comment ' ) self .
assertEqual ( intro .
content .
value , ' First here , too ! ' )
This example is using a Django comment , as you can see .
When you get a comment object , you want to see what the actual “ content ” of it is .
Normally , this requires special casing in your code , or somewhere else .
However , here we see it ’s just intro.content.value , to get the value , or . field to get the name of the content field .
The idea is that you have pluggable “ parsers ” that have names , which then map to fields on the model .
By default , the name of the parser is checked , and any mappings you have passed in .
Then it will go ahead and execute any custom logic that is associated with that parser .
So for this example , the “ content parser ” knows about comments , so it knows to check for the “ comment ” field for it ’s main content .
This lets this mapping of content to fields to live inside the parser , and lets the user of the Inspecter to just say “ I want the content ” .
Again , it ’s just easier if you read the code , it ’s really pretty simple .
Handling third party apps ¶ Django Inspect also has the concept of mapping models to fields .
So you can create a simple dictionary and pass it into your Introspection class , and it will map those keys to the corresponding fields .
An example is worth a thousand words : DEFAULT_MAPPINGS = { ' comments.comment ' : { ' content ' : ' comment ' , ' pub_date ' : ' submit_date ' , } } I call this the “ Mingus use case ” .
For example , if Mingus wanted to be able to introspect any of it ’s reusable apps for what it ’s “ pub_date ” or “ content ” fields were , it could ship with a mapping for all of the reusable app models , and then you would be able to write generic code that would work across all of those apps .
This is partially inspired by South ’s support for app migration directories
A complex example ¶ Say I am using Nathan Borror ’s Fantastic Basic Blog .
It has it ’s Blog Post model defined as such : class Post ( models .
Model ) : STATUS_CHOICES
= ( ( 1 , _ ( ' Draft ' ) ) , ( 2 , _ ( ' Public ' ) ) , ) title = models .
CharField ( _ ( ' title ' ) , max_length = 200 ) slug = models .
SlugField ( _ ( ' slug ' ) , unique_for_date = ' publish ' ) author = models .
ForeignKey ( User , blank =
True , null =
True ) body = models .
Text Field ( _ ( ' body ' ) , ) tease = models .
Text Field ( _ ( ' tease ' ) , blank = True , help_text = _ ( ' Concise text suggested .
Does not appear in RSS feed .' ) ) status = models .
IntegerField ( _ ( ' status ' ) , choices = STATUS_CHOICES , default = 2 ) allow_comments = models .
BooleanField ( _ ( ' allow comments ' ) , default = True ) publish = models .
DateTimeField ( _ ( ' publish ' ) , default = datetime .
datetime .
now ) created = models .
DateTimeField ( _ ( ' created ' ) , auto_now_add = True ) modified = models .
DateTimeField ( _ ( ' modified ' ) , auto_now = True ) categories = models .
ManyToManyField ( Category , blank = True ) tags = TagField ( ) objects = PublicManager ()
When I go ahead and create an inspecter class for this , I will be able to define what fields I want to map onto what .
So for example , here the ‘ content ’ field of the blog post is actually called “ body ” .
I could create a simple mapping for this model , or I could modify the default parser to make the “ content ” field look for “ body ” models .
BLOG_MAPPING = { ' blog.post ' : { ' content ' : ' body ' , ' pub_date ' : ' publish ' , } } from django_inspect import base ins = base .
Inspecter ( post , BLOG_MAPPING )
Now the following fields should have the following values : ins .
content .
field : ' body ' ins .
content .
value : <
Whatever my blog post is about > ins .
pub_date .
field : ' publish ' ins .
pub_date .
value : <
When my blog post was published >
Lots of room for improvement ¶
There are a lot of interesting API niceities that could be added in on top of this code .
I want to keep it really simple , however there is room for improvement .
A couple that I have thought of : Expose this as a Proxy Model , where you would get a proxy model of your model with the introspection bits attached onto it .
Make a descriptor so that you can have a pass through values do magical things on the Parsers
Allow for complex parsers by having the parsers know about each other
Make the Inspecter class know more about the parsers and be able to do more interesting things there
Ship it with a default set of mapping that work for most reusable apps out there .
Also have a “ standard ” way for apps to define mappings .
Lots more
The whole idea of releasing this is to get feedback on what the actual API should look like .
I think it ’s pretty awesome currently for the simple case , but for more advanced use , it ’s going to need to grow some features .

Do you know what happens with your suitcase in the airport behind the window with rubber cilia after registration ?
Passengers leave their baggage when registered for a flight .
A label is attached to a suitcase here , it contains information about an owner and his destination .
Oversized baggage may be checked in at a special check - in counter .
Here fragile baggage is labeled as “ glass ” and sent down not on the common conveyor but on a special elevator .
The baggage compartment occupies a huge room looking like a small underground town under the airport .
Its space is intertwined with a net of baggage conveyors which length is more than 3,5 km .
All suitcases are descending here on one of the 6 arms .
First of all the suitcase should be scanned .
A scanner reads information on a label , so if you left a label with a bar code from a previous flight it may confuse the scanner and your baggage will go to additional handling where the needed label will be found by hand whereupon the suitcase will be sent to your flight .
Then the suitcase is checked by an introscope if it has any explosives , weapons or other prohibited articles inside .
A “ suspicious ” suitcase is sent to undergo more thorough check .
This check includes computer tomograph and diffraction .
Dogs are also used to search explosives .
Oversized baggage is examined with X - rays at the special gateway .
After scanning 6 arms unite into 4 .
Suitcases pass another scanner on high speed .
Here a flight of the suitcase is defined and depending on it the suitcase is sent to the left or right sorter that is usually called “ a circle ” .
Before coming on “ the circle ” the computer speeds the suitcase up and throw it on one of the “ circle ’s ” platforms .
From the circle the suitcase is thrown on one of the 70 “ gravity slides ” .
This system makes an exact calculation when the suitcase should go by a required “ gravity slide ” and throws the baggage on it .
Look narrowly .
Do you see a pink strip over the “ gravity slides ” ?
It is a pink suitcase rushing along the “ circle ’s ” platform .
Depending on the number of passengers , 1 or more “ gravity slides ” may be assigned for one flight .
A porter takes off suitcases and scan them with a manual scanner and then puts them on the trucks .
If a plane is too big and there are many passengers on a flight , instead of “ gravity slides ” mobile lounges are used .
Pay attention : crew team ’s baggage is in front .
Trucks with baggage are taken to a plane .
The baggage may be loaded into the plane either on a small stairway - transporter …
Or lifted on a special elevator .
Usually when the plane stops at the airport ramp , a special baggage machine drives to it .
Suitcases are shifted on the trucks and the machine goes to the baggage compartment .
The machine drives up to one of the conveyors and porters shift the baggage on the belt from where it goes up to the baggage claim area .
Oversized baggage carried out separately .
Transitional baggage is marked with a bright yellow label .
The airport workers always know in advance if there is transitional baggage on a flight .
It is got out and put on a separate truck .
Ghost Cube with Labels ( Shipping now )
Twins with Black and Gold ( Special Price : $ 70 )
" I am very happy with the results , and glad that I will be able to share this puzzle with the entire puzzle community ! "
" When I designed this puzzle back in 2008 , I was inspired by Tony Fisher 's Golden Cube , itself an iconic puzzle .
The Ghost Cube design gradually formed over several days of ' tweaking ' a basic concept until I had something really interesting .
The very first prototype was printed by Geert Hellings and shown at DCD 2008 with good reviews , and early in 2009 , several were made for sale by Jason Smith .
After the initial sales , the Ghost Cube concept sat on the back shelf for a while , and to my surprise , several puzzle builders created their own hand made versions ( including a 7x7x7 version ! ) .
Suddenly there was a strong desire to produce this puzzle , and I set to work on an injection molded production design . "
The ghost cube is an exercise in making a 3x3x3 shape modification that is as challenging as possible while only allowing one solution .
Misaligned layers , odd shaped pieces , and only one color all add to the challenge .
After months of work , we are proud to bring you a remarkable puzzle , the Ghost Cube from puzzle designer Adam G Cowan !

In addition to being a great player , Numminen was well - respected throughout the League and a leader both on and off the ice .
He served as captain of the Coyotes during the 2001 - 02 and 2002 - 03 campaigns , making him the last Coyotes player to wear the “ C ” prior to Shane Doan “ Teppo Numminen was a true professional and a player I looked up to my entire career , ” said Doan .
“ He played the game with a quiet confidence and at an elite level consistently during his career while always displaying his incredible shot .
This is a tremendous honor for him and I am proud to have been his teammate and his friend .
” Following his tenure with the Jets and Coyotes , Numminen played one season with the Dallas Stars ( 2003 - 04 ) and four seasons with the Buffalo Sabres ( 2005 - 09 ) .
In 20 total NHL seasons , the native of Tampere , Finland registered 117 goals and 520 assists for 637 points in 1,372 games .
His 1,372 games are the most ever by a European - trained NHL player .
He also appeared in 82 career playoff games , recording 9 - 14 - 23 , as his teams made the postseason in 12 of his 20 seasons .
After qualifying for the playoffs in nine of his 15 seasons with the Jets / Coyotes , Numminen led Dallas to the 2004 Playoffs before helping guide Buffalo to back - to - back appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals ( 2006 and 2007 ) .
He was also a member of Buffalo ’s Presidents Trophy - winning team in 2006 - 07 .
Numminen ’s dedication to the game of hockey was evident during the 2007 - 08 season .
After undergoing open - heart surgery in Sept. 2007 , Numminen courageously returned to the Sabres to play in the final game of the season in April of 2008 .
He went on to play one more season with the Sabres before retiring from the NHL on Aug. 5 , 2009 .
In addition to his success in the NHL , Numminen also enjoyed a standout international hockey career .
He represented Finland in four Olympics ( 1988 , 1998 , 2002 , 2006 ) , one World Junior Championship ( 1988 ) , five World Championships ( 1987 , 1991 , 1994 , 1996 , 1997 ) and two World Cups of Hockey ( 1996 , 2004 ) .
Numminen earned six total medals in international competition , earning silver medals in the 1988 and 2006 Olympics , 2004 World Cup of Hockey and 1994 World Championship , and bronze medals in the 1998 Olympics and 1988 World Junior Championship .
( CNN ) -- Ladies ( and gentlemen ) : Can you find the G - spot ?
Women everywhere have read or heard that they may possess a secret pleasure zone inside their bodies that , if stimulated correctly , yields intense pleasure and even orgasm .
But this so - called G - spot has never been precisely identified as a concrete biological entity .
Scientists are still arguing over what it is and whether it exists at all .
Researchers at King 's College London in the United Kingdom have brought the elusive G - spot to the forefront with a study of more than 1,800 female twins .
The study suggests that there is no genetic basis for the G - spot and that environmental or psychological factors may contribute to whether a woman believes that she has a G - spot .
The new study is published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine .
But the lead study author , clinical psychologist Andrea Burri , is n't sure that the question was asked in a way that accurately got the information the researchers were seeking , as reflected in the study 's discussion section .
Her team did not physically examine the women for the presence of G - spots but instead gave participants a survey asking whether they believed that they had a " so called G - spot , a small area the size of a 20 p coin on the front wall of your vagina that is sensitive to deep pressure ? "
( A 20 p coin is about the size of an American nickel . )
They found that 56 percent of respondents answered " yes " and that there was no genetic correlation .
But only about 30 percent said they were able to achieve orgasm during intercourse , which may indicate that women were confused by the G - spot question because stimulation of the G - spot is supposed to induce orgasm , she said .
The definition of G - spot in the study is too specific and does n't take into account that some women perceive their G - spots as bigger or smaller , or higher or lower , said Debby Herbenick , research scientist at Indiana University and author of the book " Because It Feels Good . "
" It 's not so much that it 's a thing that we can see , but it has been pretty widely accepted that many women find it pleasurable , if not orgasmic , to be stimulated on the front wall of the vagina , " said Herbenick , who was not involved in the study .
The study also found correlations with personality components in women who did report having G - spots :
For instance , these women tended to be more extroverted , arousable and open to experience , which may indicate a psychological component to the G - spot , Burri said .
More research is necessary to make more conclusive statements about whether the G - spot has a physiological basis , experts say .
" I do n't think that these are invented experiences at all , " Herbenick said .
" And if at the end of the day , someone 's invented something and they feel pleasure from it , then I think that 's great . "
The G - spot has been so difficult to identify because it is more of a physiological change -- akin to swallowing or urinating -- than an anatomic structure such as a nipple , said Dr. Irwin Goldstein , director of sexual medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego , California , who oversees the peer review process for the Journal of Sexual Medicine .
But a recent study that adds credence to the G - spot concept .
French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès did ultrasounds of a small number of women having intercourse with men .
By looking at the changes in the vagina , the researchers found physiological evidence of the G - spot .
This study is under review at the Journal of Sexual Medicine , Goldstein said .
The G - spot is named after Dr. Ernst Grafenberg , a gynecologist known for his research on female genitalia .
He described this pleasure zone of the vagina in a 1950 paper .
The 1982 book " The G Spot : And Other Discoveries About Human Sexuality " made the term " G - spot " popular .
A small study by Italian researchers in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2008 found that women who were able to achieve vaginal orgasms had thicker tissue between the vagina and the urethra , where the G - spot is said to reside .
A minority of women say they ejaculate when they have a G - spot orgasm .
Some sex researchers say this fluid comes from a gland that 's near the G - spot area .
Men also have a G - spot of sorts , below the scrotum and above the anus , Goldstein said , although it has not gotten as much attention as the more mysterious female G - spot .
Experts agree that the idea of the G - spot has put pressure on both women and their male partners to find some kind of hidden treasure that leads to orgasm from the penis alone .
" Initially , it was a good concept , because who would n't like the idea of ' push a button and get the best orgasm ever ? ' " Burri said .
But those women who can't orgasm from vaginal intercourse may feel inadequate , and knowing that the G - spot may not exist can take some pressure off .
Women should explore their bodies , find out what they like , and communicate that information to their partners , Herbenick said .
" Whether you call it your G - spot or the front wall of your vagina , or if you make up a silly name for it ... at the end of the day , it 's what you like and how your body works , " she said .

Flat tires can be a serious problem whether you are tooling down the interstate or crunching across a foreign planet .
NASA and Goodyear developed an airless tire that lets large , long - range vehicles transport heavy loads across the surface of the moon .
The " Spring Tire " has inside 800 load - bearing springs and is designed to carry much heavier vehicles over much greater distances than the wire mesh tire previously used on the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle ( LRV ) .
According to Goodyear , NASA requires tires that can handle vehicles weigh ten times what Apollo required .

It ’s hard not to be in awe of Tito Ortiz ’s head .
So imperious in its shape and proportions .
So defiantly unbowed .
So … well , frankly , so unbelievably mammoth .
It was only after I had been admiring Tito ’s head for some time that I learned that in addition to its obvious aesthetic qualities , his cranium ’s superhuman proportions gave him near invincibility in the ring .
Amazing !
And it was only after I had been believing that for some time more that I went to medical school and realized it was absolute nonsense .
If a strangely enlarged cranium does n’t provide a fighter with infallible protection against knockouts , the so - called “ iron chin , ” what does ?
What allows one fighter to absorb a man-killing blow to the face and dooms another to crumple before it ?
The answer is straightforward and multi-syllabic : the sternocleidomastoid muscles .
The sternocleidomastoids ( SCM ) -- one on each side of the neck -- are paired muscles , composed of the sternomastoid component that runs from the sternum to the mastoid process of the skull , immediately behind and below the ear , and the cleidomastoid muscle that runs from the clavicle to the mastoid .
When flexed , the SCM rotates the head toward the opposing side .
Flexing both SCMs in alternation shakes the head “ no , ” as one might if waving off an overly concerned ringside physician .
Flexing them simultaneously flexes the neck forward and extends the head -- in the right circumstance resisting the force of a blow to the face .
It ’s why fighters often seem to be ducking into a punch .
One can look in a mirror and flex his SCMs , looking a bit like Lou Ferrigno after someone has seriously pissed off Bruce Banner .
The muscles are prominent .
Unfortunately , they are also isolated ; no other significant muscle supports them in resisting backward movement of the cranium .
Moreover , arrayed against them are the muscles used in throwing a punch : calves , gluts , lats , pecs , triceps , etc .
These are some of the most powerful muscles in the body .
It is not surprising then that we rarely see the thrower of a well - placed punch to the head grasping his hand in pain and stumbling back in amazement as his opponent casually flexes his SCMs and smiles ; the muscular arithmetic is firmly in the thrower ’s favor .
When a punch of sufficient force strikes the face , it accelerates the front of the cranium back into the frontal lobes of the brain .
This is the irreducible sweet science of brain injury .
A gentle blow to the frontal lobes causes various degrees of central nervous system sedation -- it stuns the brain -- and a blow of sufficient force simply shuts the brain off .
Seizures are not uncommon .
When a blow to the head comes from an angle , as opposed to straight on , only one of the SCMs can resist the force :
The resulting acceleration of the cranium and damage to the brain are thus much greater .
Worse still , when a fighter is struck on the chin , the mandible creates leverage that magnifies the force and damage .
This is the phenomenon of a fighter being hit “ on the button . ”
Incidentally , this is an argument why , all things being equal , fighters with large heads and Cro-Magnon - like chins are at a theoretical mechanical disadvantage in withstanding blows .
Lastly , the anatomy of the brain makes blows to the back of the head particularly dangerous .
The extensor muscles of the neck are far stronger than the SCMs , but the part of the brain under direct assault is more delicate .
The frontal lobes injured in a frontal blow control speech , movement and thought -- all the neurologic skills we see depleted in old boxers .
The back of the brain , the hindbrain or , controls respiration , heart rate , swallowing , blood pressure .
Fighters who sustain injuries there never grow to be old .

An octopus and its coconut - carrying antics have surprised scientists .
Underwater footage reveals that the creatures scoop up halved coconut shells before scampering away with them so they can later use them as shelters .
Writing in the journal Current Biology , the team says it is the first example of tool use in octopuses .
One of the researchers , Dr Julian Finn from Australia 's Museum Victoria , told BBC News : " I almost drowned laughing when I saw this the first time . "
He added : " I could tell it was going to do something , but I did n't expect this - I did n't expect it would pick up the shell and run away with it . "
Quick getaway
The veined octopuses ( Amphioctopus marginatus ) were filmed between 1999 and 2008 off the coasts of Northern Sulawesi and Bali in Indonesia .
The bizarre behaviour was spotted on four occasions .
The octopuses use the coconuts as a shelter
The eight - armed beasts used halved coconuts that had been discarded by humans and had eventually settled in the ocean .
Dr Mark Norman , head of science at Museum Victoria , Melbourne , and one of the authors of the paper , said : " It is amazing watching them excavate one of these shells .
They probe their arms down to loosen the mud , then they rotate them out . "
After turning the shells so the open side faces upwards , the octopuses blow jets of mud out of the bowl before extending their arms around the shell - or if they have two halves , stacking them first , one inside the other - before stiffening their legs and tip - toeing away .
Dr Norman said : " I think it is amazing that those arms of pure muscle get turned into rigid rods so that they can run along a bit like a high - speed spider .
" It comes down to amazing dexterity and co-ordination of eight arms and several hundred suckers . "
Home , sweet home
The octopuses were filmed moving up to 20 m with the shells .
And their awkward gait , which the scientists describe as " stilt - walking " , is surprisingly speedy , possibly because the creatures are left vulnerable to attack from predators while they scuttle away with their prized coconuts .
The veined octopus is a meaty feast for predators
The octopuses eventually use the shells as a protective shelter .
If they just have one half , they simply turn it over and hide underneath .
But if they are lucky enough to have retrieved two halves , they assemble them back into the original closed coconut form and sneak inside .
The shells provide important protection for the octopuses in a patch of seabed where there are few places to hide .
Dr Norman explained : " This is an incredibly dangerous habitat for these animals - soft sediment and mud could n't be worse .
" If they are buried loose in mud without a shell , any predator coming along can just scoop them up .
And they are pure rump steak , a terrific meat supply for any predator . "
The researchers think that the creatures would initially have used large bivalve shells as their haven , but later swapped to coconuts after our insatiable appetite for them meant their discarded shells became a regular feature on the sea bed .
Surprisingly smart
Tool use was once thought to be an exclusively human skill , but this behaviour has now been observed in a growing list of primates , mammals and birds .
They do things which , normally , you 'd only expect vertebrates to do
Tom Tregenza , University of Exeter
The researchers say their study suggests that these coconut - grabbing octopuses should now be added to these ranks .
Professor Tom Tregenza , an evolutionary ecologist from the University of Exeter , UK , and another author of the paper , said : " A tool is something an animal carries around and then uses on a particular occasion for a particular purpose .
" While the octopus carries the coconut around there is no use to it - no more use than an umbrella is to you when you have it folded up and you are carrying it about .
The umbrella only becomes useful when you lift it above your head and open it up .
" And just in the same way , the coconut becomes useful to this octopus when it stops and turns it the other way up and climbs inside it . "
He added that octopuses already have a reputation for being an intelligent invertebrate .
He explained : " They 've been shown to be able to solve simple puzzles , there is the mimic octopus , which has a range of different species that it can mimic , and now there is this tool use .
" They do things which , normally , you 'd only expect vertebrates to do . "

The career - driven , social agenda - driven scaremongering frenzy of the IPCC over global warming is totally unnecessary when glaciers already tell the tale .
Kayaking at Hooker Glacier , with Mt Cook beyond .
Picture courtesy mtcook.com
In New Zealand , the lies and counter - lies from the IPCC and global warming denialists about the world ’s fast disappearing glaciers get their moment of truth .
The three longest piedmont glaciers in the southern alps , the Tasman , the Mueller and the Hooker , are disappearing at a speed unimaginable to this former alpine climber and my friends from that carefree and reckless past .
We crossed ice 400 metres thick near places where sightseeing boats now ply the vast lake that has replaced most of the lower Tasman Glacier .
Kids wearing board shorts , sunnies and face paint are windsurfing across another lake that is now replacing the lower Mueller Glacier , also close to the Mt Cook tourist village .
In the ’60s , the late bushwalker and early alpine climber Dorothy Butler took foolish youths to NZ Alpine Club skills courses so we ’d be able to get out of crevasses , self - arrest and do all the other things that might stop callow Aussie kids dying like flies on their mountains , it was … so different .

These lakes rapidly appeared out of nowhere , starting with huge crater - like sink holes in crumbling moraine covered black ice in 1978 - 79 .
What was ice , massive , rock - hard sheets of slowing - moving ice , became vast reaches of shingle and streams and lakes .
What became tussocks became the flowers of the plains , colonised each summer with specks of gentian - like blossoms .
You can find seedlings that will grow into the first trees in places last covered by woods in the previous interglacial , maybe 120,000 - 130,000 years ago .
Why the IPCC sees a need to distort the tale that the glaciers already tell in abundance ( and with immense beauty ) about global warming is the question .
Not just about glaciers , but about temperatures , and inferred warming that “ eliminates ” pesky ground station readings that show cooling , and outrageous scare tactic crap about decametre rises in sea levels within 20 years , 50 years or whatever number of years drives headlines and hysteria .
This career - driven , social agenda - driven scaremongering frenzy sticks in the throats of some of my friends in earth sciences here and abroad , and hey , back then , I climbed with a few them in NZ , in France , and America .
In our lifetimes , the ice has disappeared and transformed some of those places beyond recognition .
The complaint is about the pressure to frame everything in earth sciences in terms of a catastrophic warming dogma .
This involves a contempt for the research , which is difficult and complex and in places contradictory , yet also points inescapably to fossil carbon induced warming as real and serious .
Then the denialists buzz around the stink with their own lies .
One of the most persistent is that most of the world ’s glaciers are actually advancing .
For sure .
Nothing like confusing advance for “ surge ” , which is what happens when a heavy snow season sends a “ ripple ” of ice downstream , as happens on the NZ west - coast glaciers such as the Fox and Franz .
The large tributary ice streams that feed down into the Tasman , like the Hochstetter Icefall from the grand plateau halfway up Cook , or the Ranfurly that drains the Minarets , are thickening .
The warmer temperatures up high actually mean more snowfall , and more glacial ice flow , but down low , on the main trunk of the Tasman , it means runaway melting , and a drastic retreat .
Some of the Tasman ice feeders , such as the Ball Glacier have almost completely vanished .
In the ’60s we used ropes and crampons to get from the Tasman to a scary place under the Caroline face on Mt Cook via the Ball Glacier .
Now , the deeply crevassed glacier has vanished .
Rivulets roar down slope there for all but a few months of the year and ravage metres of ice per day from the remaining middle Tasman ice .
These “ temperate ” glaciers are the canary in the mine shaft of global warming because they remained stable just above or below freezing point .
Now that the main glacial tongues are above freezing from surface to bottom they are rotten with water .
They will melt completely into lakes or shingle plains within decades , until the next glacial epoch comes .
The process of glacial retreat here , and everywhere non-polar glaciers persist , fits the rising concentrations of CO2 in the air from the onset of pre-industrial smelting and forest clearing in the clearest possible way .
It does n’t need help from lies or distortions .
Take your children to New Zealand .
Show them the places where the ice is being reclaimed by the flowers and trees and lakes , and pleasure boats .
It is a rare moment in time to be able to witness what happened on such a huge scale at the end of the Pleistocene and the start of the Holocene , or “ our time ” .
May we use our time wisely , and truly .
[ Enjoy this D’OHverthinking It guest post from Chris Morgan ! ]
We all have a touchstone in our lives .
The one thing we hold closest to our hearts .
The one thing we can always rely on .
For some it ’s family or religion .
For others it ’s bees ( apiarists mostly ) .
For me , it ’s The Simpsons .
As far as I am concerned it is the most glorious thing mankind has ever accomplished , and you can take all your airplanes , polio vaccines , and wheels and jump in a lake if you disagree .
On December 17th , the show celebrated its 20th anniversary .
There have been 450 episodes , and I have seen every single one of them .
Of course , people have been complaining about the show for years .
Cries of “ Worst episode ever ” have been heard for so long , they were able to deal with it in “ The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie ” episode ( my personal favorite ) and that was all the way back in season eight when the show was still fantastic .
I have never been one who likes to bemoan the show .
If anything , I am a Simpsons apologist .
Yet even I must admit the show is a mere shadow of what it used to be .
In fact , I do n’t even really look forward to new episodes anymore .
I merely sit down in front of my TV ( or my internets , more often ) and hope for the best .
I no longer love the show , but I can not bring myself to leave them .
You know , like most marriages .
In fact , and I it depresses me to even have to say this , but last season me and the show had our lowest moment ; I could n’t make it through the full episode .
It was just too bad .
It was the episode “ Double , Double , Boy in Trouble ” in which Bart meets his exact double who , get this , comes from a rich family !
Hilarity did n’t ensue , soul crushing did .
I made it through leprechaun jockeys .
I made it through raccoon families that look like the Simpsons .
I could n’t make it through this .
These days , I truly think the show is at its worst .
Now , all Simpsons fans have their own theories and reasons why the show does n’t have the same impact it used to .
Many feel that the characters are n’t relatable anymore .
Some blame this on former show runner Mike Scully , who was the executive producer from season nine until season 12 .
He allowed the show to devolve into silliness ( he oversaw the aforementioned leprechaun jockey fiasco ) .
Brilliant Simpsons writer John Swartzwelder has a penchant for allowing his writing to devolve into complete absurdity if it is n’t kept in check ( as any of his novels can attest to ) and under the watch of Mike Scully that did n’t happen .
Scully also subjected us to the scourge of humanity that are show writers Tim Long and Carolyn Omine , whose names on the “ Written By ” credit always gives me the chills .
Omine ’s writing style would fit in better over at Family Guy , as she has an annoying habit of including off hand pop culture references in her work ( look no further than the episode where Homer becomes an ice cream truck driver for reference ) .
Long ’s writing suffers from being too silly , too over the top , and usually lacking any heart .
He ’s the man behind the leprechaun jockey episode I keep referencing , as well as the episode where Bart becomes a member of a boy band whose music is used to subliminally recruit people into the army .
Really .
However , since Al Jean ( who co-show ran seasons three and four with Mike Reiss before creating The Critic ) took over the show in season 13 , things have n’t really gotten any better .
Some other common complaints are that Homer has gotten too stupid and / or too mean .
Over at the website “ Bone The Fish ” which is apparently the spiritual successor or Jump the Shark which was bought by TV Guide and turned into a gossip website , the number one moment listed is when the show killed off Maude Flanders .
This , in a roundabout way , brings me to why I feel the show is n’t as good as it used to be .
Here was a character people came to know and love who was suddenly and callously killed off .
As the episode “ The Principal and the Pauper ” dealt with , viewers get really attached to the characters on a show .
However , I feel that is no longer possible with The Simpsons and that is the main reason for both its sagging quality , and thus its sagging popularity .
Why are these characters we once knew and loved no long knowable and loveable ?
Well , because it ’s nigh impossible to really have a feel for the characters anymore .
The show has had six different show runner eras involving nine different people .
They have had countless different writers .
This , combined with the need to create new stories after so many years , has led to writers ascribing traits to characters they once did n’t have .
Many times , these traits are contradictory to everything we knew about the character .
Often , they are tossed aside and the character returns to the way they use to be , or develops entirely knew characteristics .
I ’m not merely talking about the various degrees of Homer ’s stupidity .
I am talking about the core , basic traits of these characters and their moral and ethical standing .
Take , for example , Bart Simpson .
He ’s never been my favorite character , but he has for the most part been alright with me and is , of course , a key member of the show .
In the early years , when Bart became the breakout star , recording novelty records and shilling crumbly candy bars , he was the focal point of the show .
It was a show about Bart the mischievous son rebelling against the harsh authority figure , Homer .
The show started to focus more on Homer as it went on ( and in later years focused more and more on secondary characters ) but Bart ’s character remained essentially unchanged .
He was the prankster , the class clown , a modern day Dennis the Menace right down to the slingshot .
However , he was mostly harmless , and thus likeable .
That was , until the episode “ Please Homer , Do n’t Hammer ‘ Em ” written by Matt Warburton ( one of the more subversive writers the show has ever had ) .
The A - story is all well and good ;
Marge finds a love for carpentry but needs Homer to be the face of the operation because nobody in town takes a female carpenter seriously .
The episode gets into gender role stuff and Homer ’s fear of being emasculated by Marge .
It is all well and good .
The B - Story is where I have an issue .
It turns out Principal Skinner has a very serious peanut allergy .
As in , even touching peanuts can bring him to the brink of death .
Bart finds out about this , and decides to use it to his advantage .
Instead of using this information to pull off harmless pranks or get some leniency in school , however , he instead forces Skinner to do some really creepy and weird things , one of which involves filling his pants with cats and dynamite .
A ridiculous notion , perhaps , but a disturbing one nonetheless .
So , to reiterate , Bart is forcing Skinner to do really unpleasant and messed up things by means of essentially threatening to kill him .
With that , the modern day Dennis the Menace was turned into a straight up sociopath .
Juxtapose that with , say , the episode “ Bart the Mother ” from season 10 .
In this episode , Bart accidentally shoots a bird , is torn up inside by it , so he rescues its eggs to help them hatch .
Even when they turn out to be bird killing lizards , he still protects them and saves their lives .
This is the exact same character acting in completely opposite ways .
This is confusing , this is maddening , and this leaves you unable to say who “ Bart Simpson ” is anymore .
Additionally , the Bart Simpson of the later episode , the one brandishing a peanut on a stick for evil , leaves a bitter taste in your mouth .
It renders the character completely unlikeable for the rest of the show ’s run , or at the very least unsympathetic .
You ca n’t undo the actions of the characters within the show , even a show such as The Simpsons which tells mostly stand alone stories with their episodes .
In an episode this season , a plan by Bart to make Mrs. Krabappel more fun ends up getting her fired and he feels terrible about it .
He plans to get the new teacher fired so she can get her job back , but then thinks better of it , because he wants to believe there is still a bit of goodness left inside him .
Sorry , Simpsons writers , but that ship has sailed .
You ca n’t suddenly re-ascribe old character traits to Bart .
How , exactly , are we then supposed to reconcile the events of previous episodes ?
Had this latest episode taken place in an earlier season , I may have enjoyed it .
However , at this point it just rang hollow and annoyed me .
Now , let ’s take the other Simpsons child ( I , like Homer , am ignoring Maggie ) , Lisa .
There is often a problem with Simpsons episode in where Lisa has to act like a child .
Early in the show ’s run , they needed a voice of reason and rationality within the family , and with the other characters tied up with their own roles that fell to Lisa .
She has always been exceedingly smart , so world wise and intelligent than if it was n’t an animated show it would ring as false and annoying to me .
However , occasionally to tell a story they need her to act like a child which means taking on traits that , while typical of your usual eight year old , does not jive with her character .
Take , for example , the episode in where Lisa develops a fear of the cemetery that is put up outside her bedroom window .
Normally , Lisa would be too pragmatic and rational for this , but there is no other way for The Simpsons ’ writer to tell this story .
Since most of the time when Lisa acts her age it is part of a story of emotional depth rather than hollow zaniness , I usually let it slide .
However , I could certainly see it bothering some people .
On the other hand , here is a recent example of Lisa acting in a way that completely flies in the face of everything we know about her as a character .
In the episode “ Pranks and Greens ” Bart befriends an aging prankster ( played by Jonah Hill so you know it ’s hilarious ) and tries to help him turn his life around .
The genesis of his decision , however , comes after Lisa snarkily calls the two of them losers .
Repeatedly .
In an obnoxious voice she has never before used .
With his finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead .
At the end of the episode she does this again when she finds out that Jonah Hill ’s character has gotten a job writing for Krusty ’s show in an oh so hilarious meta gag about the show ’s writers , and indeed all television writers ( and perhaps even all aspiring television writers , such as yours truly ) .
In this episode , Lisa exhibited a side of her we had n’t see in the 446 episodes before this one or the one after it ; Lisa , the arbiter of cool .
Throughout the entire run of the show Lisa has been an unpopular , awkward , social outcast .
She rarely , if ever , is shown to have friends .
Take , for example , the episode “ Summer of 4 Ft. 2 ” in which the Simpsons stay at the Flanders ’ beach house .
Nobody ’s signs Lisa ’s yearbook at the school year ’s end .
Why ?
Because she is unpopular .
Why ?
Because she is an overachiever who never missed class and apparently undertook the kind of disturbing task of timing how long people used the restroom .
She desperately tries to change herself at the beach house where nobody knows her .
She succeeds to some degree , despite Bart ’s attempt to sabotage her ( which he later regrets , again flying in the face of the later Bart ) , and we all feel good for her after she , and her friends , accept her for who she is .
The point of this episode , as well as the point of Moby Dick , is be yourself .
Lisa , the liberal , the Buddhist who seems kosher with most religions ( including Wiccans ) , the vegetarian who learned a valuable lesson about not forcing your opinions on others from Paul and Linda McCartney , suddenly is dismissing all television writers as losers ?
I could see her pointing out to Bart that his new hero ’s life is n’t all that impressive , but to do it in the way she did it just did n’t ring true with me .
As such , it was really quite annoying .
Needless to say , I did not like that episode .
There are many other examples .
Whenever they try and give
Moe a semblance of a heart or a conscience despite so much evidence to the contrary never works for me .
Homer being virulently homophobic in one episode ( though he admittedly becomes more tolerant late in the episode ) , then living with two gay men and suddenly become more effete ( for the lack of a better term ) in a later episode , and then in an episode after that holding up a sign saying “ Death Before Gay Marriage ” in a protest , before quickly discarding it and becoming a minister to perform gay marriages .
However , these are all example of character traits that have been suddenly adopted and discarded at the whim of various writers .
The very history of these characters has been messed with as well .
I speak , of course , of the dreaded retcon episode .
Were those mysterious bulletlike objects seen in the sky off the coast of Newfoundland missiles ?
Or where they , as some are suggesting , model projectiles launched by local " rocket hobbyists ? "
In a case that sounds like a Hollywood science - fiction movie , locals in Harbour Mille , a small town near Newfoundland 's southern coast , are buzzing over the sighting of three silver or grey objects early Monday evening .
Resident Darlene Stewart was planning to to take a picture of the sun going down around 5 p.m .
But to her shock she saw the objects in the sky above Fortune Bay and called her neighbour , Emmy Pardy .
Stewart took pictures of the mysterious objects .
" It was grey and silver in colour .
It looked like an oversized bullet with a trail of fire behind it , " Pardy told the Star .
There was no sound of an airplane 's engine , she said , and three of the objects were visible for about 15 minutes .
An RCMP officer initially confirmed to Pardy in two telephone conversations that it was indeed a missile , she said .
" He said the military was made aware of this , " Pardy explained , adding he told her a missile or missiles were launched from nearby St - Pierre - Miquelon , which is French territory .
But the RCMP later referred inquiries on the matter to the federal government , which said there was no missile and no evidence of anyone firing a rocket near the area .
Liberal Senator George Baker told the Star there 's no way the objects were models fired by locals .
They were too large – one witness Baker spoke to said they were at least the size of an 18 - wheeler – and at - 14 C it was too cold for a hobbyist to be out .
The Newfoundland senator suggested they were missiles launched from France , or nearby St - Pierre - Miquelon , pointing to a dispatch from Hervé Morin , France 's defence minister , that praises the launch of an M51 missile Wednesday from the Bay of Audierne in France .
Ottawa did n't mince words about the incident .
" There is no indication that there was ever a rocket launch , " said PMO spokesman Dimitri Soudas .
No one from the French embassy in Ottawa was available for comment .
Maj .
Jason Proulx said Canadian Forces have confirmed there were no planned missile exercises off the seaboard .
" There 's no threat to the security of Canada , " Proulx said from Ottawa .

Mossad 's Use of Canadian Passports : Two Reports
Canadian Press Calls for Inquiry into Allegations Regarding Mossad Use of Passports
By Faisal Kutty
Until last Sept. 25 a Canadian passport was considered one of the safest travel documents available .
That was the day on which members of a Mossad assassination squad using altered passports of Canadian Jewish residents of Israel botched an attempt to murder Khaled Meshal , the political chief of the Hamas Islamic movement , in Amman .
Now , according to Canadian press reports , including an article titled " Are Canadians in Jeopardy ? " in Maclean's , Canadians traveling in the Middle East are already encountering difficulties .
The failed mission carried out on Jordanian territory had the blessings of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , who accepted " final responsibility " for the decision .
The murder bid not only strained relations with Israel 's friendliest Arab neighbor , it also raised concerns in Canada .
Canada 's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy reacted by recalling Canada 's ambassador , David Berger , on Oct. 2 . David Viveash , Canadian chargé d'affaires in Tel Aviv , said " the whole affair has raised a number of questions for Canada . "
One concern was how Israel 's Mossad came into possession of Canadian passports .
According to Viveash , Canada has " protested vigorously " the use of Canadian passports by counterintelligence agents for the past 30 years .
The Mossad obviously concluded that the protests did not apply to Israel .
Canadian journalists learned that Canadian immigrants to Israel are routinely asked to turn over their passports for Mossad use .
Norman Spector , the first Jewish Canadian to serve as ambassador to Israel ( from 1992 to 1995 ) , confirmed this but then alleged that Canadian authorities are aware of it and turn a blind eye .
In a series of media statements bound to complicate the lives of hundreds of Canadians living and working in 45 Muslim countries around the globe , Spector suggested that Canada 's intelligence service actively cooperates with Israeli agents .
He told the Toronto Starthat " there has been an attempt to sort of cover up all of this right from the beginning . "
Spector , who now is the publisher of the Jerusalem Post , claimed in numerous media interviews and in his columns in the Jerusalem Post and the Globe and Mail that he knows from experience that there is extensive " active " cooperation between Mossad and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) .
Even chargé d'affaires Viveash admitted that the CSIS is " in touch " with its Israeli counterpart and cooperates with it in combatting terrorism , drug traffic and other crimes .
He told the Jerusalem Post that " Canada has security cooperation with a number of allies . "
Arab Canadian groups have been complaining for some time about that close cooperation .
Immigration Canada uses information supplied by Mossad , which is known to plant disinformation for political purposes , in considering refugee and immigration claims from Israel and Palestine .
Spector seemed to confirm this in his Nov. 7 column in the Globe and Mail when he wrote :
Canadian immigrants to Israel are routinely asked to turn over their passports for Mossad use .
" For its part , Canada is reluctant to have it known that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) shares information with its counterparts around the world , including with Israel 's Mossad .
Most of the information provided by Israel is routine , although it can be very helpful in rooting out terrorists and other undesirable elements who wish to take advantage of Canada 's liberal immigration policies .
On occasion , however , the information can be especially valuable .
Israel has supplied information in the past that allowed Canadian authorities to uncover spies operating in Canada .
Israeli operational agents have been given to understand that the use of Canadian passports is the quid pro quo . "
Foreign Minister Axworthy , who is on record as stating that CSIS shares information with Mossad about terrorism but " does not undertake any kind of overseas operation , " has brushed aside Spector 's comments as irresponsible and threatening the safety of Canadians abroad .
But Spector wo n't be shushed .
" It goes beyond information sharing , " claims Spector .
" There are joint operations . "
He has reported , for instance , that there was a CSIS operative working for him at the Tel Aviv embassy and that he was a witness to " a lot " of CSIS activities .
Spector , who also served as former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney 's chief of staff , said that Canadians do not know of Canada 's obligations pursuant to its commitments at the Sharm el - Sheikh anti-terrorism summit in March 1996 .
Some Canadian commentators suggest that 48 - year - old Spector 's aim is to embarrass the current government and sell his newspaper , which has a circulation of 30,000 .
The first charge is leveled because he was removed from his post as ambassador to Israel by the incoming Liberal government in 1995 to make room for its own political appointee .
Spector claims that his objective in " coming out " is to ensure that Foreign Minister Axworthy does not get away with " pulling the wool over Canadians ' eyes . "
He told the Toronto Star that he is driven by his new vocation as a journalist whose role is " exposing lies , writing about the facts and gaining a hearing for one 's views . "
Spector appears to tailor his comments to suit his readers , however .
In his columns in Canada and comments to Canadian journalists , he gives the impression that he is concerned about Canada 's interests .
He goes so far as to suggest that Israel has not apologized properly and has not given its commitment not to use Canadian passports .
When he addresses Israeli audiences , however , Spector appears to justify the use of Canadian passports .
For instance , he told the Jerusalem Post that Canada 's reaction to the passport fiasco raises questions as to Prime Minister Chrétien 's commitments made at the Sharm el - Shaikh anti-terrorism summit in March 1996 .
He also pointed out that Canadian passports were used to rescue U.S. diplomats from Tehran in the 1980s .
" If Israel had asked Canada for permission to use its passports in an anti-Hamas operation , would it have complied ? "
Spector asked rhetorically to the Jerusalem Post .
" Is Canada with us or against us ? "
Some observers , including the Toronto Star , are calling on the government to order a parliamentary inquiry into Spector 's allegations .
The Security Intelligence Review Committee ( SIRC ) , a watchdog agency set up to monitor the activities of CSIS , has asked CSIS to respond to the allegations .
If Spector 's allegations that CSIS participated in " overt " operations with the Mossad are true , notes Ron Atkey , a former head of the SIRC , the CSIS has acted illegally .

Mossad 's Use of Canadian Passports Quickly Forgiven
By John Dirlik
The use of forged Canadian passports by Israeli agents in their September assassination attempt on a Hamas leader in Jordan initially prompted a stern rebuke from Ottawa .
In an unprecedented move , Canada 's ambassador to Israel , David Berger , was recalled home , and his Israeli counterpart was called in by senior foreign affairs officials to express Canada 's anger .
" We take great exception to the use of the reputation of Canadian passports for these sorts of things , " said Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy , who said Canada did not rule out other " options " like economic sanctions and imposing visa requirements on Israeli visitors .
" Let 's come to a clear understanding that it will not be done again , " Axworthy said .
" And I want some satisfaction on that before Mr. Berger will return . "
But despite the tough talk , less than a week later the foreign minister announced in the House of Commons that he accepted what he called a letter of " apology " from his counterpart , Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy , paving the way for the return of Ambassador Berger to the Jewish state .
Axworthy refused to table the letter or divulge its contents , citing diplomatic protocol .
" The [ Israeli ] minister first apologized for the fact that any misuse of our passports may have caused inconvenience or problems of safety for any Canadian citizens , " said Axworthy .
" Second , [ Levy ] agreed that Israel now undertake measures to ensure it will never happen again . "
Opposition leaders in Ottawa expressed dissatisfaction with Levy 's response , especially after a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Minister said that the letter was not a " direct apology " but rather an " expression of regret . "
Preston Manning of the Reform Party said Levy 's remarks were " unacceptable to Canada " and urged Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to press Netanyahu for a clear and unequivocal position .
The harshest rebuke came from NDP leader Alexa McDonough , who complained that " our Canadian passport has become the passport of preference for international terrorists . "
She said that it's " puzzling " the prime minister was not demanding an " absolute assurance " that Israel will never again " rip off Canadian passports for terrorist purposes . "
Responding to charges that Israel 's actions compromised the safety of Canadians in the Middle East , Axworthy insisted he had made it clear to Arab nations that the passports were forgeries and that Canada had no involvement whatsoever in the operation .
That reassurance did not satisfy some Canadians working in the area , who have reported being accosted by suspicious Jordanians .
" It 's not the governments I have to deal with , " said Ann Kindrachuck , a consultant for the Canada Fund .
" It 's regular people ... who just know that somehow Canada was involved in this affair .
They are not going to pick up the finer points of statements in Ottawa about forged documents .
All they know is that a group of people with Canadian passports have been found to be Israeli agents . "
The Israeli letter was not a " direct apology " but rather an " expression of regret . "
Sandra Ballantyne , a physiotherapist in the West Bank , put it this way .
" I think Israel treated Canada like dirt here ... If they 're going to go around killing people , they have no right to get us involved in their filth . "
Both Canadians said their safety was further jeopardized when Norman Spector , a former Canadian ambassador to Israel , speculated there was Canadian complicity in the forged passport affair .
Spector who , like current Ambassador Berger , is Jewish , is the publisher of the Jerusalem Post .
He charged that the Canadian government has known for years its passports were being used by Mossad , but chose to " turn a blind eye " because it receives valuable information from Mossad such as background checks on would - be immigrants .
" You have to pay for that information , primarily by trading information , " Spector said .
" Canada does n't have much information to share , and so it had to get involved in joint operations . "
Spector conceded , however , that Canadian officials would not have been aware that forged passports would be used in any assassination attempt .
The incident in Amman was not the first time that Israeli agents have been caught using Canadian passports .
The first time was in Lillehammer , Norway , when Israeli agents shot to death a Moroccan waiter they mistook for a Palestinian they believed was involved in the 1972 killing of Israeli athletes in Munich .
At that time Canada sought — and received — assurances from Israel that its passports would not be used again .
Satisfactory Assurances ?
At a news conference in Jerusalem , Axworthy and Levy were asked by reporters why Canada should believe Israel 's pledges now when it had not kept them in the past .
Axworthy responded he was satisfied with Israel 's assurances because they have been translated into " specific actions , " referring to Levy 's promise that Israel would hold an inquiry on the Amman affair .
For his part , Levy avoided the question and instead cited Israel 's " unique situation " as a country plagued by terrorist attacks .
Seeming to imply that Canada had not done enough to fight terrorism , Levy said that " We repeatedly turn to governments to prevent the capacity of these [ organizations ] from acting against us , but we are not always successful , and we are sometimes forced to take our own actions to protect our own citizens . "
In the meantime , Canada 's ambassador to Israel was back at his post , saying it 's time to resume " business as usual . "
Speaking to reporters on his arrival at Ben-Gurion Airport , David Berger said , " We consider the matter closed . "

For more than five decades we ’ve been brainwashed to believe that saturated fat causes heart disease .
It ’s such a deeply ingrained belief that few people even question it .
It ’s just part of our culture now .
Almost every day one of my patients in the clinic tells me proudly that they have a “ healthy ” diet because they do n’t eat butter , cheese or red meat or any other foods high in saturated fat ( nevermind that red meat is n’t particularly high in saturated fat , but that ’s a subject for another post ) .
Or I might overhear someone at the grocery store saying how much they prefer whole fat yogurt to the low - fat version , but they eat the low - fat stuff anyways because they want to make the “ healthy ” choice .
What most people do n’t realize is that it took many years to convince people that eating traditional , animal fats like butter and cheese is bad for you , while eating highly - processed , industrial vegetable oils like corn and soybean oil is good for you .
This simply defied common sense for most people .
But the relentless , widespread campaign to discredit saturated fat and promote industrial oils was eventually successful .
What if I told you that there ’s absolutely no evidence to support the idea that saturated fat consumption causes heart disease ?
What if I told you that the 50 + years of cultural brainwashing we have all been subject to was based on small , poorly designed studies ?
And what if I told you that a review of large , well - designed studies published in reputable medical journals showed that there is absolutely no association between saturated fat and heart disease ?
Well , that ’s what I ’m telling you .
We ’ve beed duped .
Blindsided .
Lied to .
And we ’ve suffered greatly as a result .
Not only have we suffered from being encouraged to eat packaged and processed foods made with cheap , tasteless vegetable oils , but these very oils we were told would protect us from heart disease actually promote it !
See my article How to Increase Your Risk of Heart Disease for more on that .
The recent review I ’m talking about is a meta- analysis published this week in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
It pooled together data from 21 unique studies that included almost 350,000 people , about 11,000 of whom developed cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , tracked for an average of 14 years , and concluded that there is no relationship between the intake of saturated fat and the incidence of heart disease or stroke .
Let me put that in layman ’s terms for you :
Eating saturated fat does n’t cause heart disease .
There .
That ’s it .
That ’s really all you need to know .
But if you ’d like to read more about it , John Briffa and Chris Masterjohn have written articles about it here and here .
I wonder how long it will take for this information to trickle down into the mainstream culture ?
Unfortunately it ’s not going to happen overnight .
Paradigm shifts do n’t work that way .
But I ’ve seen some positive signs , and I do believe the tide is turning .
Let ’s hope it does n’t take another 50 years .

Twenty - two years after the US marketing of Prozac , which changed the marketing , prescribing and widespread consumption of psychoactive drugs–a meta- analysis of six large studies published in the Journal of the Medical Association ( JAMA ) confirms that industry ’s blockbuster drugs , SSRI antidepressants were unable to outperform placebos for moderate symptoms of depression .
Just like the older , much cheaper tricyclic antidepressants , SSRIs show a clinical value only for severely depressed –i.e. , clinically
dysfunctional– patients .
In other words , antidepressants are worthless for most of the people for whom they are prescribed .
Even cautious reporters of The New York Times could no longer avoid reporting the obvious –despite efforts to deflect from the scientific verdict :
" The findings could help settle a longstanding debate about antidepressants .
While the study does not imply that the drugs are worthless for anyone with moderate to serious depression – many such people do seem to benefit – it does provide one likely explanation for the sharp disagreement among experts about the drugs ’ overall effectiveness .
Taken together , previous studies have painted a confusing picture .
On one hand , industry - supported trials have generally found that the drugs sharply reduce symptoms .
On the other , many studies that were not initially published , or were buried , showed no significant benefits compared with placebos . "
Dr. Erick Turner , whose earlier study " Selective Publication of Antidepressant Trials and Its Influence on Apparent Efficacy , " in The New England Journal of Medicine , 2008 caused a stir among industry ’s stakeholders , also avoided the inescapable conclusion , given the finding that placebos performed just as well as antidepressants without any adverse side - effects :
" I think the study could dampen enthusiasm for antidepressant medications a bit , and that may be a good thing .
People ’s expectations for the drugs wo n’t be so high , and doctors wo n’t be surprised if they ’re not curing every patient they see with medications . "
" The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be MINIMAL OR NONEXISTENT , on average , in patients with mild or moderate symptoms .
For patients with very severe depression , the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial .
No finding of a cure for ANY patient .
See JAMA
The full magnitude of severe harm produced by these drugs in otherwise healthy people for whom antidepressants were misprescribed has not yet been fully collated –the human casualties include thousands of drug - induced suicides , mania , drug - exacerbated depression , drug dependence , birth defects …

Popular Drugs May Help Only Severe Depression
By BENEDICT CAREY
Some widely prescribed drugs for depression provide relief in extreme cases but are no more effective than placebo pills for most patients , according to a new analysis released Tuesday .
The findings could help settle a longstanding debate about antidepressants .
While the study does not imply that the drugs are worthless for anyone with moderate to serious depression – many such people do seem to benefit – it does provide one likely explanation for the sharp disagreement among experts about the drugs ’ overall effectiveness .
Taken together , previous studies have painted a confusing picture .
On one hand , industry - supported trials have generally found that the drugs sharply reduce symptoms .
On the other , many studies that were not initially published , or were buried , showed no significant benefits compared with placebos .
The new report , appearing in The Journal of the American Medical Association , reviews data from previous trials on two types of drugs and finds that their effectiveness varies according to the severity of the depression being treated .
Previous analyses had found a similar pattern .
But the new study is the first to analyze responses from hundreds of people being treated for more moderate symptoms , as are most people who seek care .
" I think the study could dampen enthusiasm for antidepressant medications a bit , and that may be a good thing , " said Dr. Erick H. Turner , a psychiatrist at Oregon Health and Science University .
" People ’s expectations for the drugs wo n’t be so high , and doctors wo n’t be surprised if they ’re not curing every patient they see with medications . "
But Dr. Turner added , " The findings should n’t dampen expectations so much that people refuse to even try medication . "
A team of researchers , including psychologists who favor talk therapy and doctors who consult widely with drug makers , performed the new analysis , using government grants .
The group evaluated six large drug trials , including 728 men and women , about half of them with severe depression and half with more moderate symptoms .
Three of the trials were of Paxil , from GlaxoSmithKline , a so - called S.S.R.I. , and the other three were of imipramine , an older generic drug from the class known as tricyclics .
The team , led by Jay C. Fournier and Robert J. DeRubeis of the University of Pennsylvania , found that compared with placebos , the drugs caused a much steeper reduction in symptoms of severe depression ( cases scoring 25 or higher on a standard scale of severity , putting them in the top quarter of the sample ) .
Patients with scores of less than 25 got little or no added benefit from the medications .
" We were able to give an overall estimate of effectiveness for the first time in this more moderate severity range , from 14 to 20 on the scale , in which there ’s no question that doctors would likely consider prescribing medication , " Dr. DeRubeis said .
His co-authors included Steven D. Hollon and Dr. Richard C. Shelton of Vanderbilt University , Sona Dimidjian of the University of Colorado , Dr. Jan Fawcett of the University of New Mexico and Dr. Jay D. Amsterdam of Penn .
The effects of other popular S.S.R.I. ’s like Lexapro and Prozac are not likely to be much different than those of Paxil , experts said .
Dr. DeRubeis and others said antidepressants ’ inability to outperform placebos against moderate symptoms stemmed partly from the sustained attention that patients in drug trials received from top doctors – which itself can help relieve symptoms , drug or no drug .
For some people , too , the drugs ’ side effects may cancel any benefit .
" The message for patients with mild to moderate depression , " Dr. DeRubeis said , " is , ‘ Look , medications are always an option , but there ’s little evidence that they add to other efforts to shake the depression – whether it ’s exercise , seeing the doctor , reading about the disorder or going for psychotherapy . ’ "

Antidepressant Drug Effects and Depression Severity A Patient - Level Meta-analysis Jay C. Fournier , MA ; Robert J. DeRubeis , PhD ; Steven D. Hollon , PhD ; Sona Dimidjian , PhD ; Jay D. Amsterdam , MD ; Richard C. Shelton , MD ; Jan Fawcett , MD
Context Antidepressant medications represent the best established treatment for major depressive disorder , but there is little evidence that they have a specific pharmacological effect relative to pill placebo for patients with less severe depression .
Objective
To estimate the relative benefit of medication vs placebo across a wide range of initial symptom severity in patients diagnosed with depression .
Data Sources PubMed , PsycINFO , and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 1980 through March 2009 , along with references from meta- analyses and reviews .
Study Selection Randomized placebo - controlled trials of antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the treatment of major or minor depressive disorder were selected .
Studies were included if their authors provided the requisite original data , they comprised adult outpatients , they included a medication vs placebo comparison for at least 6 weeks , they did not exclude patients on the basis of a placebo washout period , and they used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) .
Data from
6 studies ( 718 patients ) were included .
Data Extraction Individual patient - level data were obtained from study authors .
Results Medication vs placebo differences varied substantially as a function of baseline severity .
Among patients with HDRS scores below 23 , Cohen d effect sizes for the difference between medication and placebo were estimated to be less than 0.20 ( a standard definition of a small effect ) .
Estimates of the magnitude of the superiority of medication over placebo increased with increases in baseline depression severity and crossed the threshold defined by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence for a clinically significant difference at a baseline HDRS score of 25 .
Conclusions
The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent , on average , in patients with mild or moderate symptoms .
For patients with very severe depression , the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial .

This is the most detailed view to date of the entire surface of the dwarf planet Pluto , as constructed from multiple NASA Hubble Space Telescope photographs taken from 2002 to 2003 .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- NASA today released the most detailed set of images ever taken of the distant dwarf planet Pluto .
The images taken by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope show an icy and dark molasses - colored , mottled world that is undergoing seasonal changes in its surface color and brightness .
Pluto has become significantly redder , while its illuminated northern hemisphere is getting brighter .
These changes are most likely consequences of surface ices sublimating on the sunlit pole and then refreezing on the other pole as the dwarf planet heads into the next phase of its 248 - year - long seasonal cycle .
The dramatic change in color apparently took place in a two - year period , from 2000 to 2002 .
The Hubble images will remain our sharpest view of Pluto until NASA 's New Horizons probe is within six months of its Pluto flyby .
The Hubble pictures are proving invaluable for picking out the planet 's most interesting - looking hemisphere for the New Horizons spacecraft to swoop over when it flies by Pluto in 2015 .
Though Pluto is arguably one of the public 's favorite planetary objects , it is also the hardest of which to get a detailed portrait because the world is small and very far away .
Hubble resolves surface variations a few hundred miles across , which are too coarse for understanding surface geology .
But in terms of surface color and brightness Hubble reveals a complex - looking and variegated world with white , dark - orange , and charcoal - black terrain .
The overall color is believed to be a result of ultraviolet radiation from the distant Sun breaking up methane that is present on Pluto 's surface , leaving behind a dark and red carbon - rich residue .
This video describes how NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope has provided increasingly better pictures of Pluto since the telescope 's launch into Earth orbit in 1990 .
Since its discovery in 1930 , Pluto has been a speck of light in the largest ground - based telescopes .
But the Hubble telescope has now mapped the planet in never - before - seen detail .
The images reveal a changing landscape of snow - white and orange - black regions .
The Hubble pictures underscore that Pluto is not simply a ball of ice and rock but a dynamic world that undergoes dramatic atmospheric changes .

When Hubble pictures taken in 1994 are compared with a new set of images taken in 2002 to 2003 , astronomers see evidence that the northern polar region has gotten brighter , while the southern hemisphere has gotten darker .
These changes hint at very complex processes affecting the visible surface , and the new data will be used in continued research .
The images are allowing planetary astronomers to better interpret more than three decades of Pluto observations from other telescopes , says principal investigator Marc Buie of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo .
" The Hubble observations are the key to tying together these other diverse constraints on Pluto and showing how it all makes sense by providing a context based on weather and seasonal changes , which opens other new lines of investigation . "
The Hubble pictures underscore that Pluto is not simply a ball of ice and rock but a dynamic world that undergoes dramatic atmospheric changes .
These are driven by seasonal changes that are as much propelled by the planet 's 248 - year elliptical orbit as its axial tilt , unlike Earth where the tilt alone drives seasons .
The seasons are very asymmetric because of Pluto 's elliptical orbit .
Spring transitions to polar summer quickly in the northern hemisphere because Pluto is moving faster along its orbit when it is closer to the Sun .
Ground - based observations , taken in 1988 and 2002 , show that the mass of the atmosphere doubled over that time .
This may be due to warming and sublimating nitrogen ice .
The new Hubble images from 2002 to 2003 are giving astronomers essential clues about how the seasons on Pluto work and about the fate of its atmosphere .
This is the most detailed view to date of the entire surface of the dwarf planet Pluto , as constructed from multiple NASA Hubble Space Telescope photographs taken from 2002 to 2003 .
Hubble 's view is n't sharp enough to see craters or mountains , if they exist on the surface , but Hubble reveals a complex - looking and variegated world with white , dark - orange , and charcoal - black terrain .
The overall color is believed to be a result of ultraviolet radiation from the distant Sun breaking up methane that is present on Pluto 's surface , leaving behind a dark , molasses - colored , carbon - rich residue .

The images , taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys , are invaluable to planning the details of the New Horizons flyby in 2015 .
New Horizons will pass by Pluto so quickly that only one hemisphere will be photographed in the highest possible detail .
Particularly noticeable in the Hubble image is a bright spot that has been independently noted to be unusually rich in carbon monoxide frost .
It is a prime target for New Horizons .
" Everybody is puzzled by this feature , " says Buie .
New Horizons will get an excellent look at the boundary between this bright feature and a nearby region covered in pitch - black surface material .
" The Hubble images will also help New Horizons scientists better calculate the exposure time for each Pluto snapshot , which is important for taking the most detailed pictures possible , " says Buie .
With no chance for re-exposures , accurate models for the surface of Pluto are essential in preventing pictures that are either under - or overexposed .
The Hubble images are a few pixels wide .
But through a technique called dithering , multiple , slightly offset pictures can be combined through computer - image processing to synthesize a higher - resolution view than could be seen in a single exposure .
" This has taken four years and 20 computers operating continuously and simultaneously to accomplish , " says Buie , who developed special algorithms to sharpen the Hubble data .
The Hubble research results appear in the March 2010 issue of the Astronomical Journal .
The top picture was taken in 1994 by the European Space Agency 's Faint Object Camera .
The bottom image was taken in 2002 - 2003 by the Advanced Camera for Surveys .
The dark band at the bottom of each map is the region that was hidden from view at the time the data were taken .

Re “ The Wrong Story About Depression ” ( Op - Ed , Jan. 9 ) :
Judith Warner is correct that antidepressants are frequently prescribed by primary - care doctors , often for the minor and moderate depressions referred to in the study getting recent media attention .
Depressions respond to psychotherapy .
Ms. Warner is also correct that the effectiveness of this treatment very much depends on the individual practitioner .
The practitioner can be a psychiatrist , a psychologist or a social worker .
The advantage of an evaluation by a well - trained psychiatrist is that the medical and drug - induced causes of depression can be better ruled out , and a judgment can be made whether the condition is of significant severity where the benefits of the addition of medication outweigh the risks .
Unfortunately , as with other fields , attempts to determine who are the best ( performance measurements , published rankings , word of mouth ) all have their flaws .
There are many people suffering from severe depression , and we have to do a much better job ensuring that they get the best possible care .

After all the hubbub and controversy caused by the release of SingPlayer for iPhone back in May , we knew it would take a serious change of heart for AT&T to reverse course on the issue of 3G streaming .
The app's super - conspicuous lack of 3G was one of the clearest statements around that the iPhone represented a level of data consumption that AT&T was fairly unprepared for , and that certain uses like VoIP over 3G and live video streams were just not going to fly .
Well , we 've just now gotten over that VoIP hump , and now AT&T has given in to SlingPlayer demand at last .
AT&T says it has been testing an " optimized " version of the app on its 3G network since December , and Sling says the dynamic bandwidth adjustment should keep the app from bringing the network to grinding halt -- in not so many words .
The 3G - friendly version will be a free upgrade to the $ 30 application , and should be available as soon as the revised software makes its way through the App Store approval process .

‘ Revolutionary ’ Water Treatment Units On Their Way To Afghanistan
Feb . 8 , 2010
SHSU Media Contact : Bruce Erickson
The United States Army has taken delivery of the first two units of a “ revolutionary ” waste - water treatment system that will clean putrid water within 24 hours and leave no toxic by - products , according to scientists at Sam Houston State University .
“ The system is based on a proprietary consortium of bacteria – you can find them in a common handful of dirt , ” said lead scientist Sabin Holland .
“ In the right combination and in the right medium , they have the capability to clean polluted water with a very high efficiency very quickly .
It truly is a revolutionary solution . ”
Holland said the physical systems themselves - called “ bio- reactors ” – use little energy , are transportable , scalable , simple to set - up , simple to operate , come on - line in record time and can be monitored remotely .
The first two units , housed in standard 20 - foot ISO shipping containers , are being deployed by the Army to Afghanistan .
“ The science and engineering technology behind this process have both military and civilian applications , ” said Holland .
“ The technology was developed for remote applications where little infrastructure exists , such as remote military operations , disaster relief and nation - building situations . ”
“ These systems would be immensely useful right now in Haiti , ” Holland said .
“ One of the most pressing threats to public health in the aftermath of the recent earthquake is contaminated water and the lack of infrastructure to clean it up .
This technology is an ideal application to mitigate that urgent need . "
Holland has managed the research and development of the systems and works for the Texas Research Institute for Environmental Studies at Sam Houston State .
“ We have gone from basic research into the bacteria to actual construction and deployment of the systems in seven years .
The typical time from discovery to commercialization is 14 years , ” Holland said .
“ The bacteria , the ‘ bugs , ’ we are working with are naturally occurring .
We have isolated a small subset of them – each bacterium has a specific function -- and we have engineered a biofilm that is self - regulating and highly efficient at cleaning wastewater . ”
Holland and his colleagues have tested and demonstrated the systems ’ capabilities and effectiveness at several municipal and military sites – to the satisfaction of the Army -- by cleaning influent wastewater within 24 hours after set - up to discharge levels that exceed the standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency for municipal wastewater , “ leaving less than ten percent of sludge by volume , in most cases less than one percent . ”
“ The typical septic system or traditional waste treatment process can take as long as 30 days and leave 40 to 50 percent sludge , ” he said .
Part of the recent engineering and component testing were done in partnership with Lamar University and Sul Ross University , Sam Houston State ’s sister institutions within the Texas State University System .
“ The technology is scalable , ” Holland said .
“ We can make the units as large as required for large scale treatment applications , or as small as a single home unit . ”
The research has been funded over the last three years by U.S. Department of Defense .
The Army ’s systems will be deployed in rugged terrain and transported by the Army ’s standard heavy trucks using a standard pallet loading system .
After an extended search for a business partner , Sam Houston State selected a private firm , PCD Inc , of Palestine , Texas , to form a limited liability corporation company named Active Water Sciences ( AWS ) , to market , manufacture , sell and further develop the systems .
The university owns an interest in the corporation and has licensed the technology to AWS .
“ This technology is an elegant , simple system , ” said Dan Davis , SHSU ’s associate vice president for research administration and technology commercialization .
“ We are at a very exciting point in its commercialization . ”
Sam Houston State University received three patents to protect the technology and engineering associated with a system and has three more patent applications pending .

The parts of CSS3 that seem to grab the most column inches on blogs and in articles are the shiny bits .
Rounded corners , text shadow and new ways to achieve CSS layouts are all exciting and bring with them all kinds of possibilities for web design .
However what really gets me , as a developer , excited is a bit more mundane .
In this article I ’m going to take a look at some of the ways our front and back - end code will be simplified by CSS3 , by looking at the ways we achieve certain visual effects now in comparison to how we will achieve them in a glorious , CSS3 - supported future .
I ’m also going to demonstrate how we can use these selectors now with a little help from JavaScript – which can work out very useful if you find yourself in a situation where you ca n’t change markup that is being output by some server - side code .
The wonder of nth- child
So why does nth - child get me so excited ?
Here is a really common situation , the designer would like the tables in the application to look like this :
Setting every other table row to a different colour is a common way to enhance readability of long rows .
The tried and tested way to implement this is by adding a class to every other row .
If you are writing the markup for your table by hand this is a bit of a nuisance , and if you stick a row in the middle you have to change the rows the class is applied to .
If your markup is generated by your content management system then you need to get the server - side code to add that class – if you have access to that code .
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > Striping every other row - using classes < / title > < style type =" text /css " > body { padding : 40 px ; margin : 0 ; font : 0.9em Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; } table { border - collapse : collapse ; border : 1 px solid # 124412 ; width : 600 px ; } th { border : 1 px solid # 124412 ; background - color : # 334f33 ; color : # fff ; padding : 0.4em ; text - align : left ; } td { padding : 0.4em ; } tr.odd td { background - color : # 86B486 ; } </style > </head > < body > < table > < tr > < th> Name</th > < th > Cards sent</th > < th > Cards received </ th > < th > Cards written but not sent </ th > </tr > < tr> < td> Ann</td> < td>40</td> < td>28</td> < td>4</td> </tr> < tr class= " odd " >
< td> Joe</td > < td>2</td> < td>27</td> < td>29</td> </tr> < tr> < td> Paul</td > < td>5</td> < td>35</td> < td>2</td> </tr> < tr class= " odd " >
< td> Louise </td > < td>65</td> < td>65</td> < td>0</td> </tr> </table > </ body > </html >
View Example 1
This situation is something I deal with on almost every project , and apart from being an extra thing to do , it just is n’t ideal having the server - side code squirt classes into the markup for purely presentational reasons .
This is where the nth - child pseudo - class selector comes in .
The server - side code creates a valid HTML table for the data , and the CSS then selects the odd rows with the following selector :
tr:nth - child ( odd ) td { background - color : # 86B486 ; }
View Example 2
The odd and even keywords are very handy in this situation – however you can also use a multiplier here .
2n would be equivalent to the keyword ‘ odd ’ 3n would select every third row and so on .
Browser support
Sadly , nth - child has pretty poor browser support .
It is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and has somewhat buggy support in some other browsers .
Firefox 3.5 does have support .
In some situations however , you might want to consider using JavaScript to add this support to browsers that do n’t have it .
This can be very useful if you are dealing with a Content Management System where you have no ability to change the server - side code to add classes into the markup .
I ’m going to use jQuery in these examples as it is very simple to use the same CSS selector used in the CSS to target elements with jQuery – however you could use any library or write your own function to do the same job .
In the CSS I have added the original class selector to the nth - child selector :
tr:nth - child ( odd ) td , tr.odd td { background - color : # 86B486 ; }
Then I am adding some jQuery to add a class to the markup once the document has loaded – using the very same nth - child selector that works for browsers that support it .
< script src= " http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js "></script> < script > $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " tr:nth - child ( odd ) " ) .addClass ( " odd " ) ; } ) ; </ script >
View Example 3
We could just add a background colour to the element using jQuery , however I prefer not to mix that information into the JavaScript as if we change the colour on our table rows I would need to remember to change it both in the CSS and in the JavaScript .
Doing something different with the last element
So here ’s another thing that we often deal with .
You have a list of items all floated left with a right hand margin on each element constrained within a fixed width layout .
If each element has the right margin applied the margin on the final element will cause the set to become too wide forcing that last item down to the next row as shown in the below example where I have used a grey border to indicate the fixed width .
Currently we have two ways to deal with this .
We can put a negative right margin on the list , the same width as the space between the elements .
This means that the extra margin on the final element fills that space and the item does n’t drop down .
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > The last item is different < / title > < style type =" text /css " > body { padding : 40 px ; margin : 0 ; font : 0.9em Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; } div#wrapper { width : 740 px ; float : left ; border : 5 px solid #ccc ; } ul.gallery { margin : 0 - 10px 0 0 ; padding : 0 ; list - style : none ; } ul.gallery li { float : left ; width : 240 px ; margin : 0 10 px 10px 0 ; } </style > </ head > < body > < div id =" wrapper " > < ul class = " gallery " > < li ><img src= " xmas1.jpg " alt =" baubles " /></li> < li><img src= " xmas2.jpg " alt = " star " /></li> < li><img src=" xmas3.jpg " alt =" wreath " /></li> </ul > </div > </body > </html >
View Example 4
The other solution will be to put a class on the final element and in the CSS remove the margin for this class .
ul.gallery li.last { margin - right : 0 ; }
This second solution may not be easy if the content is generated from server - side code that you do n’t have access to change .
It could all be so different .
In CSS3 we have marvellously common - sense selectors such as last - child , meaning that we can simply add rules for the last list item .
ul.gallery li:last - child { margin - right : 0 ; }
View Example 5
This removed the margin on the li which is the last - child of the ul with a class of gallery .
No messing about sticking classes on the last item , or pushing the width of the item out wit a negative margin .
If this list of items repeated ad infinitum then you could also use nth - child for this task .
Creating a rule that makes every 3rd element margin-less .
ul.gallery li:nth - child ( 3n ) { margin - right : 0 ; }
View Example 6
A similar example is where the designer has added borders to the bottom of each element – but the last item does not have a border or is in some other way different .
Again , only a class added to the last element will save you here if you cannot rely on using the last - child selector .
Browser support for last - child
The situation for last - child is similar to that of nth - child , in that there is no support in Internet Explorer 8 .
However , once again it is very simple to replicate the functionality using jQuery .
Adding our .last class to the last list item .
$ ( " ul.gallery li:last - child " ) .
addClass ( " last " ) ;
We could also use the nth - child selector to add the .last class to every third list item .
$ ( " ul.gallery li:nth - child ( 3n ) " ) .
addClass ( " last " ) ;
View Example 7
Fun with forms
Styling forms can be a bit of a trial , made difficult by the fact that any CSS applied to the input element will effect text fields , submit buttons , checkboxes and radio buttons .
As developers we are left adding classes to our form fields to differentiate them .
In most builds all of my text fields have a simple class of text whereas I would n’t dream of adding a class of para to every paragraph element in a document .
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > Syling form fields </ title > < style type =" text /css " > body { padding : 40 px ; margin : 0 ; font : 0.9em Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; } form div { clear : left ; padding : 0 0 0.8em 0 ; } form label { float : left ; width : 120 px ; } form . text , form textarea { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; padding : 0.2em ; width : 400 px ; } form . button { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; background - color : #eee ; color : #000 ; padding : 0.1em ; } </style > </head > < body > < h1 > Send your Christmas list to Santa < / h1 > < form method= " post " action= " " id =" christmas - list " > < div > < label for = " fName " > Name </ label > < input type =" text " name = " fName " id = " fName " class = " text " /></div> < div >< label for = " fEmail " > Email address </ label > < input type =" text " name = " fEmail " id = " fEmail " class = " text " /></div> < div >< label for = " fList " > Your list </ label > < textarea name = " fList " id = " fList " rows = " 10 " cols = " 30 " ></ textarea ></div > < div >< input type=" submit " name = " btnSubmit " id =" btnSubmit " value = " Submit " class= " button " ></div> </ form > </ body > </html >
View Example 8
Attribute selectors provide a way of targeting elements by looking at the attributes of those elements .
Unlike the other examples in this article which are CSS3 selectors , the attribute selector is actually a CSS2.1 selector – it just does n’t get much use because of lack of support in Internet Explorer 6 .
Using attribute selectors we can write rules for text inputs and form buttons without needing to add any classes to the markup .
For example after removing the text and button classes from my text and submit button input elements I can use the following rules to target them :
form input[ type= " text " ] { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; padding : 0.2em ; width : 400 px ; } form input[ type= " submit " ] { border : 1 px solid # 333 ; background - color : #eee ; color : #000 ; padding : 0.1em ; }
View Example 9
Another problem that I encounter with forms is where I am using CSS to position my labels and form elements by floating the labels .
This works fine as long as I want all of my labels to be floated , however sometimes we get a set of radio buttons or a checkbox , and I do n’t want the label field to be floated .
As you can see in the below example the label for the checkbox is squashed up into the space used for the other labels , yet it makes more sense for the checkbox to display after the text .
I could use a class on this label element however CSS3 lets me to target the label attribute directly by looking at the value of the for attribute .
label [ for = " fOptIn " ] { float : none ; width : auto ; }
Being able to precisely target attributes in this way is incredibly useful , and once IE6 is no longer an issue this will really help to clean up our markup and save us from having to create all kinds of special cases when generating this markup on the server - side .
Browser support
The news for attribute selectors is actually pretty good with Internet Explorer 7 + , Firefox 2 + and all other modern browsers all having support .
As I have already mentioned this is a CSS2.1 selector and so we really should expect to be able to use it as we head into 2010 !
Internet Explorer 7 has slightly buggy support and will fail on the label example shown above however I discovered a workaround in the Sitepoint CSS reference comments .
Adding the selector label [ htmlFor= " fOptIn " ] to the correct selector will create a match for IE7 .
IE6 does not support these selector but , once again , you can use jQuery to plug the holes in IE6 support .
The following jQuery will add the text and button classes to your fields and also add a checks class to the label for the checkbox , which you can use to remove the float and width for this element .
$ ( ' form input[ type = " submit " ] ') . addClass ( " button " ) ; $ ( ' form input[ type = " text " ] ' ) . addClass ( " text " ) ; $ ( 'label[for = " fOptIn " ] ' ) . addClass ( " checks " ) ;
View Example 10
The selectors I ’ve used in this article are easy to overlook as we do have ways to achieve these things currently .
As developers – especially when we have frameworks and existing code that cope with these situations – it is easy to carry on as we always have done .
I think that the time has come to start to clean up our front and backend code and replace our reliance on classes with these more advanced selectors .
With the help of a little JavaScript almost all users will still get the full effect and , where we are dealing with purely visual effects , there is definitely a case to be made for not worrying about the very small percentage of people with old browsers and no JavaScript .
They will still receive a readable website , it may just be missing some of the finesse offered to the modern browsing experience .

Spanish police rescue woman trapped in lift for eight days
Terror :
Two policemen leave the house in Stiges , Barcelona , where the woman was trapped
Police rescued a woman who was trapped for eight days in a lift in her house in northeastern Spain .
Police said today they were alerted by relatives of the 45 - year - old woman who said they had not been able to contact her for five days .
Officers on Tuesday heard the woman 's cries for help as soon as they opened the door of her three - floor house , located in an isolated area on the outskirts of the coastal town of Sitges , near Barcelona .
Police said the woman , who lived alone , was distraught and suffering from dehydration .
She was taken to a hospital .
Police believe the lift broke down because of an electrical problem .
Some people tend to think that one way to solve the problems of scarcity in societies is that government should print more money and pump it into the economy .
So by printing more money government can give that money to every individual in the society and all the problems will be solved and no one will be poor in this world .
But that does not happen because printing of more money will lead to hyperinflation under which prices rise 10 to 100 times in very short period of time .
Because the problem is not that of scarcity of money but it is of scarcity of goods and services .
Since money is only a medium which can be used for buying goods and services but if everyone has money then everyone will be willing to buy , but goods will be same , since there is no increase in production of goods and hence more money will chase same amount of goods leading to inflationary conditions .
Hence it can be said that if it was possible to solve all economic by printing more money then there would have been no need for economics , because the main problem behind all economic problem is not scarcity of money but of resources .
The police blotter section in a small - town newspaper is pure comedy fodder .
There is no end to the joy I get out of reading clippings from small town newspaper police blotters .
It ’s like the joy Jay Leno gets out of small town newspaper wedding announcements .
Or that Matt Drudge gets out of finding an innocuous article from a small town newspaper and linking it with a headline like “ World coming to end in 2010 ? ”
Today , I present 11 great , funny , ridiculous moments from the police blotter .
I hope to have many more 11 Points lists like this in the future .
1 | Rookie
This is what happens when you try to do something at home that should really be left to the professionals .
2 | How dare he ?
I love the towns where EVERY call to the police makes the police blotter .
Because then you get gems like this .
3 | Chipotle does make them large
At least the police did n’t get a report of a burrito in a Wal - Mart trash can and find out it was really a newborn infant .
Newborn infants do n’t taste that good with sour cream .
4 | Seems like a Hardy Boys book
It ’s pretty impressive to marry a woman who can take down five pounds of bacon for her midnight snack .
I ’d be embarrassed to admit that too .
5 | So… everything ’s cool here ?
Or is it ?
6 | What are the odds she shows up to court ?
The next time a Congressman is doing a presentation on the flaws of our criminal justice system , this police blotter excerpt HAS to be part of his Powerpoint presentation .
7 | Stomping out society ’s worst criminals
I love that the woman ’s instinct was to call the cops on her housekeeper .
Whose mind works like that ?
8 | What was so suspicious ?
Great matter - of - fact reporting on the denomination of the suspicious coin .
And I agree … nothing ’s sketchier than a quarter .
9 | Not as nice of a day as they ’d like
Where is your life when it ’s after midnight and you and a friend need to knock off a drug store for almost four figures worth of vaginal anti-fungal cream ?
10 | Always blame the husband
Even if you eat five pounds of bacon and are coping with the smells that result … blame your husband .
11 | I have a theory …
And any moment now , even though it ’s years later , this woman is expecting all of her friends to jump out from behind her furniture and yell “ Surprise ! ”

Though meant to incite violence , Glenn Greenwald explains that Awlaki 's speech is Constitutionally protected .
If he is being targeted exclusively for his speech , it would be a difficult position for the White House to defend .
Blair , in his testimony , deflected criticism that Awlaki is targeted for his speech .
" We do n't target people for free speech .
We target them for taking action that threatens Americans or has resulted in it . "
We do n't know what that action is , but Awlaki is just a cleric , if an extremely volatile and militant one .
Nothing in his history indicates that he could make a bomb , pick up a gun , or plan an attack .
That he is nevertheless targeted raises questions about how he met the criteria for targeted killing .
More pointedly , it raises questions about what those criteria are .
The most sympathetic case I can imagine for targeting Awlaki is that he was using his public platform to liaison would - be militants with al - Qaeda officials .
Could Awlaki have been acting as an informal recruitment point for al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , the terrorist group allegedly behind the failed Christmas day airliner plot and other attacks ?
Both Awlaki and AQAP are in Yemen and thought to be in contact .
This is purely speculation , of course , but it's not a stretch , and the U.S. intelligence community could foreseeably conclude as much .
After all , Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan attempted to contact Awlaki .
The level of their correspondence remains unclear , but it raises the possibility that Awlaki is regularly or at least occasionally contacted by other would - be militants .
His status as a visible figure among web - based militants would make him a natural contact point for individuals wishing to pursue terrorism .
This in turn would make him attractive to AQAP as a way to connect with potential recruits .
Linking those recruits to AQAP , as he is suggested to have done with Christmas day attacker Farouk Abdulmutallab , would certainly be more damaging to the U.S. than simply preaching sermons .
BOGOTA ( Reuters ) -
Five people were killed and four wounded after Colombian FARC guerrillas ambushed and attempted to kidnap a candidate for a governor ’s post in a southern province , authorities said on Sunday .
The attack underscored the vulnerability of politicians in rural Colombia despite the progress made by President Alvaro Uribe ’s U.S. - backed security drive to defeat Latin America ’s oldest - surviving leftist insurgency .
Police said rebels attacked a convoy transporting Jose Alberto Perez , a Conservative Party candidate for the Guaviare province governorship in a special February 28 election organized after the previous governor was forced to step down .
Perez was wounded when rebels opened fire in a roadside ambush that killed four police bodyguards and another person , police said .
The FARC , or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , is at its weakest in decades after Uribe ’s campaign to force the rebels back into jungles and mountains .
But the guerrilla group remains a threat in rural areas , aided by funds from their involvement in cocaine trafficking and extortion .
Sunday ’s attack came as Colombia prepares for legislative elections in March and a presidential vote in May with Uribe still uncertain about whether he will run for a consecutive third term in the world ’s No. 3 coffee exporting nation .
In December , the FARC kidnapped and killed a governor of Caqueta State in a rare urban assault .
Luis Cuellar was dragged from his home , bundled into a waiting jeep and later found with his throat cut .
Once a mighty peasant army that controlled large swaths of Colombia , the FARC has been battered by the loss of several top commanders and a flood of desertions as its fighters come under increasing military pressure .
Colombia ’s troops are benefiting from better mobility with helicopters , improved training and intelligence , forcing the FARC to turn to ambushes and improvised landmines to attack troops .
Living in a place where water is scarce is very difficult for us in maintaining our landscape because as we all know , just like human beings and animals , plants also need water in order for them survive , bear fruits and produce flowers .
But , luckily , we are here to give some tips and tricks on how to save water .
Aside from that , hiring a professional for designing and maintaining your landscape is also a helpful idea since they know exactly how to care for your landscape despite not having too much water .
First and foremost , if you want to lower the maintenance level of your garden then choose plants that are of different textures and shapes and beautiful mulches because in this way , you can choose plants that are far less demanding than the others .
There are even plants that only needs to be watered a few months per year and the other remaining months , you can already turn off your irrigation system because they have their own way of acquiring water to sustain their life as plants .
On the other hand , if you have fruit bearing trees then there is really no way that you could hold down your irrigation system because they are the kind of trees that really needs to be watered consistently to produce fruit for you and your family .
You can also pick out some grass that can be used as an alternative for your lawn , for example choose plants that has naturally rich green color since it is also very pleasing to the eyes .
The only thing that you have to bear in mind when planting rich green plants is that this does not stand traffic so you need to place these on the sites where there are no one who is consistently stepping on it like the entrance , pathway and exit .
Shade trees are also a good idea for this dilemma of drought and they are also able to shield your house from extreme heat especially in the summer months where it is very hot .
They use very high amount of water but they are not demanding which means that you only have to water them once in a while , and when there is drought in your landscape , there is no need for you to worry about them because they sleep when it is dry .
Another tip for you is leaving out some open space in your yard because this will save you the total area of your yard that is going to need water .
You can instead replace plants with sandstone , boulders , statues or other things that does not need water .
If you put stone slabs with pebbles on it particularly beach pebbles , they will create a path and that means that there is no need for you to plant another set of plants in the area because these slabs and pebbles already occupied the vacant space .
In order to know more tips on how to maintain a landscape despite of water scarcity , then it ’s highly recommended that you only trust a professional landscape service provider in your area such as the Sutherland Shire landscapers .

Community
If there is any one word that could sum up Ubuntu , it would be Community .
Even the definition of the word “ Ubuntu ” makes reference to community , and how the betterment of the individual and community are interconnected .
Nearly everyone I ’ve met through Ubuntu in the last five years cites the community as the single major reason for their use .
In many aspects , Ubuntu is technically equal to its competitors , but nowhere else will you find the same level of community support .
Nowhere else will you find the same level of friendship and positive atmosphere .
Over the last five years I have tested many alternate Linux distributions and I have yet to find any other community that is as accepting , or that goes out of their way to invite you into the group .
The Ubuntu community has so many people actively engaged in trying to provide a positive environment , it is truly amazing .
If you find yourself at an Ubuntu event , do n’t be surprised if you actually see hugs !
And watch out , it is contagious !
The source of this positive community atmosphere is the guidance of the Ubuntu Code of Conduct .
From the beginning , Ubuntu has had a Code of Conduct , and active contributing community members are expected to understand and sign the document .
By outlining in clear terms what is expected of a community member , and keeping it forefront in members minds , Ubuntu is able to foster an atmosphere of mutual respect .
This one simple document is what sets Ubuntu apart from every other online community .
Sure you can find a community of contributors to any project , but nowhere else will you find the same respect and welcoming atmosphere that you ’ll find in Ubuntu .
Simplicity
Ubuntu introduced a level of simplicity to the Linux environment that has n’t been seen before .
What has historically been a hobbyist operating system has been tuned and refined to the point that truly anyone can install and use it .
Before Ubuntu , a user would need to be familiar with partitioning and package selections ( at minimum ! ) in order to install a machine .
With Ubuntu a machine can be installed with a very sane set of default tools without any technical decision making from the user .
With tools such as Wubi , now included on Ubuntu installation disks , a user is able to install Ubuntu alongside an existing Windows installation and have the two peacefully coexist .
Giving the user the ability to try - before - you - buy , and leave current installations and data intact have also drastically improved the userbase and adoption rate .
Ubuntu was also the first to promote a single CD installation .
Where most other Linux distributions were offering DVD based installations , Ubuntu packaged a core selection onto a single CD and offered those for download .
They even offered to send free CDs through the mail to anyone that requested them !
It does n’t get much simpler than than !
The truly amazing thing about this simplicity is that , despite being limited to a single 700MB CD , Ubuntu comes with a plethora of software .
The base installation provides a comprehensive desktop environment , including a full office suite , web browser , mail client , audio and video tools and more !
This emphasis on delivering a highly refined , usable environment from the start is a very important aspect of Ubuntu .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Even with President Barack Obama ’s attention firmly focused on jobs , it will be years before U.S. unemployment is back to pre-recession levels .

With 15.3 million people unemployed and thousands more so discouraged they ’ve given up looking for work and are no longer counted in the unemployment rolls , elevating jobs to the top of the agenda was a political imperative , particularly with November congressional elections looming .
In his State of the Union address on Wednesday , Obama backed up his pledge to make jobs the number one focus in 2010 with proposals to free up $ 30 billion in small business lending and offer tax incentives for hiring .
Both make sense , economists say .
Neither will work fast .
Small businesses are the biggest source of job creation and hold the key to reducing unemployment , so funneling money their way is a smart approach .
The problem is , even though the economy has resumed growing , confidence is in short supply , leaving these companies reluctant to hire , economists say .
Washington has added to uncertainty with a drawn - out debate on healthcare reform and what is shaping up to be a 2010 fight over tax policy and how best to ease the debt burden .
“ Businesses do n’t thrive in uncertainty , ” said Kyle Hannon , vice president of public policy at the Elkhart , Indiana , Chamber of Commerce .
Obama mentioned Elkhart in Wednesday ’s speech and has visited it twice in his first year in office , holding it up as an example of a small Midwestern industrial city that has suffered with unemployment but was fighting its way back to growth .
Elkhart was hit hard when the recession and high gasoline prices crushed demand for recreational vehicles , its major industry .
“ I ’ve talked to several companies around here that are really busy , ” Hannon said .
“ Orders are picking up , but they ’re not sure it ’s going to last so they ’re hesitant to hire people .
They need confidence .
Is this going to be a lasting recovery or is it going to be a troubled one ? ”
That was a common sentiment in Reuters interviews with business owners around the country , and it bodes ill for Obama ’s economic agenda and Congress members ’ campaign hopes .
“ I do n’t know if I am looking at an upswing or am I just looking at a flat prairie and somewhere there is a precipice out there and it will all fall over the edge , ” said Art Daniel , head of AR Daniel Construction in the Dallas suburb of Cedar Hill .
The company employs about 45 people .
Jim Pettit , owner of A - One Signs & Graphics in Elkhart , said demand was starting to improve after a devastating year .
His business fell by 50 percent in 2009 , and he is down to six employees from 10 .
“ I ’m still hanging in there by my fingertips , ” said Pettit , who described himself as an optimist who firmly believes the economy will come back .
Yet he does not want to risk hiring workers now only to find the recovery was a false dawn , possibly forcing him to let them go .
“ One or two orders is n’t going to do it , ” he said .
“ I want to see on the horizon a reliable growth pattern and then I would consider adding to the work force . ”
GETTING RECONNECTED
Economists estimate it will take at least four years of above - average economic growth to get the jobless rate back to its pre-recession level of around 5 percent .
The economy must generate more than 100,000 new jobs a month to make a dent in the unemployment rate .
In 2004 - 2005 , for instance , when unemployment drifted lower after the so - called “ jobless recovery , ” monthly payroll gains were often in the 200,000 to 300,000 range as it was falling .
Just getting unemployment down to 9 percent by November ’s elections looks ambitious considering that economists polled by Reuters expect economic growth of 2.7 percent this year , near the average performance in the decade before the recession .
For small businesses , the labor pain has been particularly acute .
Companies with fewer than 50 employees have lost 2.7 million jobs since the start of the recession in December 2007 , according to data from the ADP Employment Report .
The National Federation of Independent Business ’s monthly small - business survey suggests that trend wo n’t improve any time soon .
Over the next three months , 15 percent of small businesses plan to cut jobs , and only 8 percent intend to create new ones .
“ The job generating machine remains in reverse , ” NFIB said .
Brian Bethune , an economist with IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Massachusetts , said Obama ’s proposal to direct $ 30 billion to small - business lending , if properly structured , could produce a significant benefit .
By putting the money into community banks in the form of capital -- the same thing Washington did with the largest banks in 2008 to shore them up -- it could generate $ 300 billion in lending .
Banks routinely lend out $ 10 for each $ 1 in capital .
But Bethune said Obama has a long way to go to win back the confidence of business owners , many of whom are independent voters who helped him win the presidency in 2008 and are now discouraged by the direction of policy .
Healthcare reform ranks high on the list of worries for many business owners because they are n’t sure how much it will cost them .
Taxes are close behind .
Although Obama has pledged not to raise taxes on those making less than $ 250,000 , there are questions about how that will apply to businesses .
The hundreds of billions of dollars spent on Wall Street bailouts have also left many small businesses feeling resentful , Bethune said .
“ Somehow he ’s going to have to reverse some of the bad feelings that have been created that the administration is kind of up in the clouds and not really connected with Main Street , ” Bethune said .
“ The president has to play catch - up and do it in time so that there is not a midterm ( election ) disaster . ”

Yakuza 3 , the crime drama from SEGA , is finally coming to the West after being released in Japan almost a year ago .
The game will have subtitles .
That 's not what SEGA is screwing up .
This is .

" The content between Yakuza 3 US / UK and Yakuza JP is a little different in that we took out certain bits in order to bring the game to the west in the time allotted for us to do so .
The parts we ended up taking out were parts that we felt would n't make sense ( like a Japanese history quiz game ) or would n't resonate as much ( such as the concept of a hostess club ) , " SEGA told website IGN .
" We did n't replace the parts we took out , but we made absolutely sure that the story continuity stayed intact so that the story experience was the same as the Japanese version and that it did n't take away the human drama so inherent to the Yakuza series . "
The entire appeal of yakuza for Japanese players is that the game is a peek into the criminal underworld .
For Westerners , this appeal is compounded : the game is not only a tour of the Japanese underworld , but a tour of Japan as well .
Japanese history quizzes might be difficult for players who do not understand Japanese history .
But SEGA has unilaterally decided that a hostess club would not resonate with Western players .

Hostess bars appear in Japanese movies , and in turn , some of those movies are released in the West , complete with hostess bar scenes intact .
But it 's not just Japanese movies .
Hollywood film Black Rain featured an American hostess character played by Kate Capshaw .
And yet , SEGA does n't think hostesses or hostess bars would resonate with you , the foreign player .
There are a wide variety of hostess bars in Japan , and they are very much part of business country .
Deals are made at hostess bars .
They are a place salarymen can unwind and bond .
Some businessmen go simply because they do not want to drink alone .
Not all Japanese businessmen go to hostess bars , so do not assume that they do .
Advertisement
Depending on the bar , visitors will either pay an entrance fee or buy a bottle , which the bar will then keep for the next time they come .
Some large hostess bars have the hostesses rotate all night long from customer to customer like a game of musical chairs .
Smaller hostess bars often do not .
Advertisement
At hostess bars , customers tend to talk about their job or flirt with the hostesses , who pour them drinks , light their cigarettes and sing karaoke songs .
The girls are dressed to the nines in fancy evening wear ( though , there are casual clubs , too ! ) and many even have their hair done at hair salons before their evening work starts at typically 8 pm or 9 pm .
Girls enter hostessing for a variety of reasons :
They want to save money for a trip abroad , they owe people money , they have a kid to support or they like the salary .
Good hostesses in high end clubs are good at conversation .
They 're knowledgeable and well - versed in many subjects so that they can talk to a wide variety of customers .
However , there are hostesses that simply giggle and talk incessantly about sex .
They may talk about sex , but that does n't mean they 're necessarily doing it .
The goal for a clever hostess is to string a customer on as long as possible without actually having sex .
It 's all about the pursuit .
Drawing in the customer and keeping him interested as long as possible so he continues to visit the hostess bar and spends cashola .
There may be dinner or movie dates as well .
Keep in mind , everyone involved is an adult and everyone understands the dynamic .
However , that does not mean customers do not fall in love with hostesses or vice - versa .
It is not unheard of for a customer to marry a hostess .
Advertisement
It 's not just men .
Women also have the option to go to host bars , which are staffed by young males who serve the same purpose as hostesses :
Hold a conversation , pour drinks , light cigarettes and sing karaoke .
It 's more about getting good service , having fun , letting off steam .
However , hostessing is considered mizu shobai ( " the water trade " ) , which encompasses things like actual prostitution .
( Prostitution is legal as long as it does not encompass vaginal sex .
Everything else is fair play . )
Hostessing has been called " psychological prostitution " .
Advertisement
SEGA does not have the space to explain all of this in Yakuza 3 .
But it does n't have to .
Playing a video game is an experience .
Part of the experience for Yakuza 3 is visiting hostess bars — an experience that SEGA does not think has to resonate with Western players .
The first Yakuza game SEGA released in 2006 was dubbed horribly in English as SEGA seemed to think players did not want to experience the title in its original language .
Here we are almost four years later , and SEGA continues to underestimate its consumers .

The government could allow hi-tech security searches at British airports that focus on people who fit a particular profile , prompting fears that particular racial and religious groups will face increased scrutiny , it emergedtoday .
A Whitehall source told the Guardian passenger profiling was " in the mix " of the review into airport security ordered this week by Gordon Brown after the failed attempt to blow up a transatlantic jet on Christmas Day .
The development came as airline industry chiefs warned it would be impossible to screen all travellers with a new generation of body scanners the government now wants introduced at airports .
Airport industry executives warn the scanners are currently too big , slow and expensive to make their widespread installation viable .
Costing around £ 100,000 each , they take up much more space than the arch metal detectors currently in use and require longer to check every passenger .
Many in the industry have long called for the profiling of passengers to detect potential terrorists .
But while it is claimed spotters would primarily be watching for suspicious behaviour , there are fears travellers will be selected for enhanced checks based on race , religion and ethnicity .
" They would be looking for people who are acting differently from regular passengers .
However , it is going to appear to target a particular group of people because sadly it is that group of people that is presenting the problem at the moment , " said Norman Shanks , a former head of security at BAA , the UK 's largest airport operator .
The Airport Operators Association ( AOA ) and BAA , the UK 's largest airport operator , support passenger profiling .
" We would like to see a combination of technology , intelligence and passenger profiling , " a BAA spokesman said .
Shanks said a successful profiling system should train airline check - in staff and other people working at airports how to spot unusual behaviour .
The exact criteria used to produce a passenger profile is secret but could also include factors such as how a ticket was bought , whether the passenger had check - in luggage , as well as the person 's behaviour .
The director of Liberty , Shami Chakrabarti , warned against an overreaction to the latest security alert .
" We all take our security seriously but we need to learn the lessons of the recent past .
Any response to terrorism has to be proportionate and respectful of the human rights values of dignity , privacy and liberty that governments on both sides of the Atlantic have been all too easily tempted to ignore . "
The Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said he would encourage the Muslim community to accept profiling .
" I think people would rather be profiled than blown up .
It would n't be victimisation .
I think people will understand that it is only through something like profiling that there will be some kind of safety , " he said .
" Certainly some people will be aggrieved but the fact is that the majority of people who carry out these terror attacks do happen to be Muslims . "
As Brown announced a security summit would be held this month in London , it became clear ministers are ready to authorise the use of full body scanners whatever the conclusion of a European review of such systems next week .
The scanners , which can see under people 's clothing , could have spotted explosives strapped to the body of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab when he boarded a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day .
Officials at the Department for Transport had said the EU ruling on whether the scanners violated people 's privacy was necessary before they could be used in Britain but now sources have said the government inquiry – due to wind up in the next few days – is likely to give the go - ahead for the scanners " with or without European cooperation " .
But concerns remain about the cost and practicality of introducing them .
" It is all right if you are planning a new terminal but you cannot change the design of an airport [ to fit them in ] .
UK airports are already full to capacity to accommodate passengers at peak times of the year , " said Ed Anderson , AOA executive chairman .
Senior BAA staff are understood to have reservations about the readiness of full body scanning technology .
Brown said today the security summit would discuss methods of countering radicalisation in Yemen .
It will be held on 28 January alongside the conference on the future of Afghanistan .
Abdulmutallab is believed to have developed radical Islamist views during visits to Yemen .
The Raging Grannies of South Florida were not fans of CBS 's anti-abortion Super Bowl ad , but we are fans of the Grannies ' hats , their message , and their weirdly protracted credit sequence .

Topalov qualifies for Grand Slam Final Masters
Topalov concentrating
before the start of R5 in Linares
Veselin Topalov won the 2010 edition of the Linares chess tournament .
He collected 6,5/9 , half a point more than Grischuk ( winner of 2009 ) and a point more than Aronian .
With this victory , Topalov becomes the second player to guarantee his spot at the Grand Slam Final after Magnus Carlsen .
Entering the second half of the double round robin tournament with a large margin of point and a half ahead of the opposition , Topalov ’s victory appeared imminent , but he almost threw it away in the penultimate game after losing against the last - year winner Alexander Grischuk , who then caught up on the shared first place .
But Topalov quickly bounced up and beat the 2009 World Cup winner Boris Gelfand in the last round in an impressive Rook endgame .
Meanwhile , Grischuk could not achieve more than a draw with black pieces against Francisco Vallejo Pons and remained half a point behind the Bulgarian .
Levon Aronian secured the third place by winning against Vugar Gashimov .
This is Topalov ’s first sole victory of Linares , which comes after an year off which he took to play the Challengers match against Kamsky .
In 2005 he shared first with Garry Kasparov after defeating him in the last round , a game after which Kasparov announced he is retiring .
Linares 2010 was the last tournament of Veselin Topalov before his WCC match against Viswanathan Anand .

You 're done !
Go test ride it if you 've got any snow .
Make adjustments to the seat and handlebars until it feels right .
To all who may be skeptical of the ski attachment system : I test rode mine the day after I built it on some steep lumpy cross country ski trails and it rode fabulously .
The skis did not loosen up or dislodge from their clamped position around a couple fast corners and one fairly good double - up crash .
But , if you 'd like more security , you can easily cut grooves into the blocks that the axles can rest in and be held more securely .
Afterthoughts :
I might have liked to have cut the skis a little longer , especially after looking at a few commercial ski bikes , all of which seem to run the skis a bit longer and set up so that the tail or the front ski almost touches the tip of the rear .
I did end up raising my blocks from a 3 stack to 4 and I like the change .
It handled more predictably and the crankarms did n't hit the ground if you tried to rotate the pedals around , as they did with 3 blocks .
My old bike had short kids - length crankarms and it was great , these big ones are a bit awkward .
Things I might change :
I will probably toy with the location of the rear ski , try moving it forward to get a shorter skibase .
It may be a good idea to use threadlocker , lockwashers , or locknuts to hold the axle to the frame , plain nuts and washers have a tendency to come loose , so keep wrenches nearby and check often otherwise .
It 's probably a good idea to seal the cut ends of the skis somehow .
A layer of silicone or epoxy or something similar should do it , you just want to keep water out so that it does n't freeze and de-laminate your skis .
I may try replacing the crankset with some form of foot pegs through the bottom bracket .
Its what commercial ski bikes are doing and it would probably be easier to kick the bike along or hop on after a running start .
The big pedals and cranks just kind of get in the way sometimes .
I would like to make a large padded snowmobile style seat .
Allows for more comfortable seated riding , adjustable weight distribution , and will probably look cooler .
Many commercial ski bikes do this as well .
I 'm considering putting a 26 " fork on it to chill out the handling and reduce doubling - up crashes .
I 'll also undoubtedly monkey with different stems and handlebars .
Other Thoughts :
If you 'd like to make one of these to take to a ski area , you might want to make the mounting hardware out of steel or aluminum or something that 'll more easily pass safety inspections .
Modern kits have torsion springs built into the axles to keep the skis in tip - up position in the air .
You 'll probably need a leash for the chairlift too .
I 'm probably going to make another one of these soon ( for experimentation and to have one for friends ) using a cheapo full suspension " mountain bike " and longer skis .
I 'll update on how that works out .
Good luck and happy ski biking !

US astronomers have detected the second - smallest exoplanet ever discovered with a mass just four times heavier than the Earth , adding to a growing number of low - mass planets dubbed " super- earths " .
" This is quite a remarkable discovery , " said Andrew Howard , an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley .
This infrared photo provided by NASA and taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope , shows a region of space called W5 where astronomers are looking at planet formation .
Credit :AP
" It shows that we can push down and find smaller and smaller planets , " he said in a presentation at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington DC this week .
The exoplanet , a name given to planets outside our solar system , has been dubbed HD156668 b , and is located around 80 light years from Earth in the direction of the Hercules constellation .

Diamonds are one of the most treasured stones .
Their sheer beauty is astonishing and over the centuries their symbolism has become renowned .
Thus it has become every woman ’s desire to own at least one diamond .
Famous diamonds have become famous because they are so unique and beautiful and because their stories are fascinating .
There is no other diamond that even comes close to having the characteristics these diamonds possess .
Here I have compiled some of the most famous diamonds ever .
The Great Star of Africa 530.20 Carats - the Cullinan I or Star Africa diamond is the largest cut diamond in the world .
Pear shaped , with 74 facets , it is set in the Royal Scepter ( kept with the other Crown Jewels in the Tower of London ) .
It was cut from the 3,106 - carat Cullian , the largest diamond crystal ever found .
The Cullian was discovered in Transvaal , South Africa in l095 on an inspection tour of the Premier Mine .
The Cullian was cut by Joseph Asscher and Company of Amsterdam , who examined the enormous crystal for around six months before determining how to divide it .
It eventually yeilded nine major , and 96 smaller brilliant cut stones .
When the Cullian was first discovered , certain signs suggested that it may have been part of a much larger crystal .
But no discovery of the " missing half " has ever been authenticated .
Koh - I - Noor 105.60 Carats , an oval cut gem , now part of the British Crown Jewels .
The name of this diamond means " Mountain of Light " and its history , dating back to1304 , is the longest of all famous diamonds .
It was captured by the Rajahs of Malwa in the sixteenth century by the Mogul , Sultan Babur and remained in the possession of later Mogul emperors .
It may have been set in the famous Peacock Throne made for Shah Jehan .
After the break - up of the Persian empire the diamond found its way to India .
It may have traveled to Afghanistan with a bodyguard of Nadir Shah , who fled with the stone when the Shah was murdered , to be later offered to Ranjit Singh of the Punjab in exchange for military help ( which was never delivered ) .
After fighting broke out between the Sikhs and the British , The East India Company claimed the diamond as a partial indemnity , and then presented it to Queen Victoria in 1850 .
When the stone came from India , it weighed l986 carats ; it was later recut to l08.93 carats .
It was first worn by the Queen in a brooch .
It was later set in the State Crown , worn by Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary , and 1937 was worn for by Queen Elizabeth for her coronation .
It is kept in the Tower of London , with the other Crown Jewels .
The Excelsior Until 1905 when the Cullinan diamond was found , the Excelsior diamond held the title of being the largest diamond in the world .
The Excelsior was found in the Jagersfontein Mine on June 30 , 1895 by one of the workers while he was loading it onto a truck .
The man who found the diamond wanted to hide it from his supervisors and he was successful but he did hand it over to the managers of the mine .
The diamond had a blue - white color and weighed 971.75 Carats , which is approximately 194.2 grams .
The Great Mogul The Great Mogul Diamond ’s story begins around 1650 with its discovery as a rough diamond , most probably in the Kollur Mine in the Golconda region of southern India .
Weighing in at a whopping 787.50 carats , the diamond ’s impressive size made it a perfect gift of diplomacy when Emir Jemla , a very wealthy general , used it in seeking an alliance between two great families .
Presenting the rough diamond to Shah Jehan , Emperor of India , Jemla described it as “ that celebrated diamond which has been generally deemed unparalleled in size and beauty .
However the stone has disappeared .
Some believe that the Koh - I - Noor diamond may have been cut from this stone after its loss .
The Idol ’s Eye 70.20 Carats , a flattened pear - shaped stone the size of a bantam 's egg .
Another famous diamond that was once set in the eye of an idol before it was stolen .
Legend also has it that it was given as ransom for Princess Rasheetah by the Sheik of Kashmir to the Sultan of Turkey who had abducted her .
The Regent 140.50 Carats , although it is now surpassed in weight by other famous diamonds , the exceptional limpidity and perfect cut of the Regent give it an uncontestable reputation as the most beautiful diamond in the world .
Discovered in India in 1698 , it was acquired by Thomas Pitt , Governor of Madras , who sent it to England where it was cut .
In 1717 the Regent purchased it from Pitt for the French Crown .
It first adorned the band of Louis XV 's silver gilt crown ( in the Louvre ) at his coronation in 1722 , going then to Louis XVI 's crown in 1775 .
Later in 1801 it figured on the hilt of the First Consul 's sword ( Fontainebleau , Musée Napoléon 1st ) , and then on the Emperor 's two - edged sword in 1812 .
In 1825 it was worn on the crown at the coronation of Charles x , and during the Second Empire it embellished the " Grecian diadem " of the Empress Eugenie .
It can be seen today at the Louvre in Paris .
The Orloff 300 Carats when found , color : slightly bluish green , clarity : exceptionally pure , cut : Mogul - cut rose , source : India .
This gem may be found in the Diamond Treasury of Russia in Moscow .
There are so many historical episodes involving the Orloff .
First , it may have been set at one time as the diamond eye of Vishnu 's idol ( one of the Hindu Gods ) in the innermost sanctuary temple in Sriangam , before being stolen in the 1700s by a French deserter .
However , the deserter just dug one eye from its socket , because he was terror - stricken at the thought of retribution , so he could n't take the other .
He went to Madras , and sold the stone quickly to an English sea-captain for 2,000 pounds .
The time passed , the stone arrived at Amsterdam where the Russian count Grigori Orloff , an ex-lover of Empress Catherine the Great was residing .
He heard about rumors of the stone , and he bought the diamond for 90,000 pounds and took it back to Russia for Catherine 's favor .
The stone has been called the Orloff since then .
Catherine received his gift and had it mounted in the Imperial Sceptre .
She gave a marble palace to Grigori in exchange for the Orloff .
However , Grigori could n't get Catherine 's love .
Grigori Orloff passed away at the nadir of disappointment in 1783 .
In 1812 the Russians , fearing that Napoleon with his Grand Army was about to enter Moscow , hid the Orloff in a priest 's tomb .
Napoleon supposedly discovered the Orloff 's location and went to claim it .
However , as a solider of the Army was about to touch the Orloff , a priest 's ghost appeared and pronounced a terrible curse upon the Army .
The Emperor , Napoleon scampered away without the Orloff .
The Blue Hope 45.52 Carats , the ironically named Hope diamond ( named for its purchaser , Henry Thomas Hope ) may have had a long and illustrious history before it became associated with a run of bad luck for its owners .
It is thought to be a part of the famous Blue Tavernier Diamond , brought to Europe from India in l642 .
The Blue was purchased by King Louis XIV who had it cut to 67.50 carats from 112 carats to bring out its brilliance .
The diamond was stolen during the French Revolution , and a smaller diamond of similar color was sold in 1830 to Hope , an English banker .
After inheriting the diamond , Hope 's son lost his fortune .
It was eventually acquired by an American widow , Mrs. Edward McLean , whose family then suffered a series of catastrophes : her only child was accidentally killed , the family broke up , Mrs. McLean lost her money , and then committed suicide .
When Harry Winston , the New York diamond merchant , bought the stone in 1949 , many clients refused to uch the stone .
It is now on display at the Smithosonian Institute in Washington .
The Sancy 55 Carats , it was cut in a pear shape and was first owned by Charles the Bold , Duke of Burgundy , who lost it in battle in 1477 .
The stone is in fact named after a later owner , Seigneur de Sancy , a French Ambassador to Turkey in the late 16th century .
He loaned it to the French king , Henry III who wore it in the cap with which he concealed his baldness .
Henry IV of France also borrowed the stone from Sancy , but it was sold in 1664 to James I of England .
In 1688 , James II , last of the Stuart kings of England , fled with it to Paris .
It disappeared during the French revolution .
Taylor - Burton 69.42 Carats , color : F - G , clarity : IF , cut : Pear - shape , source : Premier Mine , Transvaal , South Africa .
It was founded in 1966 in the Premier Mine in South Africa .
The rough , which weighted 240.80 carats , was cut into a 69.42 pear shape diamond .
As you might guess from the name , Richard Burton bought and named this stone as a gift for Elizabeth Taylor .
Yes , Richard Burton bought it $ 1,100,000 .
He also named this stone as an engagement .
After Burton 's death in 1979 , Liz Taylor sold the stone for charity and reportedly received $ 2.8 million .
She donated in his memory to a hospital in Biafra .
It was last seen in Saudi Arabia .

Since the mid-1990s , Tasmanian devil numbers have crashed Researchers believe they have identified the source of fatal tumours that threaten to wipe out the wild population of Tasmanian devils .
Writing in Science , an international team of scientists suggest cells that protect nerves are the likely origin of devil facial tumour disease ( DFTD ) .
The disease is a transmissible cancer that is spread by physical contact , and quickly kills the animals .
DFTD has caused the devil population to collapse by 60 % in the past decade .
" To look more closely at the tumours ' origin , we sequenced the genes that are expressed in this devil cancer and compared them with other genes that are expressed in other devil tissues , " explained lead author Elizabeth Murchison , from the Australian National University in Canberra .
She told the Science podcast the team 's findings delivered surprising results .
" We found that the tumours expressed genes that were normally only expressed by Schwann cells , which are cells that are found in the peripheral nervous system that protect nerves . "
' Genetically distinct '
The researchers sampled 25 different tumours from all over Tasmania , the only place on the planet where the world 's largest carnivorous marsupials are found .
DEVILS IN DETAIL Scientific name : Sarcophilus harrisii
Devils were given their common name by early settlers , who were haunted by " demonic growls " Largest living carnivorous marsupial Now only found in Tasmania Can live up to five years in wild Weight : male 10 - 12kg ; female 6 - 8 kg
They favour habitats where they can shelter by day and scavenge by night
They found that the growths were genetically distinct from their hosts , but were identical to one another .
Dr Murchison , who is also a researcher at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , US , said the teams findings had a number of positive outcomes : " Most importantly , this has led to the development of a diagnostic test for the disease .
" Devils are susceptible to a number of different types of cancer .
Just like humans , they can get breast cancer , leukaemia , etc - especially in their old age .
" Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between these types of cancer and the transmissible disease .
" Now that we know that these very specific Schwann genes are expressed in the cancer , we can use these genes as diagnostic markers . "
DFTD was first described in the mid-1990s , when devils with large facial tumours were photographed in north - eastern Tasmania .
By the end of 2008 , the disease - which kills infected animals within nine weeks - had been confirmed at 64 locations , covering more than 60 % of the Australian island state 's mainland .
Experts warn that without intervention , the disease could wipe out the wild population of the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial within decades .
Dr Murchison hoped identifying the catalogue of genes associated with DFTD would lead to the development of vaccines , or possibly therapies .
The disease usually kills infected devils within nine weeks " As yet , unfortunately , there is nothing we can do to help the devils that have the disease , " she said .
" This devil facial cancer is very unusual as it is an infection cancer ; it is a little bit like an organ transplant , " she said .
" In an organ transplant , you have an organ that is transplanted into an unrelated individual .
In the case of the devil cancer , you have a cancer that is transplanted into another unrelated devil through biting .
" One of the big questions about this cancer is why it is not being rejected or being recognised as a foreign graft .
" If we could understand that ... we could perhaps use this data to develop a vaccine that could help the devils ' immune system reject the cancer before it takes hold . "

First Group drivers on the number 3 route kept an eye on Casper A cat which became a celebrity by travelling around Plymouth on the bus has died after reportedly being struck by a car .
Casper , a 12 - year - old black and white cat , used to wait with commuters at the bus stop and then hop on to the number 3 to find a seat to curl up on .
The cat was so well - known on the First Devon and Cornwall service , drivers knew which stop to let him off at .
His death was announced on a notice put up at Casper 's bus stop by his owner .
' Free spirit '
It said : " Many local people knew Casper , who loved everyone - he also enjoyed the bus journeys .
" Sadly a motorist hit him and did not stop .
" Casper died from his injuries .
He will be greatly missed ... he was a much loved pet who had so much character .
Thank you to all those who befriended him . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement First Devon and Cornwall said it was " devastated " by the cat 's death .
Casper 's owner , 55 - year - old Susan Finden , who re-homed him from a rescue centre in 2002 , said he had always been a free spirit .
He was named after the cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost , because of his habit of wandering off .
' Exploring heaven ' Mrs Finden posted a tribute to Casper on the local Herald newspaper website and thanked First 's bus drivers for looking after her pet so well .
The website has also received tributes to Casper from around the world , including the US and Australia .
The bus company said many of its drivers had expressed sympathy for Casper to Mrs Finden .
In a statement , a company spokeswoman said : " Casper touched many people 's lives and clearly had a very exciting life - travelling around Plymouth and who knows where else .
" I suspect he's now exploring heaven and is telling all the other cats up there about the many adventures he had . "
A picture of the cat will continue to be used on one of the company 's buses .

Scientists broke the law by hiding climate change data :
But legal loophole means they wo n't be prosecuted
Accused : Professor Phil Jones asked a colleague to delete emails relating to a report by the IPCC
Scientist at the heart of the ' Climategate ' email scandal broke the law when they refused to give raw data to the public , the privacy watchdog has ruled .
The Information Commissioner 's office said University of East Anglia researchers breached the Freedom of Information Act when handling requests from climate change sceptics .
But the scientists will escape prosecution because the offences took place more than six months ago .
The revelation comes after a string of embarrassing blunders and gaffes for climate scientists and will fuel concerns that key researchers are too secretive and too arrogant .
It will pile pressure on the director of the university 's climate change unit , Professor Phil Jones , who has stood aside while an investigation is carried out , and make it harder for him to return .
The ruling followed a complaint from retired engineer David Holland - 66 , whose Freedom of Information - requests were ignored .
Last night Mr Holland welcomed the watchdog 's decision but said it was disappointing the researchers would not be prosecuted .
' All we are trying to do is make the scientists follow their own professional rules by being open , transparent and honest , ' he said .
' We are not trying to show that human beings do n't affect the climate , but to show that the science is not settled . '
Scientists at the University of East Anglia were encouraged to delete emails concerning claims that man-made emissions were causing global warming
The Climategate row broke in November when hundreds of stolen emails from the world - renowned Climate Research Unit in Norwich were posted online .
The emails appeared to show researchers discussing how to manipulate historical temperature data and dodge requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
One request came in 2008 from Mr Holland , a grandfather from Northampton and an engineering graduate .
He was seeking evidence that scientists had cherry - picked research when preparing the previous year 's UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report .
Conducting a full inquiry : Liberal Democrat MP Phil Willis
After the request was received , a message from one academic to another on May 28 , 2008 , said : ' Oh MAN !
Will this c**p never end ? '
In other emails the researchers complained that the unit was being bombarded with FOI requests from sceptics .
And in another , researchers appeared to be encouraging each other to delete emails .
After the emails were published , Mr Holland complained to the Information Commissioner 's Office .
An ICO spokesman yesterday confirmed that the UEA breached the Freedom of Information Act .
He added : ' The emails which are now public reveal that Mr Holland 's requests under the Freedom of Information
Act were not dealt with as they should have been under the legislation . '
Climate change sceptics welcomed the ruling and called for the Climategate inquiry to be made public .
Lord Lawson , head of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , said it should also investigate whether the CRU denied opportunities to scientists trying to publish dissenting views .
Last week , the IPCC was forced to apologise after wrongly claiming the Himalayan glaciers could vanish within 25 years .
Critics have also accused it of exaggerating the risk of tropical storms and hurricanes .
Earlier this week , Britain 's chief scientific advisor , Professor John Beddington , called on climate scientists to be more honest about the uncertainties of global warming .

The Imperial March went down this morning at Foot Locker on 34th St. , and special guest Snoop Dogg joined up at the Time Square store .
You really ca n’t get more OG than Snoop and Darth Vader .
By Thomas Adams , at Paykin Krieg and Adams , LLP , and a former managing director at Ambac and FGIC .
Readers may have noticed Janet Tavakoli ’s recent article at Huffington Post on Goldman Sachs and AIG .
While much of it covers territory that Yves and I already wrote about previously , Ms. Tavakoli stops short of telling the whole story .
While she is very knowledgeable of this market , perhaps she is unaware of the full extent of the wrongdoings Goldman committed by getting themselves paid on the AIG bailout .
The Federal Reserve and the Treasury aided and abetted Goldman Sachs in committing financial and ethical crimes at an astounding level .
She notes , accurately , that Goldman used AIG to hedge its bet on CDO ’s , either for itself with the Abacus deals , or for its clients , with the Davis Square deal .
Had AIG failed , Goldman would have been on the hook for the losses : to execute the CDO with synthetic mortgage bonds , Goldman went “ long ” the CDS and then turned around and went “ short ” with AIG , effectively taking the risk of the mortgage bonds defaulting and then transferring it to AIG .
But Ms. Tavakoli fails to note that the collapse of the CDO bonds and the collapse of AIG were a deliberate strategy by Goldman .
To realize on their bet against the housing market , Goldman needed the CDO bonds to collapse in value , which would cause AIG to be downgraded and lead to AIG posting collateral and Goldman getting paid for their bet .
I am confident that Goldman Sachs did not reveal to AIG that they were betting on the housing market collapse .
To help hasten the housing market collapse , Goldman ran a huge mortgage lending and issuance program with low quality loans virtually designed to fail , including dozens of deals backed by completely toxic non-prime second lien loans ( these loans help pump up the housing bubble and let borrower ’s suck the equity out of their homes ) .
In soliciting AIG ’s insurance for the CDOs , Goldman was not disclosing that the transaction was highly speculative .
Goldman was offering AAA , or even super AAA bonds .
Goldman designed and sold these bonds and purchased a rating from the rating agencies that represented the risk to be AAA .
In fact , the bonds did not provide real protection , despite their AAA rating , and when the housing market turned down , the AAA CDO bonds collapsed in value exactly as they were designed to do .
Goldman never wanted these CDOs to succeed – their bet depended on them failing .
This is why they used AIG as their insurer – AIG posted collateral , which enabled Goldman to still get paid even when AIG inevitably got downgraded for taking on such toxic deals .
Goldman needed AIG ’s insurance to complete this bet and get them off risk for the CDO they created .
Hedge fund manager John Paulson and others used the same strategy .
Goldman ’s bet was risky because they depended on AIG being solvent in order to get paid .
Other parties who made similar betters , but relied on the other bond insurers to pay them off ended up getting hurt when the bond insurers got downgraded and the trade did not pay off , as well .
Months before AIG received its bailout , Goldman was well aware of the risk that insurers would pay less the full amount of the CDOs – Goldman was advising FGIC in its restructuring efforts and FGIC negotiated a CDO commutation for ten cents on the dollar .
Goldman mitigated the risk of downgrade by dealing exclusively with AIG , which was required to post collateral in the event of a downgrade .
Goldman also misled shareholders and investors by proclaiming that they were not exposed to toxic CDOs because they were hedged with AIG , even as the bond insurers ( AIG ’s direct competitors in the CDO market ) , were getting downgraded .
It is bad enough that the creators and sellers of the CDOs , such as Goldman , BlackRock and TCW , have not been held to account for selling worthless bonds while representing them to be of AAA quality .
Most of these influential power brokers have succeeded in blaming the victim ( investors and insurers who believed their lies about the quality of the bonds ) for the financial crisis to distract from their own questionable activities .
Goldman goes quite a few steps further into despicable territory with their other actions and the body count from Goldman ’s actions is so enormous that it crosses over into criminal territory , morally and legally , by getting taxpayer money for their predation .
Goldman made a huge bet that the housing market would collapse .
They profited , on paper , from the tremendous pain suffered by homeowners , investors and taxpayers across the country , they helped make it worse .
Their bet only succeeded because they were able to force the government into bailing out AIG .
In addition , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury , by helping Goldman Sachs to profit from homeowner and investor losses , conceal their misrepresentations to shareholders , destroy insurers by stuffing them with toxic bonds that they marketed as AAA , and escape from the consequences of making a risky bet , committed a grave injustice and , very likely , financial crimes .
Since the bailout , they have actively concealed their actions and mislead the public .
Goldman , the Fed and the Treasury should be investigated for fraud , securities law violations and misappropriation of taxpayer funds .
Based on what I have laid out here , I am confident that they will find ample evidence .
Update 12/23 , 1:00 PM : Yves here .
Some readers in comments are dismissing this post as mere Goldman bashing , when its behavior was far more pernicious .
I was remiss in not adding a critical bit of Tom ’s argument , which he provided in a separate post :
While the subprime deals and CDOs were obviously going bad , an argument was made by many people at the time that the aggressive mark downs by AIG acelerated the death spiral for the market .
It is pretty clear , here and elsewhere , that Goldman was the one that initiated the mark downs of collateral value .
it would be interesting to explore this all the way through .
Though not discussed in this article , Goldman shorted subprime through the Abacus deals , and perhaps elsewhere .
this gave them an incentive to force mark downs .
the intermediation deals described in the article , combined with AIG ’s collateral posting , gave them another incentive to be agressive with mark downs .
they were acting like they wanted to grab the money before anyone else could get their hands on it .
this would have raised some issues in an AIGFP bankruptcy .
( note – Hank Greenberg suggested that this was going on in his october 2008 testimony but there was a chorus of attacks on him for being a crook and unreliable , thanks to his problems with Spitzer . )
So here we have the pattern :
If your mother - in - law 's mail goes through the Waterbury or Wallingford post offices , she might not have received the birthday card you sent in time .
Apparently managers at the post office have been hiding mail , Ray Arcovio , president of the Waterbury area postal worker ’s union , told the Waterbury Republican - American .
And he wants to sincerely apologize .
Workers have been stuffing mail into closets and unused rooms at mail facilities in Waterbury and Wallingford because they do n’t know how to keep up with such a high volume of mail , he told the newspaper .
" They 're just pushing it aside for the next day , " Arcovio told the paper .
" We 've had issues with them hiding the mail . "
In an effort to cut back on costs , the postal service now transfers mail processing from Waterbury to Wallingford .
Arcovio says the problem is being handled .
" We have dealt with it and got the assurance it would n't happen again , " he told the Republican American .
" The employees who see it and are aware of it are fearful to speak out about it for fear of repercussions . "
In some cases , even first - class letters were pushed aside because there were n't enough workers to handle it .
The USPS offers a different side of the story .
There was one incident , said a spokeswoman .
It was four months ago and the supervisor made a " poor judgment call about how to handle some late arriving mail and moved it out of the work area , " Maureen Marion explained .
Appropriate administrative action was taken , she said .
" To suggest this activity is routine is a falsehood , " she added in a statement .
What 's more , it did n't involve first class mail .

* Vote is 5 - 4 , with the liberal justices dissenting
* Courts did not follow appropriate procedures
* Dissenters said case is of great public interest
WASHINGTON , Jan 13 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that video from the trial over California ’s same - sex marriage ban cannot be broadcast , handing a victory to those defending the ban .
By a 5 - 4 vote , the high court granted an emergency request from attorneys supporting the Proposition 8 ban for a stay of the broadcasting of the trial .
The attorneys said broadcasting the trial would turn it into a “ media circus ” and that witnesses who testify would be intimidated .
The closely watched trial , which could produce a landmark ruling and lead to an overturning of similar bans in other states , began in federal court in San Francisco on Monday before U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker .
Right before the trial began , the Supreme Court decided to delay any broadcast coverage through Wednesday while the justices considered the issue .
Walker had agreed to making video coverage of the trial available on the court ’s website or through YouTube .
Walker acted based on a recent rule change by the U.S. appeals court based in California allowing televised coverage of some civil cases .
In its 17 - page ruling , the five - member court majority said broadcasting the trial should be blocked indefinitely , pending the filing and disposition of any appeal .
The majority said it ruled without expressing any views on whether such trials should be broadcast .
Instead , broadcasting the trial was put on hold “ because it appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting , ” according to the ruling .
Opponents of the ban and a coalition of media organizations argued that video coverage of the trial should be allowed .
They said there is a public benefit to complete access to public trials .
The court ’s four liberals -- Justices John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor -- agreed .
In a 10 - page dissent that his three other colleagues joined , Breyer wrote that the public interest weighed in favor of providing access to the courts and said the case involved an issue of great public interest .

But just for the sake of latecomers , the casual and those who ca n’t be bothered , they are : Kathryn Bigelow for “ The Hurt Locker , ” James Cameron for “ Avatar , ” Lee Daniels for “ Precious , ” Jason Reitman for “ Up in the Air ” and Quentin Tarantino for “ Inglourious Basterds . ”
It would be a fairly big surprise if the Oscar ’s nominees were a whole lot different .
Gregg Kilday at THR points out that Lee Daniels is the first African - American to be nominated ( !!!! ) and Kathryn Bigelow is joining the very small club of women to be nominated for the award .
However , you can be sure that if she was n’t nominated , her absence would have been the story , considering how her film has been received up to now .
The same might have gone for Daniels , though perhaps to a lesser degree as he has more detractors .
My hunch is that Bigelow also enjoys a somewhat better better chance to actually win than did such past female nominees as Lina Wertmuller , Jane Campion , Sofia Copolla , and , yes , Barbara Streisand , though the competition is mighty stiff .
Of course , there ’s always some controversy , so now the question is , why leave out first - timer Tom Ford of “ A Single Man ” ?
And so , the Playlist asks a related question : “ Too Gay or Too Little Money ? ”
Fun fact time :
This is also the first time , I ’m pretty sure , a once - married coupled ( Bigelow and James Cameron ) have been nominated to oppose each other for the directors ’ awards .
Of course , once we succeed with overturning Proposition 8 , that could get more common even if the DGA remains predominantly a boys ’ club .
On a related note : The BAFTAS long list .
A 12 - year - old boy has died after being stabbed during a fight in a schoolyard on Brisbane 's bayside .
Elliott Fletcher was stabbed in the chest at St Patrick 's College at Shorncliffe about 8:00 am AEST .
He was taken to Brisbane 's Royal Children 's Hospital in a serious condition but later died .
Police allege the boy was stabbed with a knife by a 13 - year - old fellow student .
The 13 - year - old was found nearby with minor wounds and is assisting police with their investigation .
It is not clear what sparked the incident .
The school was put in lockdown this morning after the stabbing but the restrictions have now been lifted .
It is the second stabbing involving students at a Catholic boys ' schools in Brisbane in the past 10 days .
But criminologist Professor Paul Wilson says it does not mean there is a trend .
" I do n't think that the fact that it occurred in a Catholic school necessarily points to more problems in Catholic schools at all , " he said .
" But I do think that school , and other schools where there have been serious assaults , have to be analysed very carefully . "
Tributes
Scores of condolence messages have been left on a Facebook page dedicated to the dead boy .
" Devastating .
A dark day for the family and all St Patrick 's College Old Boys ..... RIP brother , " one post said .
Many more messages lamented the loss of such a young boy .
One person wrote : " soooooooooo sad 2 young to die . "
" My thoughts are with his family and friends , " wrote another .
" May you rest in peace .
No child 's life should end this way . "
Increasing violence
The Foundation for Young Australians says there is no doubt violence is increasing amongst the nation 's youth .
Today the foundation addressed a Melbourne hearing of the Federal Government 's long - running inquiry into youth violence .
Its primary recommendation was that funding be increased to school - based programs targeting youth violence .
The foundation 's Sharby Ibrahim says today 's tragedy only highlights the need for classroom - based education about violence .
" I think what 's extremely aggravating is that we 've had so many of these wake - up calls , " he said .
" The fact that another young person has died ... through this kind of behaviour just shouts about the fact that there needs to be action and it needs to be taken drastically .
" It 's been shown that there has been a significant increase not only in the amount of violence but also in the severity of violence .
" That means more knives are involved , there have been more deaths , there are more guns involved and sometimes these attacks are perpetrated by groups of young people . "
A new report on sustainable biofuels points out that the U.S. government spent $ 4 billion in 2008 on subsidies to replace just 2 % of the U.S. gasoline supply .
The average cost to taxpayers for the substituted barrels of gasoline was roughly $ 82 per barrel , or $ 1.95 per gallon on top of the gasoline retail price .
The use of corn - based ethanol , the report suggests , will not only be difficult and expensive to reach congressionally mandated levels for renewable fuels , but the production itself comes with a slew of negative consequences for humans and the environment .
From the report :
The addition of ethanol to gasoline poses a great risk for human exposure to toxic constituents present in underground storage tank leaks .
Increases in corn-based ethanol production in the U.S. Midwest could cause an increase in detrimental environmental impacts , including exacerbating damage to ecosystems and fisheries along the Mississippi River and in the Gulf of Mexico and creating water shortages in some areas .
Any clearing of forests and grasslands to grow biofuels will add to the release of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) into the atmosphere .
...
It is uncertain whether existing biofuels production provides any beneficial improvement over traditional gasoline , after taking into account land use changes and emissions of nitrous oxide .
Legislation giving biofuels preferences on the basis of greenhouse gas benefits
should be avoided .
When I first started listening to the calls for Mentoring for free , I like many did not know what to expect or what I really would get out of it if anything .
To say I had trepidation as to the thoughts of how much is this going to set me back in money once again is an understatement .
I like many of you have been on the merry go round when it comes to MLM programs .
In fact not being someone with any real knowledge as to how or what makes a good MLM program had me on the fence as to if I truly wanted to start again with something new .
In saying all that I thank god that I did with mentoring for free it was the first time I and my wife met people and read about MLM programs that did not sugar coat the truth with a bunch of flash and promises .
Once I started learning what others have learned I had to ask myself why over all these years did I wait so long to find people that were truly succeeding in their home business .
The fact is when listening to the calls and speaking with our personal mentor I find that the biggest part about mentoring for free is not the idea of selling someone something but having good team members and a very good product that sells itself .
I can say honestly that I can truly see a huge change in my thoughts and attitudes towards the world since I started the mentoring for free calls there is a hole world of people out their who want nothing more than to help .
Mentoring for free has done more for my mental state as a new home business maker than years of going on my own .
When I say new home business maker it ’s exactly what I mean .
Yes I have tried a home business before .
However I have had little to no success .
So I can not count on those times as truly starting a business that would one day take care of my family .
They were half hearted attempts on a dream that I had no guidance to make even remotely possible .
However with mentoring for free I have not only received so much guidance to help me succeed I have also gained the confidence that I can and will succeed with no thought that I can not .
The mentoring forhome business is something that has such positive out comes in so many peoples lives that I can not say enough as to how I never want to miss what ’s coming next .
None of us can say what the future holds however we can work hard and plan for a good one .
With mentoring for free that ’s exactly what they are doing for every one they are teaching us to plan our lives in a positive direction that brings positive factual results that are solid foundations that last a life time .
I and my wife can not thank our mentoring home business enough or the man himself who brought such clarity in to our live Michel Dloughy .
The idea that learning and thinking as to a future is first and foremost to except ones self as a winner is ground breaking .
Each morning I wake up with what is known as self talk it gets me started out right on a good note as to what I intend to accomplish during that day and how I can further my desires to make the future I want become a reality !
Each one of us has a desire and a purpose as to what we truly want out of life and mentoring for free is the stepping stones to getting there .
Since the very first call till now my spirit has been lifted up to a place of knowledge about myself and how to make myself better understand those around me .
Our Mentor said in great words that should be on the lips of all who would start a home business .
Mentoring is teaching people to avoid mistakes and to be in control of self .
What that means is never ever try and sell someone an idea however let the idea sell itself by being worth the thought .
Many times I had to step back as I have listened to the mentoring for free calls and say Aha so that ’s where I moved off the path of positive thinking .
One of the biggest lessons we learn in mentoring for free is that positive thinking can only bring positive out comes not just in business but in all aspects of life .
With mentoring for free I have over come the fear and the negative worries and replaced them with a can do positive thought as to my life and home business .
The saying the sky ’s the limit does not apply there are no limits to the power mentoring for free can take you to .

Can the world be made safe for the return of securitizations ?
That is a question of great importance to those like John C. Dugan , the comptroller of the currency , who say they believe that the banking system on its own is unlikely to have the ability to provide enough credit to sustain an economic recovery in the United States .
“ We need a vibrant , credible securitization market to help fund the real economy going forward , ” Mr. Dugan said this week .
He was preaching to the choir  a meeting of the American Securitization Forum  but it is an opinion widely held in financial markets .
It is possible to question that thesis .
Securitization grew as a way for banks to get around capital rules , not because of any profound desire by investors for such assets or any real unwillingness by banks to make the loans .
But since it was more expensive to hold capital against the risk if the loans were not securitized , they were securitized .
That also opened the market to new players , who neither wanted to , nor could amass , the capital to hold onto loans .
Together , those developments undoubtedly made mortgage loans less expensive for borrowers .
That was welcome to politicians and to regulators , who wrongly thought that securitization had moved a lot of risk outside the banking system .
The title started as a joke , but it has become a reminder .
A reminder not that people hate me , but that even if they did , it should n’t affect me .
It reminds me to always be aware of my ego , to keep it in check .
It reminds me to be critical .
It reminds me why I ’m different .
If you do n’t understand the title , you probably do n’t yet understand me .
OpenID on App Engine made easy with AEoid
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , coding , app- engine , tech
I 'm pleased to present AEoid , a new App Engine library that aims to make user authentication with OpenID on App Engine simple .
AEoid is extremely easy to install , comprising a single piece of WSGI middleware , and its interface mirrors that of the App Engine Users API .
Here 's an example of it in action :
from aeoid import users class TestData ( db. Model ) : user = users .
UserProperty ( ) class TestHandler ( webapp.RequestHandler ) : def get ( self ) : user = users.get_current_user ( ) if not user : self.redirect(users.create_login_url(self.request.url ) ) return logging .
warn ( " Logged in as %s ( %s ) " , user.nickname ( ) , user.user_id ( ) ) data = TestData( user=user ) data.put ( )
As you can see , the interface to AEoid is almost exactly identical to the App Engine Users API .
There a few differences of note :
Users are identified uniquely by their OpenID endpoint .
You can't construct a User object without specifying an OpenID URL .
Nicknames and email addresses are user - supplied , so they 're not guaranteed unique or validated .
is_current_user_admin( ) is not yet implemented .
login : clauses in app.yaml are not affected by AEoid - they still authenticate using the regular Users API .
Installation
Installing AEoid is a simple matter of adding its WSGI middleware to your app .
Here 's an example for webapp :
application = webapp .
WSGIApplication ([ # ... ] , debug= True ) application = middleware .
AeoidMiddleware( application )
For more installation details , see the readme .
AEoid takes the " convention over configuration " approach , so there are no mandatory configuration arguments - simply add the middleware and you 're set .
If you wish , though , you can customize it extensively : Currently , you can change the way sessions are handled , and in future you 'll be able to customize the layout of the login page , the OpenID extensions you want to use , and other parameters .
How it works
The code behind AEoid is fairly straightforward , consisting mostly of glue code to make the python - openid and beaker sessions libraries work together nicely .
Its workings are broken up into several components :
Request handlers that provide the login page , handle login requests , and log users out .
These contain the bulk of the OpenID machinery .
When a user submits their OpenID URL , a login handler creates an OpenID request and redirects them to their provider .
Once login is complete , the provider redirects them back to AEoid 's completion handler , which creates the user session and redirects them back to the app .
The public interface , in the form of a clone of the App Engine Users module .
User objects consist of wrappers around a datastore entity that holds a user 's information , and the various methods operate on this object .
A UserProperty is also provided , which stores the key to the internal User object , while providing an interface identical to that provided by the datastore 's native UserProperty .
Middleware code to make it all work .
This takes care of wrapping your app in Beaker 's session middleware , then , for each request , extracting the current user information for use by the Users API .
Right now , AEoid is in what I consider to be an ' early look ' state .
It 's fully functional , but it 's only lightly tested so far , and there 's a lot of room for improvement - which will definitely be forthcoming .
To see what 's in the pipeline , check out the issue tracker .
If you decide to use AEoid , please leave feedback , as well as filing feature requests and bug reports in the issue tracker !
In particular , if you use a framework other than webapp , please do try out AEoid with it , and let me know how it goes , so we can build up a compatibility list for the library .
If you 're really enthusiastic , do n't hesitate to fork the library and contribute your own patches !

By now we ’ve discussed the fact that you should first plug your funnel , then improve conversion rates , then work on sending as much traffic as possible to your website .
But we have n’t talked about how big of a role traffic quality plays in determining your conversion rate .
Traffic Quality
By “ quality ” I mean the following : how close each visitor is to your ideal customer , and how much of a relationship you have with that visitor .
High quality traffic means each visitor is very close to your ideal customer and they know and trust you .
By the way , this is why TechCrunch traffic is not profitable for startups .
It ’s completely un-targeted ( unless your niche market is other startups ) and you have no relationship with that audience .
Using our definition above , this traffic is of very low quality .
This becomes apparent the first time you send an email to a list that you ’ve been communicating with for some length of time .
Your conversion rate for these leads will be astronomically higher than your standard website traffic , as much as 10 x higher and in the worst case 2 - 3 x higher .
This is because the quality is so much better .
I regularly see a 200 % differences in Academy sign - up conversions based on the source ( and thereby the quality ) of the traffic .
The reason this is important is because you have to understand where to focus your energy when driving traffic .
If people from your email list will convert at 5 - 10 x the rate of someone finding your site through Google , you can spend 5 - 10 x the effort getting people on your mailing list and still have a break - even ROI .
Likewise , if you see the massive amount of traffic coming from SEO you have to know how many of those people are buying your product .
Without that knowledge you are flying blind and cannot properly allocate your efforts .
Luckily , Google Analytics can spell this out for you using goals .
For more info on setting up goals check out this link .
You will not regret doing this .
You will instantly be able to see that some sources of traffic do not convert at all .
And you can stop pursuing that traffic and focus your efforts on methods that convert .
As an example , Bidsketch is a product launched by a Micropreneur Academy member .
A few weeks ago I was writing up a detailed case study of its launch ( published inside the Academy ) .
As I was looking at traffic stats I noticed a huge increase in mid-November due to a number of write - ups on startup and web - 2.0 blogs .
But the number of conversions stayed about the same as it had been the week before , meaning the conversion rate ( the number of sales per visitor ) plummeted .
Is this bad ?
No , as long as you know why this is happening .
And the reason , of course , is traffic quality .
Removing the Junk
In fact , my next step was to look at all visitors that stayed longer than 5 seconds , and that removed 67 % of the traffic .
In other words , two - thirds of the traffic from the startup and web - 2.0 blogs stayed less than five seconds on the site .
It was obvious they were there for a quick peek .
Including them in any kind of conversion rate calculation would be a mistake .
And thinking you had a major win by being listed on these blogs would also be a mistake .
Sure , it ’s nice to have several thousand people see your website , but if they do n’t convert they may as well have not shown up at all .
And do n’t think you ’re building a brand – you ’re not Coca - Cola .
The minute those users leave your site you are out of their mind forever .
General Rules
It ’s impossible to say unequivocally which traffic is better for every website , but having launched or revamped over 20 revenue - generating websites I ’ve noticed a definite pattern in traffic quality based on the source .
Here is my list , in order of quality :
Mailing list ( assuming you have a relationship )
Your blog ( assuming you have a relationship )
A referral link from a targeted website with a positive write - up about your product Direct traffic ( this typically means someone heard about your product on a podcast , read about it in print or in an online article with no link , or the person is a repeat visitor that remembers your URL )
An organic search on your product name A referral link with no write - up or from a non-targeted website ( such as TechCrunch )
All other organic searches ( assuming this is their first visit ) Google AdWords Banner and other advertising
I can point to exceptions to the order of the items above , but in general the trending follows this list .
The Moral
Blog to build your RSS and email subscriber base for the highest quality traffic .
Participate in blog and podcast interviews for the # 3 and # 4 spots .
You should always perform on - page SEO since it ’s a simple step to take , but only move down the list above if you have exhausted the first several traffic levels ( and you will not do this until you ’ve achieved a decent level of success ) .
Focus your time on high quality traffic and your high quality traffic will focus its time on you .

JPMorgan Chase books $ 3.3 billion profit
While some of its peers spent part of 2009 in the red , JPMorgan Chase managed to stay profitable .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- JPMorgan
Chase showed it was close to making a full recovery from last year 's crisis after the company reported better - than - expected quarterly profits of $ 3.3 billion Friday .
The New York City - based banking giant also revealed that compensation expenses climbed 18 % during the year to $ 26.9 billion , much of which is expected to doled out in the form of bonuses .
Kicking off the fourth quarter earnings season for the nation 's top banks , the company said it turned a tidy profit during the final three months of 2009 , earning 74 cents on a per share basis .
That was much better than Wall Street was anticipating .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report a profit of $ 2.46 billion for the quarter , or 61 cents a share .
Shares of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) fell more than 1 % in midday trading though as revenue numbers fell short of expectations .
" Though these results showed improvement , we acknowledge that they fell short of both an adequate return on capital and the firm 's earnings potential , " JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement .
Still , 2009 proved to be a stellar year for the bank , as profits more than doubled to $ 11.73 billion , besting consensus estimates .
One of the biggest drivers of its results in the quarter was the company 's investment banking business , which earned $ 1.9 billion , largely helped by robust debt and stock underwriting fees .
" Earnings in the investment bank were better than we were expecting , " Collins Stewart analyst William Tanona wrote in a note to clients Friday .
Executives at the company however , were reluctant to declare that the worst was behind them .
Mike Cavanagh , JPMorgan
Chase 's chief financial officer , noted that there were still areas of weakness within the company 's mortgage portfolio .
He also reiterated previous forecasts that its credit card division would likely lose $ 1 billion a quarter during the first half of 2010 .
" We need to wait and see how the economy evolves , " he said .
It was clear though that JPMorgan was taking no chances , especially with millions of Americans still out of work .
During the quarter , the bank said it added an additional $ 1.9 billion to its consumer loan loss reserve .
Dimon said that the lack of clarity about the direction of the economy was also playing a big part in keeping the bank from boosting its dividend back to pre-crisis levels .
JPMorgan slashed its dividend last year by 87 % and currently pays one of just 5 cents a quarter .
JPMorgan Chase is the first of several big banks and Wall Street firms to report its fourth - quarter results .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) are all slated to release their fourth - quarter and full year numbers next week .
JPMorgan
Chase is widely believed to be among the strongest banks in this group though , and its healthy profits could lead to more criticism of the financial services industry .
On Thursday , the industry faced one of its harshest attacks yet after the White House proposed a new tax Thursday on big banks that it said helped to contribute to the financial crisis .
Dimon said Friday that he was not opposed to the concept given the financial services industry 's role in the current economic mess .
But he quickly rejected the notion that banks such as his should be held responsible for the problems in other industries such as the automotive business .
" I do n't understand why we should have to pay for that , " he said .
There is also the ongoing backlash among politicians and taxpayers about the size of bonuses doled out by financial firms that benefited from government bailouts .
JPMorgan , which accepted $ 25 billion in taxpayer aid last fall , revealed Friday that more than a third of its compensation expenses went towards its Wall Street employees .
The company said it spent $ 9.33 billion to compensate workers in its investment banking division , an increase of $ 1.6 billion from a year ago .
That figure includes salaries as well as money set aside for bonuses .
Divided among the nearly 25,000 individuals in this business , the average annual compensation per employee was nearly $ 380,000 .
Gay rights activists say they have been living in fear since the bill was tabled Uganda 's controversial Anti-Homosexuality Bill is likely to be changed , a minister has told the BBC .
However , Deputy Foreign Minister Henry Okello
Oryem did not give details of how he thought the final bill would be different to the current proposals .
Uganda has come under intense international pressure over the bill , which provides for the death penalty for some homosexual acts .
Mr Oryem was speaking after US leader Barack Obama called the bill " odious " .
It has also been condemned by various European countries .
ANTI - HOMOSEXUALITY BILL Death penalty For " serial offenders " , HIV - positive " offenders " , or those engaging in homosexual activity with a minor or disabled person Life in prison
For homosexual acts Seven years in prison
For helping , counselling , or encouraging a person to engage in a homosexual act
Fear over gay death - penalty plans " I am sure the bill will take a different form when it is tabled on the floor in parliament , " Mr Oryem told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
However , he also pointed out that it was a Private Member 's Bill and so the government did not have the powers to alter it at this stage .
" Homosexuality is not a top priority for the people of Uganda , " he deputy minister said .
" Our priority is to make sure there is food on the table of our people - that we deal with the issue of disease . "
Homosexual acts are already illegal in Uganda and punishable by up to 14 years in prison .
The bill would raise that penalty to life in prison .
It also proposes the death penalty for a new offence of " aggravated homosexuality " - defined as when one of the participants is a minor , HIV - positive , disabled or a " serial offender " .
Uganda 's President Yoweri Museveni has already distanced himself from the bill , saying it did not represent the views of his government .
Two weeks ago its sponsor , David Bahati , told a Ugandan newspaper he was willing to " amend some clauses " .
The cabinet has set up a committee to look at his proposals .

Why is an intellectual property treaty being negotiated in the name of the US public kept quiet as a matter of national security and treated as " some shameful secret " ?
Solid information on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) has been hard to come by , but Google on Monday hosted a panel discussion on ACTA at its DC offices .
Much of the discussion focused on transparency , and why there 's so little of it on ACTA , even from an administration that has made transparency one of its key goals .
The reason for that was obvious : there 's little of substance that 's known about the treaty , and those lawyers in the room and on the panel who had seen one small part of it were under a nondisclosure agreement .
In most contexts , the lack of any hard information might lead to a discussion of mindnumbing generality and irrelevance , but this transparency talk was quite fascinating — in large part because one of the most influential copyright lobbyists in Washington was on the panel attempting to make his case .
Steven Metalitz represents clients like the MPAA and RIAA , and he 's quite good at what he does .
If there 's a copyright - related issue being discussed in DC , he has a hand in it .
Over the last year , he has used his position to argue that consumers should have no ability to strip DRM from music or video tracks even if an online store takes down its authentication servers .
He has also argued against the Obama administration 's stance at the World Intellectual Property Organization , where he opposes a treaty on copyright exemptions for the blind .
The reason : international copyright laws should only force copyright protections and enforcement on signers , but exemptions to copyright must never be anything more than " permitted . "
Metalitz took on three other panelists and a moderator , all of whom were less than sympathetic to his positions , and he made the lengthiest case for both ACTA and its secrecy that we have ever heard .
It was also surprisingly unconvincing .
Parsing the unknown
ACTA is currently being hashed out by 40 countries apart from any existing international process such as WIPO or the WTO .
No government will show draft texts of the treaty , though the public looks likely to be offered a draft once negotiations are complete ( when it 's too late to make substantive changes ) .
Far from covering " counterfeiting , " ACTA covers a host of issues that include Internet infringement of copyrighted works .
That 's key , said Metalitz , because one in ten US jobs depends on copyright protection .
A legislative aide for Rep. Zoe Lofgren ( D - CA ) retorted that the same stats show just how many companies rely on fair use , copyright exceptions , DMCA safe harbors , and Communications Decency Act safe harbors .
ACTA " ca n't just be about going to the max for enforcement , " he said .
But because it's hard to argue specifics when it comes to ACTA , the talk turned to the question of why we can't see the text .
Jamie Love of Knowledge Ecology International , a group which has obtained many of the leaked documents about ACTA , noted that all 40 countries involved could see the text , " every lobbyist in K Street who has the phone number of USTR can get access to what 's available in the proposal , any one of the thousand members of the [ USTR ] advisory boards that are cleared advisors has the right to ask for access to these documents , " but voters do not .
If the whole future of our economy depends on protecting the creative industries , why is an intellectual treaty being done " as some shameful secret ? "
Metalitz said that ACTA so far has been more transparent than numerous other trade agreements , but Love pointed out that the major international agreements on these issues ( TRIPS and the WIPO treaties ) have been far more open .
And , under pressure to open up , WIPO and the WTO have both allowed nonprofit civil society groups access to debates and negotiations over the last decade — and , suddenly , the agreements coming out of those bodies became more pro-consumer .
WIPO also regularly posts drafts , working papers , and proposals online .
Past free trade agreements have been handled in a similar fashion .
" Steve 's embarrassed by the content of the negotiation or he would be more supportive of transparency , " said Love , not one to hold back in his rhetoric .
Keeping negotiations secret is how " you get big fees to be a lobbyist , " since only the " insiders " have access to the process .
Frank discussions
Metalitz never provided a cogent case for why it might be acceptable to negotiate such an agreement in secret when so much of the public clearly wants to be involved .
When pressed most directly on the issue , he punted , criticizing those who oppose protecting intellectual property .
But he also made the fair point that he 's not the one doing the negotiating .
The US Trade Representative , which handles ACTA , is ultimately responsible .
Though it has repeatedly pledged transparency , none has been forthcoming .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist , going back through the few documents that we do have , believes that the US is one of the primary obstacles to such transparency .
Even the MPAA , one of Metalitz 's top clients , has publicly called for transparency on ACTA to remove the " distraction " that the issue has become .
Such transparency would require the assent of all the governments involved in the negotiations .
As the head of USTR has indicated , the ACTA talks might break down completely without secrecy , and it 's clear that many governments do n't actually want their own people to see the proposals being made and to shape their outcome .
This is n't surprising , of course , since international groups like WIPO and WTO already exist to tackle these kinds of issues .
But those groups would be more open than the ACTA process , and they would force countries like US , Canada , Japan , and the EU to involve more countries .
Much easier to form a " coalition of the willing " instead .
The USTR has claimed that it needs the privacy to have a " frank exchange of views , " though WIPO has managed to work on major international IP legislation without such total secrecy .
No one argues that every moment of the negotiating sessions needs to go on YouTube , or that there is never a place for an off - the - record exchange of views ; but members of Congress like Mike Doyle ( D - PA ) , Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) , Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) , and Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) have all blasted USTR in recent weeks for not taking basic steps , such as offering drafts to the public .
Several of the panelists agreed that this might well be because the public would n't support what 's being done in its name , but all of them , including Metalitz , believe that the transparency issue will eventually put real pressure on the USTR to open up further .
When that might happen , however , remains a mystery .
Last weekend ( Friday and Saturday ) , I attended RubyNation 2008 , the first regional Ruby conference in my area .
The speakers were excellent and it was great to meet up with folks from the Ruby community who I have n’t seen in awhile .
As always , I left feeling energized and excited about my Ruby projects .
There were two main themes of the conference : the ‘ official ’ one was Ceremony vs. Essence , while the ‘ unofficial ’ one was Test all the fucking time .
The first theme was the subject of the opening and closing keynotes .
The second came from Bryan Liles lighting talk on the first day and kept coming up afterwards ( audience ‘ hecklers ’ would ask presenters how often they should test ) .

Neal Ford ’s talk on Ceremony vs Essence was one of the best talks of the conference and a great way to kick it off .
He criticized our industry for failing to look backwards and leveraging the lore of the past .
Then he proceeded to look even further back discussing Plato ’s doctrine of ideas , Aristotle ’s essential properties vs accidental properties , Galileo ’s use of experimentation to verify ideas , and William Occam ’s principle that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible ( KISS ) .
Do n’t confuse essential complexity ( we have a hard problem to solve ) vs accidental complexity ( we ’ve made the problem hard to solve ) .
Some of the new patterns he presented were :
Chicken Cognition : no memory , ca n’t learn from your mistakes
Frozen Caveman : burned by something and was flash frozen at that point in time , everything revolves around that issue
Rubik ’s Cubicle : love to solve puzzles , not real issues
During his keynote , Neal suggested learning from the lore of our past by reading classics like The Mythical Man-Month : Essays on Software Engineering , Anniversary Edition ( 2nd Edition ) , Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns , The Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master .
Next up was Russ Olsen who gave a talk about DSLs , both external and internal .
Domain specific languages continue to be a hot topic in Ruby and the developer community in general .
Ruby is very well suited to both external DSLs ( involving a parser ) and internal DSLs ( use the Ruby parser and build language infrastructure ) .
Ruby is great for DSLs because it does n’t require parenthesis or semi-colons , it supports procs , the reflection capabilities ( method_missing , instance_eval , etc ) , etc. Rich Kilmer called DSL building , syntax driven development .
Glenn Vanderburg presented on the culture of innovation within the Ruby community .
The Ruby community is seeing so much innovation because Rubyists are novelty junkies , the languages opens possibilities that deserve to be explored , the requirement to integrate with IDEs is hampering innovation in Java ( Java developers wo n’t use it until it ’s integrated within their IDE ) , and things are just easier to accomplish in Ruby ( low ceremony ) .
He said that sometimes its good to start over as being forced to reinvent can be an opportunity .
To close out his talk he did have a warning :
When learning new things costs are easier to spot than benefits , but when inventing new things benefits are easier to spot than costs .
Yehuda Katz from Engine Yard spoke about living on the edge .
As an aside , it appears that Engine Yard is trying to be a mini-Google in that they appear to have hired many of the top Rubyists as well as some very savvy operations folks .
Yehuda said that we should expect Merb 1.0 by the end of summer , introduced the DataMapper ORM , YARD ( a replacement for rdoc ) , and Johnson ( a JavaScript / Ruby bridge ) .
He urged those present to take the time to think things through and not rush an API ( or software ) out .
During the Lightning Talks we heard from Chris Bucchere about BDG ’s social network for conferences ; David James of Community Goals about state machines , Simon Kaczar of Prognosoft about libncurses - ruby , and Bryan Liles about testing ( where the meme test all the fucking time appeared ) .
Bryan ’s was one of the best talks of the conference , I highly recommend seeing him present .
The first day closed with Giles Bowkett ’s presentation on Archaeopteryx ( a Ruby MIDI generator ) .
The music it generated ( through Reason ) was pretty good .
The software makes heavy use of lambda functions and so Giles has aliased lambda to L to reduce typing .
His talk covered a wide range of topics and there ’s no way I can do it justice .
Hopefully he ’ll have it recorded ( since he ’s given the presentation a few times now ) and post it on the ‘ net .
The second day opened with Rich Kilmer of InfoEther who provided a look back at the early days of Ruby ( from his involvement in 2001 ) , the conferences , and all of the various projects he ’s worked on with Ruby .
Rich always has fun stories to tell and I enjoyed his talk immensely .
I wo n’t go through the entire chronology , but he ended by stating that the community needs to develop tools to deal with the dynamic nature of Ruby in order for wider adoption of the language , though he did note that Ruby is becoming mainstream .
He also announced HotCocoa , a DSL for Cocoa application development .
Mike Furr spoke about issues he encountered when writing a Ruby parser for his DRuby project .
These were somewhat interesting traps , pitfals , and corner cases for where the language is ambiguous .
His slides are available here so you can see specific code examples .
David Keener walked through installing , configuring and running JRuby .
Unfortunately , I have no interest in JRuby .
I started working with it at my previous job to add Ruby scripting to a Java application , but since I no longer program in Java nor have an operational environment that is setup to deploy Java , I just do n’t care .
Tools for your Ruby toolbox by David Bock was an interesting tour of three Ruby projects : StaticMatic , Sinatra , and GServer .
StaticMatic looked interested for static website development , but then Mike Clark wrote about Webby and it looks even better .
Sinatra appears to be a very light weight alternative to Rails and in combination with a static web site tool like StaticMatic or Webby could be extremely useful .
GServer is a generic server which takes some of the pain out of setting them up .
Dave ’s an engaging speaker and I always enjoy his presentations as well as speaking with him in the hallways at conferences .
The second day of Lightning Talks was even better than the first .
Soren Burkhard from Hawaii Business Consulting had a great overview of starting your own business .
Glenn
West spoke about several Rails plugins that he uses on a regular basis : ActiveScaffold , Role Requirement , ActiveAuthentication , File_column , PDFtoRuby , DotR , and Tabnav .
Jesse Shock from Engine Yard spoke about high availability planning : multiple sites , geographic diversity , data partitioning , sharding , etc .
He said you need to establish costs up front so the customer knows which availability techniques they can afford .
Yehuda Katz , also from Engine Yard , spoke about testing ( in the context of Merb ) and how you should use BDD for internal as well as external interfaces .
The last of the lightning talks was by Bryan Liles on how to be a manager , his slides are available here .
Finally , Stu closed out the conference with a talk on bad Ruby .
Overall , Ruby is good but that there are some bad practices / decisions that could come back to bite us later as Ruby adoption grows .
Some of the examples he provided were : constants ( you ca n’t change them so testing becomes difficult ) , class attributes ( prefer instance attributes on the eigenclass ) , direct access of instance variables , and proc workarounds ( e.g. passing more than one block to a method ) .
The code examples from his talk are available here .
Luis de la Rosa was kind enough keep track of all of the URLs that folks were throwing around and has posted them here : – delicious : http://delicious.com/tag/rubynation – magnolia : http://ma.gnolia.com/tags/rubynation
Overall , it was a great conference and I look forward to next year ’s RubyNation in June 2009 .
