Can Americans be murdered by the Israeli government with impunity ?
For several days , Israel has been able to contain some of the fallout from the flotilla massacre by withholding information about the dead and injured .
The object of this exercise has clearly been to slow the flow of information in the hope that by the time the most damning facts become known , the international media ’s attention will have turned elsewhere .
But the dead now have names and faces and one turns out to be a nineteen - year - old American : Furkan Dogan .
Dogan is alleged to have been shot with five bullets , four in the head .
Does the Obama administration intend to investigate the circumstances in which one of its citizens was killed ?
Protecting the lives of Americans is after all the most fundamental responsibility of our government .
Dogan ’s death was presumably instant , but according to Al Jazeera ’s Jamal Elshayyal there were others on board the Mavi Marmara who died because Israeli soldiers refused to treat their injuries .
“ After the shooting and the first deaths , people put up white flags and signs in English and Hebrew .
An Isreali [ on the ship ] asked the soldiers to take away the injured , but they did not and the injured died on the ship . ”
Crimes have been committed and since the suspects all acted under the direction of the Israeli government and its defense forces and took place on international waters outside Israel ’s area of legal jurisdiction , “ a prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards ” — a demand made by the UN Security Council with the support of the Obama administration — cannot be conducted by the Israeli government or a commission appointed by them .
An investigation conforming to international standards must also be an international inquiry .
It can be common for some attorneys to blindly help their clients without accepting any of their input .
Attorney Michael Cougar 's strategy is the opposite .
His goal is to work collaboratively with his clients so that they can make strategic legal decisions .
He takes this approach because he understands that you know your situation better than anyone .
It 's important that your estate planning attorney acknowledges that , while they may know the law better than the client , the client should always have the final say in how their case is handled .
Michael 's role in planning your estate is to ensure you 're fully aware of your options and to lay them out so you can make an informed decision .
Whether you want to create a will or need to assign a guardian for your children in the event that you pass , Michael has the tools and experience to make sure you and your family are taken care of .
His clients throughout Medford and Grants Pass , Oregon , have benefited from this collaborative approach .
Any relief payment plan established in the wake of the worst environmental accident ever was bound to have its flaws , but this goes to a whole new level of wrong .
According to Gulf resident Kindra Arnesen , who turned whistleblower and full - time activist when she saw how many people were put out of work by the spill , BP will deduct money from individual payments on claims for lost income if the claimant refuses to work in assisting the spill response .

Reading from a letter she ’d received from BP , Arnesen quoted the company ’s line :
“ BP will continue its efforts to pay legitimate claims for losses incurred due to the Deepwater Horizon incident .
However , federal law clearly provides for adjustments for all income resulting from the incident , all income from alternative employment or businesses undertaken [… ] and potential income from alternative employment or businesses not undertaken but reasonably available . ”
In other words , if you are a fisherman who was put out of work by BP and you do not elect to work in their employ , but you still file a claim for losses over the Deepwater Horizon disaster , that claim could be significantly less than the actual damages incurred .
Arnesen , a fisherman ’s wife and longtime Louisiana resident , has been a true pitbull of an activist since she began popping up in area media .
Finally , at the beginning of June , she gained enough notoriety that CNN picked up her story .
She was one of the first to raise hell over reports of fishermen getting sick , allegedly from the oil and dispersant fumes coming off the Gulf .
Her husband David is one of thousands who opted to work for BP after the oil contaminated his usual fishing routes .
She believes he was one of many who were sickened by BP ’s toxic vapors .

BP CEO Tony Hayward tried to pass off the multiple boats full of sick fishermen as “ food poisoning . ”
The company has since discouraged use of respirators because they do n’t want the task to appear dangerous .
However , RFK Center President Kerry Kennedy traveled to the Gulf Coast to talk to cleanup workers and found that BP ’s active denial of proper safety equipment was having a serious health effect .
“ In all three states that I ’ve visited , fishermen said when they went out to work on the cleanup , that if they tried to bring respirators they were told it was unnecessary equipment and would only spread hysteria , ” Kennedy told Fox News .
“ When I went out with eleven people , we had respirators on and within half an hour , all of our eyes were burning and our throats were closing and we all had headaches , ” she explained .

That got Kindra mad as hell .
In an amazing display of gusto , even with the possibility that she ’d endanger his income by damaging their relationship with BP , Arnesen showed up absolutely livid to a citizens emergency summit on June 19 .
Her speech quickly gained traction in progressive media after she claimed BP ’s directors were eager to cut costs and merely put on a show every time a politician swings through , ushering cleanup crews out almost as fast as they ’re ushered in .
Visibly disturbed by BP ’s concise statement on relief payments , Arnesen jeered : “ They summed it up in one paragraph : billions upon billions for coastal communities .
One paragraph .
One paragraph ?
This is what they think ?
That we ’re gonna clean up their toxic shit ?
For the same price that we ’re gonna pick up shrimp ?
Are they loony ?
Have they lost their minds ? ”

“ Am I scared ?
Yes , ” Arnesen told CNN .
“ Anything that ever starts , starts with one .
And if I have to be the one then I have to be the one . ”
The team that filmed her , Project Gulf Impact , also recently landed an interview with Dr. Chris Pincetich , a marine biologist , who claimed that the U.S. Coast Guard is involved in spraying Corexit oil dispersant and that the substance has made it ashore .

Astral Energy 1Posts : 13 Ego shattered from ketamine .
Has anyone else experienced this ?

A near death experience induced by Ketamine
" A place to live unharmed by death
Does not exist
Not in space , not in the sea
Nor if you stay in the midst of mountains . "
-- Buddha
Buddha says that a healthy contemplation of death throughout your lifetime helps to counteract the misguided notion that life is permanent .
Yet ironically we who live in the West are rarely privy to the one phenomenon that we will certainly come to us all .
Nothing in life is certain , except that on day life as we know it will be no longer .
Death is hidden away , swept under the carpet , kept behind closed doors .
And the reasons for this are as numerous as they are varied , death is private , it is sad , it forces us to confront our mortality , to take a long hard look at our life and to decide whether or not we are satisfied that we have put our time on earth to good use .
Did I make a difference ?
Has my life amounted to something ?
Did I learn whatever it is I was put on earth to learn ?
These are all questions that resonate amongst all of us as members of the human race , regardless of our culture , our nationality or our religion .
But if death is hidden away from us , and if the culture we are brought up in eschews the idea of contemplating death ; considers it to be morbid and unnatural .
Then how are we ever to understand what death is ?
What does it feel like to die ?
Two years ago I experienced death , and the experience was so enormous , so profound , that the memory I have of it has been seared into my inner most being and will remain with me until the day I experience it again in earnest .
For me death was the most incredible , breathtaking , terrifying , eye - opening and deeply , deeply spiritual experience I have ever had .
It quite literally brought me to my knees , it unleashed an inhuman scream , a scream that rippled across the universe .
It was the scream of a being experiencing his true nature for the first time .
My near death experience occurred two years ago , and although I have only just now plucked up the motivation to write about it , not one day has gone by when I havent thought of it and revisited the place I was transported to .
The realm of the eternal .
Thedivine source .
I was 27 when I decided to take ketamine for the third or fourth time .
I had experimented with several recreational drugs over the past decade , but had never really experienced the dissociative effects high doses of ketamine can induce .
And although I had used lower doses of ketamine before , this experience was only the second time that I had entered a k - hole  that endlessly looping and almost robotic cartoon - i- verse which seems to lie just behind the curtain of reality .
And even now , some two years later , trying to put this utterly ineffable experience into words stretches the English language to its limits .
The experience took me to soaring highs , producing feelings of bliss and ecstatic love for the world and the people in it , but simultaneously it also took me to a place of unadulterated horror , where the darkness and the sheer dread and hopelessness forced me to see that the state we refer to as hell  does exist ... and for a moment I was given a glimpse into all that is evil and wrong with mankind  like a horrid divine experiment that had gone terribly wrong and had begun rotting and eating away at itself .
The culmination of this ketamine experience resulted in me being carried out of a nightclub kicking and screaming , convinced that I had just experienced my own death .
A death as breathtakingly beautiful and perfect as it was terrifying and life changing .
I am not sure what part of me died that night , but one thing is clear , when I woke up the next morning back in the reality I had always known , I was an immensely different and a fundamentally more spiritual and altruistic person
Entering into what I can only refer to as the world of k was to me like entering into another dimension or reality which exists behind the scenes of the reality in which we all play out our lives .
It s like seeing the great wheels and cogs that comprise the machinery of the universe endlessly revolving in upon themselves - as they have done for aeons .
One has the strange sense that time and space do not exist , and as such , one begins to truly begin to understand the concept of eternity  , a strange and unsettling feeling which courses through your inner most self ... like the slow recollection of an old truth you have always known , and at the same time , always managed to forget , time and time again .
In this particular case the fall into the k hole was both sharp and almost immediate .
A sense of foreboding overcame me , as if I had taken a bite of the forbidden apple and consequently forever condemned myself to the dark , robotic and surreal k - dimension .
I recall thinking ,  Why did you take the k , now you have enslaved yourself into the k - dimension , you have infected yourself with the drug , and now whilst you may continue to live your everyday existence and reality , you will forever be bound to this darker side of reality and subject to being thrown back into the world of k at any given moment .
The world of k is horrifically real as an experience  in some ways even more real than reality , its as if ketamine acts as some sort of chemical key which allows your cerebral cortex to unlock the part of your brain capable of accessing this dimension .
Like a radio tuner all of sudden rewired to pick up not just other radio stations on air , but also capable of seeing the antenna , the sound waves and all the equipment which facilitates the broadcast .
The most frightening and simultaneously enlightening aspect of a high ketamine dose as its ability to produce a schizophrenic break and completely obliterate the ego .
 To produce a schizophrenic break you need to collapse the ego , preferably as rapidly as possible .
There are different ways of defining the ego but I define it thusly :
The ego is a structure of the personality that is made up of what we believe to be true about ourselves , others , the world around us , and our place in it .
We form these beliefs as based on our relationships , our experiences , the roles we play and the activities we engage in .
All of these combined , create our ego -- which is , for most of us , our sense of who we are . 
" The overall experience is described as falling into a kind of abyss of isolation .
This comes about because there is such a discrepancy between the subjective inner world that one has been swept into , and the mundane everyday world outside .
It is like falling into a death - not only a death state , but also a death space - the " afterlife , " the " realm of the ancestors , " the " land of the dead , " the " spirit world . "
The common experience here is for the person to look about and think that half the people around him are dead too .
While in this condition , it 's very hard for one to tell if one is really alive or not . "
For me it was as though I had somehow managed to tear through the fabric of reality and to step behind the scenes of the world .
Everything moved in slow motion in an endless cycle .
The universe is cyclical , perfect and eternal - it had no beginning and it will never have an end , after all , how could it ?... when time and space are mere concepts that we perceive through our unavoidably human experience .
Life is nothing more than our divine creator playing out a grand eternal game through us , the characters he has created .
Life is Gods way of perceiving himself .
" Right away at the beginning , the death experience is accompanied by the feeling that you 've gone back to the beginning of time .
This involves a regression , a return to the state of infancy in one 's personal life history .
But hand in hand with this is the feeling of slipping back into the world of the primordial parents , into a Garden of Eden .
For example , it 's a very common experience to feel one is the child of Adam and Eve , say , at the beginning of time .
This is very symbolic , obviously .
It 's pretty much a representation of the psyche at the start of one 's individual career after birth . "
I remember distinctly having memories of Adam and Eve and the other narratives Id read about in the bible .
Words and phrases would rise in my mind , as though the entire experience was being narrated to me by some divine voice .
Or perhaps it was just my own voice .
The voice of the eternal " I " that had always been there underneath " self " but who had been drowned out by the incessant chatter of the mind .
The phrase  That s life  passed through my mind again and again as though I was realising for the first time what " life " actually was .
I remember seeing language as an entity unto itself , seeing the spirit of language it is alive and it sustains this life as we transmit it from generation to generation .
I remember seeing all the meaning bundled up in a word like " love " and feeling it with the same intensity as if for that split second the voices of every single human being who had ever uttered it were coursing through my mind .
I remember the phrase " The Game of Life " passing through my stream of consciousness and laughing as I saw for the first time the mechanics of this game unfolding before my eyes .
I remember repeating a word over and over in my head .
It was not an English word and to this day I dont know how to write it or what language it is .
Phonetically it sounded like  Thuck ah dun dunstall . 
I do however know what the word means .
The word being spoken to me from the inner most depths of my soul was my name , not the name I have been given in this lifetime , but my eternal name , the name I have remembered at the point of all my previous deaths , and the name I will continue to remember for as many lives as I am forced to wander through Samsaric existence .
I saw all the people in my life as though they were characters in my story , some of them good , some of them malevolent ... but all of them were there for a purpose , to teach me something about myself , to allow me to grow as a spirit .
It was as though we were all intertwined in a great eternal narrative and that each of us in our various lives plays a role in order for others to grow .
Suddenly it was as though everybody in the room turned to face me and I felt all of the cells in my body tremble .
The thought passed through my consciousness , " I am about to die I know whats going to happen now this moment is about to be the moment of my death . "
I felt all the people in the room turn in slow motion to look at me , as though something profound was about to happen .
Again there was a primordial word for it that I heard from someone in the room .
" Hes about to go through his ( then the primordial word for death ) . "
Suddenly it was as though all the cells in my body turned to water and I quite literally felt myself collapse into the ground , back into the very universe from which I first sprung .
I let out a cry , an inhuman scream from the very depths of my soul .
It is a sound I never realised I could make , a sound that my friends told me later literally stopped every person in the club in their tracks and caused them to look over to where I had collapsed .
As I collapsed into the ground I was screaming at the top of my lungs the word for my name , as though this unearthly scream of my primordial name could somehow force me to remember who I was and where I had come from .
As I collapsed to the ground next to my friend I was convinced that I was experiencing my own death unfold , I felt a sort of a guiding presence trying to tell me that what I was now going through was a natural progression in the higher scheme of things , that it was a process that everyone had a time and a moment reserved for them to die , and that everything that was about to unfold was a perfectly normal step in the process .
At the time I felt like every person in the room surrounding me had already passed though into the next realm and that they were there to witness and guide me as I passed through to join them .
I collapsed kicking and screaming to the ground , I felt a guiding force instructing me to do so , to release all the anger and the pain of life out of my body , to cleanse myself .
I honestly believed that each and everyone one of them , at their chosen point in time , had also undergone this experience .
Finally I saw the faces of two of my friends as they picked me up and it was as though somehow all the cells in my body reformed and I came out the other side .
It was as though for one brief instant instead of cycling in upon itself , the universe passed one cycle through my body .
As I got up I could see my two close friends comforting me " See , you re going to be ok , its ok .
You re going to be ok because death is not the end , it is just the end of one cycle and the beginning of another "
 All kinds of imagery comes tumbling across the field of awareness .
It 's like the mythological image in a perfect stained - glass window being smashed , and all the bits and pieces being scattered .
The effect is very colourful , but it 's very hard to discern how the pieces belong to each other .
Any attempt to make sense of it is an exercise in abstraction from the actual experience .
The important thing is to find the process running through it all . 
I also distinctly remember a feeling of fear and terror which came from feeling like Id popped out of reality and into this great eternal loop .
My friend and I would be thrown together , intertwined , both with gaunt eyes filled with horror , begging each other to try and remember , to never forget  but each time we would pass through another cycle , sure enough , we seemed to be back to the place where we had begun , forever trapped in this world we had dared venture into .
I remember the songs lyrics playing in the club  Funky disco playing in a long , monotone drawn out fashion in my head , on some sort of loop .
This loop experience is also characteristic of the k - world itself , indeed one of the overwhelming thoughts that continued to pervade my k experience with my friend was that I had in fact enslaved myself into the k - world , which is a world effectively on a loop complete with its dark inhabitants  the darker side of humanity , the twisted and contorted faces , bodies that appeared to be made from stone of the individuals serve as a constant reminder that these are the individuals who had chosen to try k , and had thus effectively ensnared themselves in the k - loop  a world from which they would never find any escape , and would be damned to inhabit for the rest of eternity , with no possibility of death , no peace , no nothingness .
Walking out of the club onto the road where I had spent so many nights with my friends over the years was like walking out into bliss .
I saw the faces of all the people I had ever loved , and as the process wore on I felt the veil which obscures all the mysteries of life falling down all around me .
I felt that I finally understood .
In particular I felt a deep connection with language and the way we use language to construct meaning around us .
I remember contemplating certain words and turns of phrases in English , and finally understanding a deeper meaning , how they fit into the jigsaw puzzle that is life , and how they are but the building blocks of all those who have gone before us  the very spirits I was about to encounter as I moved into the next realm .
I saw all the people I had ever thought I had loved - some brief encounters , other more lasting as finally my image settled on a friend of mine  my one true soul mate .
I saw him in a light that I had never seen him in before , I felt the love and the connection building in me like a volcano , I lay down on the road in front of me and let it all out in a tide of tears and screaming .
I was screaming I love you , god I f**cking love you .
I finally felt bound to someone , the right one , and I now felt that we would be moving together as one in the next realm as one unit .
As two beautiful souls bound eternally together .
I realised then the meaning of life , as I saw our two souls parting together , and my human conscious re-preparing itself to enter the earthly realm as a new spirit .
I was convinced that one part of me was about to be born again as a new child , although in this particular experience it never occurred , or if it did occur I was not aware of it whilst it was happening .
As I neared the end of my death I felt euphoria , I was screaming  That s life , that s what life is !
I was blown away by the sheer magnitude of life force  that which we call god  but what I experienced as an omnipresent energy from which all life is derived .
I felt complete , I felt whole , I felt peace .
But no light can exist without darkness and shortly after this euphoric epiphany I began to feel the darkness again - the terror and the evil that is also life .
As I held onto my friend he began to disintegrate in my arms .
I bit him savagely on the chest to try and hold onto him , drawing blood and causing him to cry out 
I had wanted to try and keep part of him with me , to stop the erosion .
But he began to melt away , as did the feeling of bliss and euphoria .
The guiding presence told me that I needed to experience all that is life , not merely the good , but also the bad .
I heard my friend saying  Dont forget how good this was and Ill see you next time our spirits rejoin .
But I also simultaneously felt the guiding presence telling me that soon all would be forgotton , that my conscience would be reset , and that still deep down below this world of bliss , of heaven and of euphoria , was the world of K , the mechanical , robotic loop world which underpins reality .
That I was forever bound to it , and knowing that fact every time I came to dying in my future lives was ultimately a hell that I was bound to endure .
Life is suffering , and as long as humanlust shackles us to the physical planes , we shall be bound to endure it .
My death was truly the most breathtakingly beautiful yet simultaneously utterly terrifying experience I have ever gone through .
As I was laying out on the road I felt as though I saw the people who had played a significant role in my life as though for the first time - like they were shedding their masks and I was seeing them in a way that I had been unable to do during my life .
I understood the roles they had played in shaping me , in allowing me to grow and learn as a spirit and I felt an overwhelming love for all of them which overwhelmed and consumed every essence of my being .
Perhaps the best way I can describe it is that I saw their spirits their essence I felt their light and their warmth , and was overwhelmed by the collective wisdom and knowledge that I saw within them .
I felt as though I was amongst very old and very wise spirits who were guiding me and helping me grow and move into a new , higher realm .
I felt privileged to have had them in my life .
This included both those who had caused me harm , and those who had brought me love and happiness .
I understood for the first time that they were all , in essence , incredible spirits that in my death brought me a feeling of peace and belonging that I had never known in my mortal life .
I felt a connection to the universe and to these spirits , my friends , that made me realise for the first time that death is not at all something to be feared , and that most importantly that my connection to these great spirits would be eternal .
As the earthly faces of my friends were one by one unveiled , and as I saw each of them as if for the first time , I witnessed the essence of who they truly were and I finally understood what it is to love someone , and just how beautiful and special each of them truly is .
I remember finally understanding that we are all at various stages in lives , lives that begin and lives that end .
As I lay there experiencing my death on the road I felt at peace , that death was not something to be feared but to be embraced , and that when my time eventually did come , this understanding that I had been given a glimpse of in my k- hole would reveal itself in its entirety .
That the energy which powers us as humans is eternal , and that whilst I was one thing in this life , I was male , I was someone who chose to use drugs , I was someone who was not religious , etc ... that in my next lifetime I would be someone else .
That life itself was eternal , even if my life was not .
That on my next time around  so to speak , that I would experience things from a different point of view , perhaps as another person , perhaps simply as another animal or being somewhere .
I remember laughing at those who had told me that the way I had lived my life was wrong knowing that after the death of their physical selves that the energy that is them could return as somebody like me .
That their values were only contingent on their physical surrounds and of their geographic place in the world .
I felt a new sense that our concepts of right and wrong were quite arbitrary , that life itself was so infinitely grand and all consuming that those mistakes or wrongs that we committed on the earthly plane were in the grand scheme of things were of little relevance .
That all the goodness that exists in humanity can only be so with the necessary existence of all that is bad with humanity .
That both goodness and badness are life , and that life itself is so infinitely grand and amazing that we as humans could never be capable of comprehending it through our physical , earthly selves .

" For me it was as though I had somehow managed to tear through the fabric of reality and to step behind the scenes of the world .
Everything moved in slow motion in an endless cycle .
The universe is cyclical , perfect and eternal - it had no beginning and it will never have an end , after all , how could it ?... when time and space are mere concepts that we perceive through our unavoidably human experience .
Life is nothing more than our divine creator playing out a grand eternal game through us , the characters he has created .
Life is Gods way of perceiving himself .
" Right away at the beginning , the death experience is accompanied by the feeling that you 've gone back to the beginning of time .
This involves a regression , a return to the state of infancy in one 's personal life history .
But hand in hand with this is the feeling of slipping back into the world of the primordial parents , into a Garden of Eden .
For example , it 's a very common experience to feel one is the child of Adam and Eve , say , at the beginning of time .
This is very symbolic , obviously .
It 's pretty much a representation of the psyche at the start of one 's individual career after birth .
" I remember distinctly having memories of Adam and Eve and the other narratives Id read about in the bible .
Words and phrases would rise in my mind , as though the entire experience was being narrated to me by some divine voice .
Or perhaps it was just my own voice .
The voice of the eternal " I " that had always been there underneath " self " but who had been drowned out by the incessant chatter of the mind .
The phrase  That s life  passed through my mind again and again as though I was realising for the first time what " life " actually was .
I remember seeing language as an entity unto itself , seeing the spirit of language it is alive and it sustains this life as we transmit it from generation to generation .
I remember seeing all the meaning bundled up in a word like " love " and feeling it with the same intensity as if for that split second the voices of every single human being who had ever uttered it were coursing through my mind .
I remember the phrase " The Game of Life " passing through my stream of consciousness and laughing as I saw for the first time the mechanics of this game unfolding before my eyes .
I remember repeating a word over and over in my head .
It was not an English word and to this day I dont know how to write it or what language it is .
Phonetically it sounded like  Thuck ah dun dunstall . 
I do however know what the word means .
The word being spoken to me from the inner most depths of my soul was my name , not the name I have been given in this lifetime , but my eternal name , the name I have remembered at the point of all my previous deaths , and the name I will continue to remember for as many lives as I am forced to wander through Samsaric existence .
I saw all the people in my life as though they were characters in my story , some of them good , some of them malevolent ... but all of them were there for a purpose , to teach me something about myself , to allow me to grow as a spirit .
It was as though we were all intertwined in a great eternal narrative and that each of us in our various lives plays a role in order for others to grow .
Suddenly it was as though everybody in the room turned to face me and I felt all of the cells in my body tremble .
The thought passed through my consciousness , " I am about to die I know whats going to happen now this moment is about to be the moment of my death . "
I felt all the people in the room turn in slow motion to look at me , as though something profound was about to happen .
Again there was a primordial word for it that I heard from someone in the room .
" Hes about to go through his ( then the primordial word for death ) .
" Suddenly it was as though all the cells in my body turned to water and I quite literally felt myself collapse into the ground , back into the very universe from which I first sprung .
I let out a cry , an inhuman scream from the very depths of my soul .
It is a sound I never realised I could make , a sound that my friends told me later literally stopped every person in the club in their tracks and caused them to look over to where I had collapsed .
As I collapsed into the ground I was screaming at the top of my lungs the word for my name , as though this unearthly scream of my primordial name could somehow force me to remember who I was and where I had come from .
As I collapsed to the ground next to my friend I was convinced that I was experiencing my own death unfold , I felt a sort of a guiding presence trying to tell me that what I was now going through was a natural progression in the higher scheme of things , that it was a process that everyone had a time and a moment reserved for them to die , and that everything that was about to unfold was a perfectly normal step in the process .
At the time I felt like every person in the room surrounding me had already passed though into the next realm and that they were there to witness and guide me as I passed through to join them .
I collapsed kicking and screaming to the ground , I felt a guiding force instructing me to do so , to release all the anger and the pain of life out of my body , to cleanse myself .
I honestly believed that each and everyone one of them , at their chosen point in time , had also undergone this experience .
Finally I saw the faces of two of my friends as they picked me up and it was as though somehow all the cells in my body reformed and I came out the other side .
It was as though for one brief instant instead of cycling in upon itself , the universe passed one cycle through my body .
As I got up I could see my two close friends comforting me " See , you re going to be ok , its ok .
You re going to be ok because death is not the end , it is just the end of one cycle and the beginning of another "
All kinds of imagery comes tumbling across the field of awareness .
It 's like the mythological image in a perfect stained - glass window being smashed , and all the bits and pieces being scattered .
The effect is very colourful , but it 's very hard to discern how the pieces belong to each other .
Any attempt to make sense of it is an exercise in abstraction from the actual experience .
The important thing is to find the process running through it all .
I also distinctly remember a feeling of fear and terror which came from feeling like Id popped out of reality and into this great eternal loop .
My friend and I would be thrown together , intertwined , both with gaunt eyes filled with horror , begging each other to try and remember , to never forget  but each time we would pass through another cycle , sure enough , we seemed to be back to the place where we had begun , forever trapped in this world we had dared venture into .
I remember the songs lyrics playing in the club  Funky disco playing in a long , monotone drawn out fashion in my head , on some sort of loop .
This loop experience is also characteristic of the k - world itself , indeed one of the overwhelming thoughts that continued to pervade my k experience with my friend was that I had in fact enslaved myself into the k - world , which is a world effectively on a loop complete with its dark inhabitants  the darker side of humanity , the twisted and contorted faces , bodies that appeared to be made from stone of the individuals serve as a constant reminder that these are the individuals who had chosen to try k , and had thus effectively ensnared themselves in the k - loop  a world from which they would never find any escape , and would be damned to inhabit for the rest of eternity , with no possibility of death , no peace , no nothingness .
Walking out of the club onto the road where I had spent so many nights with my friends over the years was like walking out into bliss .
I saw the faces of all the people I had ever loved , and as the process wore on I felt the veil which obscures all the mysteries of life falling down all around me .
I felt that I finally understood .
In particular I felt a deep connection with language and the way we use language to construct meaning around us .
I remember contemplating certain words and turns of phrases in English , and finally understanding a deeper meaning , how they fit into the jigsaw puzzle that is life , and how they are but the building blocks of all those who have gone before us  the very spirits I was about to encounter as I moved into the next realm .
I saw all the people I had ever thought I had loved - some brief encounters , other more lasting as finally my image settled on a friend of mine  my one true soul mate .
I saw him in a light that I had never seen him in before , I felt the love and the connection building in me like a volcano , I lay down on the road in front of me and let it all out in a tide of tears and screaming .
I was screaming I love you , god I f**cking love you .
I finally felt bound to someone , the right one , and I now felt that we would be moving together as one in the next realm as one unit .
As two beautiful souls bound eternally together .
I realised then the meaning of life , as I saw our two souls parting together , and my human conscious re-preparing itself to enter the earthly realm as a new spirit .
I was convinced that one part of me was about to be born again as a new child , although in this particular experience it never occurred , or if it did occur I was not aware of it whilst it was happening .
As I neared the end of my death I felt euphoria , I was screaming  That s life , that s what life is !
I was blown away by the sheer magnitude of life force  that which we call god  but what I experienced as an omnipresent energy from which all life is derived .
I felt complete , I felt whole , I felt peace .
But no light can exist without darkness and shortly after this euphoric epiphany I began to feel the darkness again - the terror and the evil that is also life .
As I held onto my friend he began to disintegrate in my arms .
I bit him savagely on the chest to try and hold onto him , drawing blood and causing him to cry out 
I had wanted to try and keep part of him with me , to stop the erosion .
But he began to melt away , as did the feeling of bliss and euphoria .
The guiding presence told me that I needed to experience all that is life , not merely the good , but also the bad .
I heard my friend saying  Dont forget how good this was and Ill see you next time our spirits rejoin .
But I also simultaneously felt the guiding presence telling me that soon all would be forgotton , that my conscience would be reset , and that still deep down below this world of bliss , of heaven and of euphoria , was the world of K , the mechanical , robotic loop world which underpins reality .
That I was forever bound to it , and knowing that fact every time I came to dying in my future lives was ultimately a hell that I was bound to endure .
Life is suffering , and as long as humanlust shackles us to the physical planes , we shall be bound to endure it .
My death was truly the most breathtakingly beautiful yet simultaneously utterly terrifying experience I have ever gone through .
As I was laying out on the road I felt as though I saw the people who had played a significant role in my life as though for the first time - like they were shedding their masks and I was seeing them in a way that I had been unable to do during my life .
I understood the roles they had played in shaping me , in allowing me to grow and learn as a spirit and I felt an overwhelming love for all of them which overwhelmed and consumed every essence of my being .
Perhaps the best way I can describe it is that I saw their spirits their essence I felt their light and their warmth , and was overwhelmed by the collective wisdom and knowledge that I saw within them .
I felt as though I was amongst very old and very wise spirits who were guiding me and helping me grow and move into a new , higher realm .
I felt privileged to have had them in my life .
This included both those who had caused me harm , and those who had brought me love and happiness .
I understood for the first time that they were all , in essence , incredible spirits that in my death brought me a feeling of peace and belonging that I had never known in my mortal life .
I felt a connection to the universe and to these spirits , my friends , that made me realise for the first time that death is not at all something to be feared , and that most importantly that my connection to these great spirits would be eternal .
As the earthly faces of my friends were one by one unveiled , and as I saw each of them as if for the first time , I witnessed the essence of who they truly were and I finally understood what it is to love someone , and just how beautiful and special each of them truly is .
I remember finally understanding that we are all at various stages in lives , lives that begin and lives that end .
As I lay there experiencing my death on the road I felt at peace , that death was not something to be feared but to be embraced , and that when my time eventually did come , this understanding that I had been given a glimpse of in my k- hole would reveal itself in its entirety .
That the energy which powers us as humans is eternal , and that whilst I was one thing in this life , I was male , I was someone who chose to use drugs , I was someone who was not religious , etc ... that in my next lifetime I would be someone else .
That life itself was eternal , even if my life was not .
That on my next time around  so to speak , that I would experience things from a different point of view , perhaps as another person , perhaps simply as another animal or being somewhere .
I remember laughing at those who had told me that the way I had lived my life was wrong knowing that after the death of their physical selves that the energy that is them could return as somebody like me .
That their values were only contingent on their physical surrounds and of their geographic place in the world .
I felt a new sense that our concepts of right and wrong were quite arbitrary , that life itself was so infinitely grand and all consuming that those mistakes or wrongs that we committed on the earthly plane were in the grand scheme of things were of little relevance .
That all the goodness that exists in humanity can only be so with the necessary existence of all that is bad with humanity .
That both goodness and badness are life , and that life itself is so infinitely grand and amazing that we as humans could never be capable of comprehending it through our physical , earthly selves .
Thoughts , similar experiences on ketamine or other Entheogens ?

While Japan ’s long economic stagnation has prompted a slow dismantling of the nation ’s postwar order , punctuated by a historic change of government last year , one pillar of that order , the news media , has so far been left relatively untouched .
The new government has taken the initial steps to open up some of the exclusive press clubs that dominate coverage at Tokyo ’s powerful central ministries , but it has yet to follow through with more sweeping changes .
For a variety of reasons , cultural as well as economic , the digital revolution has yet to wreak the same havoc on the news media here that it has in the United States and most other advanced countries .
The media landscape is still dominated by the same handful of behemoths that have held sway for decades , like the Yomiuri Shimbun , the world ’s largest newspaper , with daily circulation of more than 10 million .
Personal blogs thrive in Japan , as do shopping sites and chat rooms appealing to groups from pet lovers to angry nationalists .
But sites dedicated to news have found only a small foothold , and most of those are run by major news organizations , which often treat them as sideshows .
Most glaringly , there have been few of the alternative news blogs and news sites that have appeared in other countries , like The Huffington Post in the United States .
The handful of sites that have drawn attention , like J - Cast News and The Journal , have failed to garner large numbers of readers .
Citizen journalism sites have earned the most attention here , largely for taking the lead in challenging media taboos and criticizing Japan ’s press clubs .
But they are far from prosperous .
Before JanJan , a well - financed startup from South Korea , OhmyNews Japan , shut down two years ago and Tsukasa Net closed last November .
Another , PJ News , has shrunk to a single editor who does not even have an office .
One day in 1939 , Berkeley doctoral candidate George Dantzig arrived late for a statistics class taught by Jerzy Neyman .
He copied down the two problems on the blackboard and turned them in a few days later , apologizing for the delay — he ’d found them unusually difficult .
Distracted , Neyman told him to leave his homework on the desk .
On a Sunday morning six weeks later , Neyman knocked on Dantzig ’s door .
The problems that Dantzig had assumed were homework were actually unproved statistical theorems that Neyman had been discussing with the class — and Dantzig had proved both of them .
Both were eventually published , with Dantzig as coauthor .
“ When I began to worry about a thesis topic , ” he recalled later , “ Neyman just shrugged and told me to wrap the two problems in a binder and he would accept them as my thesis . ”
Jackson Browne : I Blame bottled water for the oil spill !
I was struck the other day by a comparison made on 5 Gyres , the blog site of scientists and activists who are working to draw attention to the growing concentration of plastic pollution in the world 's oceans .
According to the scientists ' and activists ' estimate , the amount of oil used to produce plastic every day is the same amount as the oil that is spilling into the Gulf of Mexico every day from the damaged Deepwater Horizon drilling rig .
And they point out that the plastic ends up in the same place – the ocean .
So that means that we are the spill , or a spill of similar proportion to the uncontainable , disastrous spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Earth song : Jackson Browne is passionate about protecting the planet
Last year my touring production company decided to eliminate plastic water bottles from the list of things we are provided in the venues we perform in .
Now we carry two five - gallon coolers , and each of the band and crew carries a stainless - steel water bottle .
On our buses we use Brita filters .
My production manager estimates we save between 200 and 250 bottles each show , and up to 96 bottles every day on the buses .
We are one of several tours that we know of who are making these kinds of changes .
There are also some venues and festivals that are eliminating single - use plastics .
Living in Los Angeles , I had long believed that having one 's own sealed water bottle was safer than trusting the municipal water supply .
My children grew up drinking from plastic water bottles .
But not long ago I heard a radio programme that dispelled that myth , and a few others , including the viability of recycling all the plastic bottles produced every year .
Most of the bottled water sold as spring water in America is , in fact , tap water .
There do n't seem to be any legal barriers to selling what comes out of a pipe in New Jersey or Los Angeles as spring water , or mountain water , or Arctic water , at least not in the United States .
There is far more quality control of American water supplies by municipalities than is exercised by the companies that bottle tap water and sell it to us for as much 200 times its value .
As for the designer water that is shipped from Fiji or France or Sweden all over the world , using jet or diesel fuel – this only adds to the amount of oil that is used by the plastic bottled water industry .
It takes one third of a bottle of petroleum to manufacture a single plastic bottle .
Add to that the cost in petro-miles of shipping it around the world and you have what is still accepted as a legitimate business expense , though it may eventually be seen as a crime .
The amount of oil used to produce plastic is the same amount as the oil that is spilling into the Gulf of Mexico from the damaged Deepwater Horizon drilling rig
Getting people to accept the premise that only the water from pristine and exotic locations is truly clean may be a marketing triumph , but it is a human health disaster .
The health issue with plastic bottles is that they are made with Bisphenol A or BPA , a known ' endocrine disruptor ' , which can mimic the body 's hormones and can have side effects .
BPA is used to make the plastic hard and clear , and it was developed originally as a sex hormone drug until that use was discontinued for reasons of human health and safety .
BPA leaches out of the bottles into the liquids they contain , in amounts that are claimed to be safe by the plastics industry .
But last year experts from five universities – London , Plymouth , Reading , Stirling and Ulster – urged the British Government to review BPA .
In a letter to the then Health Secretary Andy Burnham , they wrote : ' The major body of research and evidence presented over the last decade strengthens the growing consensus that low - level exposure to BPA has a significant impact on increasing the risks of developing conditions such as cancer , diabetes , impaired brain function , and behavioral problems in mammalian laboratory animals . '
Britain has not enacted any changes yet , but Japan has limited levels of BPA in tins and has removed it from plastic containers used by children .
Canada has listed BPA as a toxic chemical and banned it from baby bottles , and there are efforts in America , France and Australia to restrict or ban the use of BPA from children 's bottles , cups and plates .
But let 's go back to what is happening to the word 's oceans .
Most of us have heard by now that there is a ' floating island of rubbish in the Pacific Ocean twice the size of Texas ' , or some variation of that .
But it 's not an island , and it's not something that can be cleaned up or somehow recycled .
In fact , what is happening in the Pacific is happening in all five of the planet 's ocean gyres – as the systems of currents are called .
And it 's not really rubbish .
It is plastic .
It is breaking down into ever smaller pieces , but it can never biodegrade .
In parts of the Pacific this plastic outweighs plankton seven to one .
Fish mistake it for food and eat it .
And we eat the fish .
We are poisoning ourselves , and destroying the ocean .
This is done in the name of free enterprise , unregulated markets , the right to do business and the right to make a profit – and in the name of convenience , evidently the most precious freedom we have .
The plastics industry insists that all we have to do is recycle .
But why should we bear the cost and responsibility of recycling it ?
Why should we buy the stuff and then pay to dispose of it ?
In the case of the oceans , we will never be able to clean them up faster than the rate plastic is going in .
The answer is to stop producing it , to stop buying it .
A few years ago I was on a remote beach in Spain and spent the day cleaning it up with another guy there , a German .
It was mostly plastic .
He muttered that the locals did n't appreciate the natural beauty of the place .
Both of us assumed it had been thrown away there carelessly , perhaps dumped there .
But now I do n't think so .
I can see now that it had all washed up there .
Humans are slobs .
There 's no way around it .
We are slobs .
I know surfers who travel the world and ride the planet 's most remote waves .
They say there are plastic bottles washing up in Antarctica , in Patagonia , and all of the most distant and pristine beaches in the world .
What are we doing ?
There are laws against defiling the public places in our cities .
Where are the laws that protect our public planet , our commonly held wilderness , our oceans ?
Our oceans without which we certainly will perish ?
I had occasion to remark at my show at the Royal Albert Hall in London that we are the oil spill , and it is up to us to provide a solution to the problem .
And that the more I have become used to carrying a metal bottle , the easier it is to just fill my own bottle and take it with me .
On a night when I was singing my most personal reflections on life , I wanted to bring up the life of the planet .
I wanted to ask us all to try to remember to do all we can in the face of all these disasters , and to continue doing things that make a difference .
One thing we can do is to exercise our power as consumers , and to make choices that serve the interests of our families and of future generations , and the health of the planet .
Please read the websites of 5 Gyres ( 5gyres.org ) , and Plastic Pollution Coalition ( plasticpollutioncoalition.org ) , and go online and read Martin Hickman 's brilliant article Bad Chemistry : The Poison In The Plastic That Surrounds Us .
And oppose single - use plastic !
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Two years after Vallejo , California , filed for bankruptcy protection , officials in nearby Antioch are also tossing around the ‘ B ’ word .
Antioch ’s leaders earlier this month said bankruptcy could be an option for the cash - strapped city of roughly 100,000 on the eastern fringe of the San Francisco Bay area .
Antioch ’s fiscal woes are standard issue for local governments in California : weak revenue from retail sales and property taxes is forcing spending cuts , layoffs and furloughs .
But cost - cutting measures may not be enough to keep Antioch ’s books balanced , so its city council is openly discussing bankruptcy .
“ We just want to alert people to the possibility , ” Antioch Mayor Pro Tem Mary Helen Rocha said .
Orange County Treasurer Chriss Street would not be surprised if more local governments across the Golden State sound a similar alarm .
Street expects more talk of municipal bankruptcy across California because local government finances are in such dire shape -- a situation underscored on Wednesday when a top finance officer for Sacramento County projected a worse - than - expected shortfall for the county of $ 181 million , which could force more than 1,000 layoffs from the county ’s payroll .
“ You do n’t have the easy out of increasing revenue and you have a lot more call on services because of the economy , ” Street said .
“ There ’s no such thing as entertaining bankruptcy ; there ’s ending denial . ”
Orange County , California ’s third most populous county , declared bankruptcy in 1994 , at the time marking the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history , after suffering $ 1.7 billion in losses from bad investments .
The county emerged from bankruptcy in 1996 and its credit rating has since recovered from its post - bankruptcy “ junk ” status .
Fitch Ratings earlier this month affirmed its ‘ AA ’ rating on the number of the county ’s long - term obligations .
Marc Levinson , a lawyer with Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP who is representing Vallejo in its bankruptcy proceeding , agrees that California ’s hard times and lean local budgets are forcing local leaders to weigh bankruptcy .
“ It ’s a topic on everyone ’s lips because cities and counties and local governments are hurting , ” Levinson said .
OVERCOMING THE STIGMA
Municipal officials , however , are unlikely to pile into bankruptcy court in search of relief from their financial woes , Levinson said .
Chapter 9 bankruptcy filings are rare to begin , in part because many states limit them and , more important , their consequences include harm to credit ratings that determine borrowing costs , said Jim Spiotto , a partner at the Chicago law firm of Chapman & Cutler , who works on municipal finance matters .
A filing for Chapter 9 , the part of U.S. bankruptcy code that applies to municipalities could also result in being locked out of the municipal debt market , adding to fiscal trouble .
“ We take that very seriously , ” Amy Doppelt , a managing director at Fitch Ratings , said of how talk of bankruptcy could affect credit ratings .
Bankruptcy could also scare away investment and new jobs at time when California ’s unemployment rate is in the double - digits -- 12.6 percent in April -- and payroll growth is critical to bolstering the consumer spending and property markets that fill the coffers of local governments .
Ron Loveridge , the mayor of Riverside , California , and president of the National League of Cities , called bankruptcy a last resort .
“ It becomes a description of who you are , ” he said .
Despite its stigma , bankruptcy has paid an important dividend for Vallejo :
It has forced public employee unions to the negotiating table , providing city leaders an opportunity to rein in compensation , which city officials said accounts for more than three - quarters of Vallejo ’s general fund spending .
City Councilwoman Stephanie Gomes said the effort has led to concessions from three of four city unions .
Like Vallejo , Los Angeles is suffering from weak revenue at the same time the cost of its pensions and other retirement benefits are rising .
Former Mayor Richard Riordan said those factors put the government of the second largest U.S. city on track to declare bankruptcy between now and 2014 .
Riordan sees bankruptcy as a necessary tactic for squeezing concessions from the city ’s public employee unions .
It could also pave the way for 401 ( k ) retirement accounts for new city workers instead of defined pension benefit plans with escalating costs , he said .
“ The threat of bankruptcy is really the only way you ’re going to get them to make major changes , ” Riordan recently told Reuters .
Los Angeles officials dispute Riordan ’s bankruptcy outlook , published earlier this month in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal .
City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said Los Angeles does not want its “ brand ” tarnished by bankruptcy and that the city can avoid it by continuing to cut spending , by reducing its work force and by handing off some services to the private sector and nonprofits .
“ Bankruptcy is what you do when you run out of options .
The city has a lot of options and has been exercising those options , ” Santana said .
Talk of municipal bankruptcy has not escaped California ’s politically powerful public employee unions .
A number of them are pressing the legislature to pass a bill that would require local governments to get the approval of a state board before filing for bankruptcy .
Since the board could be stacked with union - friendly appointees , bankruptcy pleas could be rejected or delayed .
“ It ’s a horrible bill , ” Levinson said .
“ If you do n’t have the bankruptcy outlet , what do you do ?
If you ca n’t pay your bills what do you do ? ”
Louis Castle 's been around the block .
The American videogame designer co-founded Westwood Studios , which , as all real - time strategy fans know , created the groundbreaking Command & Conquer series .
He stayed on when EA bought Westwood , eventually becoming a big cheese within the publishing behemoth when it closed the studio in 2003 .
Then , in 2009 , Castle joined InstantAction as CEO , and set about changing the way we play games .
This morning Castle kicked off the Develop Conference in Brighton with a keynote entitled " Traditional Games Breaking into Social Networks : A View from the Frontline " .
Here , speaking to Eurogamer , Castle explains how he 's going to rid gaming of piracy and why we 'll all be playing the next Call of Duty game for free in a browser .
Eurogamer :
Tell us about your keynote .
Louis Castle :
My keynote is about traditional gaming .
Any kind of game can be distributed through the web , if you 're willing to approach it in a different way .
Eventually the same kind of content we see in consoles and on PCs for dedicated download is going to be available through web browsers .
I know that 's the case .
I would n't even say it 's probable .
It 's going to happen .
I know it 's going to happen because all the different companies are announcing initiatives , like Google with their native client stuff they want to do , and all these various companies all saying , ' Well we want to support 3D through the browser ' .
Even Flash is trying to get better 3D support through the browser .
The difference is all of those different initiatives are individual one - offs , and they 're a very small fraction of an already fragmented and heavily pirated market .
So it 's very challenging to get any publisher that 's spent $ 60 - 70 million building and marketing a game to want to put it into a place where it 's basically going to get stolen and given away for free .
It 's very analogous to the music industry .
So my keynote , in one sentence , is talking about all the different barriers that exist for high - quality published games to make it into the web , both technical and market barriers , and what we are doing at InstantAction to try to bridge that gap .
Eurogamer :
Do you believe that even high - budget console games with their impressive visuals will be playable in a browser ?
Louis Castle : I think it 'll happen , on PCs , Macs and consoles .
It 's going to happen across the board .
At GDC we were showing demonstrations of InstantAction playing Assassin 's Creed II .
We 've put Crysis on there , Call of Duty , all of these great games you would think , ' Oh my God , that 's never going to work . '
But we have them all working in a browser .
And we 're talking to a lot of publishers out there .
They 're understandably concerned and nervous .
They want to see the platform out there , well distributed , successful .
We 've got some announcements at PAX [ Penny Arcade Expo ] in September and hopefully some more following that over the fall .
Eurogamer : Obviously those high - budget games require a decent PC to run in a browser .
Louis Castle : Correct .
To be clear , we partner with Gaikai for thin client .
InstantAction as a platform offers thin - client play that masks a progressive download .
The progressive download can happen in a very short period of time relative to the game size .
In the case of something like an Assassin 's Creed or a Call of Duty , it might be a couple of hundred megabytes or more .
It could take as many as 20 minutes , maybe 30 .
So during that time we serve a Gaikai feed that lets you play immediately .
And while you 're playing the Gaikai feed we 're downloading the game in the background .
As soon as the game is on your system and ready to run , we then switch you over to play on your system , with a free trial for some period of time that 's up to the publisher .
After the free trial the publisher has lots of options on our platform on how they want to charge the customer .
They can do a cliff purchase , which is what Secret of Monkey Island is doing right now .
Or they could do rent - to - own , which we do n't think works as well .
So you 're paying , say , $ 10 - an - hour , and that $ 10 is coming off the purchase price .
So if you 've spent five hours for a $ 50 game , you 've bought the game .
You never have to pay after that .
They 're playable through the browser , full screen , as well as a browser window .
Games can actually talk to the browser and talk to things that are inside the browser , which is nice .
Your friends list can be your Facebook list , which is a lot nicer when it comes to finding somebody you want to invite .
You can create a Facebook group that is your Call of Duty friends , if you will .

MUNICH ( AP )  Bayern Munich has signed winger Franck Ribery to a new five - year contract .
The German club said in a statement on its website Sunday that the extension will keep the France international at the club until 2015 .
The contract was signed on Saturday before Bayern 's 2 - 0 loss to Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Madrid .
Ribery missed the match because of a suspension .
He arrived in Munich in 2007 from France 's Olympique Marseille on a $ 30 million transfer .
There had been reports in the last month that the 27 - year - old winger had been in talks with different European teams .

Carlos Miller , who runs the Photography Is Not a Crime blog , and veteran photojournalist Stretch Leford decided to test the photography rules in Miami - Dade 's metrorail system .
Before embarking on their test , they obtained written assurance from Metro Safety and Security Chief Eric Muntan that there 's no law against non-commercial photography on the system .
The two did n't make it past the first station before they were stopped .
Employees of 50 State Security , the private firm contracted to provide the metro's security , stopped the pair first .
They then called in local police .
The private firm and the police then threatened the two with arrest , demanded their identification ( to check them against a terrorist watch list ) , demanded multiple times that they stop filming , and eventually " banned " Miller and Ledford from the metro system " for life " ( though it 's doubtful they had the authority to do so ) .

Why Are We in Afghanistan ?
As Petraeus Takes Over , Could Success Be Worse Than Failure ?
By Tom Engelhardt
July 12 , 2011 , Washington , D.C. --
In triumphant testimony before a joint committee of Congress in which he was greeted on both sides of the aisle as a conquering hero , Gen. David Petraeus announced the withdrawal this month of the first 1,000 American troops from Afghanistan .
“ This is the beginning of the pledge the president made to the American people to draw down the surge troops sent in since 2009 , ” he said , adding , “ and yet let me emphasize , as I did when I took this job , that our commitment to the Afghan government and people is an enduring one . ”
Last July , when Gen. Petraeus replaced the discredited Gen. Stanley McChrystal as Afghan war commander , he was hailed as an “ American hero ” by Senator John McCain , as “ the most talented officer of his generation ” by the New Yorker ’s George Packer , and as “ the nation 's premier warrior - diplomat ” by Karen DeYoung and Craig Whitlock of the Washington Post -- typical of the comments of both Republicans and Democrats , liberals and conservatives at the time .
Petraeus then promised that the United States was in Afghanistan “ to win . ”
In the year since , the Taliban insurgency has been blunted and “ a tipping point has been reached , ” says a senior U.S. military official with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan , who could speak only on the condition of anonymity , in keeping with the policy of his organization .
By every available measure -- IEDs or roadside bombs , suicide attacks , Taliban assassinations of local officials , allied casualties , and Afghan civilian casualties -- the intensity of the insurgency has weakened significantly .
The Afghan military and police , though not capable of taking the lead in the fighting in their own country , have been noticeably strengthened by American and NATO training missions .
President Hamid Karzai ’s government , still considered weak and corrupt , has succeeded in putting an Afghan face on the war .
Democratic critics of Gen. Petraeus , and of President Obama ’s surge strategy , were notably quiet this week as the general toured the capital ’s power hotspots from John Podesta ’s Center for American Progress to the American Enterprise Institute , while being feted as the hero of the moment and a potential presidential candidate in 2016 .
As in 2007 , when he was appointed to oversee George W. Bush ’s surge in Iraq after the critics said it could n’t be done , the impressive charts the general brought to his congressional testimony once again vividly indicated otherwise .
The situation in Afghanistan has undergone an Iraq - like change since the nadir of July 2010 when critics and proponents alike agreed that the nine - year - old war was foundering , the counterinsurgency strategy failing , and polling in the U.S. highlighted the war ’s increasing unpopularity .
“ What a difference a year makes , ” said a jubilant senior official at the Pentagon .
In just 12 months , as Gen . Petraeus likes to describe it , he managed to synchronize the Afghan and Washington “ clocks ” and , in the process , as he had done in Iraq , took the news out of the war and the war out of the news .
The latest Gallup poll indicates that up to 63 % of Americans are now “ supportive ” of the general ’s approach to the Afghan War ...
What Success Would Mean in Afghanistan
Okay , it has n’t happened yet -- and the odds are it never will .
But for a moment , just imagine stories like that leading the news nationwide as our most political general in generations comes home to a grateful Washington .
By all accounts , the Afghan War could hardly be going worse today .
Counterinsurgency , the strategy promoted by General McChrystal but conceived by General Petraeus , is seemingly in a ditch , while the Taliban are the ones surging .
Around that reality has arisen a chorus of criticism and complaint , left , right , and center .
Failure breeds critics , you might say , the way dead bodies breed flies .
Or put another way , it ’s easy enough to criticize a failing American project , but what about a successful one ?
What if Petraeus really turns out to be the miracle general of twenty - first century American war - making -- which , by the way , only means that he needs to “ blunt ” the Taliban surge ( the modern definition of “ winning , ” now that victory is no longer a part of the U.S. war - making lexicon ) ?
Today , the increasingly self - evident failure of American policy in Afghanistan is bringing enough calls for firm drawdown or withdrawal dates ( or , from the Republicans , bitter complaints about the same ) to exasperate President Obama .
Under the circumstances , no one evidently wonders what success would really mean .
We ’ve been down so long , it seems , that few bother to consider what being up might involve .
Too bad .
It ’s worth a thought .
Let ’s say that Petraeus does return to Washington in what , these days , passes for triumph .
The question is : So what ?
Or rather , could success in Afghanistan prove worse for Americans than failure ?
Let ’s imagine that , in July 2011 , the U.S. military has tenuous control over key parts of that country , including Kandahar , its second largest city .
It still has almost 100,000 troops ( and at least a similar number of private contractors ) in the country , while a slow drawdown of the 30,000 surge troops the president ordered into Afghanistan in December 2009 is underway .
Similarly , the “ civilian ” surge , which tripled the State Department ’s personnel there , remains in place , as does the CIA surge that went with it -- and the contractor and base - building surges that went with them .
In fact , the CIA drone war in the Pakistani borderlands will undoubtedly have only escalated further by July 2011 .
Experts expect the counterinsurgency campaign to continue for years , even decades more ; the NATO allies are heading for the exits ; and , again according to the experts , the Taliban , being thoroughly interwoven with Afghanistan ’s Pashtun minority , simply cannot in any normal sense be defeated .
This , then , would be “ success ” 10 years into America ’s Afghan war .
Given the logistics nightmare of supporting so many troops , intelligence agents , civilian officials , and private contractors in the country , the approximately $ 7 billion a month now being spent there will undoubtedly be the price Americans are to pay for a long time to come ( and that ’s surely a significant undercount , if you consider long - term wear - and - tear to the military as well as the price of future care for those badly wounded in body or mind ) .
The swollen Afghan army and police will still have to undergo continual training and , in a country with next to no government funds and ( unlike Iraq ) no oil or other resource revenues on the immediate horizon , they , too , will have to be paid for and supplied by Washington .
And keep in mind that the U.S. Air Force will , for the foreseeable future , be the Afghan Air Force .
In other words , success means that , however tenuously , Afghanistan is ours for years to come .
So what would we actually have to show for all this expenditure of money , effort , and lives ?
We would be in minimalist possession of a fractious , ruined land , at war for three decades , and about as alien to , and far from , the United States as it ’s possible to be on this planet .
We would be in minimalist possession of the world ’s fifth poorest country .
We would be in minimal possession of the world ’s second most corrupt country .
We would be in minimal possession of the world ’s foremost narco - state , the only country that essentially produces a drug monocrop , opium .
In terms of the global war on terror , we would be in possession of a country that the director of the CIA now believes to hold 50 to 100 al - Qaeda operatives ( “ maybe less ” ) -- for whom parts of the country might still be a “ safe haven . ”
And for this , and everything to come , we would be paying , at a minimum , $ 84 billion a year .
On the basis of our stated war objective -- “ [ W ]e cannot allow Al Qaeda or other transnational extremists to once again establish sanctuaries from which they can launch attacks on our homeland or on our allies , ” as General Petraeus put it in his confirmation hearing at the end of June 2010 -- success in Afghanistan means increasingly little .
For al - Qaeda , Afghanistan was never significant in itself .
It was always a place of ( relative ) convenience .
If the U.S. were to bar access to it , there are so many other countries to choose from .
After all , what ’s left of the original al - Qaeda -- estimated by U.S. intelligence experts at perhaps 300 leaders and operatives -- seems to have established itself in the Pakistani tribal borderlands , a place that the U.S. military could hardly occupy , no matter how many CIA drone attacks were sent against it .
Moreover , U.S. intelligence experts increasingly suggest that al - Qaeda is in the process of fusing with local jihadist groups in those borderlands , Yemen , Somalia , North Africa , and elsewhere ; that it is increasingly an amorphous “ dispersed network , ” or even simply an idea or crude ideology , existing as much online as anywhere in particular on the ground .
In this sense -- and this is the only reason now offered for the American presence in Afghanistan -- a counterinsurgency “ success ” there would be meaningless unless , based on the same strategic thinking , the U.S. then secured Pakistan , Somalia , Yemen , and a potential host of other places .
In other words , the U.S. military would have to do one thing the Bush years definitively proved it could n’t do : impose a Pax Americana on planet Earth .
Of course , the Bush administration might have offered other explanations for the ongoing Afghan War , including the need to garrison what it called “ the arc of instability ” stretching from North Africa to the Chinese border ( essentially the oil heartlands of the planet ) , roll back Russia from its former Soviet “ backyard ” in Central Asia , and guarantee the flow of Caspian Sea oil westward .
More recently , with the revelation that a trillion or more dollars worth of natural resources lie under Afghan soil , securing that country ’s raw materials for western mining companies might have been added to that list .
The Obama administration , however , offers no such explanations and , being managerial rather than visionary in nature when it comes to U.S. foreign policy , might not even have them .
In any case , our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seem to be telling a rather different story .
The singular thing the Iraq War seems to have done politically is promote Iranian influence in that country .
Economically , it ’s made Iraq a safer place for the state - owned or state - controlled oil companies of China , Russia , and a number of other non-western nations .
In Afghanistan , in terms of those future natural resources , we seem to be fighting to make that country safe for Chinese investment ( just as the recently heightened U.S. sanctions against Iran are helping make that country safe for Chinese energy dominance ) .
The Question Mark over Afghanistan
All of this leaves the massive American investment of its most precious resources , including lives , in Afghanistan an ongoing mystery that is never addressed .
Somewhere in that country ’s vast stretches of poppy fields or in the halls of Washington ’s national security bureaucracy , in other words , lurks a great unasked question .
It ’s a question asked almost half a century ago of Vietnam , the lost war to which David Petraeus turned in 2006 to produce the Army counterinsurgency manual which is the basis for the present surge .
The question was :
Why are we in Vietnam ?
( It even became the title of a Norman Mailer novel . )
In 1965 , President Lyndon Johnson ’s administration produced a government propaganda film solely in response to that question , which was already threatening to drive down his polling figures and upend his Great Society at home .
The film was called Why Viet - Nam .
While it had no question mark after the title , the question of whether to add one was actually argued out in the most literal way inside the administration .
The film began with the president quoting a letter he had received from a mother “ in the Midwest ” whose son was stationed in Vietnam .
You hear the president , in his homey twang , pick up that woman ’s question , as if it were his own .
“ Why Vietnam ? ” he repeats three times as the title appears on the screen , after which , official or not , a question mark seems to hover over every scene , as it did over the war itself .
In a sense , the same question mark appeared both before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq , but it has never been associated with Afghanistan .
Because of 9/11 , Afghanistan remained for years the ( relatively ) good ( and largely forgotten ) war , until visible failure visibly tarnished it .
It ’s now past time to ask that question , even as the Obama administration repeats the al - Qaeda mantra of the Bush years almost word for word and lets any explanation go at that .
Why are we in Afghanistan ?
Why is our treasure being wasted there when it ’s needed here ?
It ’s clear enough that a failed counterinsurgency war in Afghanistan will be an unaffordably expensive catastrophe .
Let ’s not wait a year to discover that there ’s an even worse fate ahead , a “ success ” that leaves us mired there for years to come as our troubles at home only grow .
With everything else Americans have to deal with , who needs a future Petraeus Syndrome ?

The Gulf Oil Spill – a Cultural Crisis of Unprecedented Proportions
“ The Gulf of Mexico oil disaster feels far worse to shrimper Ricky Robin than Katrina , even though he 's still haunted by memories of riding out the hurricane on his trawler and of his father 's suicide in the storm 's aftermath .
The relentless spill is bringing back feelings that are far too familiar to Robin and others still dealing with the physical and emotional toll wrought by Katrina five years ago .
" I can't sleep at night .
I find myself crying sometimes , " said Robin , of Violet , a blue - collar community on the southeastern edge of the New Orleans suburbs , along the highway that hugs the levee on the Mississippi River 's east bank nearly all the way to the Gulf .
Psychiatrists who treated people after Katrina and have held group sessions in oil spill - stricken areas say the symptoms showing up are much the same : Anger .
Anxiety .
Drinking .
Depression .
Suicidal thoughts . ”
Oil spill 's psychological toll quietly mounts
By Janet McConnaughey and Mitch Stacy A.P .
The Gulf oil spill is a cultural crisis of unprecedented proportions and it deeply affects us on social , political , environmental , and economic levels .
The broader concerns are often the most discussed on a national scale , but there are intensely personal psychological and emotional ramifications to what has happened in our southern waters .
Especially hard hit are the residents along the coast who are still recovering psychologically and emotionally from Katrina ’s devastation .
But we are all : as a country ; as a global community ; a human community ; suffering a blow to our sense of safety in “ place ” .
We are suffering from the grim reality that nothing is sacred : our homes , our livelihood , the intimate relationship we have with our natural environment , all can be destroyed without warning .
Understandably , it is doubly hard to bear traumatic destruction that comes at the hands of those we trust and depend upon for our security , emotionally and financially .
Trauma is defined as an experience that falls outside the range of normal human experience .
Since the horror of 9 - 11 , there have been a number of formerly unthinkable events around the globe and the United States has responded with empathy and personal , corporate , and governmental aid .
After too many disasters and too many responses , our responsiveness and resilience are blunted .
Even the most empathetic people among us become cold and cynical to the cries of the survivors as a natural response to our own helplessness .
We ca n’t bear hearing them anymore because our own helplessness is too painful to bear .
The end result of long - standing helplessness and futility is the stage of grief known as denial , a “ frozen ” state where occasional feelings of sadness , emptiness , restless anxiety , and anger arise to activate our natural patterns of defense .
Those at the center of a disaster who have been suffering from the chronic stress of poverty and poor physical health have little resilience and few coping strategies .
These chronically stressed people can rapidly decompensate to self - destructive , self - sabotaging behaviors such as those reported in the article quoted above .
The most common responses are increased drug and alcohol consumption , explosiveness , domestic violence , criminal behavior , and suicidal thoughts , but more often it is a crippling state of depression that prevents activism and recovery .
It is no wonder , then , that there is a call from the coastal states and their mental health professionals for funds to be set aside for dealing with this ongoing crisis and its aftermath .
However , it bears repeating : regardless of geography , we are all experiencing this intrusion on our sense of what is normal and acceptable .
And the feeling of powerlessness to do anything about it can be overwhelming .
If we ’re normally healthy and have good coping mechanisms , we may fall into a deep and painful period of unrest and despair .
Or we may do what Daniel Goleman , the psychologist who wrote " Emotional Intelligence " has pointed out in his recent release , " Ecological Intelligence " that people react in an unproductive way which can actually subvert the kind of change we really need :
“ Finding other people to blame has always been a favored ploy of the human psyche .
Psychoanalysts call this " projection , " the casting out of our own failings and pasting them on someone - or something - other than ourselves ...
By imagining some disembodied power that has victimized us - " those greedy corporations " say - we avoid having to examine our own impacts .
It 's a convenient arrangement , one that lets us deflect our discomfort at facing the ways in which we add to the onslaughts against the natural world . ”
Daniel Goleman
Ecological Intelligence ( pg. 38 -39 )
The outrage , the sense of righteous indignation , and the painful despair we feel over the misuse of power by those who do not represent our interests or our core values can be channeled towards change and activism .
However , change requires that we look at how we support the status quo by proxy : that is , how we continually value a lifestyle dependent upon an economic structure that sucks the life out of people without regard to social justice , and resources out of the earth without regard to toxic waste and environmental destruction .
We must become conscious of our own participation in this dysfunctional , abusive system just like those living in debilitating family systems must do .
We must shed our reliance on them by breaking away from the little they provide to us at such a great personal and emotional cost .
We must if we choose to create a future that can support Life .
At this time , we are supporting a culture of Death – in the Gulf of Mexico , in Nigeria , in Afghanistan , and etc .
In her own Voice
A consortium of 30,000 union workers at Canadian food stores have gone on strike over company demands to reduce wages by as much as 25 % and reduce pension benefits as well .
For their part , grocers want to remain competitive with Wal - Mart , the 800 - pound retail gorilla .
Who has the upper hand and why ?
Please consider Ontario Loblaw workers approve strike mandate amid stalled contract talks .
Loblaw Co. workers in Ontario have overwhelmingly voted to give their union a strike mandate if Canada 's largest grocery chain does n't back down from concession demands that it says are necessary to remain competitive against its non-unionized rivals .
Over 97 per cent of members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union , which represents nearly 30,000 employees at stores under names such as Loblaws , Zehrs , Real Canadian Superstores and Fortinos , have voted in favour of a strike .
Loblaw says it must modify some of its existing agreements in order to stay competitive , as earnings have declined about five per cent from where they were five years ago .
Workers are frustrated over company proposals that would cut wages by up to 25 per cent , increase waiting times for benefits eligibility and reduce full - time jobs .
Workers at those stores make between the minimum wage of $ 10.25 and $ 25 an hour , plus benefits .
But Loblaw says that it must increase efficiency to take on a growing number of non-unionized competitors , like U.S. - based retail giant Wal - Mart , which has been ramping up its focus on low - cost groceries .
" We are striving to reach an agreement that would enable the company to continue to meet the demands of today ’s highly competitive retail landscape , " Julija Hunter , the company 's vice - president of public relations , said in an emailed statement .
" In many contracts we pay 10 per cent more than competitors and have 15 per cent less flexibility .
That ’s a real competitive disadvantage .
That ’s not sustainable , " Hunter said .
Attitudes and the 800 - Pound Deflationary Gorilla
Blaming Wal - Mart is Futile
Attitudes are Like Pendulums

If you do n’t understand evolutionary biology , do n’t write a book about it !
by Donald R. Prothero
THE DARWIN CELEBRATIONS
OF 2009 led to a glut of books about evolution , which took a wide variety of approaches .
Most books were written by biologists , paleontologists , or historians trained in the subject ; others were written by the creationists trying to counter all the Darwin publicity .
Yet there are books that fall into neither of these categories .
What Darwin Got Wrong by Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piatelli - Palmarini ( abbreviated FPP hereafter ) is a wrongheaded effort by a philosopher and a cognitive scientist ( neither of whom has any firsthand research experience relevant to evolutionary biology ) to critique natural selection .
The confusion begins with the title .
The authors state up front that they are both atheists , accept the fact that life has evolved , and do not agree with creationism or “ intelligent design ” — yet they used a title that is bound to boost sales by giving creationists the impression that this is a serious scientific critique of evolutionary biology .
In particular , the use of Darwin ’s name in the title ( talking about “ Darwinism ” rather than modern evolutionary biology , or even 1950s - style “ Neo- Darwinism ” ) is a classic creationist tactic .
In fact , modern evolutionary biology only vaguely resembles what Darwin thought 150 years ago .
So what if Darwin got a few things wrong ?
We ’ve learned a lot in the past century and a half !
What is remarkable is how much Darwin got right despite the fact that he knew nothing about genetics , and very little about the fossil record .
Throughout the book , FPP resurrect some of the hoariest discredited creationist arguments ( such as “ natural selection is tautological ” ) , showing that they have not only failed to acquire any relevant training in evolutionary biology , but also have not understood the standard responses to these creationist canards .
Since FPP do n’t deny that life has evolved , or that all life is related by a patterns of ancestry and descent ( the chief issue that bothers creationists ) , FPP ’s entire convoluted argument is against Darwin ’s main mechanism for evolution , natural selection .
There are some evolutionary biologists who have argued that natural selection is not the exclusive explanation for all aspects of life ’s evolution , from Stuart Kauffman ’s emphasis on natural self - organizing systems , to Stephen Jay Gould ’s push to recognize contingency and hierarchy in evolutionary biology .
But none of these scientists questions the idea that natural selection is real , or that it has a very important role to play in the evolution of new species .
FPP review many of the recent developments in evolutionary biology , from neutralism to group selection to self - organizing systems to jumping genes to evo-devo .
These important scientific discoveries have certainly broadened our understanding of how evolution works , but none of the people who made these discoveries doubt that natural selection still plays an important role in the process of evolution .
In effect , what FPP are suggesting is that each time we learn more about the evolutionary process , all of what we knew before must have been wrong !
There are some instances ( known as “ scientific revolutions ” ) where scientific discoveries have radically changed the foundation of a field and thrown out the entire paradigm , but none of the examples the FPP discuss are of that nature .
They are simply challenges to a narrow and restrictive form of Neo - Darwinism , not to the basic premise that natural selection is a very important ( if not the most important ) component of evolutionary change .
Much of the book consists of beating dead horses and straw men as if biology has learned nothing since the 1950s .
FPP talk about gene linkages and “ free rides ” of one gene upon another , about the laws of form and Fibonacci series in organisms , and about endogenous factors affecting form and development despite the fact that biologists have been working hard for many years to understand and explain these phenomena .
If FPP bothered to read any of the recent literature on these subjects over the past 30 years , they would have found that these phenomena are pretty well understood .
They do not force us to throw out the baby of natural selection with the bathwater of the failed ideas that evolutionary biology has rejected .
To FPP , the fundamental problem is this : how do we decide which features are selected for , and which ones are “ free riders ” invisible to natural selection ?
In their approach , if most of evolution is about “ free riders ” that are not selected for or against , then natural selection is irrelevant .
They discuss the classic 1979 paper by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin , “ The Spandrels of San Marco : A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme . ”
In that paper , Gould and Lewontin were criticizing the then - prevalent naïve form of extreme panselectionism in which every tiny aspect of an organism was presumed to be subject to natural selection in some way , even if we ca n’t detect it .
Gould and Lewontin rightly pointed out that ( like the spandrels which are functional byproducts of two arches meeting ) , many features of organisms are due to structural or functional constraints , and we should not assume that such features are fine - tuned by natural selection .
Most evolutionary biologists have taken the Gould and Lewontin ( 1979 ) paper in the spirit in which it was intended , and there is plenty of research now into functional / structural constraints .
When I attend professional meetings , I find very little of the naïve panselectionism that I encountered in my evolution classes and textbooks of the 1970s .
Yet FPP take the Gould / Lewontin critique too far , and make the absurd claim that because some features are possibly constrained and not fine - tuned by natural selection , we cannot assume that natural selection works anywhere .
What about all those studies that demonstrate tight correlations of cause and effect between a feature and the selective response that occurs when nature intervenes ?
According to FPP , these are not conclusive enough .
Therefore , whenever we have a large data set that shows a strong correlation between say , obesity and heart disease , or increases in carbon dioxide and global warming , we cannot even begin to suggest that there might be a causal connection .
If this is the angle that FPP are pushing , then they have a dispute with almost all of science , not just evolutionary biology .
Their claim is that if we see an apparent feature of an organism , and then determine what natural selection does to organisms which possess this feature , we cannot rule out the possibility that there was some unknown , invisible characteristic of the organism that caused differential survival , rather than the obvious conclusion that it was due to natural selection on the features we can study .
This is false on several counts .
First of all , there are many experiments ( not acknowledged by FPP ) that have done careful work with controls and minimizing the variables that conclusively show natural selection to be the only reasonable explanation for the results .
And secondly , what are these alleged “ invisible forces ” that might explain survival better than natural selection ?
How the heck do we evaluate them ?
In FPP ’s view , natural selection is a fine - tuned discriminator that can tell the difference between all these arbitrary categories that philosophers with no experience in biology can imagine .
In reality , natural selection is a coarse filter .
Some features of an organism appear to make a difference , and others are indeed free riders .
But the overwhelming evidence of 30 years ’ worth of natural and laboratory experiments show that natural selection indeed works , and there is no practical reason to worry about “ invisible ” ( and untestable ) causes when a clear cause - and - effect chain has been established .
If you found the previous discussion confusing and hard to follow , it is no accident .
The thinking and writing of FPP are so muddled and verbose and confusing that most people ( including most evolutionary biologists who reviewed it ) could n’t make much sense of the book , either .
In fact , FPP raise points that amount to philosophical hair - splitting and make no real difference to practicing biologists .
There are many instances of where philosophers can contribute insights to the activities of others .
But in the philosophy of science , it is much trickier .
Some philosophers have built whole careers out of trying to explain what scientists should do , without any regard to the reality of what scientists actually do .
Yet scientists keep on making big discoveries and changing our world , oblivious to philosophers who waste time arguing about idealized views of science .
Here we see another examples of outsiders like FPP who would be well advised to spend some time doing real evolutionary biology , and becoming familiar with the recent research and debates , instead of beating dead horses ( such as 1960s – 1970s panselectionism ) and strawmen arguments from 40 years ago .
Even more annoying is the fact that FPP do n’t give evolutionary biologists much credit for understanding what they do , modifying their approaches as new fields such as evo-devo have appeared , and being careful and self - critical not to overextend their conclusions .
Most biologists are very cautious about asserting cause and effect relationships between some feature and natural selection unless they have done all the necessary controls and dealt with all the variables ; otherwise , their work would not pass peer review and be published .
As their confusion and errors clearly demonstrate , FPP are outsiders with a distorted , mistaken view of the entire field who do n’t understand the field well enough to level valid criticisms .
When they have done their homework and acquired the relevant training , then the evolutionary biology community might take them seriously .
An apartheid - era cabinet minister carried a " nuclear trigger " to South Africa from Israel as part of Pretoria 's efforts to build an atom bomb , according to a report in a Johannesburg newspaper .
Two renowned South African journalists have revealed that Eschel Rhoodie , the apartheid government 's information minister who played a central role in establishing military ties to Israel , privately described in 1979 how he had transported " the trigger " as hand luggage on a flight from Tel Aviv .
But they say they were unable to publish the account at the time because of censorship and the former minister 's concerns for his safety .
Allister Sparks – who in the 70s was editor of the influential but now defunct Rand Daily Mail – said he decided to go public with Rhoodie 's admission , despite previous guarantees of secrecy , following last week 's revelations in the Guardian and in a new book , The Unspoken Alliance , that Israel offered to sell nuclear warheads to apartheid South Africa .
Writing in the Business Day newspaper , Sparks said Rhoodie travelled regularly to Israel in the mid-70s , and on occasions was accompanied by South Africa 's then intelligence chief , Hendrik van den Bergh .
" Rhoodie said talks had taken place between the two sides which had ultimately led to he and Van den Bergh being assigned the task of bringing " the trigger " to SA – which he said they did by packing it in a tea chest and transporting it as part of their hand - luggage on a South African Airways commercial flight , " Sparks wrote .
Rhoodie later revealed the information to the Rand Daily Mail 's chief investigative reporter , Mervyn Rees , whose work had exposed a government - run slush fund that brought down the then president , John Vorster , and the minister himself .
Rees confirmed Sparks 's account to the Guardian , adding that Rhoodie did not give full details about the " trigger " .
" I questioned him about it and he said I can't give you any of the details but suffice to say it was a vital component , it was a trigger , that would be used for South Africa 's nuclear capability , " said Rees .
It is possible that what Rhoodie called a trigger was tritium , a radioactive isotope required to explode certain types of nuclear bombs .
It has been revealed , although not officially acknowledged , that Israel supplied South Africa with 30g of tritium in the mid-70s , enough to build a dozen atom bombs .
Apartheid - era officials have denied the tritium was used as part of the country 's nuclear weapons programme and have pointed out that ultimately South Africa developed a type of atomic bomb that did not require that particular radioactive isotope .
But Sparks and Rees note that Rhoodie clearly said that what he called the trigger was delivered from Israel as part of South Africa 's development of a nuclear weapon which provides further evidence that the two countries were co-operating .
Rhoodie , who died in 1993 , told Rees that he became a point man in dealing with the Israelis after developing contacts while taking diving holidays in an Israeli resort .
Rhoodie 's meetings with the then Israeli defence minister , Shimon Peres , were an important step in establishing what would become very close collaboration in developing weapons .
Peres , who is now Israel 's president , wrote a letter to Rhoodie in 1974 praising the South African 's leading role in initiating " a vitally important co-operation between the two countries " .
Rees said Rhoodie confided in him during a series of lengthy conversations in Ecuador and then the south of France after he had been driven from office after the scandal over tens of millions of funds diverted from the defence budget to secret propaganda projects .
Rees said that although his reporting in the Rand Daily Mail was instrumental in exposing the scandal , Rhoodie was angered by what he viewed as his scapegoating by others in the government and decided to reveal what he knew about secret projects .
Rees said that during a meeting with Rhoodie in France in March 1979 , Van den Bergh called the former minister to a meeting in Paris .
" He went off and came back the next day in a state of some agitation and said he'd been virtually threatened by Van den Bergh , not on behalf of the South Africans but by the Israelis in terms of any disclosure that might be made regarding South Africa 's nuclear capability .
He was clearly shaken about it , " said Rees .
Rhoodie touched on Van den Bergh 's warning in his 1983 book , The Real Information Scandal .
" I had obtained much of this top secret information for the simple reason that I was one of the people who pioneered relations with certain states overseas , " he wrote .
" I assured [ Van den Bergh ] that the various projects which he was concerned about would never be released unless , I said , I were to die an unnatural death . "
Rhoodie and Rees became friends during the interviews , with Rees at one point delivering food and helping to care for the former minister when he was locked up in a French prison after the South African government sought his extradition over allegations of embezzling state funds .
Rees said he believes Rhoodie 's account because he proved to have given reliable accounts of other secret operations .
Rhoodie agreed to talk to the Rand Daily Mail on the condition he could withhold publication of information he ultimately decided should not be disclosed .
He applied that to the revelations about the nuclear cooperation .
Sparks said that the censorship laws of the time would have prevented him from printing it .
But today he said that with Rhoodie no longer alive and fresh revelations about South Africa 's nuclear ties to Israel , the time had come to reveal the truth .
" We do so because we believe it is now clear that there was nuclear collaboration between Israel and South Africa that enabled both sides to develop the bomb – and that given the state of nuclear proliferation in the world today it is in the global public interest that all available information about shady dealings with these apocalyptic weapons be brought into the open , " Sparks wrote .
In response to the latest revelations , Peres 's spokesperson , Ayalet Frisch , pointed to a statement by the former South African president , FW de Klerk , that his country had not co-operated with any foreign government in developing its nuclear weapons .
De Klerk made a similar claim to the South African parliament in 1993 when he said that the country at no point acquired nuclear weapons technology or materials from another state nor did it co-operate with foreign governments in developing its atomic bombs .
However , that has since been challenged by revelations about the amount of yellowcake uranium South Africa supplied to Israel , the tritium deliveries and the joint development and testing in South Africa of missiles to carry nuclear weapons .
In mid-June , a single - turbine helicopter took off from a test field in Mesa , Arizona , avoided obstacles in - flight , scoped out a landing site and landed safely .
It 's like the kind of flight choppers have made tens of thousands of times before .

Except this time , the helicopter did it entirely on its own - with no humans involved .
It was the first fully - autonomous flight of a full - sized chopper , ever .
The trial , overseen by Army - funded research team from Carnegie Mellon and the Piasecki Aircraft Coporation , has sent robo - choppers into the sky before ( see the video , after the jump ) .
And this Boeing - modified MD530 F helicopter , known as the Unmanned Little Bird has been making flights since 2004 .
But this was its first test without a pre-programmed flight path .

Unmanned smart choppers could help the military better handle dangerous territory and low - visibility conditions to evacuate wounded soldiers or bring supplies to the front lines .
In areas with bad or non existent roads ( like Afghanistan ) , helicopters are sometimes the only mode of transport .
Finding a place to safely land in a dust storm , on rugged terrain , or with bullets flying at you presents a major challenge for pilots .
Artificially intelligent helicopters could help pilots stake out good landing spots , or perhaps even allow them to stay safely behind at base .
While on - the - fly autonomous navigation is a first for a full - sized helicopter , the technology developed by Sanjiv Singh and his team from Carnegie Mellon is not so different from what they used to outfit a Chevy Tahoe to win Darpa 's 2007 Urban Challenge .
" It 's not as if we started from scratch , " says Singh .
" A lot of the technology was there already . "
To make the helicopter self - flying , the team installed a scanning LIDAR that uses lasers to collect range information from its surroundings .
The laser data is processed by a computer that relays commands to the helicopter controllers .
The data also creates a 3 - D map that enables the helicopter to " see " the ground or obstacles in the air - and then adjust its trajectory accordingly .
The algorithms helped the helicopter miss a tall tower during one of the tests .
In another trial , the team deceptively instructed the helicopter to land on top of a car , but the chopper was not fooled , resolving instead to land on flat ground nearby .

With its ability to avoid obstacles in flight , the system has more in common with autonomous SUVs that maneuver through rough terrain than high - flying remote - controlled flying drones like the Global Hawk .
Like many military umanned aerial vehicles , the Global Hawk is fixed - wing , and avoids obstacles by simply flying where there are n't any – at 65,000 feet .
" There are n't a lot of autonomous helicopters , " Singh observes .
The army recently scrapped its order of Northrop Grumman 's remote - controlled MQ - 8 Fire Scout in favor of the fixed - wing RQ - 7 Shadow .

With the cancellation of Future Combat Systems – the military 's plan to roboticize the military by 2020 – it 's tough to say what the future of autonomous helos looks like .
But a defining moment in robo-choppers appears to have been reached last month in Mesa .

Image caption Bribes are required for everything from healthcare to passports
Corruption in Afghanistan has doubled in the two years since 2007 , according to a survey by anti-corruption charity Integrity Watch .
Afghans paid nearly $ 1bn ( £ 658 m ) in bribes in 2009 , with almost a third of those surveyed saying they had had to pay a bribe to obtain a public service .
More than half said state corruption was fuelling the Taliban 's growth .
The average cost of a bribe was $ 180 , which can be many months salary in one of the poorest countries in the world .
Bribes are required for everything from access to healthcare and education , to obtaining a passport or identity card .
The police and the judiciary are viewed as most corrupt by the 6,500 people surveyed .
Report author Lorenzo Delesgues said : " It reduces the legitimacy of the state , it gives more legitimacy to the Taliban .
More than half of the respondents think that the Taliban are gaining ground because of corruption of the Afghan state . "
But despite the insurgents capitalising on government corruption , the vast majority of people in the country looked towards the president and other state institutions to bring it to an end .
And Afghans are just as concerned about corruption in their country as the international community .
The survey says that bribery is not part of Afghan culture , and that 90 % of respondents said they felt guilty when paying a bribe .
Ruminants release methane because of the peculiar way they digest their food .
Inside a cow ’s foregut , which can contain more than 200 pounds of grass at any given time , fermentation of the food leads to the release of hydrogen , a byproduct that would slow down the fermentation .
Microbes known as methanogens help the ruminants get rid of the excess hydrogen by producing methane gases that the animals release into the atmosphere .
In other animals known as hindgut fermenters , including humans  in which food is fermented after going through their stomachs  methane is sometimes released through flatulence , a fact that , Mr. Klieve said , has led to misunderstanding about his work

“ We ’ve had to put up with that all the time , ” Mr. Klieve said .
“ It comes from the front end !
In the cow , it comes from the front end .
But if you ’re a hindgut fermenter , it goes the other way . ”
Leading a visitor through the campus here , which is part of the University of Queensland and is about 60 miles west of Brisbane , the state capital , Mr. Klieve explained his interest in kangaroos .
Like cattle , kangaroos are also foregut fermenters .
But instead of relying on methanogens to get rid of the unwanted hydrogen , kangaroos use different microbes that reduce hydrogen by producing not methane , but harmless acetic acids , the basis of vinegar .
Could the microbes in the kangaroos be transplanted into cows ?
Could the right environment be created in cow stomachs so that the good microbes would outcompete the methanogens ?
“ If we can answer those questions , we ’re moving toward being able to get it so that these animals are not producing methane , ” Mr. Klieve said .
One expert says oil is affecting the natural habitat for many species .

BURAS , La. 
As BP made progress containing the Gulf of Mexico oil spill over the weekend , the number of birds hobbled by the oil increased at an alarming rate , indicating the oil is spreading farther into sensitive marshlands .
The Fort Jackson Oiled Wildlife Rehabilitation Center here has treated 203 oiled birds , many brown pelicans , since the center opened six weeks ago .
Of those , 110 have arrived since Friday , said Jay Holcomb , executive director for the International Bird Rescue Research Center , one of two groups tasked with cleaning the ailing birds .
At least 75 oiled birds across the Gulf Coast have died , according to statistics compiled by the Coast Guard 's Unified Command .
Animal rehabilitation groups and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have also rescued 28 oiled sea turtles .
" This really increases the urgency of efforts to shut off the leak , " Holcomb said .
Admiral Thad Allen , the federal incident commander , said Sunday that BP had made some progress toward containing the leak , but added that even after the spill is contained , oil will remain in the Gulf " well into the fall . "
PHOTOS : Animals , fish drenched by oil DOLPHINS : Deaths investigated by environmental officials CEO : BP chief says he wo n't quit over Gulf spill " This is a siege that is going to go on for a long time .
We are spread from south central Louisiana over to Port Saint Joe , Florida , " Allen said Sunday on CBS ' Face the Nation .
" It is not going to end soon . "
A cap and siphon system installed last week over the ruptured Deepwater Horizon well is now capturing about 420,000 gallons of oil a day , BP officials say .
Scientists have estimated that 500,000 to 1 million gallons of oil a day are gushing from the well .
The gusher will not stop until BP completes drilling a relief well , can divert the oil and plug the broken well with cement , Allen said .
Meanwhile , technicians at the bird rehabilitation center spend up to an hour cleaning each bird , first rubbing it with vegetable or canola oil to break up the crude oil , then washing them with warm water and detergent .
The inside of the bird 's beak and gullet must be scrubbed , too , Holcomb says .
Typically , as many as half the birds die while in captivity , although the survival in this spill appears to be higher , he says .
Seeing the oiled birds is " very heartbreaking , " says Doug Inkley , senior scientist for the National Wildlife Federation , but he 's troubled most by what is n't visible .
" The vast majority of impacts to fish and wildlife you will never see because it 's occurring under water . "

Juristen brauchen Nachhilfe in Sachen Internet Silvio Duwe
Die Internet - Enquete beschäftigt sich mit den Auswirkungen der Digitalisierung auf die Gesellschaft
In einer Expertenanhörung beschäftigte sich die Enquete Internet und digitale Gesellschaft mit dem Zusammenhang zwischen Datenschutz und Wachstum der Internetwirtschaft , der Regulierung des Internet und der Frage , warum Gerichte mitunter zu seltsamen Urteilen kommen , wenn es um Vorgänge im Netz geht : das dynamische Netz passe nicht zu Juristen , die im Kern statisch denken .
Diese Ansicht äußerte mit Thomas Hoeren ausgerechnet der einzige Richter in der Expertenrunde .
Begonnen jedoch hat die Anhörung mit einem Abgesang auf den Datenschutz , angestimmt von den Wirtschaftsvertretern in der Runde .
Unterschiede gab es dabei jedoch in der Lautstärke : Peter Bisa , Geschäftsführer des Beratungsunternehmens
Tactum sagte , Deutschland sei beim Datenschutzniveau weltweit an der Spitze , weshalb man die Gesetze nicht weiter verschärfen , sondern vielmehr zu einem Exportschlager nach dem Motto " Security made in Germany " machen sollte .
Die illegale Weitergabe von Daten könne ohnehin nicht verhindert werden : " Es ist auch verboten , eine Bank zu berauben , und trotzdem passiert es " , so Bisa .
Der Xing - Gründer Lars Hinrichs hingegen sieht die hiesigen Datenschutzbestimmungen als Grund dafür , warum europäische Firmen weit abgeschlagen hinter Unternehmen wie Google und Facebook liegen würden .
Gerade das von Datenschützern immer wieder geforderte Opt - In - Verfahren für die Nutzung und Weitergabe von Daten ist Hinrichs ein Dorn im Auge .
Wenn der Nutzer jedes Mal um Erlaubnis gefragt werden müsse , führe das dazu , dass Europa noch weiter abgehangen wird , so Hinrichs , der ebenfalls forderte , dass die Politik " Viagra für Unternehmer " bereitstellen müsse .
So wie der Zug für eine europäische Suchmaschine schon lange abgefahren sei , ist auch der Zug des Glaubens an die Privatsphäre abgefahren , meint Hinrichs , dessen Firma Cinco Capital unter anderem auch in Facebook investiert hart .
Informatikprofessor Wolfgang Coy sprach sich dagegen für eine Verbesserung des Datenschutzes aus .
Nachholbedarf sieht er vor allem bei der Aufklärung zu diesem Thema , aber auch beim Arbeitnehmerdatenschutz .
Der Besitz und die Nutzung von Netzen in Betrieben seien klar voneinander getrennt .
Dies dürfe jedoch nicht dazu führen , dass Arbeitnehmer beliebig kontrolliert werden .
Coy regte zudem an , den Datenschutz als technisches Qualitätskriterium zu begreifen .
Der Professor findet es problematisch , dass Datenschutz als ökonomisches Problem begriffen wird .
Die Menschen hätten ein Recht auf angemessenen Datenschutz , so Coy .
" Machen Sie keine Gesetze "
Thomas Hoeren machte gleich zu Beginn seiner Ausführungen mit einem für Juristen ungewöhnlichen Wunsch auf sich aufmerksam :
Es sei gefährlich , Gesetze zu machen , die Selbstregulierung sei besser .
In der letzten Zeit habe es viele Gesetze gegeben , die nicht nur inhaltlich problematisch , sondern auch formal unbrauchbar waren .
Als Beispiel führte Hoeren das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz , das Fernabsatzrecht und den Arbeitnehmerdatenschutz , " diese ganzen Katastrophen " , an .
Stattdessen sollten sie mehr auf die Justiz vertrauen , die " ist besser als man denkt " , sagte Hoeren .
Reguliert werden solle , wenn überhaupt , dann auf der Basis der Informationsfreiheit : " Wenn man Beschränkungen der Informationsfreiheit zu Gunsten von Monopolen an Wissen macht , dann müssen wir das als Ausnahme betrachten und dann auch ganz eng auslegen und nur mit besonderer Rechtfertigung gibt es eine Herrschaft an Information . "
Das Urheberrecht in seiner jetzigen Form sei " verhunzt " , so Hoeren .
Mittlerweile sei er derart resigniert , dass er sich sage , " wir müssen die ganzen Macher , die Burdas dieser Welt machen lassen , und dann lassen wir das ganze System explodieren " .
Die Diskussion um das Urheberrecht sei " lobbyistisch völlig verkleistert " , unabhängige Wissenschaftler würden von den Ministerien gar nicht mehr gefragt , weil sie aufgrund ihrer Unabhängigkeit eine Gefahr seien .
Vielmehr seien immer wieder dieselben Lobbyisten an den Diskussionen über Gesetzesinitiativen beteiligt .
Auch der Informationswissenschaftler Rainer Kuhlen sprach sich dafür aus , das Wissen als ein Allgemeingut wie Luft und Wasser zu betrachten .
Es müsse eine Kommerzialisierung entwickelt werden , die nicht auf Verknappung beruhe .
Laut Kuhlen wird der Markt den Umgang mit Wissen und Informationen nicht selbst regeln können .
Zudem sprach er sich gegen Softwarepatente aus , diese seien nicht nur eine erhebliche Bedrohung für freie Software , sondern auch für die Entwicklung der Wirtschaft .
Hoeren nutzte die Anhörung , um seine Richterkollegen zu mahnen , sich stärker mit dem Netz auseinanderzusetzen .
Die Eigendynamik des Netzes müsse bewahrt werden , jedoch sei genau diese Dynamik für eher statisch ausgerichtete Juristen ein Problem .
Man müsste mit dem Landgericht Hamburg in eine Diskussion über Medienkompetenz einsteigen , so der Professor für Medienrecht .
Hoeren betonte jedoch , dass er kein Problem mit seinen Hamburger Kollegen habe , die seien fachlich gut , würden aber von findigen Anwälten missbraucht , die die Regelung des fliegenden Gerichtsstandes ausnutzen .
Das eigentliche Problem der Hamburger sei der Bundesgerichtshof in Karlsruhe , der in Fragen des Haftungsrechtes extrem europarechtswidrig argumentiere und deshalb bereits vom High Court in London kritisiert worden sei .
Hoeren erklärte , es gebe eine klare EU - Richtlinie , wonach ein Intermediär , also beispielsweise ein Forenbetreiber , nur dann hafte , wenn er Kenntnis von einem Rechtsverstoß hat .
Der Bundesgerichtshof habe sich " aus einer gewissen Arroganz heraus " von dieser EU - Richtlinie verabschiedet , und ein eigenes Haftungsmodell entwickelt .
Dieses sei von den Hamburgern nur auf die Spitze getrieben worden , indem sie es gnadenlos anwendeten bis hin zu der scharfen
These , es gebe Geschäftsmodelle im Internet , die per se böse seien .
Ein weiteres Problem hat Hoeren im Verbraucherrecht ausgemacht : Während sich Zivilgerichte bei Abofallen häufig auf die Seite der Verbraucher schlagen würden , verweigerten sich die Strafgerichte systematisch .
So kann die letzte Sitzung der Enquete vor der Sommerpause auch als Mahnung an die Abgeordneten verstanden werden , künftig mehr Sachverstand und weniger Klientelpolitik in ihre Arbeit einzubringen .
Im Bezug auf das ACTA - Abkommen appellierte Hoeren an die Politiker , sich in das laufende Verfahren einzubringen , denn was dort geschehe , sei , unabhängig davon , wie man zu den Inhalten stehe , auch ein klarer Verstoß gegen die deutsche Souveränität .

For the last couple of decades , women have been treated as second - class filmgoers .
The plexes have been dominated by explosions , chases , slashings , Superheroics , gross - out gags and other delights tailored to the tastes of the adolescent male and his overgrown counterpart .
Now , the tables have been turned by a single franchise .
The Twilight films do n't just attract audiences that are 80 % female .
They give vent to passions so exclusively girlish that their intensity baffles mere males .
Yet on its first night out , The Twilight Saga : Eclipse ensconced itself in more American cinemas than any other film has ever managed to .
The $ 68 m ( £ 45 m ) it took in the process made it the biggest Wednesday opener of all time .
This also made it the most successful opener on any day of the week , apart from just one other film .
That happened to be The Twilight Saga : New Moon .
In the cinemas , then , a great triumph for women is clearly being won .
Just how much good it 's doing them is more doubtful .
The spell that Twilight casts over Twihard poppets and even their full - grown Twimoms cannot be assumed to be entirely benign .
Eclipse finds its 18 - year - old heroine Bella as insecure and uncertain of her place in the world as many another troubled teen .
Time perhaps for her to get a grip on her life and forge a purposeful path for herself .
Perhaps she could sail round the world single - handed , set up a dotcom business or at least get on with her homework .
Not Bella .
Instead of sorting herself out , she opts for escape to a parallel universe .
There , she 'll be able to join a coterie who'll be guaranteed to accept her .
She 'll have to be undead , but you can't have everything .
The rescuer who'll whisk her away from the challenges of reality will , of course , be a man .
Actually , Edward 's a vampire , but no matter , he 's incredibly good - looking .
He may be a dangerous dude , but a woman 's love can tame him .
Anyway , Bella 's like totally in love with him , and it's this that justifies the sacrifice of her human life .
After all , Edward has qualities to die for .
His determination to protect Bella 's best interests verges on the abusively controlling .
In particular , unusually for a well - favoured suitor , he 's prepared to contain his carnal urges lest their gratification harm his beloved .
A warm - blooded rival for Bella 's affections is available .
Like Edward , Jacob the werewolf wants only what 's best for her , but he 's not as handsome as Edward , so nuts to him .
In a climactic argument , the two guys debate what 's best for her .
As they decide her future she sleeps between them , the epitome of submissive passivity .
Bella 's fate is n't only dispiriting ; it 's also deceptive .
On the whole , beguilement by a teenage bad boy , however courtly his manner , does n't lead to eternal love ; nor is self - abnegation a reliable route to bliss .
It 's therefore understandable that some have questioned the merits of Twilight 's message for womankind .
Still , the author of the books on which the films are based , Stephenie Meyer , has answered her critics .
Bella , she says , is n't " a negative example of empowerment " .
After all , " The foundation of feminism is this : being able to choose . "
Ultimately , says Meyer , what Bella does is up to Bella .
That ought to be enough to qualify her as a feminist .
This seems to imply that anything a woman does is a feminist act , unless she 's performing it because someone 's put a gun to her head .
I do n't know if this is all that feminism amounts to , but then I 'm only a man .
Some women , it seems , have yet to be convinced .
Whatever adjudication on this point is deemed to be correct , something here seems perplexing .
You can't get away from a strange paradox .
Women are using their regained power over the picturehouse to trash their hard - won independence .
What mysterious creatures they are .
Actor Don Johnson should receive $ 23.2 million in profits from the 1990s show " Nash Bridges , " a Los Angeles jury found Wednesday .
Johnson , who played a San Francisco police inspector in the TV series , sued the production company , Rysher , saying he was owed half the profits from the show because he owned half of its copyright .
The company contended in trial the show has yet to be profitable because it cost so much to make .
In their verdict , jurors recognized Johnson 's ownership of half of the series and ordered the production company to cut the actor a check for profits they determined had accrued so far .
During the trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court , the now 60 - year - old actor recounted for jurors his rise to stardom and said he was able to negotiate a favorable contract because of his success as the lead star of " Miami Vice . "
An attorney for Rysher accused the actor of trying to change the terms of his contract because of his foundering career since his Nash Bridges days and questioned why Johnson had waited until almost a decade after the show 's end to bring the lawsuit .

Savage Love Religious Reason
I 'm a straight male college student in a relationship , which had been going great .
The only incongruity was that , for a religious reason , I do n't want to have penetrative vaginal sex before marriage .
I 'm up for anything else — I would eat her out , piss on her , whatever else — but not vaginal sex .
I made this clear at the beginning .
My girlfriend started bringing up how she wanted to have " actual " sex .
I told her , " I love you , and if you need to fuck other guys , go for it . "
To my relief , she was offended by the suggestion .
A week later , she confessed that she had slept with someone .
I feel like I can't trust her now , and I can't bring myself to sleep in her bed anymore .
I feel like a hypocrite , since I brought up the idea of her sleeping with someone else in the first place .
But I was unprepared for the reality , since she berated me for making the proposal at all .
Still , I told her to do this .
She regrets the hookup .
I do n't know if I 'm even asking for advice .
I just wonder if I 'm acting childishly .
Wishing Ancillary Fucking Felt Less Emotionally Ruinous
Your dilemma is interesting , WAFFLER , but you know what I 'm more interested in ?
I 'd really be interested in finding out which particular faith tradition frowns on penetrative vaginal intercourse before marriage but smiles on eating pussy and piss scenes and okays women having vaginal intercourse before marriage so long as they 're having it with guys they do n't intend to marry .
That sounds like a church I 'd like to visit .
Hell , that sounds like a church I should be tithing to .
Look , WAFFLER , doing everything - but - sticking - your - dick - in for religious reasons is deeply silly .
If you 're going to be in a sexual relationship , be in a sexual relationship .
I promise you that any God who frowns on fucking - pussy - before - marriage also frowns on piss - play - before - marriage and eating - pussy - before - marriage .
As for your dilemma , WAFFLER , either you need to find a girlfriend who wants what you want — or does n't want what you do n't want — or you need to stop playing bullshit games and start fucking the girl you 've got .
To say that I have recently been bored at work is a gross understatement .
I have turned it into an opportunity to read all the archived Savage Love columns I can find on the internet , which has led me to three questions :
1 . Your advice has always been sassy and matter - of - fact , but it seems to me that your advice is becoming less acidic as time passes .
How has your attitude toward the sex - advice business changed over the years ?
2 . Why do n't women brag about their clit size ?
3 . Are you still into Ashton Kutcher or do you have a new fantasy flame ?
Your Devoted Reader
1 . I get a lot of mail from people telling me I 've changed .
Half write to tell me that I 've become an insufferably bitchy sacky twatty cunt prick , and half tell me I 've gone soft , I 'm too nice , I 've lost my edge , etc .
Not sure what to make of that .
2. Clits are n't inserted into anything — not typically — so a big clit does n't earn a woman any bragging rights .
And a small clit , harder to locate and harder to stimulate , is nothing to brag about either .
And while the clit — all of it , not just the exposed part — is central to a woman 's sexual pleasure , it 's not the showiest part of a woman 's package .
That would be the labia .
And it 's not the part a man is most interested in .
That would be the vagina .
So while the clit is hugely important to her , it 's not necessarily all that important to him .
3 . I still admire Ashton Kutcher 's work ethic — the man is an acting , producing , tweeting machine — but my crush on Ashton evaporated halfway through the first episode of Punk'd .
My current celebrity crush is Bill Hader as Stefon on SNL's " Weekend Update . "
I have recently started dating a sexually adventurous man .
He is the first person to successfully fist me , and it 's fantastic .
When I orgasm , I squirt .
Lots .
Afterward , the sheets are soaked and I 'm in a puddle .
We 've put towels down , but the sheer volume of liquid soaks through them .
Without towels , it soaks all the way through to the mattress .
I 'm not super - pleased about ruining my mattress , and the postcoital sleeping on very wet sheets is not ideal .
I do n't really want to sleep on a plastic - wrapped mattress and change my sheets every time we have sex .
Does anything exist that 's super - absorbent that I could put down during sex , or even something that might go under the sheets to at least protect the bed ?
Wasting Endless Towels
The bed is a nice place to sleep , a good place to read , and an obvious place to fuck .
But you can have sex elsewhere , WET , and you can acquire just - for - fucking furniture / furnishings without going to hell with the vaginal - before - marriage crowd .
Go to a sporting - goods store and pick up a large , folding wrestling mat .
Store it under the bed , WET , and when your sexy time involves fisting — and hopefully you 're not fisting every time you have sex — GET OUT OF BED , pull the mat out , throw some towels down , and fist and squirt to your heart 's content .
Then when it is all over — all over the towels , the mat , the floor — you 'll be able to crawl back into your warm , dry , comfortable bed .
HEY , EVERYBODY : Jason Robinson is — was — the football coach at Mandarin High School in Duval County , Florida .
He was fired last month for sending " adult - oriented pictures " to a student .
Robinson did n't send the pictures to one of his students , but to a 20 - year - old college student who is his girlfriend .
The mother of Robinson 's girlfriend found the pictures on her daughter 's phone and forwarded them to the principal of the school where Robinson worked and scores of other people .
" We hold our teachers to a higher standard , " principal Donna Richardson told reporters .
" They 're in front of our students .
They 're talking with our students .
They 're teaching our students how to become good characters . "
This is sex-negative bullshit .
Robinson is a consenting adult ; Robinson 's girlfriend is a consenting adult .
And what consenting adults do on their own time — and with their own cell phones — is no one 's business but their own .
Savage Love readers stuck up for Constance McMillen after she was victimized by the homophobic morons who run her high school .
Now we need to stick up for a straight high - school coach being victimized by the sexphobic morons who run his .
Send an e-mail to Donna Richardson at richardsod@duvalschools.org .
Let Richardson know that she is in the wrong .
And let others know to let her know .
AND : Apparently , Steve Jobs is n't such a prude after all .

Why Spoon . Net Will Change The Way You Work and Develop
Last week , a friend and fellow developer , Nik from the very good dreamleaf.co.uk , introduced me to a new website called Spoon.net , and I have not been this impressed with a website or application for a very long time .
Spoon.net is a website that essentially lets you run a very large selection of useful applications direct from the browser without the need to install them , the only thing you do need is a firefox plugin .
The benefits of this are numerous , but if you 're a web designer or developer , there is one benefit above all others :
The ability to run the demon browser ( otherwise known as IE6 ) without needing an XP virtual machine or a program such as multiple IEs installed on your computer .
All it takes is around a minute of buffering time and you have a fully fledged IE6 running on your computer alongside your normal browser .
Cross browser testing suddenly got a lot more convenient .
It has a good selection of newer browsers too , with IE8 , various Firefox incarnations and the latest Safari , Chrome and Opera .
I have found that spoon has helped me save considerable time and increase productivity of both myself and my machines ( without having the drain of a virtual machine running ) considerably .
Applications aplenty on Spoon
Its not just browsers that you can benefit from though , there are all kinds of applications , amongst the most useful Skype , VLC , Open Office and Paint .
Net to name a handful .
The ultimate dream of many where the browser is all the user needs and the days of a fat , bloated operating system disappear have gotten one step closer with the advent of spoon.net , and I 'm sure there will be other sites that will follow in its rather excellent stead .
I thought this well worth sharing with everyone in the battle to make dealing with IE6 that little bit easier , and when we finally do not have to concern ourselves with it any longer , we can enjoy many of the other benefits that Spoon provides .
Theres only one small caveat ;
At the moment it is not available for Linux users or for Mac so chalk up one for the Windows crowd , I am sure albeit temporarily .
One closing thought , I 've used the word spoon enough times during this post that I think any google adsense ads on this page could have some interesting and varied content , time will tell :)
The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in an awesome series by Douglas Adams .
I really enjoyed the fourth book in the trilogy , mostly because it was the fourth book in a trilogy .... anyway , as the story goes , long ago there was a group of super - intelligent beings .
They wanted to know the Ultimate Answer to the Universe .
So they built this supercomputer called Deep Thought and it took 7.5 million years to calculate the answer .
The answer is 42 , and that 's all Deep Thought had to say about it .
It was unable to produce the Ultimate Question to the Universe .
So an even more powerful computer was built , and that was the Planet Earth .
These pan-dimensional creators of both Deep Thought and the Earth took the form of mice .
Humans are actually a race alien to Earth that crash - landed here and made the process take longer than it needed to .
After 8 million years , 5 minutes before the answer was completed , Vogons ( a nasty alien race ) destroyed Earth so they could have a better superhighway through hyperspace .
But that 's not the end of the story .
Arthur Dent , the only surviving human from Earth , has the Ultimate Question subconsciously stored in his mind .
So after escaping Earth 's destruction and embarking on trippy adventures spanning the universe and including time travel to the end of the universe ( specifically to a restaurant where you can watch the universe end in glorious fashion over and over again ) , he wound up traveling back in time to when the Golgafrinchons ( our ancestors ) crash - landed on Earth .
The subconscious question was drawn out of him by drawing random Scrabble tiles .
The message said " What do you get if you multiply six by nine ? "
The answer is obviously 54 , but Deep Thought 's answer was 42 .
Dent sees this and says , " I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe . "
Never mind that the Scrabble message included 3 Y's , and an ordinary game of Scrabble only includes 2 .
Maybe he drew a blank .
Or maybe it does n't really matter .
People have tried to read way too much into this .
It 's just Adams being funny , and 42 seemed like the funniest two - digit number he could think of .
The only really plausible hypothesis that I 've seen has to do with Base 13 , which means you take any number in the tens place , multiply by 13 instead of 10 ( hence base 13 ) , and add to that whatever is in the ones place .
So look at the Deep Thought answer : 42 .
Take 4 X 13 and that 's 52 , add two and that 's 54 .
And 9 X 6 actually is 54 .
Adams heard this theory and said , " I may be a sorry case , but I do n't write jokes in Base 13 . "
Anyway , you should read these books .
They are incredible and may change your life .
Ten years ago , Brazilian bioscience was transformed by a bold initiative .
Scientists and the government must develop and extend the progress that has resulted .
In May 1997 , a pair of Brazilian scientists spent a weekend in the country discussing a bold idea .
José Fernando Perez , the science director at the São Paulo Research Foundation ( FAPESP ) , a state - funded agency and one of Brazil 's leading research sponsors , had been looking for game - changing research initiatives .
Biologist Fernando Reinach , one of his advisers , had a sufficiently adventurous plan : kick - start biotechnology research throughout Brazil by sequencing a genome .
For many risk - averse scientists in the old guard , who were acutely aware of how far the country lagged behind the rest of the world in biotechnology , this plan seemed overly ambitious .
But the duo pushed ahead to build the capacity for genomics and bioinformatics that Brazil lacked , quickly organizing a team to conduct the project and then settling on a bacterium to sequence .
FAPESP invested the equivalent of US $ 12 million , largely dedicated to sequencers , computers and reagents , while the team brought together and trained researchers from a range of fields to develop a broad and long - lasting set of skills and knowledge .
On 13 July 2000 that effort paid off when the team , by then comprising more than 100 researchers in 35 Brazilian labs , published the genetic code for the citrus pathogen Xylella fastidiosa in an article featured on the cover of Nature ( A. J. G. Simpson et al. Nature 406 , 151–157 ; 2000 ) .
Ten years later , the fruits of that project keep coming .
Before its Xylella paper had even come out , for example , the network was busy sequencing another citrus pathogen while taking its first stab at the complex sugarcane genome and contributing to the international Human Cancer Genome Project .
The same tools and expertise were repackaged for sugarcane research in Brazil 's first major agricultural biotechnology enterprises : Allelyx ( Xylella in reverse ) , which focused on genomics , and CanaVialis , which made innovations in conventional sugarcane breeding .
The US - based biotechnology company Monsanto purchased both companies for US $ 290 million in 2008 , and is now running its own sugarcane research centre in Campinas , São Paulo , where the companies were headquartered .
Brazilian biotechnology has matured to the point at which its scientists are players on the international stage .
And FAPESP is still promoting big ideas , including a new programme to pump money into a broad portfolio of bioenergy research even as the Ministry of Science and Technology constructs a bioethanol research centre ; both initiatives seek to build on Brazil 's lead in this field .
FAPESP is also working to overcome one of the biggest impediments to progress — a lack of doctoral researchers — by encouraging scientists to fill the gaps with young stars from the United States and Europe , part of a broader effort to internationalize Brazilian science .
All of this is good , but more efforts are needed in the same vein — more attitude , more risk - taking and more entrepreneurialism that puts public science into private practice , an area in which Brazil continues to lag .
Universities and funding agencies must continue to advance technology - transfer programmes , and the government must streamline regulations that slow even simple activities such as purchasing scientific equipment from abroad .
But if there is anything holding Brazil back , it is the same unjustified fear of failure that the country overcame ten years ago with Xylella .
Although institutions can promote , fund and reward bold thinking , it is worth noting that Xylella was not simply a bricks - and - mortar research centre run by a foundation , but a science project .
Ultimately the task of promoting Brazilian biotechnology comes down to the science , and it will be up to individual scientists to accept the challenge and expand their research horizons .
Perhaps more than anything , Xylella demonstrates the benefits of aiming high .
Scientists undertook a major project , executed it with precision and published the results in English in a major international journal .
The results were broadcast by mainstream media outlets worldwide , and Perez believes that this singular — and unexpected — outcome even helped to change Brazilian science 's relationship with the Brazilian media .
Xylella helped to change Brazil 's perception of itself , its own capabilities and its place in the world of science .

Here 's a new chart ( click to enlarge ) with updated data from the Association of American Medical Colleges on medical school acceptance rates for Asians ( data here ) , whites ( data ) , Hispanics ( data ) and blacks ( data ) during the period 2007 - 2009 , based on various combinations of MCAT scores ( 24 - 26 and 27 - 29 ) and GPAs ( from 3.00 to 3.59 ) .
For example , for applicants with an MCAT score between 24 - 26 and a GPA between 3.00 and 3.19 , only 1 out of every 25 Asian applicants was accepted , compared to about one out of every 11 white applicants , one of out every three Hispanics , and more than half of black applicants with those same credentials .

Sue Lowden declined to say whether private companies should be forced to abide by the Civil Rights Act .
Lowden ducks civil rights question
Nevada Senate GOP candidate Sue Lowden again refused Wednesday to take a position on whether the landmark Civil Rights
Act should extend into private businesses , an issue that has already rocked the Senate campaign of Republican Rand Paul in Kentucky .
Speaking on a Las Vegas political talk show , Lowden repeatedly declined to discuss her views on whether private companies should be forced to abide by the anti-discrimination law — and she later sought to get ahead of the fallout by issuing a statement saying she supports the law .

Her comments came a week after Paul ignited a political firestorm by suggesting that the law ’s requirement that private businesses can’t discriminate against minorities violates constitutional rights to free speech .
Paul , who said he abhors racism , fiercely sought to contain the political damage by walking back his comment and stating his strong support for the 1964 law .
But after declining to comment to POLITICO about the issue , Lowden would not discuss her views Wednesday during the televised interview , saying she was “ more interested in what we ’re doing here in Nevada . ”
“ It ’s a simple question , but it ’s a ‘ gotcha ’ question , ” Lowden , a former state Republican Party chairwoman , said on the show “ Face to Face . ”
“ Frankly , I would n't even know Rand Paul if I saw him on TV . "
Jon Ralston , the host of the show , said he was n’t asking about Paul but wanted to know what her views were on the matter .
“ Do you think the Civil Rights Act should apply to private businesses ? ” Ralston asked .
“ I think you want to change the subject from what ’s really happening here , ” Lowden said .
“ Nobody ’s asking that question , Jon . ”
“ So you ’re not going to answer it ? ” Ralston asked .
“ No , no , ” Lowden said .
After leaving the set , Lowden sent Ralston a statement clarifying her position and said she supports “ all aspects ” of the law .
“ After reviewing the comments and news stories from Kentucky , I want voters to know that I strongly support all aspects of the Civil Rights Act , just as I strongly believe it applies to my private business and all others , ” she said in a statement .
“ My focus has been on campaigning here in Nevada , and therefore I have not paid close attention to races outside of our state . ”
Lowden is in the middle of a tight race for her party ’s nomination in the June 8 primary , battling with Sharron Angle , a tea party favorite who served in the state Assembly , and Las Vegas businessman Danny Tarkanian for the right to take on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) in the fall .
Ralston ’s comments were spurred by a POLITICO article published Monday that quoted Lowden dodging the same question about the Civil Rights Act .
“ You ca n’t resist this , can you ?
I have no idea what another candidate says , ” Lowden told POLITICO on Friday , referring to Paul .
In a follow - up question , Lowden was asked whether she had any concerns about the law ’s reach into private business , but she said , “ I ’m going , thank you , ” and hung up the phone .
Asked by Ralston about the episode , Lowden denied hanging up on a POLITICO reporter — and said she hoped that a recording of the call would be released .
But the interview with Lowden , which occurred via a POLITICO reporter ’s cell phone , was not recorded .
For far too long white Americans have been told that diversity is something beneficial to their existence .
Statistics prove that the opposite is true .
New Hampshire residents must seek to preserve their racial identity if we want future generations to have to possibility to live in such a great state .
Affirmative action , illegal and legal non-white immigration , anti-white public school systems , and an anti-white media have done much damage to the United States of America and especially New Hampshire .
It is time for white people in New Hampshire and across the country to take a stand .
We are only 8 percent of the world 's population and we need our own homeland , just like any other non-white group of people deserve their own homeland .
Had Horton been white , the Republicans still would have used the ad .
But Horton was black and the ad was powerfully effective -- so effective that it and Dukakis 's stupid answer about opposing the death penalty even if his wife were murdered destroyed the Democrats in 1988 -- the Democrats screamed racism at the top of their lungs and their accomplices in the media have forever agreed .
Willie Horton = racism .
Nonsense .
The ad worked .
It was powerful .
It was the truth .
That 's why the Democrats screamed racism so loud .
It was the only way to stop the GOP from going this direction again .
They know the GOP lives in perpetual quixotic quest for the day it gets a significant share of the black vote .
Now we have King Samir Shabazz .
He showed up at a polling location in Pennsylvania and intimidated voters going into the polls .
The Justice Department pursued the case and , having received a verdict it the government 's favor , Obama 's Attorney General Eric Holder stopped pursuing the New Black Panthers .
Video has subsequently come out of King Samir Shabazz encouraging the murder of white children .
Republican candidates nationwide should seize on this issue .
The Democrats are giving a pass to radicals who advocate killing white kids in the name of racial justice and who try to block voters from the polls .
Dear Mr. Lincoln
We Colored People have taken a vote and decided that we do n’t cotton to that whole emancipation thing .
Freedom means having to work for real , think for ourselves , and take consequences along with the rewards .
That is just far too much to ask of us Colored People and we demand that it stop !
In fact we held a big meeting and took a vote in Kansas City this week .
We voted to condemn a political revival of that old abolitionist spirit called the ‘ tea party movement ’ .
The tea party position to “ end the bailouts ” for example is just silly .
Bailouts are just big money welfare and is n’t that what we want all Coloreds to strive for ?
What kind of racist would want to end big money welfare ?
What they need to do is start handing the bail outs directly to us coloreds !
Of course , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the only responsible party that should be granted the right to disperse the funds .
And the ridiculous idea of “ reduce[ing ] the size and intrusiveness of government . ”
What kind of massa would ever not want to control my life ?
As Coloreds we must have somebody care for us otherwise we would be on our own , have to think for ourselves and make decisions !
The racist tea parties also demand that the government “ stop the out of control spending . ”
Again , they directly target Colored People .
That means we Colored People would have to compete for jobs like everybody else and that is just not right .
Perhaps the most racist point of all in the tea parties is their demand that government “ stop raising our taxes . ”
That is outrageous !
How will we Colored People ever get a wide screen TV in every room if non-coloreds get to keep what they earn ?
Totally racist !
The tea party expects coloreds to be productive members of society ?
Mr. Lincoln , you were the greatest racist ever .
We had a great gig .
Three squares , room and board , all our decisions made by the massa in the house .
Please repeal the 13th and 14th Amendments and let us get back to where we belong .
Sincerely
Precious Ben Jealous , Tom ’s Nephew National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Head Colored Person
Yesterday the NAACP condemned the teabaggers ' " explicitly racist behavior , " while Glenn Beck , their spiritual leader , amped up his campaign to trivialize and denigrate both Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King by holding a racist rally in Washington on August 28 , the anniversary of King 's historic " I Have a Dream " speech .
The resolution , which was submitted by the NAACP 's Kansas City branch points out that teabaggers have " displayed signs and posters intended to degrade people of color generally and President Barack Obama specifically " and calls " the racist elements " within the tea party " a threat to progress . "
It calls on " the leadership and members of the tea party to recognize the historic and present racist factions within it and to repudiate those factions .
" Good luck with that .
As anyone who 's every attended a teabagger event well knows , divisiveness in general and racism in particular are the very organizing principles around the " movement . "
They can't very well go out and try to gin all that faux grassroots populism based on bigger bonuses for insurance company CEOs .
At the teabagger rally I went to in Alhambra , the " anchor baby " theme was far more dominant than ever " read the bill .
" And this might be as good a moment as any to bring up Ryan Murdough , both the New Hampshire state chairman of American Third Position and the Republican candidate for the New Hampshire state senate .
Murdough : Like the teabaggers you see on TV , Murdough vociferously denies being a racist .
Really .
Limbaugh and Beck do too .
So does the Republican Party in general .
And their nutroots .
Sarah Palin was tweeting furiously .
And on her Facebook page she wrote , self - righteously , " I am saddened by the NAACP ’s claim that patriotic Americans who stand up for the United States of America ’s Constitutional rights are somehow “ racists . ”
The charge that Tea Party Americans judge people by the color of their skin is false , appalling , and is a regressive and diversionary tactic to change the subject at hand .
" President Reagan called America ’s past racism ' a legacy of evil ' against which we have seen the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights .
He condemned any sort of racism , as all good and decent people do today .
He also called it a ' point of pride for all Americans ' that as a nation , we have successfully struggled to overcome this evil .
Reagan rightly declared that ' there is no room for racism , anti-Semitism , or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country , ' and he warned that we must never go back to the racism of our past . "
I guess the GOP shock troops at the teabagger rally in the photo to the right missed that speech .
Or maybe they do n't consider that racism .
Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh do n't .
Take CNN 's Eric Erickson , for example .
He 's a GOP polemicist embedded with CNN and he had some advice for his party leaders yesterday that was reported to a mainstream audience by Media Matters .
He feels the path to a GOP victory in November is scaring people about how the Black Panthers want to kill white children .
" The Democrats will scream racism , " he wrote .
" Let them .
Republicans are not going to pick up significant black support anyway .
" No racism there , of course .
And speaking of sociopathic right - wing racism , yesterday the House was back from vacation and one of the first bills to pass , HR 4514 , Colonel Charles Young Home Study
Act passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority , 350 - 26 .
All 225 Democrats voted yes , as did 125 Republicans .
The 26 NO votes were from 26 right - wing , racist Republicans , including , notably , notorious and rabid haters like Paul Broun ( R - GA ) , John Campbell ( R- CA ) , John Culberson ( R - TX ) , Virginia Foxx ( R - VA ) , Louie Gohmert ( R - TX ) , Darrell Issa ( R- CA ) , Steve King ( R- IA ) , Jack Kingston ( R- GA ) , Doug Lamborn ( R- CO ) , Randy Neugebauer ( R - TX ) , and Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) .
The entire GOP leadership voted YES , even Boehner and Cantor ( although the leader racist in the leadership , Mike Pence , did n't vote at all .
The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the Colonel Charles Young Home , a National Historic Landmark in Xenia , Ohio , to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the Home as a unit of the National Park System .
( Colonel Charles Young was a distinguished African - American officer in the U.S. Army , a pioneer of techniques in military intelligence , as well as a commander of troops in combat in the Spanish - American War and the Mexican expedition against Pancho Villa . )
Even Mean Jean Schmidt signed on as a co-sponsor .
We 'll just leave it at that .
Was this teabagger screed yesterday by GOP radio propagandist Mark Williams , racist ?
You tell me ; maybe I 'm too sensitive .
He imagines he 's writing a letter to President Lincoln from the head of the NAACP :
Labels : Glenn Beck , GOP racism , Keith Olbermann , NAACP , racism , Sarah Palin , teabaggers
In a stunning development , Aqsa Parvez ’s father and her youngest brother admitted on Tuesday they strangled her in her bedroom .
Muhammad Parvez , 60 , and son Waqas , 29 , pleaded guilty to second - degree murder in the 16 - year - old Mississauga high school student ’s death on the morning of Dec. 10 , 2007 .
But whose bare hands were around the Grade 11 student 's neck remains unknown .
In pleading guilty , neither the father nor the son took sole blame for the murder , admitting only that they both were responsible for causing the neck compressions that led to her death .
Aqsa 's blood was on Muhammad 's hands when he was arrested after he called 911 and confessed to using his hands to murder his youngest daughter , according to the agreed statement filed as an exhibit in a Brampton courtroom .
DNA results also showed Waqas 's DNA was under Aqsa 's right hand finger nails , court was told .
At the time , Aqsa ’s death sent shock waves through the GTA prompting heated debate on the hijab , the challenges of integration for newcomers , and whether or not her death was the GTA ’s first crime of honour or a horrible case of domestic violence .
The young girl ran away twice from home , seeking to have more freedom than she could enjoy living under her father 's rigid rules in a traditional Islamic family , court was told .
Although her father eventually allowed her to wear jeans and shirts to school , instead of her traditional Islamic attire , she was still not permitted to hang out with friends outside the home .
Her father refused to let her speak with friends , especially boys , on the telephone and forbid her from getting a part - time job .
Muhammad also disapproved of , many of her friends and blamed them for his daughter ’s poor marks and failing grades .
Aqsa lived in a bedroom in the basement of their home on Longhorn Trail in Mississauga .
Her bedroom was the only one in the house without a door , Crown prosecutor Sandra Caponecchia told the court , reading from the agreed statement .
The only way for others , including her parents , to get to their room in the basement from inside the house was to walk through Aqsa 's doorless bedroom .
In the days before her death , she told friends her father swore on the Qur'an that he would kill her if she ever ran away again , Caponecchia said .
Aqsa 's mother Anwar Jan and her two other sons , Muhammad Shan and Ahtisham , were in court for the dramatic day 's developments .
In a chilling police interview on the day of Aqsa 's murder , her distraught mother , crying and talking out loud to herself , was recorded as saying she thought her husband was only going to “ break legs and arms , ” but instead “ killed her . ”
“ Oh God , Oh God . . .
Oh my Aqsa , you should have listened , ” Anwar Jan said out loud in a police interview room .
“ Everyone tried to make you understand .
Everyone begged you , but you did not listen . . . ”
She earlier told police in her interview that she advised her husband to let their daughter go , not to kill her .
When she asked him why he killed her , he told her : “ This is my insult .
My community will say you have not been able to control your daughter .
This is my insult .
She is making me naked . ”

She said her husband never said he would kill her .
She told the officer that in her Pakistani culture , if a daughter does n't listen to her parents , she is punished .
“ Either they kill the girl or turn her out of the house , ” she said .
If Aqsa had been living in Pakistan , her husband would have “ killed her there too . . . ”
Aqsa was slain around 7:30 a.m .
Muhammad called 911 just before 8 a.m. and confessed to strangling his daughter .
Waqas was initially charged with obstructing police but then was suddenly arrested six months later and charged with first - degree murder
His arrest came soon after police intercepted a conversation between him and a driver , who worked for the same tow truck company .
In the electronically - recorded conversation , Waqas admitted choking her until she died .
Tow truck driver Steve Warda told police earlier that Waqas asked if he could get him a gun because he was going to kill his sister but his father would take the blame .
Tuesday 's plea means they will be sentenced to automatic term of life in prison .
The father and son were scheduled to stand trial for first - degree murder next January .
Victim - impact statements are expected to be read into the record later on Tuesday .
Few things are less democratic in this magnificent democracy than the Senate practice of the secret hold .
In what is supposed to be the world 's greatest deliberative body , the hold is the informal practice that allows a single senator to anonymously prevent a bill or measure from reaching the floor for consideration .
That 's right — it 's an informal practice .
Look in the Constitution or in the Senate 's own rules and precedents , and you wo n't find any mention of holds .
But it 's become an obstructive instrument of senatorial power , one that some senators are loathe to give up — one that should come to an end .
A few weeks ago , I noted that the Obama administration , reputedly more enlightened than its predecessor on matters of drug policy , is encouraging states to enact gratuitously punitive laws that treat drivers with marijuana metabolites in their urine as if they were drunk .
Since traces of marijuana can be detected in urine long after the drug 's effects have worn off , this policy is just an excuse for sending pot smokers to jail .
I suggested that tests of THC in blood would be a more accurate measure of impairment , comparable to the standard for alcohol .
But as at least one commenter noted , there is an argument for treating drivers under the influence of marijuana less severely than drivers under the influence of alcohol :
They are less of a threat to public safety .
Experiments repeatedly have found that marijuana has a less dramatic impact on driving ability than alcohol does , with the added advantage that pot smokers seem to be more aware of their impairment and therefore tend to compensate for it by slowing down ( whereas drinkers tend to speed up ) .
In the latest study , reported recently in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs , subjects who smoked a joint containing marijuana with about 3 percent THC " decreased their speed [ more than the sober control subjects did ] and failed to show expected practice effects during a distracted drive , " but " no differences were found during the baseline driving segment or collision avoidance scenarios . "
In their book Marijuana Is Safer , which I reviewed in the April issue of Reason , Steve Fox , Mason Tvert , and Paul Armentano cite marijuana 's relatively minor impact on driving ability as a public safety advantage .
To the extent that legalizing pot encourages people to shift from alcohol to marijuana , it could actually produce a net decrease in traffic deaths , contrary to the nightmare scenarios painted by prohibitionists .
Armentano surveys the evidence on marijuana and driving here .

6 The FBI Pulls a Reverse Scarface

The Case :
The Gambino crime family is a Mafia legend .
As one of the notorious " Five Families , " the organization has been a major criminal empire since 1957 , and as a result , they 've been a high priority FBI target for decades .
In 2002 , the Bureau took a major leap forward when they got one of their own to successfully go undercover among the Gambinos .
Posing as Jack Falcone , a 390 - pound jewel thief with a shining personality , a love of great food , a collection of expensive suits and an obligatory diamond pinky - ring , the agent fit right in among a bunch of hardened Italian mobsters .

" Say , that Snooki is a one spicy meat - a - ball .
Amiright , my fellow pisans ? "
The primary target of the operation was Greg DePalma , an aging family capo so terrifyingly batshit that he once took " a power tool to someone 's head " because he suspected that the guy might be stealing from him .
This did not deter Jack , who probably gets 90 percent of his 390 pounds from lugging around an utterly titanic set of balls .
Armed with a blank check from the FBI , Jack lavished DePalma with expensive gifts , from bootleg cigarettes to iPods , most of which were packed full of satellite tracing technology .
The appeal to his apparent love of Apple products made DePalma swoon for his new best friend , to the point that he suggested making a " made man " out of the guy .

Becoming a made man is the Mafia 's highest honor , reserved for its most trusted and loyal members .
Due to the exclusive nature of the mob , it is almost always reserved for those who are of total Italian descent , although some exceptions are made for those who are half Italian .
That 's awesome , considering ...
The Stupidity :
Jack Falcone 's actual name is Joaquin " Jack " Garcia , and he was approximately as Italian as Zinedine Zidane .
In order to infiltrate the Mafia , the Cuban Jack Garcia had to literally adopt a new racial profile , and pull off the act in a room full of dudes who can supposedly guess what part of Italy you come from by smelling your marinara sauce from one hundred yards while blindfolded .
How did he attain such an astounding mastery of Italian - American culture ?
Among other things , by watching hours upon hours of cooking shows .

About two days ago people started talking about Flipboard .
Really talking a lot .
So much so that many people , including me , have found it very hard to try it out .
Just last night I noticed a tweet from the other side of the planet in which the editor of readwriteweb.com commented that he too could n’t try it because Flipboard was over capacity .
This problem should give you an indication of just how interesting a concept Flipboard really is .
In short , Flipboard collects information from your Twitter and Facebook ( other Social Networks may be supported ) feeds and uses it to bring all the links your friends are sharing into your iPad in a Magazine - like layout .
When you think about it , it sounds pretty interesting as you get a much more enticing presentation of the shared information than you do with pretty much any other application or interface I ’ve seen before .
The App collects the articles , posts and photos your friends have shared allowing you to see them in a magazine - like interface that provides the social features you expect on the web such as “ liking ” a specific item or sharing it with your own followers .
I ’ve embedded the demo video to give you an idea of how the application works and what it looks like .
I think that most will agree that is worth getting the free application to try it out in person , when they manage to overcome the capacity issue .
It seems obvious that the folks at Flipboard underestimated the interest their application would draw .
I hope they can iron out the capability issues soon as the concept is nothing short of brilliant , and they are going to have people coming in from all sides to try out the application .

A two - day marathon of almost real - time , personalized ads based on social media requests was so successful that it was causing Internet outages , according to an article on the campaign in AdWeek .
The ' Old Spice Guy , ' actor Isaiah Mustafa , made more than 200 little videos over the course of two days from a studio in Portland -- in a campaign that has not only revitalized the Old Spice brand but which is likely to change the relationship between social media and advertising ongoing .
“ It just gives you a glimpse of where the world is going , ” said Patrick Pichette , CFO of Google -- which owns YouTube , where the ads had their own channel -- during the company 's earnings call .
" In less than three days , the 65 response videos drew more than 5.2 million views on YouTube , " and the brand ’s Twitter followers grew to 48,000 , from 3,000 , reported the New York Times .
The effort involved a team of writers , art directors , producers , editors and social media strategists , Adweek described .
" The social media experts initially identified a crop of popular bloggers in key areas like entertainment ( Perez Hilton ) , technology ( 4chan ) and advertising ( Adweek 's own AdFreak ) , as well as regular YouTube and Facebook commenters .
The social media team scours the Web for comments related to the Old Spice campaign .
They feed ones that are funny or from interesting sources to the creatives , who then determine which make good fodder for humorous videos . "
Videos included a marriage proposal -- by the Old Spice guy , not from him , despite the wishes of hundreds of swooning women .
( The woman in question said yes . )

Old Spice Guy 's first two commercials drew 13 million and 6.2 million viewers , respectively , according to an article in the New York Times .
Even a video on how the first video was made drew more than a million viewers , the Times added .
Some 67 percent of American households are playing video games , according to a new survey from Ipsos MediaCT and video game trade body Entertainment Software Association ( ESA ) .
As part of its annual Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry report , the ESA also reports that American gamers are " more social than ever " , with 62 percent of them playing with oers in person for at least one hour a week .
48 percent of parents play video games with the children at least once a week , too .
The ESA claims that game console - owning parents with children aged under 18 are present whenever their kids purchase / rent a game 93 percent of the time , and that their children receive parental permission before purchasing / renting a game 86 percent of the time .
Those same parents say they always or sometimes monitor the games their kids play 97 percent of the time .
That close attention could be affected by the idea that games are a positive part of their children 's lives , a belief 64 percent of responding parents adhere to .
The report also shares other findings like the average age of game players ( 34 years old ) , the average age of game buyers ( 40 years old ) , the percentage of female game players ( 40 percent ) , and the percentage of all games sold that are rated " E for Everyone " by the ESRB ( 48 percent ) .
" Computer and video games are now available to consumers on every screen from smart phones to computers to flat screen televisions , " says ESA president and CEO Michael D. Gallagher .
" This enables millions of Americans enjoy the immersive storytelling , incredible graphics , and compelling plot lines . "
He adds , " These works of art are a fun and engaging way to bring people together , especially families who are playing video games together now more than ever . "
I think a lot of us have established that “ real woman have curves ” is hurtful to those of us who do n’t have curves .
Here ’s another take on the issue from Huffington Post by Starre Vartan , a writer and blogger .
I checked in with my slighter friends on this one , and they admit to feeling pushed out of the conversation about bodies just because they are more svelte and – true to form for most kind - minded women , they feel badly about making a fuss , since body image and labels always seem to launch a firestorm or controversy .
It ’s true — a lot of us do feel left out of the body image debate because we ’re smaller sized , and we feel like we ca n’t complain because people just shut us up by saying we have the ideal body type ( which is untrue ) .
And even worse , medium and large sized women ( and even skinny women ? ) who repeat the phrase real women are perpetuating the divide , when all of us should be working towards the same goal .
I think ‘ fat acceptance ’ is the wrong way to go ; not because I have a problem with fuller - figured women enjoying and celebrating their bodies ( I truly applaud those who do and those who lead them ! ) but because I do n’t want their happiness and acceptance to come at the cost of other women .
Why do some women have to suffer while others gain ?
I do n’t think fat acceptance is at fault here .
There are plenty of FA bloggers who pretty much deal only with fat people issues and find ways to make themselves feel better without putting down smaller women .
In fact , most FA bloggers I ’ve met are inclusive of skinny women .
It ’s the women who are n’t part of any sort of movement who tend to say stuff like “ real women have curves ” and join Facebook groups like “ Curvy girls are better than skinny girls . ”
When you say things like that , or when you deny that anyone other than larger women can have body image issues , you come across as insecure .
You should n’t need to put down someone else to build yourself up .
But I digress .
Throughout the history of feminism , we ’ve seen groups of women pitted against each other , whether it was the old conflict between Flappers and more traditional ladies in the 1920 ’s , or the newer conflicts between foreign - born nannies and their upper - middle class employers .
The best way forward is to work together of course , and support the idea that ALL bodies are beautiful ( this goes for men too ) .
Starre continues on a very good path .
She has the right idea , and everyone should heed her advice .
Do n’t exclude anyone who sympathizes with you and wants to join the cause !
( For the record , I strive for ethnic diversity in the FYSC tumblr and try to post unPhotoshopped photos of real , healthy skinny women and girls .
Also , I am not white . )
Barack Obama to veto bill that would stop the EPA from implementing cap and trade
Now that Harry Reid has taken the climate change legislation off of the table , and there will be no climate bill this year , Barack Obama is more then likely going to move forward with “ Plan B ” to regulate greenhouse gasses and carbon emissions .
A recent Supreme Court decision has given the EPA the right to regulate greenhouse gasses and as we speak they are beginning to write what amounts to climate change legislation .
Several Democrats from coal producing states are preparing to introduce legislation that would stop the EPA from implementing these rules for two years .
We must not forget that as a candidate Barack Obama promised to bankrupt the coal industry , so it should come as no surprise that Barack Obama is promising to veto this legislation if it makes is to his desk .
This has always been the Obama regime ’s backup plan in case cap and trade legislation failed in the House and Senate and now we are beginning to see “ Plan B ” move forward .
Cap and trade is not dead just because there will be no bill headed towards the president ’s desk .
Cap and trade is alive and well because the government is going to institute it regardless of what the proper political procedure is .
Jay Rockefeller continues to push hard for the Democrats ’ two year suspension of the EPA ’s authority to implement climate change legislation because he believes– rightfully so– that congress should be setting national energy policy and not a federal agency .
The blame goes well beyond Barack Obama on this one , we owe all of this to a disastrous Supreme Court decision handed down by the Roberts ’s court .
None of this would be happening without that decision .
I do n’t see any way that we can stop this from happening but it would be good to see the president act in good faith and sign a two year moratorium on the EPA in regards to climate change .
But that is not going to happen , this is going to be forced down our throats against our will just like everything else that has happened under this president .
And it probably does n’t matter much anyway because there probably is n’t much difference between what the EPA restrictions are going to be and what Barack Obama wants in climate change legislation .
We are screwed either way .
Here comes the national energy tax .
It is disconcerting to say the least that while the congress cannot come to a settlement on this issue using the proper forum of debate that a federal agency is going to be allowed to step right over the congress and implement a policy that congress could not agree on and the president did not sign .

The new measure of poverty assesses household poverty
Eight Indian states account for more poor people than in the 26 poorest African countries combined , a new measure of global poverty has found .
The Indian states , including Bihar , Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal , have 421 million " poor " people , the study found .
This is more than the 410 million poor in the poorest African countries , it said .
The Multidimensional Poverty Index ( MPI ) measures a range of " deprivations " at household levels .
Developed by Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative ( OPHI ) with UN support , it will feature in the upcoming UNDP Human Development Report .
The measure assess a number of " deprivations " in households - from education to health to assets and services .
" The MPI is like a high resolution lens which reveals a vivid spectrum of challenges facing the poorest households , " said OPHI director Dr Sabina Alkire .

At PepsiCo , most of the plots are still weedy and empty .
The weather has been cool and so , gardeners say , has enthusiasm .
Last year when the company first turned over a plot the size of two tennis courts to peppers and tomatoes , 200 of the 1,450 employees here signed up , mailroom workers and midlevel administrators alike .
This year , the volunteers dwindled to about 75 , and many of them have yet to ready their plots .

So on Tuesday , Anu Malhotra from the food services division pulled on her gardening gloves and yanked weeds from small squares of land that were n’t even her own .
“ Corporate strategies had two plots last year , but they were always traveling , so we just kind of took over , ” she said .
At Aveda , which offers on - site massage and organic cafeteria food at its headquarters near Minneapolis , the garden is a chance for its 700 employees to take a break from their desks and take home fresh produce .
Workers pay $ 10 for the season and in return , they get a share of the bounty .
Picking up a hoe is optional , but encouraged .
“ It does seem like work , but it ’s a different kind of work from our regular workday , ” said Peggy Skinner , an employee who pushed to have the garden installed .
Aveda employees sometimes need to be cajoled to take their turn at the weeds .
This year , to keep on schedule , Ms. Skinner has devised a chore calendar and suggests twice - weekly gardening sessions .

Sen .
Jon Kyl , Republican of Arizona , believes that any extension to unemployment benefits “ ought to be paid for . ”
But when it comes to the $ 678 - billion cost of extending the Bush - era tax cuts for the wealthy , the senator says no offsetting is necessary .
In an interview with Fox News ’ Chris Wallace Sunday , Kyl argued that Congress and the Obama administration should extend the tax cuts enacted by President George W. Bush during his first term .
ADVERTISEMENT
Extending the entire package of tax cuts would cost the US $ 2.2 trillion over the next 10 years .
The Obama administration has argued in favor of allowing to expire at least the part of the tax cuts that applies to people earning over $ 250,000 a year .
That portion is estimated to cost $ 678 billion over 10 years .
“ Tell me , how are you going to pay that $ 678 billion to keep those Bush tax cuts for the wealthy ? ”
Wallace asked Kyl .
“ You should never raise taxes in order to cut taxes , ” Kyl said .
“ Surely Congress has the authority — and it would be right — if we decide we want to cut taxes to spur the economy , not to have to raise taxes in order to offset those costs .
You do need to offset the cost of increased spending .
And that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s what Republicans object to .
But you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans . ”
Ben Armbruster at ThinkProgress notes that Kyl has in the past defended the GOP ’s blocking of unemployment benefits , agreeing with other Republicans that benefits extensions “ ought to be paid for . ”

Early Sunday , in what is being called “ one of the biggest leaks in US military history , ” the whistleblower site WikiLeaks posted tens of thousands of classified “ military field reports ” about the Afghan war .
According to the New York Times , the Times , the Guardian , and the German newspaper Der Spiegel were “ given access to the voluminous records several weeks ago on the condition that they not report on the material before Sunday . ”
Based on that access and reporting , which WikiLeaks was not involved in , the New York Times has published a series of articles today which are too lengthy to go through here in detail but , broadly speaking , conclude that the Afghan war is not going as well as official reports might lead the public to believe .
You can read a rundown of what they reveal here .
Perhaps equally as interesting is how the Times decided what to report on from the thousands of classified documents they were given access to .
The paper explains its thinking in a note to readers .
Deciding whether to publish secret information is always difficult , and after weighing the risks and public interest , we sometimes chose not to publish .
But there are times when the information is of significant public interest , and this is one of those times .
The documents illuminate the extraordinary difficulty of what the United States and its allies have undertaken in a way that other accounts have not .
Most of the incident reports are marked “ secret , ” a relatively low level of classification .
The Times has taken care not to publish information that would harm national security interests .
The Times and the other news organizations agreed at the outset that we would not disclose — either in our articles or any of our online supplementary material — anything that was likely to put lives at risk or jeopardize military or antiterrorist operations .
You can read the Guardian ’s report on the leaks here .
Update : The White House is not happy about this .
At all .
From Mike Allen .
White House National Security Adviser James Jones issued a statement that begins : “ The United States strongly condemns the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organizations which could put the lives of Americans and our partners at risk , and threaten our national security .
“ Wikileaks made no effort to contact us about these documents – the United States government learned from news organizations that these documents would be posted .
These irresponsible leaks will not impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan ; to defeat our common enemies ; and to support the aspirations of the Afghan and Pakistani people .
The statement says nothing about the three newspapers that reported extensively on the leaks .
However , in their note to readers the NYT does say that “ to establish confidence in the information , The Times checked a number of the reports against incidents that had been publicly reported or witnessed by our own journalists .
Government officials did not dispute that the information was authentic ” suggesting that the government was at least aware these docs were out there and being examined .
Update # 2 : Michael Calderone confirms the administration was indeed aware the NYT had the documents .
New York Times Washington bureau chief Dean Baquet tells Calderone : “ I did in fact go the White House and lay out for them what we had …
We did it to give them the opportunity to comment and react .
They did .
They also praised us for the way we handled it , for giving them a chance to discuss it , and for handling the information with care .
And for being responsible . ”

Both devices can now also run webOS 1.4.5 , which Palm made available for download June 30 .
This update , per Palm , includes " minor fixes and enhancements to support the public release of the webOS PDK . "
It also fixes a hitch so that podcasts download correctly , and , on certain Web sites , enables the text being entered in a field to remain the focus of the screen .
On the AT&T site , the carrier currently offers the Palm Pre Plus for $ 149.99 and the Pixi Plus for $ 49.99 , each with new service activation .

Doug McCune has charted San Francisco 's crime rate topographically .
Crimes like prostitution and narcotics peak in certain areas ( Shotwell Street and the Tenderloin , respectively ) .
San Franciscans , do you live in Strumpet Heights or Teetotaler Valley ?

Says McCune :
Many of the maps have peaks in the Tenderloin , which is that high area sort of in the north - east center area of the city .
Some are extremely concentrated ( narcotics ) and some are far more spread out ( vehicle theft ) .
These maps were generated from real data , but please do n't take them as being accurate .
The data was aggregated geographically and artistically rendered .
This is meant more as an art piece than an informative visualization .

Recently , a viral meme came full circle as Paul " Bear " Vasquez ( a.k.a .
The Double Rainbow Guy ) , made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live , a TV show hosted by the man who prompted Vasquez 's unlikely stardom .
Over Fourth of July weekend , a viral video burst onto the scene that took the world by storm — or rather the calm after the storm , punctuated by a glorious double rainbow .
In it , a tearful man goes absolutely insane over the natural phenomena .
Vasquez , the vid 's star , made the video back in January , but it did n't take off until Kimmel tweeted about it in early July .
Now , nature - lovin ' homeboy has been interviewed by many a reporter , and several spin - offs of his iconic vid have hit the web .
Kimmel recently had " Bear " on the show , where they talked about rainbows , women , a previous appearance Vasquez made on the program , and whether or not the YouTube star was intoxicated during the famed freak - out .
Vasquez says he was completely sober , but copped to smoking up before some of his other videos .
It 's OK , though , folks — he 's got a prescription .
Yeah ...
The interview is in two parts .
Check it out below :
Part One
Part Two
On another note , I know it 's the summer doldrums , folks , but can some please bust out with a new meme ?
Seriously , the staying power of this particular viral phenom is indicative of the Internet masses ' collective hunger for something amusing at present .
Something to blast away our ennui and rocket us toward novelty nirvana .
So , denizens of YouTube , I implore you , teach your toddler to crip walk or something .
For the good of humanity ...
Every year the International Trade Union Confederation reports on anti-labor union repression worldwide .
The news from last year was worse than ever .
Its report , released June 9 , showed 101 unionists murdered , up 30 percent over 2008 .
Colombia accounted for almost half of the murder victims — 48 .
Other countries with large numbers of union members murdered were : Guatemala 16 , Honduras 12 , Mexico and Bangladesh six each , Brazil four , and the Dominican Republic and the Philippines three each .
The report said India , Iraq and Nigeria had one murdered victim in each country .
The top three offenders , Colombia , Guatemala and Honduras , are recipients of U.S. military aid .
In the case of Guatemala aid was dropped from 1990 to 2005 in support of local security forces , which engaged in violent repression of leftist political activists , including trade union leaders .
The ITUC also cited imprisonment , harassment and intimidation , murder attempts , and “ serious death threats ” applied to unionists worldwide , but “ again mostly in Colombia and Guatemala . ”
Strike breaking and union busting are ubiquitous .
Workers generally lack the right to organize and bargain collectively , and most have to settle for informal or temporary work .
Women , migrants and agricultural workers have special vulnerability , the reports says .
According to ITUC General Secretary Guy Ryder , “ Colombia was yet again the country where standing up for fundamental rights of workers is more likely than anywhere else to mean a death sentence . ”
FECODE , the Colombian teacher ’s union , took the major hit during 2009 with 19 murders , followed by the FENSUAGRO agricultural union that lost 11 members .
In 2007 , killers struck down 39 worker activists ; in 2008 , 49 .
Perpetrators are identified in only three percent of cases .
Nevertheless the International Labor Organization , a U.N. agency , accepted a Colombian government report of 28 workers killed during 2009 .
At a yearly review conference in Geneva , former Labor Minister Ana Lucia Noguera claimed unionist deaths were down 81 percent over seven years .
The ILO ended up announcing early in June , Colombia ’s removal from a long stay on an ILO “ black list ” of the world ’s 25 most flagrant labor abusing countries , those requiring special attention .
Outgoing President Alvaro took the occasion to crow about “ great news for Colombia , ” resulting from “ strengthening of work to protect workers ’ rights and work to promote fraternal labor relations , different and opposed to class hatred . ”
Heading the Colombian delegation before the ILO , Colombia ’s UN ambassador in Geneva Angelino Garzón chimed in similarly : Colombia is recognized “ as a country with labor progress and union freedom . ”
ILO waffling on Colombia is consistent with a modus operandi specified on its web site : the ILO “ brings together representatives of governments , employers and workers to jointly shape policies and programs . ”
Teamed with presidential candidate Juan Manuel Santos , Garzon is favored to become Colombia ’s next vice president in second round voting on June 20 .
He is a former union leader , labor minister , and departmental governor .
Observers see the presence of a labor credentialed candidate on a ticket identified with labor rights , human rights , and constitutional abuses as cover up .
That and the drama in Geneva play out amidst media efforts to shore up U.S and European support for corporation – friendly free trade agreements and militarization .
However , not only did the ITUC report cite 48 unionist deaths last year – not 28 – but also a Colombian labor federation spokesperson from CUT affirmed that 2,721 labor union members have been assassinated over 23 years .
One man or woman has been killed every three days , according to a respected human rights group .
U.S. corporations , including Chiquita and Drummond , have been tied to giving support to paramilitary groups suspected in many unionists ’ murders .
U.S. unions , especially the United Steelworkers , have ongoing solidarity campaigns with Colombian workers and unions .
Both groups oppose a proposed U.S. - Colombia free trade agreement due to the anti-union violence .
During two weeks prior to the ITUC report ’s release , gunmen killed three unionists and severely wounded another , bringing the toll so far this year to 29 .
According to CUT President Tarsicio Mora , there have been 527 unionist murder victims since 2002 , when Uribe became president , although other estimates put the figure at around 600 .
Colombia ’s constitution recognizes the full gamut of labor rights .
Yet only 4 percent of Colombia ’s 18 million workers currently are union members , while only 1.2 percent benefit from negotiated union contracts .
Human rights advocates remind outside observers that other Colombians besides unionists confront terrible violence .
The National Indigenous Organization of Colombia , for example , claims that “ armed groups have killed more than 1,400 indigenous Colombians over the last decade , ” with 114 indigenous people meeting violent deaths last year , almost twice those killed in 2008 .

After years of enduring inconsistent , illogical , and often plainly stupid indecency decisions from the Federal Communications Commission , the broadcasting industry has found a champion in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals .
Reviewing the FCC 's sanctions against Fox Television for airing several instances of the f-bomb and s-word said on the fly , the court has unanimously declared the agency 's " fleeting expletive " policy to be " unconstitutionally " and " impermissibly vague " and in plain violation of the First Amendment .
" Under the current policy , broadcasters must choose between not airing or censoring controversial programs and risking massive fines or possibly even loss of their licenses , and it is not surprising which option they choose , " the justices declared .
" Indeed , there is ample evidence in the record that the FCC ’s indecency policy has chilled protected speech . "
And furthermore :
Sex and the magnetic power of sexual attraction are surely among the most predominant themes in the study of humanity since the Trojan War .
The digestive system and excretion are also important areas of human attention .
By prohibiting all " patently offensive " references to sex , sexual organs , and excretion without giving adequate guidance as to what " patently offensive " means , the FCC effectively chills speech , because broadcasters have no way of knowing what the FCC will find offensive .
To place any discussion of these vast topics at the broadcaster 's peril has the effect of promoting wide self - censorship of valuable material which should be completely protected under the First Amendment .
Ars received this opaque response from the FCC , following the ruling .
" We 're reviewing the court 's decision in light of our commitment to protect children , empower parents , and uphold the First Amendment , " Commission Chair Julius Genachowski declared .
As for us , we think this great news .
Finally — a court has clearly brought the right to free expression back into this discussion .
Let 's review the crazy trail that led to this outbreak of sanity .
Shocking and gratuitous
For years following the Supreme Court 's 1978 Pacifica decision validating the FCC 's right to sanction programming that it found indecent , the agency pursued a relatively restrained course of enforcement .
It took a light regulatory touch approach to the broadcast of a " single , non-literal use of an expletive , " as the Second Circuit gingerly put it .
" Speech that is indecent must involve more than an isolated use of an offensive word , " the Commission declared in one instance .
The agency even offered a guideline sheet to broadcasters in 2001 that reiterated this stance — assuring the industry that a key consideration would be " whether the material dwells on or repeats at length " some questionable word or series of words .
But in 2004 , the FCC decided to crack down , ratcheting up its stance against even a single naughty word .
The excuse came when the rock singer Bono got a little out of control upon receiving the televised Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song .
" This is really , really f*** ing brilliant , " he had the bad taste to exclaim ( adding " Really , really great " — just in case you did n't get it the first time ) .
The " ' F - word ' is one of the most vulgar , graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the English language , " the agency declared .
It " invariably invokes a coarse sexual image " and broadcasting it on a national telecast was " shocking and gratuitous . "
Now a single instance of one of these utterances was unacceptable , and soon punishments were forthcoming .
These included sanctions with big fines attached against the 2002 and 2003 Fox Television broadcasts of the Billboard Music Awards , during which Cher and Nicole Richie acted like ... themselves .
" I 've also had critics for the last 40 years saying that I was on my way out every year , " Cher explained in 2002 .
" So f*** 'em . "
In 2003 , Richie had yet to get caught sitting in a Mercedes facing backwards in a freeway carpool lane while on pills , but she did have the presence of mind to ask the Billboard audience if they had " ever tried to get cow s*** out of a Prada purse ?
It 's not so f*** ing simple . "
ABC's NYPD Blue and CBS 's Early Show also received fines for broadcasting similar utterances , but when all three networks appealed these expensive decisions to the Second Circuit , the FCC asked for a remand , then let ABC and CBS off the hook , in CBS 's case because the dirty word in question was aired during a " bona fide " news story .
Divorced from reality
With that , the Second Circuit considered the case — although only on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedures
Act 's strictures against " arbitrary and capricious " decision making .
In a two - to - one decision , the justices found that it did , even calling the rulings " divorced from reality . "
The court argued that the FCC had failed to explain why the agency had so dramatically changed its stance .
But in April of 2009 the Supreme Court rejected the Second 's ruling .
" The agency 's reasons for expanding its enforcement activity , moreover , were entirely rational , " Justice Antonin Scalia and four other Supremes declared .
" Even when used as an expletive , the F - Word 's power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning .
And the decision to look at the patent offensiveness of even isolated uses of sexual and excretory words fits with Pacifica 's context - based approach . "
Now , however , the case was remanded back to the Second Circuit to examine the problem from a First Amendment perspective .
What 's striking about this decision is that it comes very close to challenging Pacifica itself , questioning the decision 's assumptions that broadcast indecency should be regulated because of its " pervasiveness " and ability to reach children .
" The same can not be said today , " the justices noted .
" The past thirty years has seen an explosion of media sources , and broadcast television has become only one voice in the chorus . "
In addition , practically every technology now has ample software allowing parents to limit its accessibility to children .
" In short , there now exists a way to block programs that contain indecent speech in a way that was not possible in 1978 . "
Big chill
But while the court steps back from deciding whether Pacifica itself is still constitutional , it insists that the FCC's " context - based " approach amounts to little more than a jumble of incomprehensible calls .
Why , the Second asks , did the agency conclude that those Billboard shows were beyond the pale , but declared the words " dick " and " dickhead " to be acceptable ?
Why did the agency sanction broadcasts of the public television documentary The Blues for its airing of ripe words , but not broadcasts of Saving Private Ryan .
And even though the FCC declined to punish CBS , the court noted , the " FCC has made clear that it considers the decision to apply this exception a matter within its discretion . "
Thus broadcasters and their news agencies in particular should still rightly fear the Commission 's uncertain and bizarre indecency policies , and they do :
During the previous proceedings before this Court , amicus curiae gave the example of a local station in Vermont that refused to air a political debate because one of the local politicians involved had previously used expletives on air .
The record contains other examples of local stations that have forgone live programming in order to avoid fines .
For instance , Phoenix TV stations dropped live coverage of a memorial service for Pat Tillman , the former football star killed in Afghanistan , because of language used by Tillman ’s family members to express their grief .
A station in Moosic , Pennsylvania submitted an affidavit stating that in the wake of the FCC ’s new policy , it had decided to no longer provide live , direct to - air coverage of news events " unless they affect matters of public safety or convenience . "
If these policies are allowed to stand , the court concludes , broadcasters will decline " to pursue contentious people or subjects , or will eschew live programming altogether , in order to avoid the FCC 's fines . "
In other words , they will censor themselves to avoid being censored by the government .
" This chill reaches speech at the heart of the First Amendment . "
This decision is arguably a victory for anyone who believes in freedom of expression .
We ca n't put it better than Andrew Schwartzman of the Media Access Project .
" The score for today 's game is First Amendment one , censorship zero , " MAP declared in a press statement .
But when we spoke with Schwartzman , he assured us that this is not the last battle in this war .
" It is a virtual certainty that the government will ask the Supreme Court to review this decision , " he told Ars .
" In fact , during the oral argument , the judges on the panel made it clear that they expected the decision to go back up no matter which way they came out here . "
Palestinian trade union movement calls on international dockworkers ' unions to block loading / offloading Israeli ships until Israel complies fully with international law and ends its illegal siege of Gaza
By the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee , Palestine
June 7 , 2010 -- The Palestinian trade union movement , as a key constituent member of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee ( BNC ) calls on dockworkers ' unions worldwide to block Israeli maritime trade in response to Israel ’s massacre of humanitarian relief workers and activists aboard the Freedom Flotilla , until Israel complies with international law and ends its illegal blockade of Gaza .
Drunk with power and impunity , Israel has ignored recent appeals by the UN secretary general as well as a near consensus among world governments to end its siege , putting the onus on international civil society to shoulder the moral responsibility of holding Israel accountable to international law and ending its criminal impunity .
Dockworkers around the world have historically contributed to the struggle against injustice , most notably against the apartheid regime in South Africa , when port workers ' unions refused to load / offload cargo on / from South African ships as a most effective way of protesting the apartheid regime .
Today , we ask you to join the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union ( SATAWU ) , which resolved not to offload Israeli ships in Durban in February 2009 in protest of Israel ’s war of aggression on Gaza , and the Swedish Dockworkers Union which resolved to blockade all Israeli ships and cargo to and from Israel in protest of Israel 's attack against the Freedom Flotilla and the ongoing deadly Israeli siege of the occupied Gaza Strip .
Israel ’s ongoing blockade of essential food , health , educational and construction supplies is not only immoral ; it is a severe form of collective punishment , a war crime that is strictly prohibited under Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention , that is inducing mass poverty , water contamination , environmental collapse , chronic diseases , economic devastation and hundreds of deaths .
This three - year old medieval siege against 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza , has been squarely condemned by leading legal experts , including UN special rapporteur on human rights , Prof. Richard Falk , who described it as constituting " slow genocide " .
Israel 's deplorable attacks on the unarmed ships are a violation of both international maritime law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , which states that " the high seas should be reserved for peaceful purposes " .
Under article 3 of the Rome Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation of 1988 , it is an international crime for any person to seize or exercise control over a ship by force , and also a crime to injure or kill any person in the process .
As prominent international law scholars have recently confirmed , there is absolutely no legal justification for Israel 's act of aggression against international civilian ships carrying humanitarian and developmental aid to civilians suffering under occupation and a patently illegal blockade , which has created a man-made and deliberately sustained humanitarian catastrophe .
Our response must be commensurate with this crisis .
Gaza today has become the test of our universal morality and our common humanity .
During the South African anti-apartheid struggle , the world was inspired by the brave and principled actions of dockworkers unions who refused to handle South African cargo , contributing significantly to the ultimate fall of apartheid .
Today , we call on you , dockworkers unions of the world , to do the same against Israel 's occupation and apartheid .
This is the most effective form of solidarity to end injustice and uphold universal human rights .

Solidarity with the Palestinian people : Three - day strike against Israel commercial vessels
June 8 , 2010
Dear colleagues , trade unionists and workers ,
The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions has today decided to call a strike for three days at all ports of the world against Israel commercial vessels to or from Israel .
We call on all naval workers , dock workers and all workers and all unions in the ports to refuse to load or unload ships coming from for heading for Israel .
The TUI Transport of the WFTU is at the forefront of this strike .
This action is a practical demonstration of the militant solidarity with the Palestinian People .
This is a proof of militant solidarity against the blockade of the Gaza Strip .
In this way we express our demand for an independent and democratic Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital .
Furthermore , we demand the immediate lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip .
We condemn the killings of nine Turkish activists and once again we express our sincere condolences to their families .
The world working class watches with dismay the tactics of the UN and the hypocrisy of the European Union .
At the same time , we are aware of the inter - capitalist competition and the dangers it creates for the peace in the region of southeast Mediterranean .
Moreover , it is clear that the Israeli government could not carry out these crimes with impunity without the support and encourage of the U.S. and its allies .
Colleagues , trade union leaders at the ports of the world , no one must remain silent !
No one must remain neutral !
We must act now because we are all Palestinians !
You decide the dates in the month of June for the three days of strike - boycott against the Israel policy .
You choose the best way to react , the best way of showing solidarity with the heroic struggle of the Palestinian People .
Let ´s all act now .
Stop the blockade of Gaza now !
Free , independent and democratic Palestinian state !

Norwegian Ports Union boycotts Israeli ships
June 13 , 2010 -- International MiddleEast Media Center --
Responding to calls by the Palestinian Workers Union and other calls by different workers unions and organisations around the world , the Norwegian Ports Union decided to join its Swedish counterpart in boycotting all Israeli ships starting on June 15 .
The workers will not be loading or unloading Israeli ships docking in their ports .
Polls in Norway revealed that nearly half of the Norwegians support this act .
The Port Workers Union in Norway said that the boycott would be for two weeks , while the Swedish boycott would continue until June 24 .
The Palestinian workers ' unions appealed to Arab , regional and international workers union to take serious stances against the Israeli violations , and its deadly attack against the Freedom Flotilla leading to dozens of casualties among non-violent international activists transporting aid supplies to the besieged Gaza Strip .
Furthermore , the port workers ' union in South Africa , which is an affiliate with the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) , also joined the calls for a boycott of Israel .
Workers unions in Palestine welcomed the stance of Norwegian , Swedish , Greek , British , Canadian and South African unions in rejecting and denouncing the Israeli attack against the Palestinians and the activists , and the ongoing illegal Israeli siege on Gaza .
United States : Victory – Israeli ship blocked from unloading at Oakland Port
June 20 , 2010 -- ANSWER --
In a historic action and unprecedented action today , more 800 worker and community activists blocked the gates of the Oakland docks in the early morning hours , prompting longshore workers to refuse to cross the picketlines where they were scheduled to unload an Israeli ship .
From 5:30 am to 9:30 am , a militant and spirited protest was held in front of four gates of the Stevedore Services of America , with people chanting non-stop , “ Free , free Palestine , do n’t cross the picket line ” and “ An injury to one is an injury to all , bring down the apartheid wall " .
Citing the health and safety provisions of their contract , the International Longshore and Warehouse Union workers refused to cross the picketline to report for duty .
Between 8:30 am and 9:00 am , an emergency arbitration was conducted at the Maersk parking lot nearby , with an “ instant ” arbitrator called to the site to rule on whether the workers could refuse to cross the picketline without disciplinary measure .
At 9:15 a.m , after again reviewing the protests of hundreds at each gate , the arbitrator ruled in favour of the union that it was indeed unsafe for the workers to enter the docks .
To loud cheers of “ Long live Palestine ! ” Jess Ghannam of Free Palestine Alliance and Richard Becker of the ANSWER Coalition announced the victory .
Ghannam said , “ This is truly historic , never before has an Israeli ship been blocked in the United States ! ”
The news that a container ship from the Zim Israeli shipping line was scheduled to arrive in the Bay Area today has sparked a tremendous outpouring of solidarity for Palestine , especially in the aftermath of the Israeli massacre of volunteers bringing humanitarian aid to Gaza on May 31 .
With 10 days advance notice of the ship ’s arrival , the emergency Labor / Community Committee in Solidarity with the Palestinian People was set up .
On June 16 , some 110 people from unions and community came to help organise logistics , outreach and community support .
Initiating organisations included the Al - Awda Palestine Right to Return Coalition , the ANSWER Coalition , the Bay Area Labor Chapter of USLAW and the Bay Area Labor Committee for Peace & Justice .
This week the San Francisco Labor Council and Alameda Labor Council passed resounding resolutions denouncing Israel ’s blockade of Gaza .
Both councils sent out public notices of the dock action .
The ILWU has a proud history of extending its solidarity to struggling peoples the world over .
In 1984 , as the Black masses of South Africa were engaged in an intense struggle against South African apartheid , the ILWU refused for a record - setting 10 days to unload cargo from the South African Ned Lloyd ship .
Despite million - dollar fines imposed on the union , the longshore workers held strong , providing a tremendous boost to the anti-apartheid movement .
Today ’s Oakland action , in the sixth largest port in the United States , is the first of several protests and work stoppages planned around the world , including Norway , Sweden and South Africa .
It is sure to inspire others to do the same .
The goal is for a 24 - hour shutdown of the docks where the Israeli ship is docked , so the protest is planned again for 4:30 pm .

Alan Plater , whose TV credits in a writing career spanning 50 years included The Beiderbecke Affair , Fortunes of War and the screenplay for A Very British Coup , has died , his agent confirmed to the BBC today .
Plater , 75 , wrote novels and for film and theatre , but will be best remembered for a profilic body of television drama spanning six decades , starting with TV play The Referees for BBC North in 1961 .
His final TV drama , Joe Maddison 's War , starring Kevin Whately and Robson Green and set on the eve of the second world war in the north - east , where Plater was born , is currently in post - production for ITV .
Plater was born in Jarrow in 1935 and moved with his family as a young child to Hull , where he grew up .
He studied architecture at Newcastle University and worked for a short time in the profession before turning to a writing career .
In the 1960s and 1970s he wrote for BBC and ITV single drama strands including Play for Today , Armchair Theatre and The Wednesday Play , as well penning episodes of Z Cars and its spin-off , Softly Softly .
Plater will perhaps be best remembered for the period in the mid- to late 1980s when he created The Beiderbecke Affair – and its follow - ups The Beiderbecke Tapes and The Beiderbecke Connections – and adapted Olivia Manning 's Fortunes of War novels and Chris Mullen 's political thriller A Very British Coup for TV .
In the past 20 years Plater wrote episodes of dramas including Midsomer Murders , Dalziel and Pascoe and Lewis , as well as creating The Last of the Blonde Bombshells .
Plater 's agent Alexandra Cann told the BBC that he had been " very robust " until the final week of his life when he was admitted to a London hospice .
Cann said Joe Maddison's
War would be a " fitting tribute " to the writer , who saw the drama go into production .
Plater was awarded a CBE in 2005 .
In the same year he collected the Dennis Potter award for writing at the Baftas and two years later was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the Writers ' Guild of Great Britain .

While many know the late Shel Silverstein as an author of classic children ’s books like The Giving Tree and Where the Sidewalk Ends , he also moonlighted as a country singer - songwriter .
His musical legacy will be honored on the upcoming Twistable , Turnable Man , which finds acts like John Prine , Dr. Dog , and Andrew Bird putting their own spin on Silverstein ’s compositions .
Hear one of My Morning Jacket ’s two contributions below !
The album takes its title from of one of Silverstein ’s quirky poems about a particularly bendy man — Andrew Bird was given the honor of adapting the poem into a song — and features songs penned by Silverstein himself , some of which were originally made famous by other artists .
One of the most notable examples is “ A Boy Named Sue , ” which was originally performed by Johnny Cash and is covered here by Todd Snider .
Twistable , Turnable Man wo n’t hit stores until June 8 , but in the meantime check out MMJ ’s “ Lullabys , Legends , and Lies ” here .
The song , already one of singer Jim James ’ favorites , is a gently swaying country tune originally performed by longtime Silverstein collaborator Bobby Bare , Sr. , who — along with his son Bobby Bare , Jr. — produced the tribute album .

Yes , according to one scenario released by the National Center for Atmospheric Research .
Depressing video inside .
The video is the result of an effort to use computer modeling to simulate where the oil may go , based on the typical patterns of currents in the Gulf of Mexico .
The scientists caution this is n’t a forecast , per say — only a simulation based on a set of common conditions .
If there are changes to the current , for example , oil may miss the coast entirely .
But still , researchers say they think there ’s a good chance damage could expand beyond the Gulf : “ [ O ] ur best knowledge says the scope of this environmental disaster is likely to reach far beyond Florida , with impacts that have yet to be understood , ” said NCAR scientist Synte Peacock , one of the scientists who worked on the project .
Let ’s hope the “ top hat ” cap works .
Horror at family music festival as teenage girl is gang raped after getting lost
A teenage girl was raped in front of a gang of men at a major music festival popular with families .
The 19 - year - old was camping with friends at the Latitude Festival near Southwold , Suffolk , when she left her tent and got lost looking for a lavatory .
She asked a group of three or four men for directions and they offered to show her the way before walking with her a short distance .
Some of the group then grabbed her and she was raped by at least one man .

Family event : Police are investigating after a teenage girl was raped at the traditionally laid - back Latitude Music Festival in Suffolk
The men ran off and the victim , from Norwich , managed to make her way back to her tent .
She immediately told her friends , who contacted site security and police .
The assault happened at around 10 pm on Thursday , just two hours before Tom Jones played to a capacity crowd at the 35,000 ticket event at the Henham Park Estate .
Other acts at the festival , which features music , art , theatre and poetry , and runs from Thursday to Sunday , include Florence and the Machine and Corinne Bailey Rae .
Festival - goers spoke of their shock at the assault yesterday .
[ caption ] Dan Hayes , 29 , a DJ from Stoke Newington , North London , said it had ' changed the whole atmosphere of the festival ' and people were not as relaxed as they had been in previous years .
' You just do n't expect to hear of something so horrible happening here , ' he added .
' The whole idea of Latitude has always been for people to let their hair down but in a safe and sensible way .
' It 's not like other events where people end up binge drinking and doing drugs .
' I hope for the sake of the victim and the event that the police do their job and catch these monsters .
Otherwise I think it will be tarnished forever . '
[ caption ]
A Suffolk police spokesman said officers took a detailed account from the woman before she had a medical examination .
CCTV footage is also being checked .
She said : ' Latitude is a big and busy festival and there would have been lots of people around at the time of the incident who may have seen the victim and the men .
' Police officers will continue with their inquiries over the weekend and are working with site organisers to investigate the incident fully .
' We are also reminding individuals to be vigilant and are advising groups of friends to stick together and look out for each other . '
The spokesman added : ' It was very dark at the time of the attack but the victim believes one of the men may have short , dark , curly hair . '
The force has appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the incident or seen a young woman wearing jeans , a yellow and cream top and a black cardigan walking with a small group of men to get in contact .
We all know that homeopathy is really stupid , just like most alternative medicine .
However , when I saw this “ lecture ” by Dr Charlene Werner , I was astounded by the depths of stupidity that she is able to attain .
It ’s almost like she ’s a kind of Superheroine of Stupidity , with the special power of creating a singularity of stupid .
This is of course stupidity that ’s so extreme that it tends towards infinity and temporarily makes all reason disappear into a black - hole of scientific incompetence .
Wow .
Bottom - line : if you have a brain - cell or two and you care about it , stay very far away from homeopathy .
It will make you stupid too .
Update
They pulled that specific video from youtube , probably because they were concerned about Dr. Werner ’s reputation going even more to the dogs than it already has ( but not as much as it deserves ) .
Fortunately , the video has been mirrored :
What 's wrong with taking a steroid , while you 're , to try to increase the odds that your female fetus will someday grow up to be a straight woman who gives you grandchildren , and not a lesbian daughter more interested in puppies ?
I have a funny feeling I 'm about to get hit by various versions of that question , since Ellen Feder of American University , Anne Tamar - Mattis of Advocates for Informed Choice , and I just submitted a new post to Bioethics Forum revealing what we think is the first organized medical " paradigm " for attempting to prevent in the womb .
Let me give five answers to that question .
Maybe six .
1 . The specific drug we 're talking about , dexamethasone , is not a benign drug for pregnant women , nor for the children exposed in utero .
The studies we do have on the early prenatal use of " dex " are worrisome .
The number of women and children missing from the follow - up studies of this drug use is more worrisome still .
This drug is unequivocally experimental and risky .
That 's why , back in February , I organized interested members of the Bioethics community to fight to make sure every woman offered dex for CAH knows the truth about its experimental and risky nature .
( You can read about our efforts in Time magazine .
And you can about the medical establishment 's resultant mad scampering to make sure everyone knows this is experimental here . )
Make no mistake :
In spite of Dr. Maria New 's outrageous FDA - regulation - flaunting claims that this off - label drug use " has been found safe for mother and child , " it ai n't been .
New is a rogue pediatrician whom medical societies have been nudging ( and sometimes yelling at ) for years .
Because she apparently would n't stop experimenting on these women and children without oversight , in January I got called in to help by a few freaked - out clinicians .
And I called in my colleagues to call out the feds .
New just looks and sounds safe for mothers and children .
Which is why she 's really dangerous .
2 . We know that gay and lesbian people suffer a lot of discrimination .
And in theory , it seems reasonable to try to prevent a child from suffering .
But an approach like prenatal dex for homosexuality prevention positions gay and lesbian people as the problem to be cured , where we ought to see that it 's our society that 's suffering from a disease .
The medical establishment has long recognized that gay and lesbian people are not inherently diseased , even if Dr. New and her collaborators did n't get the memo in 1973 .
3 . Trying to prevent homosexuality in the womb is akin to cosmetic " medical " procedures in that it is inherently anti-democratic .
I 've ranted elsewhere about why medicine needs to be liberated from recent profoundly anti-democratic trends , so I wo n't go on about it here .
But the bottom line is that an attempt to prenatally prevent homosexual orientation is n't just bad medicine ( because it is n't necessary or safe ) , it 's bad for American democracy , because it sends the message that you must to the most conservative social norms to count as acceptable and to be allowed to live , with full rights , free of discrimination and abuse in American society .
In fact , the beauty of American history is that we have repeatedly changed our society to give oppressed people access to equal privilege .
A democratic medical establishment does not alter people 's bodies to fit regressive social norms ; it advocates for patients by demanding the social body get its act together .
As a white woman who grew up with a black brother , I can tell you that the solution to my brother 's suffering was not to have his skin bleached and his hair straightened , prenatally or postnatally .
As I asked in One of Us , why not change minds instead of bodies ?
4 . The fact is that children are inherently unpredictable , and so ( surely ) what it means to decide to be a parent is to agree that you will accept the uncertainty that comes with being a parent .
Having a child is not like taking a spouse ; there is no mutual agreement entered into .
It is up the parent to make the commitment .
And to make the commitment by saying , " I 'm willing to have you , but only if you are a boy , and a straight boy at that , and a straight boy with blue eyes and a very high " is , frankly , to not really make the commitment that parenting requires .
Am I suggesting that people who want to engineer their children 's sexual orientations are unfit to be parents ?
Yes , I am .
Being gay is not a terrible , tragic disease that requires prevention or treatment chosen for you by your parents .
I am reminded here of a colleague who works as a social worker on a craniofacial team at a children 's hospital .
She was telling me one day , despairingly , of having a consultation with a pair of expectant parents .
Their fetus had been diagnosed with a cleft lip , one that would be reasonably correctable without major .
It was true the baby would be born with the odd - looking mouth , and that the child might always have a noticeable lip scar .
But this was not a child with a fatal disease or anything .
Yet the father was flipping out , saying to his wife and the social worker , " I can't handle this !
I can't handle this ! "
He wanted to abort for this .
My friend and I both were both thinking : Come on !
If you can't handle this , what are you going to do when your kid smokes a little dope ?
What are you going to do if she ends up pregnant at 16 ?
What are you going to do if she sucks at math or suffers from a lot of acne ?
Sure , abort .
But do n't have any children if you can't handle this .
The problem with such a parent is that he is planning to live his entire existence with his child on the shame - pride axis , where everything his child does is rated according to whether it makes her father proud or ashamed .
You want a child who never makes you anything but proud ?
Please .
Do n't bother taking on if you can't handle the fact that sometimes your child 's wo n't be what you would have chosen .
And if you want to prevent a child from ever suffering ?
Well , then do n't have a child .
No one is born into the world never to suffer .
Is having a child with a less - than - idealized identity or anatomy sometimes really hard ?
Yup .
And when you sign up for parenting , that 's part of what you 're signing up for .
You can't seriously expect your whole parenting experience to consist of softball trophies and bumper stickers that brag about your Honor Roll child .
It is not your child 's job in life to make you proud .
It is your job to make your children proud of you as their parent .
5 . Relatedly , if you want to be a parent , start getting used to the fact that your children will change you as much as you change them .
I now know far more than I ever thought I would about trains , airplanes , and Australian native species thanks to my son .
I am also more patient , more organized , more disorganized , more sleep deprived , and more in love with him than I ever thought I 'd be .
If you would not have your child explicitly manipulate your identity as a condition of loving you , do not begin your relationship with your child by doing the same .
To paraphrase Ghandi , be the child you want to see in the world : open to possibility , open to love , open to learning what love really means .
6 . Puppies make great grandchildren , not least because if your child goes away and you 're too busy to care for them , you can put them in a kennel .

March '09 is shifted to the right of where it should be , making Bush 's latter climb appear less rapid than it should be .
and the beginning of Obama 's appear to not level off as much as it should .

Interesting that the graph is perfectly straight , which is a give - away that it 's faked .
Another point is that it gives a source , " BLS " but what is that ???

I have to wonder what idiot put that label on that graph .
Clearly , that heading is no where near accurate .
If you change the heading to " Unemployed Americans " , then it starts to make sense .
Those numbers are fairly close to what is reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

Read the Media Matters link I gave ya at the end the article .
The numbers do n't make sense and are still misleading even after changing the chart 's title .
Unless you mean " fairly " in the same sense they mean " fair and balanced " .

Yes , I did read the article .
I am not making a claim that the gragh is correct .
In fact , I believe that MM was generous in saying that this " Worst chart I 've seen all day " .
The staight lines , ect , makes it one of the the worst chart that I have seen in sometime .
My 3 year old niece could have done a better job of making this type of chart .
But those numbers are roughly BLS numbers , so unless you are making the claim that we can't trust the BLS , those numbers do make sense .
VP Biden claimed that we lost 8 million jobs since the recession started .
Nov 07 , 7.2 million unemployed ( linked in # 4 ) .
Add his 8 million , that would be 15.2 million .
Before today 's reported , the BLS said we had 15 million unemployed .
That seems to make sense .

No mainstream news outlet offers real news .
Fox is just more forthright about it .
It wears its white hood out in the open vs soft - brownshirt jargon of Clark Hoyt types .

Labor statistics are probably the single most abused of the " lies , damned lies , and statistics " that are out there .
There are " seasonal adjustments , " " underemployed , " " working poor , " and then the massive number of " discouraged " workers who do n't necessarily appear in the " numbers " but are still out there , hungry , sick , willing to work , but unable to do so .
While I do n't promote Faux New 's agenda of bashing Obama , I do believe that he missed his mark by not making a bigger deal of the disgusting PIT OF DESPAIR AND RUIN that Bush and the Rethuglicans put us into during their 8 years of reckless spending and tax cuts for the ultra - wealthy and unfunded wars .
Now , Obama has to OWN this Depression , and the fact is , by his compromises and pandering to the right wing ( of his own party and the Rethuglicans ) he has not sufficiently funded recovery efforts while giving trillions to the Banks and military / industrial / security / crisis complex .
We are DECADES from recovering the middle class that has been destroyed in the last 10 years , and Obama is going to have to OWN that problem , whether he wants to or not .
Had he chosen on day 1 to indict and try and convict the criminals that came before him , he would at least have somebody to point to when asked how this happened , but by letting them walk free , he 's stuck .
TRUE unemployment is at 20 % .
Go into any inner city , and you 'll see that .
As the right wing finishes tearing giant holes in the safety net , and the crime and discontent grows , you 'll start to see it much more clearly .
Faux
News may be creating false charts for all the wrong reasons , but the story they tell is , unfortunately , true : LIFE SUCKS IN AMERICA IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE TOP 1 % THAT OWNS THE GOVERNMENT , COURTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE .

After weathering the fear of federal prosecution and competition from drug cartels , California ’s medical marijuana growers see a new threat to their tenuous existence : the “ Wal - Marting ” of weed .
The Oakland City Council on Tuesday will look at licensing four production plants where pot would be grown , packaged and processed into items ranging from baked goods to body oil .
Winning applicants would have to pay $ 211,000 in annual permit fees , carry $ 2 million worth of liability insurance and be prepared to devote up to 8 percent of gross sales to taxes .

The move , and fledgling efforts in other California cities to sanction cannabis cultivation for the first time , has some marijuana advocates worried that regulations intended to bring order to the outlaw industry and new revenues to cash - strapped local governments could drive small “ mom and pop ” growers out of business .
They complain that industrial - scale gardens would harm the environment , reduce quality and leave consumers with fewer strains from which to choose .
“ Nobody wants to see the McDonald ’s - ization of cannabis , ” Dan Scully , one of the 400 “ patient - growers ” who supply Oakland ’s largest retail medical marijuana dispensary , Harborside Health Center , grumbled after a City Council committee gave the blueprint preliminary approval last week .
“ I would compare it to how a small business feels about shutting down its business and going to work at Wal - Mart .
Who would be attracted to that ? ”

It 's interesting to try to divine the chicken - and - egg of Mel Gibson 's firing by WME last week :
Was it his ( first - alleged , now aurally proved ) misogynistic and racist comments that enabled the agency to part ways with him , or was it the death of longtime agent Ed Limato that did the trick ?
Earlier today the news surfaced that William Morris Endeavor had split with Gibson last week -- as Limato lay seriously ill , and just several days after Radar Online broke the news that Gibson had verbally abused his girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva by using the N - word .
( The reports were just that until today , when audio of the Gibson incident was released on Radar . )
It 's a juicy thought experiment to ask what Gibson 's agency status would have been had only one of those events occurred .
( For what it 's worth , our guess is that Limato 's death without comments would have spelled the end of the relationship , while comments with Limato around probably would have kept him on the WME docket , though with dubious professional results . )
There 's of course a third variable in all this -- the fact that Gibson just was n't much of a bankable star anymore anyway .
His one stab at acting in the last eight years , the cop thriller " Edge of Darkness , " was a flop , and we were n't hearing his name much for new projects , despite his industrious work habits and the fact that contemporaries like Bruce Willis were regularly booking action - movie gigs .
There 's a reason Gibson was spending his time directing , producing and starring in movies that were self - financed through his Icon production banner ( one of those , " How I Spent My Summer Vacation " -- about a criminal who , in un -Gibson - like fashion , rehabilitates himself -- is nearly in the can , though without U.S. theatrical distribution ) and trying to resurrect his career with quirky indie movies like " The Beaver . " ( Incidentally , we do n't think we 're being pessimistic in saying that , despite a deal for Summit to release that film in the fall , this movie will sit on the shelf for a long , long time .
You can try to market a Mayan adventure in which Gibson does n't actually appear , as Disney did with " Apocalypto " not long after the Malibu anti-Semitism incident in 2006 , but good luck releasing a movie in the coming months with Mel Gibson on the topline and in posters , and wearing a beaver puppet to boot .
Jay Leno 's writers wo n't have to work for weeks . )
This newest development -- the loss of one of the few power brokers loyal to Gibson , and now the loss of one of the few larger institutions that 's been looking out for his professional interests -- is pretty much a fatal blow .
There 's little chance he 'll land at another agency anytime soon -- signing would bring down a horrible avalanche of bad PR to any agency that got within smelling distance and , more to the craven point , any agent that signs him has little hope of booking him any roles anyway since there is n't a studio in town that will hire Gibson .
( Some will point to a degree of international bankability , but unless Gibson makes a very niche movie exclusively with and for another continent , he 'll still need someone in North America to bankroll it . )
If he works at all , Gibson will for the foreseeable future do so by financing and starring in Icon movies -- though even this seemingly safe step is perilous , since getting anyone in the U.S. to star in , distribute or see these movies will be tricky .
( Well , that 's not true .
He should be able to lure people who are n't black , Jewish , female or have any sense of moral decency . )
The fat lady has n't just sung -- she 's changed out of her gown and hit the showers .
Culturally , of course , the drama will continue to play out , as will the punditry .
It is telling that it took a second round of unforgivable comments -- this time propagating the ugliest stereotypes about blacks , just as his 2006 remarks did about Jews -- for the nail to enter the coffin .
Equally interesting is a contemplation of what the reaction might have been had the sequence of these two awful incidents been flipped , what with only agency honcho Ari Emanuel and some scattered others coming out and condemning Gibson when he drunkenly told a policewoman that Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world .
Actually , strike that , because even now the silence is deafening .
This would seem like a good time to make a public statement , Jodie Foster , longtime friendship or not .
Then again , it 's not like Gibson had a terribly robust career over the last four years , so in a way you could say that Emanuel 's 2006 call for a boycott served it purpose .
But Gibson did take meetings and did land several roles , and as sad as it is that someone with all this experience could walk the world in his own bubble of hate , it 's perhaps sadder that it took so many of us this long to realize what should have been clear all along .

Karun Chandhok will not be racing at the German Grand Prix next weekend , his HRT team announced on Friday , and his place will be taken by Sakon Yamamoto .
The Japanese driver had replaced Bruno Senna for unknown reasons in the previous race at Silverstone , and the Brazilian will be back in action next week at Hockenheim .
Chandhok , however , will not be racing in Germany , the team said .
Hispania said that the Indian was still part of the team and that he was " likely " to be in the car later in the season .
" After Sakon Yamamoto gave a very positive performance in Silverstone , the team has decided to give the Japanese driver another opportunity to drive the car alongside Bruno Senna , " said the team in a statement .
" Karun Chandhok is still part of the Hispania Racing , HRT F1 Team family and is likely to be in the car at some later races this season . "
Yamamoto raced alongside Chandhok at the British Grand Prix , where the Japanese driver finished in 20th position behind the Indian .

That 's about $ 80 less than a new Kindle , and pretty much one of the cheapest ebook readers you can buy .

The Kindle refurb still qualifies for customer service and Amazon 's 30 - day return policy , and represents a $ 30 price cut for the refurbished model .
Could it be that they 're clearing out inventory in preparation for a new Kindle ?
Probably .

6 After Captain America : Fighting American
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Joe Simon and Jack Kirby were true visionaries :
They created Captain America in late 1940 , a full year before the U.S. got involved in World War II , and they had him punching Hitler in the face as early as March 1941 .
When Marvel Comics put out the first issue of Captain America , the character became an overnight sensation .
Simon and Kirby were immediately flooded by fan mail and even death threats from Nazi sympathizers .

So when Marvel relaunched the character in 1953 without Simon or Kirby 's involvement , they called bullshit .
Similar to the creators of Superman , they felt they had been swindled and decided to do something about it .
Unlike Superman 's creators , they did n't even try to come up with a new character - they simply did a Captain America rip - off at another company .
This time Simon and Kirby owned the copyright , so by their own admission , they " were determined to make the public forget about Captain America . "
Here 's what they came up with :

June 7 , 2010
Denver -- Colorado has enacted statewide regulations for the medical marijuana industry which could potentially allow hundreds of dispensaries to continue operating .
Gov. Bill Ritter on Monday signed two bills passed by lawmakers this session to rein in the estimated 1,100 medical marijuana dispensaries that have cropped up around the state .
Both laws take effect immediately .
One allows only doctors in good standing to recommend medical marijuana .
The other sets up a uniform set of rules for marijuana dispensaries as well as growers and makers of marijuana - infused snacks preferred by some patients .
Regulators expect only about half of the existing dispensaries to be able to continue operating under the rules .
In his state of the state message in January , Ritter urged the industry to work with communities and law enforcement to come up with compromises that protect the public and patients using medical marijuana .
" The companion measures I signed today strike a delicate balance between protecting public safety and respecting the will of the voters , " Ritter said .
The measures face potential legal challenges from supporters who say they go too far , allowing communities like Vail , Aurora , Superior , Arapahoe County and Colorado Springs to clamp down on the industry .
" On the one hand , we are pleased it legitimizes this health care industry ; however , we are concerned it may be overly strict and could cut off patient access to medication as a result of the dwindling number of dispensaries , " said Brian Vicente , executive director of Sensible Colorado , a medical marijuana patients ' group .
Under the new laws , cities and counties are able ban dispensaries within their borders .
In places where they 're allowed , owners will have to undergo criminal background checks .
Dispensaries must grow 70 percent of their marijuana , a provision aimed at keeping tabs on where it is being sold .
Karen O'Keefe , director of state policies for the Marijuana Policy Project , said a state - regulated medical marijuana program is already in effect in New Mexico and similar programs will soon be operational in Rhode Island , Maine , New Jersey and Washington , D.C .
O'Keefe said the number of sanctioned dispensaries to be allowed in each of those states and the District of Columbia is fewer than 10 .
Colorado's law will authorize hundreds , and potentially more if future demand increases .
Colorado 's medical marijuana industry will be overseen by the state revenue department in much the same way that casinos are regulated .
Inspectors will investigate the books of marijuana businesses to look for criminal ties .
Fees to be set by regulators will pay for the system , and smaller dispensary owners fear they may not be able to afford them .
Some dispensaries will also likely have to merge with growers to meet the requirement that they grow most of their own pot .

Another South Park Song To Hit Rock Band

That 's what I thought .
This is n't the only track , but it is obviously the best out of next week 's DLC for Rock Band .

So if you are a fan of her " music " for some reason , you can give her tracks a whirl .
But the Cartman Poker Face should totally be on the list of downloads once it becomes available .
Recently there was a lot of racket about results presented in papers by a pair Nicholas Christakis & James Fowler .
Their papers gained a lot of attention both in the academic world as well as in media .
In their papers they claim to provide evidence for social contagion ( transmission through social networks ) of several types of individual characteristics .
They wrote articles addressing , among other , social transmission of : obesity ( friends of obese people are likely to be obese too ) , smoking ( smokers tend to be friends with smokers ) , happiness ( friends of happy people tend to be happy too ) , or loneliness ( people are more likely to feel lonely if their friends feel lonely too , my personal favourite … ) .
All of these are based on data from Farmingham Heart Study about which I wrote some time ago .
For the reference , the relevant papers are listed at the bottom .
Authors claim to find very strong effects which they attribute to social transmission of the studied characteristic ( obesity , smoking etc. ) dismissing other potential explanations based on various arguments .
I am sure for anybody interested these things the results were jaw - dropping .
For example , in the case of obesity , the reported result was that if your friend is obese then you risk for becoming obese increases by 57 % (! ) as compared to the situation if your friend did not become obese .
For an overly - critical person like me the results were not so much jaw - dropping but eyebrow - raising .
Among other things , to me , the results were based on somewhat strange analytical techniques where , at the same time , social networks literature suggests different approaches .
Christakis & Fowler were not referring to the existing methodology at all .
Most notably to SIENA models for network and behavior dynamics or models for social selection and social influence developed by people at MelNet .
I was not the only one not fully convinced , see for example here or here .
Anyway , I ’m not going to review all the results here as somebody did that pretty well recently .
The paper The Spread of Evidence – Poor Medicine via Flawed Social Network Analysis was uploaded couple of days ago to the Arxiv .
The author , Russel Lyons , mathematician from Indiana University , takes a closer look at the papers I mentioned .
In general , he finds flaws that range from problems in the arcane details of estimation strategy to undergraduate - level mistakes in interpreting confidence intervals .
All the flaws Lyons finds fall into two categories :
Certain aspects of statistical techniques used by Christakis & Fowler are not justified .
The numerical results obtained are misinterpreted .
The bottom line is : substantive claims Christakis & Fowler make are not supported by results they show .
Again , I ’m not going to copy - paste from Lyons ’ paper .
Have a look yourself here .
Couple of end - thoughts :
It ’s great that somebody took a detailed and closer look at this research .
It is a contribution to the public good .
How come the mentioned papers by Christakis and Fowler passed the reviews in , what seems to be , quite respected journals ?
Especially that some of the mistakes seem to be very basic .
Perhaps we need to move forward from the present journal reviewing system to something like Open - Source Science 2.0 ?
All the scientific publications should be transparent as it goes for data and methods used .
I ’m thinking about systems in the flavor of “ literate statistical analysis ” like Sweave in R. Moreover , all scientific publications could be reviewed and commented upon publicly on the Web ?
Much like Talk pages on Wikipedia …

We have discussed in our previous post the decorator pattern ’s role , and giving a very detailed illustration about it .
Also , we have discussed its design varieties and clarified when to use each design and why .
Today , we will complete our discussion about decorator pattern .
We will talk deeply about different examples from the real world cases to give you more deep understanding of this pattern .
Also , we will discuss when to use this pattern in real world situations .
We will demonstrate first a simple example and then move on to a more complicated ones and more variations .
1 – Example : Use Case Diagram Tool
Use case diagram is one of the fundamental diagrams of the unified modeling language ( UML ) .
We use the use case diagrams to describe all the use cases a user can interact with within an application .
Here , we will start to build a simple ( Really , it is a very simple , just for demonstrations purposes ) use case diagram tool .
If we look more thoughtfully into the available shapes that can be drawn in a use case diagram , we will find them to be 3 main shapes :
Actors .
Use cases .
Arrows ( which represent relationships between actors , or between use cases or between actors and use cases ) .
But a more deep look , we will find that each shape has a different look in a different situations .
As described in the following diagram , some of the variations that could be applied to any shape during drawing process of use case diagrams :
The challenge here that we want to build an application that covers all the variations available and with an ability to add more shapes in futures in case of any updates happens to UML .
Here comes the magic of the decorator pattern .
Let ’s get started :
Analyzing the last diagram shows us that we have 3 main shapes with different variations .
Variations means here decorators which can be applied to different shapes to show us the right final shape .
More analyzing , we are noticing that we have some kind of hybrid decorators like for example , dotted line with a tag .
In fact , they are two decorators tag decorator and dotted line decorator .
Let ’s first start with one shape and then we will elaborate on this .
I Shape interface and Actor class :
IShape Interface :
public interface IShape { Bitmap Draw ( ) ; }
Actor Class :
public class Actor : I Shape { public Bitmap Draw ( ) { Bitmap image = new Bitmap ( 200 , 200 ) ; using ( Graphics graphics = Graphics . FromImage ( image ) ) { using ( Pen black Pen = new Pen( Brushes .
Black ) ) { //
Drawing head graphics .
DrawEllipse( blackPen , 100 , 20 , 20 , 20 ) ; // Drawing backbone graphics .
DrawLine ( blackPen , 110 , 40 , 110 , 80 ) ; // Drawing arms graphics .
DrawLine ( blackPen , 110 , 55 , 130 , 55 ) ; graphics .
DrawLine ( blackPen , 110 , 55 , 90 , 55 ) ; // Drawing legs graphics .
DrawLine ( blackPen , 110 , 80 , 130 , 100 ) ; graphics .DrawLine ( blackPen , 110 , 80 , 90 , 100 ) ; } } return image ; } }
If we try now to use this class with a windows forms application in .NET for example you will write just like the following code after dragging a picture box into the form :
Actor actor = new Actor ( ) ; pictureBox1.
Image = actor . Draw ( ) ;
Run the project , you will see :
Now we need to add some sugar , so let ’s add a decorator called TagDecorator which will be responsible for adding tags ( titles ) to any shape .
Here is the class diagram ( following the guidelines of decorator patterns ) :
TagDecorator Class :
public class TagDecorator : I Shape { private IShape _shape ; private string _tag ; public TagDecorator ( IShape shape , string tag ) { _shape = shape ; _tag = tag ; } public Bitmap Draw ( ) { //
Getting the actor shape without tags Bitmap image = _shape .
Draw ( ) ; //
Writing the tag under the actor shape using ( Graphics grahpics = Graphics . FromImage ( image ) ) { grahpics .
TextRenderingHint = System .
Drawing .Text.TextRenderingHint .
AntiAlias ; StringFormat stringFormat = new StringFormat { Alignment = StringAlignment .
Center , LineAlignment = StringAlignment .
Center } ; grahpics .DrawString ( _tag , new Font ( " Times New Roman " , 12 ) , Brushes .
Black , new Rectangle F ( 10 , 110 , 200 , 20 ) , stringFormat ) ; } return image ; } }
Let ’s try to draw this decorated actor to the form .
So we will write this code :
Actor actor = new Actor ( ) ; TagDecorator actorTag = new TagDecorator ( actor , " User " ) ; pictureBox1. Image = actorTag. Draw ( ) ;
And see the output :
Now let ’s make things more complicated , I will just give you the concepts and let you try to implement them .
What if we want to add more shapes , simply we will use the following diagram :
What about more decorators ?!
Go , and try to build you own diagramming tool .
2 – Real World Examples
Now we will demonstrate some real world examples may be we are using in a daily basis but we do n’t know .
In a very good article by Rob Pierry , he discussed when a decorator pattern has been used within .
NET .
He Said :
“ Any useful executable program involves either reading input , writing output , or both .
Regardless of the source of the data being read or written , it can be treated abstractly as a sequence of bytes .
. NET uses the System .
IO .
Stream class to represent this abstraction .
Whether the data involves characters in a text file , TCP / IP network traffic , or something else entirely , chances are you will have access to it via a Stream .
Since the class for working with file data ( FileStream ) and the class for working with network traffic ( NetworkStream ) both inherit from Stream , you can easily write code that processes the data independent of its origins .
Here ’s a method for printing out some bytes from a Stream to the console :
public static void PrintBytes ( Stream s ) { int b ; while ( ( b = fs.ReadByte ( ) ) >=
0 ) { Console .
Write ( b + " " ) ; } }
Reading a single byte at a time is typically not the most efficient way to access a stream .
For example , hard drives are capable of ( and optimized for ) reading continuous blocks of data from the disk in a big chunk .
If you know you are going to be reading several characters , it is better to read a chunk from the disk all at once and then consume the chunk from memory byte by byte .
The Framework includes the BufferedStream class for doing just that .
The constructor for Buffered Stream takes as the parameter whatever stream you would like buffered access to .
Buffered Stream overrides the main methods of Stream , such as Read and Write , to provide more functionality .
Since it is still a child class of Stream , you can use it the same as any other Stream ( note that FileStream includes its own buffering capabilities ) .
Similarly , you can use System .
Security .
Cryptography .
CryptoStream to encrypt and decrypt Streams on the fly , without the rest of the application needing to know anything more than the fact that it is a Stream .
This ability to dynamically attach new functionality to objects transparently using composition is an example of the Decorator pattern ” .
This is valid also for Java developers as well as far as I know in java .
io namespace .
Let ’s also demonstrate a more general real examples :
Here are four ways the Decorator pattern is used in the real world ( Excerpt from C# 3.0 Design patterns ) :
As our small example illustrated , the Decorator pattern fits well in the graphics world .
It is equally at home with video and sound ; for instance , video streaming can be compressed at different rates , and sound can be input to a simultaneous translation service .
At a more mundane level , decorators abound in the I/O APIs of C# as illustrated .
In today ’s world of mobile devices , web browsers and other mobile applications thrive on the Decorator pattern .
They can create display objects suitable for smaller screens that include scroll bars and exclude banners that would be standard on desktop display browsers , for example .
The Decorator pattern is so useful that there are now actual Decorator classes in .NET 3.0 .
The one in System .
Windows .
Controls “ provides a base class for elements that apply effects onto or around a single child element , such as Border or Viewbox . ”
3 – When to use ?
When you have :
An existing component class that may be unavailable for subclassing .
Or When you want to :
Attach additional state or behavior to an object dynamically .
Make changes to some objects in a class without affecting others .
Avoid subclassing because too many classes could result .
4 – Finally
At last , we have finished demonstrating this pattern .
Our next one is Proxy pattern .
So , be with us 🙂
WASHINGTON — Gay rights activists protested the defeat of bill S. 743 Monday , saying that the proposed legislation giving homosexuals the right to marry was derailed by the National Association of Semi-personalized Linens Manufacturers ( NASLM ) , a powerful lobby representing the nation 's gender - specific bath - towel makers .
" The special interests of those producing matching knickknacks for traditional heterosexual couples have been over - represented in this debate for far too long , " said GLAAD president Neil Giuliano , citing the influential lobby 's contribution of more than $ 95 million in campaign funds during the last election cycle .
" We cannot allow the outdated values of a profiteering minority of towel makers stand in the way of social change . "
NASLM released a statement in response to Giuliano 's criticism that expressed the organization 's belief that " marriage is a sacred bond between a his and a hers . "

Newly published election spending figures show Sarah Palin ended the last quarter with a war chest of more than $ 1 m , suggesting gathering momentum for a run at the White House in 2012 .
Her political action committee , a body for raising and distributing election cash , raised $ 866,000 in the three months from April 1 , the most since it was formed in January 2009 .
She spent about $ 742,000 over the quarter , most of it on building up her political profile and base support .
Palin , who enjoys the support of the Tea Party and other grassroots activists but is distrusted by the Republican party establishment , has not yet said whether she will stand as a candidate .
She and other potential rivals for the Republican nomination would normally begin to make their intentions clear early next year , in the wake of November 's Congressional mid-term elections .
But a breakdown of money raised and spent by Palin suggests she is putting in place the political framework for a bid .
She spent almost twice as much as in any previous quarter , much of it on speechwriters , private jets for public appearances , and hiring consultants to advise her on domestic and foreign policy , which were embarrassing weaknesses during her vice - presidential run in 2008 .
She is also taking on more staff , including for the first time someone to keep control of her schedule .
Until now , her organisation has tended to be chaotic .
John Ellis , a conservative political analyst , predicted she would be the de facto Republican frontrunner by December and that , by then , it may be too late for the party to do anything about it .
Ellis wrote on his blogsite : " ' She 's too stupid ' is what the Establishment GOP really thinks about Sarah Palin .
' Good - looking , ' but a ' ditz ' .
This is unfertile ground , since Palin can turn the argument on a dime and say : ' They drive the country into bankruptcy , they underwrite Fannie and Freddie , they bail out Goldman Sachs , they fight wars they do n't want to win , they say enforcing the immigration laws is silly and they call me stupid !
I 'll give you a choice : you can have their smarts or my stupidity , which one do you want ? '
A large number of GOP presidential primary voters will take Palin's " stupidity " in a heartbeat . "
Palin 's potential Republican rivals , who have also set up PACs , include Mitt Romney , the multi-millionaire and former governor of Massachusetts who was John McCain 's closest competitor for the Republican nomination in 2008 , Mike Huckabee , the former governor of Arkansas who has a strong following among evangelical Christians , and Tim Pawlenty , governor of Minnesota .
Small donors have contributed substantially to Palin 's funds , reflecting her grassroots support .
Tim Crawford , the PAC treasurer , told the Politico website that 8,000 new donors have been added in the last quarter , bringing the total of contributors to 25,000 .
" Essentially when we started last January , we started from scratch , " Crawford said .
" We did n't have a big base of people coming out of the presidential campaign .
Everybody knew that there was this massive amount of support , but she did n't have it , because all that stuff was property of the McCain campaign .
But now , I think we 've got a pretty formidable thing going on , and it grows every day . "
As well as spending on building her own support , Palin distributed $ 87,500 in the last quarter to Republican candidates she is backing in the elections for Congress and governorships in November .
If you 're building an internal or private cloud , Canonical wants you to use Ubuntu Linux 10.04 as your operating system of choice .
To that end , the newest version of Ubuntu includes a feature set called Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud .
In keeping with its open source pedigree , Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud is integrated with the open source Eucalyptus http://www.networkworld.com/slideshows/2009/110909-open-source-companies-list.html#slide4 private cloud platform , making it possible to create a private cloud with much less configuration than installing Linux first , then Eucalyptus .
If you 're building an internal or private cloud , Canonical wants you to use Ubuntu Linux 10.04 as your operating system of choice .
To that end , the newest version of Ubuntu includes a feature set called Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud .
See how we conducted this test |
First - ever test of public cloud management wares
In keeping with its open source pedigree , Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud is integrated with the open source Eucalyptus private cloud platform , making it possible to create a private cloud with much less configuration than installing Linux first , then Eucalyptus .
And for those thinking about eventually moving resources to the public cloud , or simply bursting to the public cloud when workloads spike , the Ubuntu / Eucalyptus internal cloud offering is designed to be compatible with Amazon 's EC2 public cloud service .
On the flip side , you 'll need to familiarize yourself with both Ubuntu and Eucalyptus , as Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud 's dependence on Eucalyptus will force you to reach beyond Ubuntu documentation when problems occur .
For example , we found Ubuntu had weak documentation for customizing images , an important step in deploying Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud .
Basically , Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud can be deployed on internal hardware to run job / batch applications .
The idea is to initially allocate storage , then rapidly build multiple virtual machines to process data , collect the data , then tear down the infrastructure for re-use by a subsequent purpose .
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud provides internal cloud control methods that closely mime what can be done on Amazon 's public cloud infrastructure .
Its tools can be used to process recurring jobs or one - shot distributed applications , like DNA analysis , video rendering , or database table reformatting / reindexing .
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud uses the open source kernel - based virtual machine ( KVM ) platform to host virtual machines that run on the backend nodes .
This is important because there are extra Eucalyptus - provided images that include both the KVM and Xen kernels , but you must use the KVM ones if you 're important them into Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud .
Getting started
In order to successfully run Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud , we had to have at least two dedicated systems .
One is used for the front - end applications , which include a Cloud Controller , a Cluster Controller , Walrus Controller , and the Storage Controller .
The other system became a node machine that ran the hosted virtual machines .
The controller services were easy to understand since they 're similar to Amazon EC2 Cloud components .
The Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Cloud Controller is the front - end service application — the one to connect to for managing cloud services .
It understands EC2 API calls , and offered us its Web user interface .
The Cluster Controller , in turn , manages each cluster of node ( VM ) resources , and talks to the node / VM host via the open source libvrt library .
We could use as many nodes as we had hardware resources to cram them into ; Canonical recommends baseline hardware and recommends faster components , even down to disk speed .
The Walrus Controller acts as a storage mechanism like Amazon 's S3 ( Simple Storage Service ) for data storage or storing VM images .
The Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Storage Controller , like Amazon Elastic Block Storage ( EBS ) , makes persistent virtual disks to attach to running instances — active resource storage virtualization control .
Each cluster can have a Storage Controller for the convenience of management , snapshots , object aggregation , and so on .
Installation
Installation was very simple ; we inserted the Ubuntu Server CD , selected Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud , and drank energy drinks .
When installing , all we had to do was select options and if more information was needed , boxes would pop up for us to enter our choices , such as hostname or an elastic IP address range .
The installer automatically creates certificates , keys , private keys and other relevant data .
One would have to do most of this manually if setting up Eucalyptus alone .
Next , we installed a node by running installation for nodes .
If both machines are on the same network , the node will automatically find the cluster and cloud controllers .
There are different network topologies available depending upon how many machines are available to be used , but Ubuntu does n't recommend a single machine for production environments , even though it is possible .
Setup / Configuration
Job requirements and their applications dictate configuration of Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud .
Most of the setup was taken care of by the installer .
In order to use Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud , we connected to the Web interface , and logged in with the default user admin / admin .
We then setup our user by changing the password .
We also had to enter other information such as e-mail and name , but some optional metadata could be entered as well , such as telephone number , project leader , project description and affiliation .
Once done , we could download a zip file that included our credentials ( X.509 certs , public / private key pairs ) which can be used with Amazon EC2 tools ( or the Eucalyptus tools and certain other third - party tools ) .
Also , you can get a query ID and secret key for use with Amazon - like tools .
HybridFox , a Firefox plug - in , seemed to be the simplest and quickest tool to setup that we could find to make managing the cloud much simpler ( as opposed to ssh'ing into the cloud server using only command line tools ) .
For power conservation , we could manage power for nodes not in use , turning them on for jobs , then off when done .
After setting this up , it 's automatic and the controller will remotely turn on and off the machines when necessary .
To manage this , we had to turn Wake - On - LAN for our network interface on the node .
In addition , the server host machine needs to be able to support at least one of the following of several common Linux power management commands : pm-suspend , pm-hibernate or poweroff .
The default setting is for the machine to use one of the previous commands if it has n't been used in 5 minutes ( and , of course , no instances running ) .
We tested this and it seemed to work well , after 5 minutes our node turned off .
We then tried loading a new instance , and the machine turned back on and started to run the instance .
This seems like a pretty good way to save power when your nodes are not being used — without having to perhaps walk across a campus and flip power switches .
Image Bundles
With each job there 's a VM instance that 's preconfigured to do a piece or all of the work .
The OS is designed to use only the components needed .
Once a VM is built , it can also be replicated so that multiple concurrent instances can do many jobs , or many pieces of a job or batch application processing .
Bundling Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Linux images is very similar to the Amazon EC2 method of bundling images and uses almost the exact same commands .
If you are familiar with how EC2 does this , then you should have no problems here either .
If not , the Eucalyptus Web page docs supply information on its bundling command , euca - bundle - vol .
To bundle our VM , we started off with a base Ubuntu 10.04 Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud server image .
After launching this instance , we used ssh to link into the machine and follow the instructions to install more application functionality options , in this case we used the LAMP server option .
After this initial installation , we upgraded to the latest packages , then installed our test Web site .
The bundle was then built using the command line tools .
The bundling commands are n't smart enough to do things like check disk space first .
Image setup , as mentioned , is n't fun .
After a lot of trial and error , here are the commands we used to bundle an image ( after updating everything ) running the latest Ubuntu 10.04 ( from within the virtual environment itself ) : euca - bundle - image - i /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic -pae -- ramdisk true -r i386
These nine commands are easily scripted to make the components of the bundle : ramdisk , kernel , and image .
Note the use of easily understood XML .
We wish the docs had better instructions .
euca - upload - bundle - b lamp - bucket -m /tmp/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic-pae.manifest.xml
euca - register lamp - bucket / initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic-pae.manifest.xml
euca - bundle - image - i /boot / vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic-pae -- kernel true -r i386
euca - upload - bundle - b lamp - bucket -m /tmp/vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic-pae.manifest.xml
euca - register lamp - bucket / vmlinuz-2.6.32-21-generic-pae.manifest.xml
euca - bundle - vol -p lamp - server -d / mnt -- kernel eki-0E6C159C -- ramdisk eri-4FE51677 -r i386 -s 5120
euca - upload - bundle - b lamp - bucket -m /mnt/lamp-server.manifest.xml
euca - register lamp - bucket/lamp-server.manifest.xml
Usage / Monitoring
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud uses the Eucalyptus " euca ' commands , similar to those used for Amazon , allowing you to monitor and manage instances .
Examples include HybridFox , a third - party plug - in based upon Amazon 's ElasticFox , a Firefox browser extension that provides a simple GUI for accessing , monitoring and using the cloud resources .
In our testing , ElasticFox did n't work , since the latest version is no longer compatible with Eucalyptus .
But HybridFox did work .
Combining HybridFox with the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Web interface made it simple to manage a private cloud .
We suggest using this combination , and it would make a great addition to the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud download .
With HybridFox , we could see all our images , instances , security keypairs , security groups , elastic IP addresses , EBS volumes , and clusters .
We could create new instances from images , connect to those instances via ssh , add or edit our keypairs and security groups , create , delete or attach EBS volumes .
Sadly , we could n't create new bundles from running instances or upload bundles .
We still had to do this from the command line .
Conclusion
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud provides tight integration between Ubuntu and Ecalyptus and a series of CLI tools ( made even more simple by apps like HybridFox with gives them a GUI ) that follows along Amazon 's construction .
Work done for Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud ends up being somewhat reusable if you 're transporting your work to Amazon .
What 's missing are the rich pre-made bundles used by RightScale and others that make short work of typical tasks .
Nonetheless , a few hours of work is rewarded by reusable Ubuntu private cloud job / batch control components .
If public cloud makes you nervous , here 's a way to deploy cloud computing inside your data center .

Call me crazy , but it seems that there is a large influx of Ruby programmers exploring the Clojure programming language .
Based on the results of Chas Emerick ’s great State of Clojure – Summer 2010 survey , 17 % of surveyed Clojure users come from a Ruby background .
Based on observed trends , I expect that percentage to grow in the next round .
But why ?
An Opening of Minds
Paul Graham ’s seminal essays on Lisp were an incredible boon for reawakening the public ’s interest in the language .
I imagine many programmers , like myself , were awe - struck when reading Beating the Averages for the first time .
While I had previous experience with Lisp in a university setting , I was never able to crystalize my feelings on the matter .
Upon reading that essay in early 2001 I was driven to an incredible urge to “ get me some of that ” — which I did by enrolling in an Artificial Intelligence graduate school program in the fall of the same year .
I believe , based on personal conversations that there were many who had a similar urge , but chose a different path — the path of “ halfway to Lisp ” .
1
That is , I believe that languages2 like Perl , Python , and Ruby managed to capture a significant portion of programmer mindshare because they not only learned their lessons from Lisp , but they put many of its powerful capabilities in the hands of their programmers .
Enter Clojure
And now years later we see that Clojure , while still humble compared to Java , C++ , C , and C# , is gaining increasing popularity and mindshare in the technological zeitgeist .
In increasing cases Clojure seems to be gaining serious consideration for , if not outright adoption .
But again — why ?
In my humble opinion it can be summarized as the result of a feedback loop starting with the influence of Lisp on languages like Ruby which again feedback into an increased interest and adoption of Clojure .
3
ruby.clj
I would love to hear from Ruby programmers on the following observation4 , be it correct or wrong - headed .
The existence of the Lisp feedback loop has lured Ruby programmers in much the same way that Lisp lured them into Ruby in the first place .
That is , Ruby programmers being the adventurous lot to begin with , are not satisfied with “ halfway to Lisp ” .
Instead , they want it all .
That ’s not to say that I think ( nor wish ) Ruby programmers will abandon ship and run arms - wide to Clojure .
Instead , I think that our industry can support both in a complementary relationship modeled ( just to name one such scenario ) much like the inner workings of FlightCaster .
I already see a similar path in Clojure as previously observed in Ruby5 .
That is , Clojure seems to be used in applications already built on cutting edge technologies ( as noted by Chas in his survey results post mentioned in the beginning ) .
Is it really too much to suppose that this environment might also appeal to the Rubyist ?
Finally
I ’ve babbled on enough about this , but let me end by saying that I fully expect that the inclusion of Clojure into the Well - Grounded Rubyist ’s6 arsenal will work to strengthen said Rubyist ’s skills and indeed the language itself .
Likewise , the presence of Ruby mindshare into the Clojure community will help to motivate a continuing culture of practicality , while also maintaining cutting edge , yet practical , exploration .
Welcome Rubyists7 — it ’s a pleasure .

Having swapped Fulham FC for Liverpool FC during the summer , Roy Hodgson 's quest for a second successive UEFA Europa League final begins on Friday with the draw for the third qualifying round , streamed live on UEFA.com from 13.30CET .
Fulham 's extra -time defeat by Club Atlético de Madrid in May's Hamburg showpiece proved to be Hodgson 's last game in charge and , having moved north this summer , his first match at the Liverpool helm will come in the same competition .
He will learn who stands between his new charges and the play - offs after the draw in Nyon , with ties to be played on 29 July and 5 August .
The five - time European Champion Clubs '
Cup winners are not the only side with continental pedigree awaiting their fate .
Two - time European champions Juventus and 1991 titleholders FK Crvena Zvezda are also in the running along with UEFA Champions League regulars Sporting Clube de Portugal , VfB Stuttgart and 2000 UEFA Cup victors Galatasaray AŞ .
IFK Göteborg have two UEFA Cups to their name , though for Russia 's FC Sibir Novosibirsk and Polish Cup winners Jagiellonia Białystok this represents a first step onto the European stage .
Montpellier Hérault SC return to continental competition after an 11 - year absence while Czech Cup holders FC Viktoria Plzeň will hope for a better draw than their only previous European tie in 1971 – Gerd Müller scored twice in a 7 - 1 aggregate win for FC Bayern München .
These sides are among 30 new contenders who will join 40 second qualifying round victors in Friday 's draw .
That could include Olympiacos FC , Beşiktaş JK and an APOEL FC team that contested last season 's UEFA Champions League group stage .
Draw format
The 70 sides will be allocated to seven groups of ten teams .
Each group is split into equal numbers of seeded and unseeded teams according to club rankings , and balls containing seeded teams will be placed in one bowl and unseeded teams in another .
A ball from each bowl will be placed in a large empty bowl , where they are shuffled .
The first side drawn will play its first match at home , against the second team drawn .
Clubs from the same association may not be drawn against each other .

More news of the latest member of Samsung ’s Galaxy family is starting to flow in .
this time around a Vietnamese site by the name of Tinh Te , is claiming to have information on a few specs .
If they are true this will be a pretty impressive tablet .
Samsung has a history of being able to deliver hardware pretty quick so the wait for this slate may not be as long as most .
Some of the rumored specs include Android 2.2 , yes folks , this may very well be the first Froyo powered Android tablet .
Also , there ’s a 1.2GHz ARM Cortex A8 processor , 16GB of on - board storage and a microSD slot that can handle up to 32GB .
That would bring the grand total to 48 GB which is enough for all your movies and music .
The 4,000 mAh battery should be enough to last you throughout the day .
From the leaked picture , there appears to be a front facing camera .
This tablet should come with the GPU from the Galaxy S and the DLNA capabilities .
There was no mention of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but I fully expect them to be included .
It 's been just over 3 years since the Haskell community server was started , and since then 372 projects have been created .
While work goes on behind the scenes to move community to a more powerful server , with a recently enlarged sysadmin team running it , here are some stats for what it 's being used for .
Almost all projects use community for hosting source code , but many also use it for a trac bug tracker , a web page , and a mailing list :
Working out what licence projects use , without a lot of manual effort , is tricky , but hopefully this is a good approximation :
This data is based on licence files , and licence fields in Cabal files , within project 's / srv/code directories .
The total is more than 100 % as soem projects contain files under multiple licences , and it is likely that there are further licences that have been missed .
In particular , licences for document such as RFCs and academic papers will likely have been missed .
Unsurprisingly , BSD3 is the most common license , with GPL and LGPL next .
The " Haskell " licence is the licence used for the Haskell98 report .
Interestingly , the picture is a little different if we look at the number of bytes under each licence :
The " Haskell " licence is much higher now , as it includes any project containing a GHC tree ( which is large ) .
GHC trees also get marked as using the GPL ( due to a Cabal file in Cabal 's testsuite , although some of the Windows tarballs contain GPLed programs anyway ) and there are also some large projects using the GPL ; the combination puts GPL ahead of BSD3 .
Looking at the number of users per project , most have a single developer , and the number tails of as one would expect :
Most projects have seen activity ( defined as " a file in the / srv/ code directory has been modified ) within the last 6 months , and more than two thirds within the last year .
Inevitably , there are some that appear dormant :
Finally , here 's a breakdown of the disk usage on community :
We ’ve all heard that “ one man ’s trash is another mans treasure ” .
That saying takes on new meaning when we view the world through the eyes of the artists featured in todays post .
These talented individuals see possibility in the things we throw away every day .
Instead of heading to the art supply store they just collect common trash and turn it into works of amazing art .
Take a look at these 40 terrific works of art made from common trash and be prepared to start looking at your garbage in a whole new way .
Artworks Made From Trash
Ann P. Smith
This awesome owl and bird sculpture was made from reclaimed electronic trash .
It reminds me of the mechanical owl in The Clash of the Titans .
This ram looks like anything but trash .
Each piece fits perfectly .
These delicate birds and other sculptures by Ann can be bought at her store online .
Belen Hermosa
Got a few thousand CDs lying around ?
Have a seat .
Lamponi
Lamponi make some really cool lamps from trash .
This one was an old steam iron .
An old ice scoop makes a good lampshade .
This old school hair dryer lamp and others are actually available to purchase .
Check out the site for more far out creations .
Alex Andromeda
This three - legged beast is made from electronic garbage .
Computer circuit boards make up this work of art that almost looks like a burning man effigy .
It ’s hard to believe that this intricate motorcycle was made from random bits of trash .
Amazing !
Austinevan
This huge dragon was created using aluminium cans .
Law Kevin
What a stunning sculpture .
Notice the computer mouse teeth and the washing machine door eyes .
Sayaka Kajita
Sayaka uses reclaimed plastic material to build her wonderful sculptures .
Look closely at these two and you can see plastic spoons .

Baghdad suicide bomber kills at least 43 people Published duration 18 July 2010
media caption The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse : " As a policeman tried to stop the man , he detonated the explosives inside his vest "
A suicide bomber has killed at least 43 people and injured 40 more southwest of Baghdad , Iraqi police say .
The attack targeted government - backed Sunni militia members lining up to be paid in the neighbourhood of Radwaniya .
The Sunni militia fighters , known as the Sahwa or Awakening Councils , were once allied with al - Qaeda , but turned against the militant group in 2006 .
Among the dead were at least six soldiers and three accountants , the Associated Press news agency reported .
At least 13 soldiers were also wounded , along with four accountants .
" There were more than 85 people lined up in three lines at the main gate of the military base to receive salaries when a person approached us , " a survivor , 20 - year - old Tayseer Mehsen , told the Reuters news agency at Mahmudiya hospital .
" When one of the soldiers tried to stop him , he blew himself up . "
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Baghdad says the Sahwa are credited with helping to reduce the overall levels of violence in Iraq since they joined the US military and government forces in the fight against al - Qaeda .
He says that the Sahwa have been increasinly targeted by militants in recent months and have complained that their state - support is evaporating .
The Sons of Iraq , as members of the militia are also known , have recently reported cases of harassment from government troops as a political vacuum continues following inconclusive elections in March .
Sunni insurgents have sought to exploit the deadlock created by a failure of Sunni , Shia and Kurdish factions to agree on a new coalition government .
The two lists which won most seats are still bickering over who should be the next prime minister .
Both former prime minister Iyad Allawi and incumbent Nouri Maliki insist that they are best placed to lead the war - torn country .
There are fears that the political uncertainty could hinder the planned withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq by the end of August , in preparation for a full military departure by 2012 .
The Department of Investigation , New York City 's anti-corruption watchdog , arrested more people in the last 12 months than in any year in the agency 's 137 - year history .
The 822 arrests in the fiscal year that ended Wednesday is a 12 % increase from the prior one .
The investigations have run the gamut , probing officials at the highest levels — resulting in the indictment of a sitting councilman — to a steady stream of charges against low - level employees for a variety of schemes .

President Obama vowed at a closed - door White House meeting with Congressional leaders yesterday , July 27 , that Democrats will end the Bush tax cuts for the rich and continue the middle class tax cuts they enacted last year .
Rep. John Boehner of Ohio , the GOP House Minority Leader clashed with the president , saying the tax cuts for the rich should be extended .
Obama said that the Republicans enacted tax cuts for the wealthy ten years ago , knowing they would help fuel deficits that would be left for another administration .
“ I was n’t there , ” Mr. Boehner claimed .
“ I did n’t structure that deal . ”
The room reportedly fell silent as the Congressional leaders digested the statement by Boehner who was first elected in 1990 .
“ How long have you been here ? ” a Democrat asked Boehner , as the room broke out into laughter .
The Republicans in the room claimed that failing to extend the tax cuts for the wealthy would kill jobs provided by their companies but the president said most small business owners would not be affected since they do not have high enough income to be taxed at the two highest rates .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs later told reporters that the president believes the tax cuts for the richest households – those individuals making more than $ 200,000 a year and couples with more than $ 250,000 – “ are tax cuts that , based on our fiscal situation , simply ca n’t be afforded . ”
New national polling shows large majorities against extension of the Bush tax cuts for the rich .
In some polls even 40 percent of Republicans favor allowing the cuts to expire .
“ That suggests that 40 percent of Republicans , who have been hearing the deficit hysteria since Barack Obama took office , are smarter than your average congressional Republican , ” wrote Joan McCarter of Daily Kos .
“ Where was the growth that was supposed to happen after the Bush tax cuts ? ” asked Matt Yglesias of Thinkprogress.org yesterday .
“ The era during which Bush ’s tax policies prevailed was the first in which median household income declined … the worst peak - to - peak economic performance ever , followed immediately by the worst recession since World War II . ”
There is word on Capitol Hill , however , that not all Democrats can be counted on to back Obama ’s proposal for a permanent extension of the middle - class tax cut .
The Hill reported that an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - Md. , said Democrats were looking at “ other options , ” including temporary extensions of the tax cut that would last more than a year .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , has backed Obama ’s policy of extending the middle - class tax cuts permanently .
Sen . Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , recently said he was “ open ” to a temporary extension of those cuts “ that could set the stage for broader tax reform . ”

Three city officials in Bell , Calif. , have agreed to resign after a public uproar over reports that make a combined annual salary of more than $ 1.6 million , the Los Angeles Times reports .
The resignations were announced to an angry crowd after midnight following a city council meeting that was closed to the public because it involved personnel matters .
The three officials , city manager Robert Rizzo , who earns $ 787,000 a year , police chief Randy Adams , who makes $ 456,000 ( more than the police chief of L.A. ) , and assistant city manager Angela Spaccia , who earns $ 376,000 , will not receive severance packages .
CNN reports that the average salary in the blue - collar town of around 37,000 people near Los Angeles is $ 30,000 and the unemployment rate is about 16 % .
The crowd also demanded a recall move against city council members , the newspaper says .
The Times , which first reported the huge salaries last week , notes that that four of the five council members make close to $ 100,000 each per year .
The fifth makes only $ 8,000 .
Times reporter Jeff Gottlieb , in a separate story , writes that the council was able to skirt state salary limits by authorizing a little - noticed special election in 2005 that changed the legal description of Bell from a " general law city " to a " charter city . "
Only around 400 voters turned out for the election , in which the change was the only item on the ballot .
The election was called after adoption the same year of a state law that placed limits on the pay of council members in " general law " cities .
That law , in turn , had been passed in response to high salaries that leaders in the town of South Gate , Calif . , had given themselves .
The author of that law , Assemblyman Hector De La Torre , estimates that if Bell were not a charter city , the council members would earn between $ 10,000 and $ 12,000 a year , the Times says , not $ 100,000 .
City leaders at the times argued that the change was needed to give the council more flexibility to govern .

Four Wheels Good , Two Wheels Bad

There is something profoundly wrong with a nation where more adults ride bicycles than children .
America might now be such a nation .
While kids sit at home texting their friends and slaying computer - generated monsters , a growing number of their parents and grandparents are clogging the roads atop a contraption that was once considered a childs toy .
We will have accurate data when the 2010 census is complete , but there are already strong indications of bicyclings rise in popularity .
Fortunately for red-state America , the phenomenon is more common in urbanized regions along the coasts .
The Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia recently gushed that the 2009 American Community Survey found that the number of commuters [ in Philadelphia ] who rode a bicycle to work rose from 4,778 to 9,410 between 2005 and 2008 : a 97 percent increase in 3 years . 
Two odious ideologies fuel the popularity of bicycling : anti-obesity extremism and eco-lunacy .
Pedal power , we are told , will not only make you thinner , it will reduce your carbon footprint .
( Its a Nanny State twofer . )
Already slim , or pursuing other means to lose weight ?
Like your SUV , and dont swallow the discredited theory that man is baking the planet ?
Then obviously you re an idiot .
In 2003 , BusinessWeek asked Andy Clarke , director of state and local advocacy for the League of American Bicyclists , to respond to the fact that 500,000 Americans commute by bicycle .
The figure was pathetic ,  he snorted , for a nation that should be smarter and wiser . 
Feeling themselves superior to their countrymen in both health and environmental consciousness , many bicyclists flout road rules .
Last year , The Boston Globe reported :  On any hour of any day bicyclists routinely run red lights , ride the wrong way on one - way streets , zip along sidewalks , and cut off pedestrians crossing streets legally -- even though bike riders are supposed to obey the same traffic laws as motorists .
Sometimes , a bicyclist will do all of these things in one two - wheeled swoop .
The city seems unable to stop it .
Writing in the Rocky Mountain News , Arvada , Colorado resident J.M.
Schell admitted that there was a very , very good reason so many view those of us who are cyclists as rude , arrogant jerks .
Most of us are .
Recklessness and lawbreaking notwithstanding , Big Bicycle has attained the status of a lobby that can not be ignored .
 Bikes Belong ,  an agitprop shop sponsored by the U.S. bicycle industry with the goal of putting more people on bicycles more often ,  boasts of  12 professional staff , 18 volunteer directors , and a $ 2 million annual operating budget . 
 Maximizing Federal Support for Bicycling ,  a page on the organizations website , explains that it spent $ 1 million on lobbying between 2002 and 2005 , which ultimately produced  $ 4.5 billion for bicycling and walking in SAFETEA -LU , the transportation law passed in August 2005 .
Where did that money come from ?
You guessed it : the federal gas tax .
( Four out of every ten dollars raised by the levy are diverted to non -highway expenses . )
Where did the dough go ?
To state and local pols , who gleefully commit drivers  forced contributions to dubious bike schemes .
 There s never been so much attention from cities collectively for cycling as a mode of transportation ,  the executive editor of Bicycling magazine swooned to USA Today in 2007 .
 Bike to Work days and weeks are commonplace .
 Bicycle planning  is providing lucrative jobs for bureaucrats eager to wield the coercive power of government to change commuting habits .
Remarkably , Big Bicycle was able to get in on Wall Streets bailout .
The National Center for Bicycling and Walking notes that fedpols  2008 rescue of financial firms included a rather unrelated perk :  Starting January 1 , 2009 , employers who provide bike parking , bathing facilities , tune - ups , or other support for bicycle commuting , can deduct up to $ 20 a month per participating employee from their own taxable income . 
Is bicycle - commuting a credible traffic - fighting tool ?
No , says Cato Institute scholar -- and avid cyclist -- Randal OToole .
 I dont think encouraging cycling is going to reduce congestion or significantly change the transportation makeup of our cities ,  he said .
 There really is very little evidence that any of [ these efforts ] are reducing the amount of driving .
They re just making it more annoying to drivers .
( OToole observes that telecommuting is far more common , and growing faster , than getting to work on a bike . )
Bicycles are wonderful , of course .
For children .
Only misanthropes complain about stopping or yielding to safely accommodate a couple of twelve - year - olds pedaling their way to the fishin hole .
For adults , bicycling has become a finger - wagging , revenue - pilfering , and increasingly obnoxious crusade .

I have bicycle commuted off and on since 1989 .
I ’ve done every STP ( Seattle to Portland ) bike ride since 1991 .
The first 10 years in two days and the rest in one day .
It ’s 200 miles .
I like to bike ride , it keeps me in shape , and I am sharper when I get to work than I am when I ’ve sat in a half hour of rush hour in a car .
A couple of years ago , I counted the cars I PASSED on my 9 mile ride to work .
I passed over 300 “ stop and go ” cars before 100 of them overtook me just before I pulled into the office . :)
I consider a mountain bike to be an excellent form of transportation when you put kevlar belted road tires on it .
And if you leave the mountain tires on it is not only fun , but it can be a good way to get places during economic collapse .
People do not realize just how fast bicycles are compared to cars in an urban area .
Heck , I used to commute 46 miles round trip to my job in the University district .
It took 55 minutes each way by bike and 1 hour and five minutes by bus .
I do n’t force it on anyone else , and I have not gone down on a bike since I was jumping dirt piles in summer of 1965 in eastern Washington .
And no , I do n’t stop at stop signs or even traffic lights if there is no traffic or cops .
And I ’ve been hit by three cars , all of which were badly scratched up by my handlebars and pedals but I stayed up with no damage whatsoever every time .
All that said , what makes it fun is that I do n’t HAVE to .
Nor would I force it on anyone else .

I have a 20 - mile drive to work .
Lately , I am encountering cyclists leaving town when I am within 4 - 5 miles of work .
More annoying is when I am leaving for home and catch them in my lane getting out of town .
They are either retirees or unemployed or perhaps schoolteachers off for the summer .
They seem oblivious to those of us who actually have to be somewhere .
Now I did have a friend once who was an Army Ranger triathlete who used to ride his bike out to my place for a light workout .
Different deal ; dude had it going on and was ready to deploy in defense or our country .
These other clowns are just out for a joy ride .
Maybe they should volunteer putting up square bales if they need exercise .

If you can find safe paths or roads , it beats fighting rush hour .
I can generally bike down to the teens -- tho ' I have biked from 109o in Phoenix down to - 4o in the Twin Cities .
My current job is not too far , but the path goes through some unsafe neighborhoods .
So it 's back to the car for me .
Cheers !

Further ruminations on " if something 's not worth doing , it 's not worth doing well "
This always degenerates into a flamewar when I write it on CT [ 1 ] , but I mean really , look at it .
It 's a random , but certainly not peripheral or nutpicked , example of an article in modern metaphysics & epistemology , on the subject of statements of the form :
" t1
Sue : " Bill could be in Boston "
Ted : " Actually , I just saw him board a flight to Houston "
t2
Sue : " Oh . Then I was wrong " .
Apparently it is very difficult to fit this sort of thing into a consistent logical framework .
It 's not a bad article , or even an uninteresting one - it 's quite fascinating if you like logic puzzles and I do .
But I mean really .
" Oh , maybe I 'm wrong then " - who does n't understand that ?
People who tackle problems like whether phrases like " Oh , maybe I 'm wrong " imply that there are sentences whose truth conditions are indexical to a context of assessment , are , as a fact of sociology , some of the most prestigious and respected members of the profession and generally considered to be the most intelligent .
Problems like this are considered to be the most important and difficult in philosophy .
People who think about questions like " Is war bad ? " , " Does life begin at conception ? " or " Is it immoral to make workers redundant ? " , are much further down the food chain and often working in departments that do n't even have " philosophy " in the title .
Funny old world .
[ 1 ] Strangely , there is always an appreciative audience for material suggesting that economics has gone down a blind alley of pointless formalism , but when the same suggestion is made to the philosophers about their own subject , my gosh they do n't like it .
I think the original reference is in the Talmud , Bava Kama Chapter 5 , " Rules Concerning a Goring Ox " .
[ 2 ] " High theorists " in any subject are , of course , always given to arguing that their abstract methodological discussions are vital in forming the tools which can be used to work on practical problems .
There are two responses to this , which are in the first , " No they are n't " [ 3 ] , and in the second that high theorists certainly do n't act or behave like support staff providing a secondary function to people doing the real work .
[ 3 ] " No " , is imperfect here - the correct response , as the economist said to the philosopher , is a sweep underneath the chin with the fingertips .

An EMT who was accused of callously ignoring a dying , pregnant woman during his coffee break at an Au Bon Pain last year was shot and killed today after a dispute near a SoHo nightclub , police said .
Embattled EMT Jason Green , 32 , and a male pal were trying to get into Greenhouse , a popular club on Varick Street , about 5 a .m. when bouncers turned them away because the friend was n’t properly dressed , officials said .
Minutes later , about a block away from the club , Green and his friend got into a dispute with an armed man who stepped out of a car at Vandam and Hudson streets and opened fire on them , police said .
The man in the vehicle got off at least two shots , striking Green hit twice in the torso .
He later died at New York Downtown Hospital .
Green ’s friend was not injured and was being interviewed by cops .
Green of Jackson Heights had been a target of a criminal probe by the Brooklyn DA ’s Office because he and his girlfriend , Melisa Jackson , 23 , a fellow EMT , allegedly refused to help Eutisha Rennix , 25 , a dying , pregnant mom , during their coffee break at the eatery .
Rennix ’s still - grieving mother , Cynthia – stunned to learn of Green ’s death yesterday – offered kind words of support for his relatives .
“ As a mother who has been through this kind of loss , I have to feel for his family , ” she said .
“ Even though what he did to my daughter was an injustice , I am sorry for him , and especially for his mother . ”
Eutisha ’s sister , Marva , added , “ We thought what he did [ to Eutisha ] was inhuman .
But he did n’t deserve [ being fatally shot ] .
…
You have to live your life right , because when you do wrong things , life has a way of bringing bad things back to you . ”
Eutisha ’s twin brother , Eudane , was scheduled to ship overseas with the military last night after getting a tattoo of his sister on his arm .
The criminal investigation into Green and Jackson ’s actions began after the pair allegedly ignoring the frantic pleas of Rennix ’s co-workers to help her when she suffered a seizure Dec. 9 at the Au Bon Pain shop in 1 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn .
The center is the site of the Fire Department ’s headquarters , where the pair of EMTs work as dispatchers .
Rennix , who had a 3 - year - old son , died at Long Island College Hospital after the incident .
Her premature baby was delivered at the hospital but also died two hours later .
Witnesses said Jackson called a fellow dispatcher to report the incident but noted that she and Green did nothing to help Rennix , who was six months pregnant .
Green and Jackson were suspended for a month without pay after Rennix died .
They were reinstated , but the criminal investigation is pending .
Residents who live near Greenhouse said the club is a magnet for noise and violence .
“ I hate to say it , but we ’ve been waiting for something like this to happen , ” said Silvia Beam , president of the Vandam Street Block Association .
“ I ’ve had numerous complaints filed with 311 , and they never got back to us .
It starts usually at 11 or 12 at night , and they do n’t leave until 1 in the afternoon the next day . ”

“ It 's a sin to kill a mockingbird . ” - Atticus Finch
It ’s rare that a movie captures the magic of a ​great book , and yet holds its own as a masterpiece of cinema .
To Kill a Mockingbird does just that .
Set in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression , To Kill a Mockingbird raises great questions of racism , poverty , ignorance and injustice with enormous grace and emotional power .
Moral and deeply humane , the movie is a classic coming - of - age story of childhood innocence lost in the segregated American south .
The Plot
In hot , dusty Maycomb County , lawyer Atticus Finch ( Gregory Peck ) takes on the case of an innocent black man accused of assaulting a white girl .
He ’s up against the entrenched racial power structure of the Old South , fierce taboos against interracial sex , and the pride of the girl ’s impoverished and violent family .
The story is told from the perspective of Finch ’s daughter Scout ( Mary Badham ) , whose character narrates the film in flashback ) , her brother Jem and their friend Dill ( modeled on author Harper Lee ’s childhood friend , writer Truman Capote . )
The children are fascinated by the decaying old Radley place , where Boo Radley ( Robert Duvall in his film debut ) is a recluse .
A grown man who has not left the house for years , Boo is a bogeyman to the children --- until he begins to leave them small gifts at the risk of displeasing his abusive father .
Hounded at school because their father is defending a black man , the children watch the trial from the blacks - only balcony of the courtroom and begin to see Atticus in a new light .
Both they and their father are put in real danger as the trial progresses , and the two story lines come together as the tension rises .
The Cast of ' To Kill a Mockingbird '
Peck plays a hero who ’s such a perfect human being he’d be a little hard to believe if not for Peck ’s forthright , understated performance .
He ’s intelligent and modest , a soft - spoken man of unquestionable integrity devoted to the cause of justice .
He ’s also a devoted single father and the best shot in the county .
It ’s a good thing the studio ’s original pick for the role , ​ Rock Hudson did n’t work out .
Peck won a well - deserved , long overdue Oscar .
Badham , delightful as the willful tomboy Scout , was nominated for her amazingly natural and engaging performance but lost the Best Supporting Actress Oscar to ​ Patty Duke as Helen Keller in ​ The Miracle Worker .
Brock Peters is wonderful as the falsely accused Tom Robinson , terrified , but clinging to his own pride and the truth .
A terrific ensemble cast brings the entire town to life with a great sense of place .
And although Duvall has only a few moments of screen time as the damaged Boo Radley , he ’s unforgettable .
The Bottom Line
Beautifully shot in black and white , To Kill a Mockingbird is a masterpiece that everybody should see , and no serious movie collector should be without .
The film celebrates the power of innocence to turn back evil but acknowledges that true justice is often impossible to reach .
The great achievement of To Kill a Mockingbird is its unsentimental appeal to what Lincoln called “ the better angels of our nature . ”
It shows us who we want to be , and who we deserve to be , even when we fail .

Republicans run from Steele
Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele showed up in Colorado Thursday but the GOP ’s top statewide candidates did n’t exactly roll out the welcome wagon .
While scores of activists and local party officials attended a ceremony opening the headquarters of the Colorado Republican Party ’s Victory program in Greenfield Village , the GOP candidates for governor and Senate declined invitations to appear with him .
Their absence suggested the degree of Steele ’s isolation , a week after he made comments questioning the Obama administration ’s approach to the war in Afghanistan .

The RNC reached out to a number of Republican candidates , including former Rep. Scott McInnis , who ’s running for governor , and former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton , the national GOP ’s favored candidate for Senate , to invite them to the event .
Neither McInnis nor Norton accepted .
“ He has another event elsewhere , ” McInnis spokesman Sean Duffy explained .
“ It was , ‘ Can you guys attend an opening on this day , at this time ? ’
And Scott just was n’t available . ”
Duffy said he could not recall the details of McInnis ’s scheduling conflict and declined to say whether McInnis would have joined Steele if his schedule had permitted it .
Norton ’s campaign confirmed that the RNC approached them about the event several weeks ago , but explained that Norton had already planned to campaign that day with Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch .
And Norton told POLITICO this week that she did not approve of Steele ’s comments on Afghanistan .
“ I do think Michael Steele ’s comments about the war were downright erroneous and unfortunate , ” Norton said in an interview .
“ I do think the party needs its very best leadership going forward in the 2010 and 2012 elections and I have been disappointed in some of the comments the chairman has made . ”
While the Colorado GOP ’s Victory program is geared toward gathering resources for general election candidates , Norton spokeswoman Cinamon Watson said the candidate ’s meetings with activists were an essential part of her strategy .
“ The bottom line is we 're reaching out as many Colorado primary voters as we can , ” Watson said .
“ We have a lot of activists joining us at events tomorrow who are going to help us reach out to Colorado voters . "
Norton ’s chief rival in the Republican Senate primary , Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck , did n’t exactly rush to the event , either .
Buck planned to attend a fundraiser with South Carolina Sen.
Jim DeMint , said spokesman Owen Loftus , who explained : “ We ’ve been planning this for so long we have n’t even thought about it . ”
The Colorado Republican Party said that there was never a plan for anyone but Steele to host the Victory headquarters event , and spokeswoman Chelsey Penoyer insisted : “ It was just out of the blue that Chairman Steele would be there . ”
But a week after Steele ’s remarks on Afghanistan — he made them during a trip to Connecticut for state Republicans and Senate candidate Linda McMahon — he has yet to appear in public with any of the party ’s major candidates .
While Rep. Mike Coffman , running for reelection in a safe House district , attended Steele 's Thursday event , none of the party ’s top House candidates made it to Thursday ’s event .
RNC Communications Director Doug
Heye disputed the notion that candidates were dodging Steele , noting that Coffman , state Sen. Nancy Spence and Colorado GOP Chairman Dick Wadhams , were among the many officials who attended the event .
" We were happy to visit the Denver - area victory center , " Heye wrote in an email to POLITICO .
" With more than 100 people in attendance , every seat taken and a lot of folks standing , it 's clear the GOP enthusiasm in Colorado is high . "
Steele is set to speak this weekend at the Washington State Republican Party ’s Republican Resurgence Rally this weekend .
He is the only guest speaker listed on the state GOP ’s website .

My son just turned 5 years old in July .
He is a tall for his age , loves soccer and can’t wait for September to start school .
While he is growing up ( he does n’t want to be called a kid anymore but a boy ! ) , I am doing my best to transmit to him as much financial knowledge as I can so he does n’t have to learn his money lessons the hard way .
Today I thought I ’d share the ways I teach my oldest son about money , and maybe when we ’re done you can give me some additional tricks in the comments ! ;-)
Money Is Hard To Earn
The very first thing I want my son to understand is that money does n’t come without effort .
As a young boy , he does n’t see the “ behind the scenes ” time where I work to make money .
He sees me leave in the morning , come home in the evening and he gets clothes , toys and does activities in the meantime … it is as simple as this : when someone in the house needs something , daddy is going to pay for it .
So first , I had to learn to say “ no ” in order to show him that money is not limitless .
We often say no to our 2 children .
Not because we can’t afford it but because it is important stress that sometimes you need to make choices and not buy everything you want .
I also tell my son how important it is to go to work each day and that it takes a lot of money to pay for everything we have .
I also plan on bringing him to work on a Friday so he understands what it is like to work in the office all day ( even though he will only spend an hour or two at the office , I ’m sure it will look like days of work to him ) .
Money Is Fun To Spend
I do n’t like money just for having money ’s sake – or accumulating money in my bank account .
What I like about money is what I can do with it .
Renting a vacation home for our family , going to soccer with my son or going to the zoo are things I do with my extra money .
When your family has a budget , spending money allocated to be spend is a lot of fun .
I do n’t want my son to be afraid of spending or thinking that he can’t afford to buy something .
I would rather show him that once you have learned to manage your money properly , you can enjoy the things it can bring .
Money Is Not Important , It ’s What You Do With It
I want to show my son that while you have to work hard for your money , you can reward yourself .
Since money is a powerful tool , it is important to not fear or hate it .
It is also important to not love money either .
I have a fun relationship with my money as I see it as a way to treat myself and spend quality time with my family .
I try to show my son that money , when used properly , can be a lot of fun .
If You Make Money , You Should Give Some Of It Away
I am well aware that my 2 children are spoiled .
They have great godfathers and godmothers and grandparents who love to buy them toys .
I do n’t have a problem having seeing a playroom full of toys and seeing my children doing all kind of activities .
However , it is very important to me that they understand that not everybody has the same fortune .
This is why , every Christmas , I ask them to pick 2 toys that we will wrap and give to charity .
I also contribute to a children ’s hospital .
From time to time , they send me a letter with the testimony of a child who was sick and has gotten better .
I read the letter to my children so they see that there are people that ca n’t go outside and play .
Thoughts On Kid ’s Allowances
I am quickly approaching a time where I ’ll need to figure out how much and how I will give my son as an allowance .
I do n’t want to give money to my son just for the sake of giving money .
I want him to learn what money is and how to manage it .
Anybody have experience with giving money to their kids , and how it should be done ?
Tell us your thoughts on these money lessons .
What other lessons do you teach your kids or do you think it is important to stress ?
Tell us your thoughts in the comments .

EVERYONE has an opinion about the best way to grill corn .
Some swear you have to soak the ears in the husk before grilling .
Some say you should peel back the husk , remove the silk , then butter and season the corn and wrap it back up to grill .
Personally , I love the charred , popcorn - like flavor that corn gets when it ’s exposed directly to the flame , so I grill my corn out of the husk and until it ’s browned  really browned  in a few places ; as it happens , this usually leaves other parts bright yellow .
Not only is this super - easy but it results in the kind of flavor I associate with the crunchy street corn of Mexico .
In many parts of Mexico , though , that crunchiness is highlighted with a creamy chili - lime sauce .
This is more unusual than the tried , true and unbeatable butter - salt - and - pepper combination , and only slightly more complicated :
You just mix together mayonnaise , freshly squeezed lime juice , chili powder , salt and pepper .
It ’s pretty authentic , and a combination that brings out the grilled flavor and balances the sweetness of fresh corn perfectly .
There are other options : olive oil , chopped basil and Parmesan make an unexpected and very good combo ; crumbled feta mixed with plain yogurt , lemon juice , oregano and cumin is amazing ; and you ca n’t go wrong with mayo mixed with minced garlic , pimentón and parsley .
CAP 2022 news !
03 May 2020 CAP 2022 will take place in Israel !
Many thanks and congratulations to the Co-Directors of the Israel CAP team , Amnon Cavari , Maoz Rosenthal , and Ilana Shpaizman .

Demonstrators have thrown an oil - like substance and feathers on the entrance to Tate Britain in London in protest at its acceptance of BP sponsorship .
The group , calling itself The Good Crude Britannia , is calling for the gallery to sever ties with the company over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill .
Last night the gallery threw a summer party , partly to mark 20 years of support from the oil giant .
More than 170 artists have written an open letter protesting the sponsorship .
The poured substance was believed to be molasses Q&A : Why is arts sponsorship important ?
Printed in Monday 's Guardian , the letter called the BP logo " a stain on the Tate 's international reputation " .
Playwright Caryl Churchill , cartoonist Martin Rowson and comedian Robert Newman were among the 171 signatories .
Others included artist John Keane and electronic musician Matthew Herbert , who appeared at the Glastonbury festival last weekend .
Jane Trowell , of environmental arts campaign group Platform , said : " BP is trying to repair its tarnished reputation and buy our approval by associating itself with culturally important institutions like Tate . "
She added that she hoped it would soon be " socially unacceptable " for cultural institutions to accept funding from oil companies .
Even a ' property ' with as high a profile as the Turner Prize or the Edinburgh Comedy Awards struggles to find and retain sponsors Will Gompertz , BBC arts editor Read Will Gompertz 's blog
But in a statement , Tate Britain defended the deal saying BP 's support " has been instrumental in helping Tate develop access to the Tate Collection and to present changing displays of work by a wide range of artists in the national collection of British art " .
Last week the Tate joined other institutions that receive BP sponsorship in thanking the oil company for its support .
" We are grateful to BP for their long - term commitment , " said the Tate , the Royal Opera House , the British Museum and the National Portrait Gallery in a joint statement .
" The income generated through corporate partnerships is vital to the mixed economy of successful arts organisations and enables each of us to deliver a rich and vibrant cultural programme . "
Those sentiments have since been echoed by art historian Sir Christopher Frayling , former chairman of Arts Council England .
" Now is not the time to get squeamishy about sponsorship , " he said on Radio 4 's Today programme .
" The system is utterly dependent on sponsorship from companies and large firms . "
Yesterday 's open letter , however , claimed sponsorship from the likes of BP and Shell was a " means by which attention can be distracted from their impacts on human rights , the environment and the global climate " .
" These relationships enable big oil companies to mask the environmentally destructive nature of their activities with the social legitimacy that is associated with such high - profile cultural associations , " the letter reads .
Greg Sargent and Digby offer their views on Charlie Cook 's doomsday prediction for Democrats , based largely on polling showing that Republicans plan to vote with far greater enthusiasm than Democrats .
( Whether more of them vote is a different question , since you only get one vote per person , no matter how enthusiastic you may be . )
Digby :
You can't help but wonder if the Democrats have decided that having the votes of " liberals , African - Americans , self - described Democrats , moderates and those living in either the Northeast or West " just are n't worth having so they are going to fight the Republicans for every last one of those John McCain voters .
How else to explain the ongoing derision of their rank and file ?
( " They look like absolute idiots " is the quote that comes to mind . )
If going for hard core Republican votes is n't their strategy , then someone might tell the president that for the next four months he might want to knock off his patented " one from column A one from column B " routine and stop making false equivalence between the Democratic base and teabaggers and lavishing praise on Blue Dogs who repeatedly punch hippies and stab him in back .
Sargent :
I tend to fall into the camp that holds that the Dem base 's lack of enthusiasm is out of sync with the size and scope of the accomplishments racked up thus far by Obama and Dems .
The excitement around Obama 's victory was so intense , and the sense of a " big change moment " was so palpable , that people were bound to feel let down despite Obama 's clearly historic achievements .
Here 's yet another way of looking at it :
The good news for Republicans is that their enthusiasm is at a record high , meaning they stand a realistic chance of retaking control of Congress .
The bad news for Republicans is that the prospect of a GOP majority might just be enough to fire up the Democratic base and left - leaning independents .
I actually think all three arguments have some validity and none of them are mutually exclusive .
Taken together , they offer up a useful ( though not fully comprehensive ) guide for Democratic officials planning the fall campaign .
Do n't be afraid to repeat the administration 's and Congress 's accomplishments ad nauseum .
It will take time to break through , but eventually , it will .
Empower White House aides who connect well with the base and muzzle those who do n't .
Use the looming prospect of a Republican takeover of Congress as a weapon against them .
Make sure this election is a choice between GOP and Democratic governance .
Anyone who says with certainty they know how this election will play out is a snake oil salesman .
And while Republicans may say they are more enthusiastic than Democrats , you only get one vote no matter how enthusiastic you are .
So what counts is whether more of them vote than Democrats .
So far this year , that has n't happened .
And there 's no guarantee that it will happen in November .
But it could happen .
And it 's important that we not let it .

Former Stereophonics drummer Stuart Cable has been found dead at his home in south Wales .
Emergency services attended the house at Llwydcoed near Aberdare , Cynon Valley , at 0530 BST on Monday .
South Wales Police said they were not speculating on the cause of death but there were no suspicious circumstances .
Cable , who left the Stereophonics in 2003 , had hosted his rock show on BBC Radio Wales on Saturday .
South Wales Police confirmed they were investigating the sudden death of a 40 - year - old man at an address in Llwydcoed .
A post mortem examination is due to be carried out later this week .
Floral tributes have been left outside his home .
It is understood Cable had been drinking at a local pub , where his car was left overnight , and had had some friends over at his house on Sunday night .
It is also believed a number of bottles of alcohol were removed from the property by investigators .
His death comes just two days after Cable 's former band Stereophonics played at Cardiff City Stadium .
Stereophonics lead singer Kelly Jones , back home for a family funeral , told BBC Wales they had only been speaking in the past few days and he could not believe what had happened .
The band were formed in Cwmaman near Aberdare in 1992 by school friends Kelly and Richard Jones along with Cable , who was four years older .
Within five years they were rising stars , supporting bands such as the Rolling Stones and U2 .
Cable , who said he was planning to leave the band before he was sacked in September 2003 , said he had no regrets .
He later formed a new group called Killing for Company , who were due to play at the Download festival Donington Park on Saturday .
The band 's new album is due for release to coincide with it .
A simple tribute message on their website says " you will be missed " .
Among other tributes from the music and entertainment industries , Mike Peters , lead singer with The Alarm , said Cable 's band had only recently played with them and his death was a " real shock " and a " real tragedy " .
Image caption Police guarding Stuart Cable 's house in Aberdare
His mother Mabel , 79 , told Wales Online she had worried when he travelled all over the world .
" He is now settled down and then this has happens , " she said .
" It has not sunk in yet . "
His manager John Brand said Cable had been looking forward to his performance at Download , and " really excited about drumming his way back to the top " .
He said : " He will be remembered for his big heart and booming voice , his bonhomie and his compassion for those less fortunate than himself .
" I will always remember him as a loyal friend .
Someone I shared many of the best and often the funniest times in my life . "
Cable 's autobiography , Demons and Cocktails , was released in 2009 .
Image caption Stuart Cable left Sterephonics in 2003
The autobiography shed light on tensions which eventually led to the drummer 's departure .
Cable revealed the split was mainly sparked off by Kelly Jones ' desire to produce the band 's third album .
There were also said to be tensions in the band about Cable 's burgeoning career as a presenter .
Cable hosted his own TV show , Cable TV , and radio show , Cable Rock , for BBC Wales .
He has also been involved in a variety of other projects .
In March 2002 , he took part in a BBC Wales social action campaign urging young men to look out for the warning signs of testicular cancer .
In autumn 2007 Cable quit the BBC to launch a Cardiff - based branch of rock station XFM , which closed after six months on air .
He was also a presenter for the Birmingham - based commercial radio station Kerrang !
But he returned back at BBC Radio Wales with his Saturday rock show in April .
' Extraordinary man '
BBC Radio Wales producer and friend of Cable , Darren Broome - who worked with Cable on his final show on Saturday - said : " He was a warm - hearted person who loved Aberdare and the Cynon valley and chose to live there .
" He was a huge personality .
I feel very numb .
He was so passionate about music . "
Mr Broome said the musician was " a scream " to work with .
" It was the best two hours , playing good music in the company of Stuart Cable , " he said .
" He was a total , total music fan and inspiration to performers and so proud of his home town .
A diamond geezer , a top dude . "
Steve Austins , editor of Radio Wales said : " We are all profoundly shocked and saddened at the news of Stuart 's death .
He was an extraordinary man .
" He was well loved by both colleagues and listeners and he will be deeply missed .
Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family and friends at this difficult time . "
Tributes were being emailed by fans and musicians alike to BBC Wales
One fan , Ian Gravell , said : " I met Stuart with my son ( a keen drummer at the time ) after watching Scarlets at Stradey a few years ago .
Despite him being with friends , Stuart took the time to chat to my son about his drumming and what he should do to improve .
This is a tragic event for Wales . "

Big problems sometimes come in small packages .
The problem with which physicists must now concern themselves measures a mere 0.0350 millionth of a millionth of a millimetre .
This is precisely the difference between the new , smaller , dimension of the proton , the nucleus of the hydrogen atom , and the value which has been assumed so far .
Instead of 0.8768 femtometres , it measures only 0.8418 femtometres .
At the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland , an international team of researchers including physicists from the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics has now measured this in experiments which are ten times more accurate than all previous ones .
They thus present physics with some tough problems : at least one fundamental constant now changes .
And physicists have also to check the calculations of quantum electrodynamics .
This theory is assumed to be very well proven , but its predictions do not agree with these latest measurements .
The research is published in the journal Nature ( July 8 , 2010 ) .
For many years , Randolf Pohl and his colleagues believed their measuring instrument was not accurate enough : they first performed an experiment to determine the size of the proton back in 2003 , but they had not discovered the signal which would provide them with the relevant insight .
" This was not down to the accuracy of our method , but to the fact that we did not expect such a large deviation , " says Randolf Pohl .
The researchers had therefore chosen too small a window for their measurements .
" It is good , nevertheless , that we have significantly improved our method yet again , otherwise people might not believe us now , " continues Pohl .
Randolf Pohl and his colleagues in an international collaboration have measured the charge radius of the proton with an accuracy of better than one thousandth of a femtometre .
This is the radius which the charge of the positive hydrogen nucleus assumes .
To this end , they have investigated tiny details in the atomic structure , using muonic hydrogen , where it is not an electron but a heavier muon which orbits the nucleus ( see ' Background : a ruler for a proton ' ) .
Their measurements show that the hydrogen nucleus measures 0.8418 femtometre .
A result which is outside the margin of error which physicists had applied to the previous measurements for the proton radius by a factor of five .
Even if the deviation is negligible on a day - to - day scale , it possibly has significant consequences .
Researchers are unable to say precisely what these may be , however .
What is certain is that this changes the Rydberg constant .
Quantum physicists use this constant to calculate which energy packets atoms and molecules absorb and emit when they change their states .
These energy packets correspond to the spectral lines of the elements .
The calculations for the spectral lines now shift noticeably and no longer match the experimental findings .

The theoreticians are now searching for the error in the calculation
" Since the Rydberg constant is the most accurately determined fundamental constant so far , it is as solid as a rock , " says Randolf Pohl .
If physicists draw a self - consistent picture of all fundamental constants , the other fundamental constants such as Planck 's constant or the mass of the electron can only move around the Rydberg constant .
The fact that this rock has been moved slightly will hardly impress the other fundamental constants : they have been determined just as exactly as the Rydberg constant so they will probably not feel the jerk at all .
The test for this is still pending , however .
" We also have to be very careful with more far - reaching consequences , " says Pohl .
Many theoreticians all over the world are now recalculating the predictions of quantum electrodynamics with the new proton radius .
This quantum theory describes how atoms , electrons , elementary particles and other players move in this diminutive world and which electromagnetic fields are created in the process .
It also provides a value for the proton radius for comparison with experimental data -- but this is significantly higher than the one measured now .
" I assume that an error has been made somewhere in the calculation , because the theory of quantum electrodynamics is very consistent and has been rigorously proven , " says Pohl .
If this is not the case , the slightly shifted proton radius would trigger an earthquake in physics , which would at least result in considerable ' fault lines ' in this theory .
While theoreticians are now trying to get to the bottom of the mystery of the erroneous proton radius in their models , the Garching researchers and their colleagues are checking the new measurement result with further experiments on the hydrogen atom .
They also want to redesign their experimental set - up so that they can also measure the charge radius of the helium nucleus .
These investigations are also intended to tell them something about how atomic nuclei are deformed when they interact with a negative charge .
In this way the physicists want to discover the exact structure of matter step - by - step -- and hope , of course , to come across more mysteries of physics .
Background : A ruler for a proton
In order to measure the charge radius of the proton , the researchers use the electronic interactions in a hydrogen atom and take into account the tiniest details of the atomic structure : the positively charged nucleus attracts the electron , which can move in different shells around the nucleus .
The energy of the electron increases when it jumps up to the next highest shell .
In the first shell it can only move in one orbital : the s-orbital , which surrounds the atomic nucleus like a sphere .
When the electron climbs upwards shell by shell , additional space becomes available to it each time .
In the second shell , for example , it can occupy not only the spherical s-orbital but also a p-orbital which forms a dumbbell - shaped structure around the atomic nucleus .
advertisement
In the simplest model of an atom the electron has the same energy in the s-orbital as it does in the p-orbital .
In reality , however , its energy in the p-orbital is slightly higher than in the s-orbital .
Physicists call the small energy gap the Lamb shift .
The Garching physicists are targeting this small gap .
One reason for its existence is that the proton is not an infinitesimally small point , but a tiny sphere .
If the electron occupies the p-orbital , the electron does not feel this , because both club - shaped ends of the dumbbell are located outside the atomic nucleus -- the electron is therefore never inside the nucleus itself .
The situation is quite different in the sphere of the s-orbital : here the electron also repeatedly spends time in the nucleus itself -- the charges of nucleus and electron then cancel each other out .
This decreases the average attractive force of the nucleus and hence the energy of the electron .
In the conventional hydrogen atom the effect is so small that it is hardly noticeable even in the most accurate measurements .
At the Paul Scherrer Institute in the Swiss town of Villingen the Garching physicists have therefore produced muonic hydrogen in which a muon replaces the electron .
The muon has the same negative charge as an electron , but is around 200 times heavier .
The total diameter of the atom thus shrinks and , on average , the muon spends more time in the nucleus so that the energy of the s-orbital in question also experiences a stronger shift .
The researchers measure the energy difference by giving the electron a little energetic nudge with a laser , so that it jumps from the s-orbital of the second shell into the p-orbital .
That is the principle .
In order to measure the energy difference , which is still tiny even in muonic hydrogen , the physicists working with Randolf Pohl have to solve some practical problems .
They not only need a laser whose wavelength can be set with extreme precision .
Little by little they change its energy until it precisely matches the transition between the two orbitals .
The laser must also release its pulse in less than one millionth of a second after it has received the command .
This is placed as soon as the detectors of the apparatus register a muonic hydrogen atom .
In 99 percent of the cases the muon in the hydrogen atom slips immediately into the s-orbital of the energetically favourable first shell .
The laser therefore mainly fires at particles which are no use for the researchers ' real purpose .
The apparatus registers an atom in which the muon remains in the s-orbital of the second shell only six to seven times per hour .
" You can sit for hours in front of the screen and hardly anything happens , " says Randolf Pohl .
And then it takes only a millionth of a second until the muon falls from the second into the first , energetically more favourable shell .
The Garching researchers have used a variety of tricks to teach their laser a reaction time of 900 billionths of a second , thus making the measurement possible in the first place .
After the researchers had spent several months setting up and fine - tuning their apparatus at the Paul Scherrer Institute , they finally measured for three weeks without a break .
Only then had they moved muons from the s-orbital into the p-orbital of the second shell so often that a marked peak was visible in their spectrum .
Then only calculations remained .
" The equation for this is pretty difficult , " says Pohl , but , finally , they arrived at their value for the proton radius which is ten times more accurate and which now sets a number of new tasks for quantum theorists .
British cities have fared poorly in a Europe - wide survey , with London having the worst food and Birmingham being the most boring big town .
And although London was rated the most exciting European city , it was also considered the most expensive , according to the poll out today from the TripAdvisor company .
Birmingham also received another unwanted accolade , being voted the second - most unattractive city , with Krakow in Poland the least attractive .
The 2,963 Europeans , including 559 Britons , who were surveyed also considered Liverpool to have the second - worst cuisine among European cities , with Birmingham third worst .
However , London was considered the easiest city to get around and having been voted the dirtiest city in a similar survey last year , the UK capital was considered one of the cleaner cities this year .
London was also rated the third - safest city , with the Swiss cities of Geneva and Zurich taking the top two positions .
Rome was considered to have the best cuisine and the Italian capital was also voted the most attractive and the worst to get around .
The most dangerous city was Istanbul , the cleanest was Zurich , the best value was Lisbon and dirtiest was Athens .
TripAdvisor spokesman Emma O'Boyle said : " Europe 's cities all have their highs and lows , but it 's great that London has been crowned the most exciting , .
" And with the London Olympics only two years away it 's encouraging to see the fundamental issues of safety and transport already scoring highly with visitors . "
Sally Chatterjee , CEO of Visit London , said : " We 're delighted that London has been voted the most exciting city in Europe .
" Whilst old perceptions remain about British cuisine , they do n't reflect the reality which is that London is now home to the best chefs and restaurants on the planet .
Chapter One : Initial Provisions and Definitions
The leaked version of the latest ACTA draft helpfully includes country positions , information that was scrubbed from the official release last April .
As I noted yesterday , much of the debate boils down to U.S. and European proposals with the remaining ACTA countries picking sides .
Jonathan O’Hara , one of my research students this summer , has helped compile a list of the Canadian positions where negotiators have failed to reach consensus .
It is notable that most Canadian positions seek to limit the scope of ACTA or incorporate some balancing provisions .
Section A : Initial Provisions
Article 1.2 : Nature and scope of obligations
In the phrase â€œmore extensive protection and enforcementâ€  Canadian is proposing to delete â€œprotectionâ€ , which would limit the scope of ACTA to enforcement , rather than to protection of IP generally .
Article 1.3 : Relation to standards concerning availability and scope of intellectual property rights
Canada is proposing to add a paragraph â€ œNo Party shall be obliged to apply this section to any goods that do not infringe an intellectual property right held within the territory of that Party.â€ 
Canada seems to be attempting to limit the applicability of ACTA by requiring that IPRs be recognized in the territory of a member , for a member to have obligations to enforce IPRs .
Article 1.X : ( General principles )
Canada is proposing to add an article that outlines principles of IP enforcement , such as technology dissemination and transfer , a manner conducive to social and economic welfare , measures necessary to protect health and nutrition , etc .
Section B : General Definitions
Canada has reserved its position on all the definitions pending discussion .
Chapter Two : Legal Framework for Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights
General Obligations
Article 2.X : General obligations with respect to enforcement
Canada is proposing : â€ œ(3 ) In respect of civil remedies and criminal penalties for enforcement of intellectual property rights , each Party shall take into account , as appropriate the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement , the interests of third parties and the applicable remedies or penalties .â€ 
The major difference between this and another option is the requirement to take the interests of third parties into account , and that specificness of the wording around proportionality .
Canada is proposing in paragraph ( 5 ) that the agreement shall apply ONLY to trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy .
Section 1 : Civil Enforcement
Article 2.1 : Availability of Civil Procedures
Canada is proposing that civil procedures only be available for copyright , related rights and trademark rights .
Article 2.X : Injunctions
Again Canada is limiting the availability of injunctions to copyright , related rights or trademarks .
Canada is suggesting that the power of judicial authorities be â€œsubject to any statutory limitations under its domestic lawâ€ .
This suggesting has been explicitly opposed by the US , Japan , EU , Switzerland , Korea and Mexico .
Article 2.3 : Other Remedies
In two paragraphs of this article Canada is proposing remedies regarding destruction of goods or implements to create the goods , be limited to good which are found to be related to piracy or counterfeiting .
Canada is also proposing that judicial authorities have the power to order the destruction to occur at the infringer ’s expense .
Article 2.5 : Provisional Measures
Canada is proposing the that provision measures only be available where there is an imminent infringement of copyright , related rights or trademark rights .
Canada is proposing that for provisional measures , authorities can require sufficient evidence to ensure that infringement is imminent before provision measures are taken .
Section 2 : Border Measures
Article 2.X : Scope of border measures
Canada is proposing that provisions for border measures be applied to trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy .
While Canada has not explicitly used the work â€œonlyâ€ to strictly limit the application of border measures , but the US , Singapore and Japan have suggested changes to the wording to make border measures more broadly available , including â€œapplies to at least trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracyâ€ .
Article 2.X : De Minimis Provision
Canada is proposing to make the wording of the de minimis provision the same as the TRIPS equivalent , and include goods â€œsent in small consignmentsâ€ .
Article 2.6 : Application by Right Holder
Canada is proposing that Parties shall provide procedures for import , but not be obligated to provide measures to exported goods .
In a footnote to this , Canada is also wanting to clarify that there is no obligation to apply the procedures to grey market goods .
Canada is is also proposing that accepted applications for border measures be effective for a least one year .
Article 2.7 : Ex - Officio Action
Canada is proposing that Parties give their customs authorities the power to suspend goods suspected of being pirated copyright or counterfeit trademarked while they are exported from the country or in transit through the country .
This differs from the position of the US who propose that Parties shall give their customs authorities the power to seize on import / export / transit .
Article 2.X ( Information sharing cooperation in lieu of suspension of goods )
Canada is proposing that any information sharing between an exporting or transit country and the destination country is limited by and must be consistent with any bilateral information sharing agreements .
Article 2.9 : Security or equivalent assurance
Canada proposes to modifying the wording of this article to apply to copyright , related rights or trademark rights , which is consistent with Canada ’s position that ACTA clearly apply only to those IPRs , rather than all IPRs .
Section 3 : Criminal Enforcement
Article 2.14 : Criminal Offenses
Paragraph 1 :
Canada is proposing to clarify that criminal offenses apply to acts of piracy ( rather than acts of infringement as the US is proposing ) .
In either case , the piracy or infringement still must be commercial in nature .
This seems like an attempt by Canada to make clear that criminal enforcement applies to a specific subset of infringement activities , rather than using infringement loosely in different contexts .
Paragraph 5 :
Canada is proposing to specifically include that a theatre manager can be guilty of camcording of movies crimes , even in their own theatre .
Article 2.16 : Seizure , forfeiture and destruction
Paragraph 1 :
Canada is proposing that competent authorities have the power to authorise ( rather than â€œorderâ€ , which is what the article reads otherwise ) the seizure of suspected infringing goods and the implements associated with them
Paragraph 3 :
Canada is proposing that authorities have the power to order forfeiture â€œat least for seriousâ€ offenses .
Section 4 : Special Measures Related to Technological Enforcement of Intellectual Property in the Digital Environment
Article 2.18 : Enforcement Procedures in the Digital Environment
Canada has reserved the right to revisit the elements of this section at a later date , which may reflect the fluidity of Bill C - 32 .
Paragraph 1 :
Canada has proposed that the wording of this article be limited to permit action against trademark , copyrights or related rights ( as opposed to any type of intellectual property , which is what Japan , EU and Switzerland are proposing ) .
Paragraph 2 :
In two instances of this paragraph , Canada is limiting the types of infringement covered by ACTA to copyrights or related rights , rather than general intellectual property rights , as the EU and Switzerland are proposing .
Paragraph 3(a ) ( iii ) :
Canada is proposing wording that clarifies that ISPs not be held liable in cases of referring or linking users to a location containing infringing material .
Paragraph 3 ( b ) :
Canada is proposing that ISPs can be allocated a defined period of time ( rather than a more general â€œ â€œexpeditiouslyâ€ ) to remove / disable access to infringing material .
Paragraph 3( c ) ( iii ) :
Canada is proposing that an ISP be exempt for liability if they have no actual knowledge of a court decision that materials are infringing .
Paragraph X : Exceptions to technological enforcement in 2.18.4
Canada is proposing wording slightly clarifying that a party can implement exception to provisions ( rather than measures ) .
Canada also proposes to distinguish the technological measures themselves from the provisions , so that exceptions apply to the provisions rather than to the measures .
Paragraph 6 :
In the context of electronic rights management information , Canada is proposing that infringements of related rights is only enforceable when the related rights pertains to phonograms .
Paragraph 6 ( b ) :
Canada is proposing that importation for distribution only be an prohibited when the copyright owner is prejudicially affected .
Paragraph 7 : Exceptions to technological enforcement
This paragraph seems to be almost identical to paragraph X , except that it may provide exceptions to 2.18.4 and 2.18.5 .
As in paragraph 2.18.X , Canada is proposing wording slightly clarifying that a party can implement exception to provisions ( rather than measures ) .
Canada also proposes to distinguish the technological measures themselves from the provisions , so that exceptions apply to the provisions rather than to the measures .
Madison —
Dairy farmers are being squeezed out of business as other sectors of the food industry demand a greater share of the consumer 's dollar , farmers attending a federal hearing testified Friday .
The current system leaves dairy farmers with little or no profit , several said at a U.S. Department of Justice hearing on antitrust issues in the dairy industry .
The hearing attracted hundreds of farmers from around the country to the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" What we are hearing is a consistent message , which has not always been the case .
Dairy producers , large and small , are hurting , " U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said at the hearing .
In the past 10 years , the number of U.S. dairy farms has fallen from 111,000 to fewer than 65,000 , Vilsack said .
Some of that has come from farm consolidations and voluntary retirements .
But much of the loss has come from farmers who have been forced out of business , especially in the past two years .
" I have a growing concern about rural America " and the nation 's food supply , Vilsack said .
Some farmers complained bitterly about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , where the price of cheddar cheese blocks serves as the basis for determining farm milk prices .
A few Mercantile traders can influence milk prices by selling or buying cheese at strategic moments .
It 's a thin slice of the dairy market , yet it sets the milk price for everybody , testified Joel Greeno , a dairy farmer from Kendall .
All of a farmer 's hard work , and awards for high - quality milk , mean nothing when low prices force someone out of business , according to Greeno , whose parents lost their farm to foreclosure on their 29th wedding anniversary .
Dairy farmers currently get about 97 cents from a gallon of milk sold for $ 3 at the grocery store .
The rest of the money goes to the store , a processor and others involved in the handling , buying and selling of the product .
Some farmers blame Dean Foods , the nation 's largest dairy company , and Dairy Farmers of America , the nation 's largest dairy farm cooperative , for reducing competition .
In January , the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Dean Foods , alleging that it purchased two Foremost Farms bottling plants in Wisconsin to quash competition in school milk programs .
The suit signaled a shift of antitrust policy in Washington , where regulators had done little in the agriculture sector in the past 20 years .
It was highly unusual , said Pete Hardin , who publishes The Milkweed industry newsletter from his farm in Brooklyn , Wis .
Adding to that consolidation is the growth of Dairy Farmers of America , which has about 18,000 members .
Farmers are pressured to join the co-op or they 're not in a position to sell their milk , Hardin said .
Christine Varney , head of the Department of Justice antitrust division , said she is committed to pursuing cases against those in the dairy industry engaged in anticompetitive practices .
" We are keeping a watchful eye on this industry , " she said .
" We will go to court and block mergers " that reduce competition .
Dean Foods and Dairy Farmers of America deny that they are responsible for low farm milk prices .
Milk prices are set by the U.S. government based on a survey of wholesale prices for non -fat dry milk , cheese , butter and whey .
It 's not something that a large processor or dairy cooperative controls , according to Dean Foods .
" The system is broken , and all of us - farmers , processors , and retailers alike - are paying the price in one way or another , " Dean said in written remarks .
" We share dairy farmers ' frustration with the increasing volatility in milk prices .
" While we cannot eliminate price volatility , the industry clearly needs better tools to manage it . "
A small number of critics have made false accusations against Dairy Farmers of America , said John Wilson , vice president of the Kansas City - based cooperative .
" Some people say that we have lost the connection to our members , but that rings hollow to me , " Wilson said .
He defended the size of the cooperative , saying there 's strength in numbers .
Last year , Dairy Farmers of America sent $ 37 million in special aid to its members to help them through hard times .
Varney and Vilsack said that they were interested in farmers ' complaints about the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , but that it would take a lot of work to determine whether the complaints were valid .
Years ago , farmers had similar complaints about trading on the now defunct Green Bay Cheese Exchange .
The price that farmers receive for their milk is based on a government formula and a complicated system patched together over decades .
" There are five people who understand how dairy products are priced .
Four of them are dead , and the fifth one is lying , " quipped David Ward , director of government relations for Cooperative Network , a Wisconsin trade association that represents cooperatives .
The purpose of Friday 's hearing was to gather testimony from dairy farmers .
It was the third in a series of USDA workshops on anticompetitive issues in agriculture .
" If anything comes out of this , I hope it's that we are able to create a pricing system that is transparent and makes sense , and that nobody is manipulating anything , " Ward said .
" Especially in a period of low prices , people always look to see if anyone is gaming the system . "
The Federal Court of Appeal issued is decision today [ not online yet ] on whether Internet providers can be considered broadcasters within the context of the Broadcasting Act .
The case is the result of last year ’s CRTC New Media decision in which many cultural groups called on the Commission to establish an ISP levy to fund Canadian content .
The ISPs argued that such a levy was illegal since they fell under the Telecommunications Act , not the Broadcasting Act .
The cultural groups argued that ISPs should be considered broadcasters in the case of the transmission of video programs .
The CRTC punted the issue to the Federal Court of Appeal .
The Federal Court of Appeal sided with the ISPs , ruling that providing access to broadcasting is not the same as broadcasting .
So long as ISPs maintain a content - neutral approach , they fall outside of the Broadcasting Act and should not be expected to play a role in promoting the policies found in the legislation .
The case is a huge win for the ISPs and – subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada or a legislative change – puts an end to the ISP levy proposal .
The case is also noteworthy from a net neutrality perspective , since the court emphasized that ISPs fall outside the Broadcasting Act so long as they remain content - neutral .
Should ISPs play a more active role , their ability to rely on the broadcast / transmission distinction would be lost .
The court set out the issue as follows :
the issue to be decided is whether , when providing access to the â€œtransmission of programs â€¦â€ , ISPs are broadcasting .
The answer to this question hinges on a consideration of the findings of the CRTC as to how programs are transmitted on the Internet on the one hand , and the exact purport of the definition of the word â€œbroadcastingâ€ , on the other .
The conclusion , which relied heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada Tariff 22 decision between SOCAN and the Canadian Association of Internet Providers :
Relying on the logic adopted by Binnie J. in CAIP in construing the word â€ œcommunicateâ€ under the Copyright Act , I am of the view that the definition of â€œbroadcastingâ€ is also directed at the person who transmits a program and that a person whose sole involvement is to provide the mode of transmission is not transmitting the program and hence , is not â€œbroadcastingâ€ .
As for promoting the Broadcasting Act objectives , the court stated :
Because ISPs ’ sole involvement is to provide the mode of transmission , they have no control or input over the content made available to Internet users by content producers and as a result , they are unable to take any steps to promote the policy described in the Broadcasting Act or its supporting provisions .
Only those who â€œtransmitâ€ the â€œprogramâ€ can contribute to the policy objectives .
Finally , the comment that puts net neutrality back on the table :
In providing access to â€œbroadcastingâ€ , ISPs do not transmit programs .
As such , they are not â€œbroadcastingâ€  and therefore they do not come within the definition of â€œbroadcasting undertakingâ€ .
In so holding , I wish to reiterate as was done in CAIP that this conclusion is based on the content - neutral role of ISPs and would have to be reassessed if this role should change ( CAIP , para . 92 ) .
The now - dead KIN was not a bad idea ( read our hands - on with the platform ) .
Microsoft 's ambitions with the KIN were sound .
As much as the iPhone and , lately , Android handsets garner all the press attention , smartphones represent only a minority of phone sales — a growing minority , but a minority all the same .
There are many , many people who do n't have a smartphone , and do n't even particularly want one , and they easily outnumber smartphone users .
Redmond wanted to be a part of this broader market .
The company was already a big player in the smartphone market with Windows Mobile ; the KIN was a product of its ambitions beyond that space .
So rather than starting from scratch , in 2008 Microsoft bought Danger , the company behind the T - Mobile Sidekick line .
The choice made sense .
Danger 's products were not just phones ; they included an online component , too .
Sidekick users had their contacts , calendars , e-mails , and photos all stored online , and the handsets all included instant messaging .
This combination of ( phone ) software plus online services clearly resonated with Microsoft .
Sidekicks were n't smartphones , but their online tie-ins meant they were also more than " dumbphones . "
Danger 's products also showed real focus .
The Sidekicks were aimed at teenagers and young adults , and the hardware reflected this .
SMS and instant messaging are particularly important to this demographic , because talking on the phone makes it hard to multitask — taking a phone call when you 're just chillaxin ' with your friends can be annoying .
Danger threw in cameras , of course , because a phone is how you take pictures these days .
And the hardware was all fairly robust .
KIN was supposed to be the spiritual successor to the Sidekick .
Similar target market , similar emphasis on SMS and instant messaging , but bolstered with better hardware , even richer online integration , and support for the all - important Facebook .
Even the hardware styling was not a million miles away from that of the Sidekicks , though the novel rotating screen was replaced with a more conventional slide mechanism .
The Sidekick was popular , so should n't its successor have flourished ?
Pricing problems
Well , we know now that it did n't .
After rumors of sales numbering only a few hundred , it looks like the true figure is just a few thousand .
More than 500 , certainly , but below 10,000 .
That 's pretty astonishingly lackluster .
KIN , like the Sidekick before it , was a device aimed at teenagers and young adults .
It should have been cheap to buy and cheap to operate .
But it was n't .
The pricing was , frankly , nuts : $ 150 for the KIN ONE or $ 200 for the KIN TWO ( albeit with a $ 100 mail - in rebate available for both ) along with call plans that started at $ 60 / month .
From day one , it did n't stand a chance .
Though the hardware prices were slashed , the plans remained prohibitively expensive .
Verizon , for its part , did little to promote the device .
Microsoft ran extensive advertisements for the product , but Verizon left the devices to languish in dark corners at the back of its many stores .
In - store promotion is important — as Google learned with the Nexus One — but the KIN never received much of it .
The fundamental reason for these delays , the source claims , was a problem that is all too familiar in the software industry : Not Invented Here syndrome .
The switch to Verizon also meant that Microsoft lost the Sidekick branding .
Though the handsets were generally known as Sidekicks , they are , properly , called Hiptops ; that 's what Danger called them .
T - Mobile , the biggest seller of Danger 's devices , branded them as Sidekicks , and that 's the name that stuck .
The value of the pre-existing Sidekick userbase was wiped out by the move to Verizon , and though there were benefits ( Verizon 's network is more extensive than T - Mobile 's ) , abandoning existing users and strong branding was a high price to pay .
KIN 's software also had flaws .
The biggest omission was probably calendar syncing ; Sidekick had it , KIN did n't .
A software update has been promised , but in light of the product 's cancellation , it 's not clear that it will actually materialize .
Opinions on the phone software varied — consensus seems to be that it was overall pretty mediocre ; not horrifically bad , but not particularly good , either .
The KIN did have one consistently well - received part : KIN Studio .
KIN Studio provided a central place for managing all the pictures and videos that KIN users produced , providing easy and effective dissemination of that information into social networking sites .
Infighting and outfighting
On the face of it , it 's astonishing that Verizon would treat the product this way .
The pricing model meant that the product would never stand a chance ; the lack of promotion crippled it yet further .
This is a strange thing to do for an exclusive product with a successful predecessor , especially when Microsoft was willing to do so much promotion of its own .
A source speaking to Engadget gives some indication of why Verizon acted this way .
The mobile operator was allegedly set to give KIN attractive pricing for both handsets and plans — pricing them in reach of its target audience — but Microsoft could n't get the hardware finished in time .
The fundamental reason for these delays , the source claims , was a problem that is all too familiar in the software industry : Not Invented Here syndrome .
Danger 's phone software was Java - based , but rather than continuing to build on this codebase — a codebase that was already driving a range of successful products — the " strategic " decision was made to scrap everything and build on Windows CE instead .
This decision , it is claimed , set the project back by some 18 months .
Verizon lost patience with Microsoft , and so dropped its teenage - friendly pricing structure in favor of the smartphone - level costs we see now .
Part of the delay may have stemmed from internal Microsoft turf battles .
There are allegations of chronic infighting between the Windows Phone and KIN management .
Comments on the ( in ) famous Mini Microsoft blog point at a remarkable level of bad blood between the groups .
Mini Microsoft , a blog written by an anonymous Microsoft insider wishing to make the company leaner and more efficient , with a strong direction , attracts many anonymous comments from Microsoft employees past and present .
Though the authenticity is always something to be concerned about with such blogs , the comments , if accurate , paint a startling picture , and one is worth quoting at length :
Glad you named KIN , as I used to work there until few months ago .
KIN was a great and ambitious project ... until May 2009 .
The business , marketing , design vision was just spectacular !
In May 2009 , Mr. Myerson , decided to kill it because it was competing with his own baby , WP7 .
Since WP7 was not ready ( still today is by far ready ! ) the exec told him KIN would continue .
As retaliation , he killed the support of his team to KIN project .
Guess what ?
KIN team had to take over a lot of base code postponing all the value added apps + services .
Now you get why there is lack of apps on KIN .
Who will win in medium / long term ?
Mr Myerson obviously , that 's why I decide to leave .
" Mr. Myerson " is Terry Myerson , head of Windows Phone engineering .
If true , it means that not only was KIN lumbered with the overhead of targeting a brand new platform , it also did n't have access to the engineering resources that might possibly have served to make such a switch worthwhile .
Instead of consolidating expertise ( surely the biggest benefit to a unified operating system base ) , poor management meant that the effect was the exact opposite , with the KIN team having to do the work that , by rights , should have been done by the Windows Phone team .
How to tear Phone Books By Clay Edgin — # 1 Certified Gripper King and Grip Monster Check out Clay's Athlete Profile--CLICK HERE
If you ask around , the chances are pretty good that someone has seen a phone book ' being ripped in half ' or knows of someone who does it , although it remains a feat of strength that almost seems superhuman .
The purpose of this article is to de-mystify the tearing of a phone book and show you just how easy it can be .
Tearing a phone book in half is something I have wanted to do since before I ever got into grip training but how do you go about ripping a 2 ” thick hunk of paper ?
It was n’t until I started talking with Michael Wayne , a good friend of mine and strong ' gripster ' in his own regard , that the technique clicked in my head .
First , grab the top of your book and keep your hands as far apart as possible while still having all your fingers on it .
Tightly grip the book with the pinky and ring finger on each hand .
In the picture below , you can see that my index and middle fingers are n’t even gripping the book .
With your thumbs or thumb pads , push the center of the book away from you so that it forms a “ U ”
From here , grip the book tightly with your entire hand , including the middle and index fingers on each hand , and begin to “ bend ” the ends of the book down Notice how the pages between my index fingers are now in a “ V ” shape and the pages at the top of the book are fanned out a little and look almost stretched .
Continue to bend the edges of the book down while maintaining a tight grip .
The book binding and pages on top of the book will split , making a pleasant popping sound and you ’ll end up with something like in the picture below .
Now , continue to bend the edges of the book down until you have torn through all the pages .
If you do not tear through all the pages in the first motion , reset your hands on top of the book a little closer and go through the same motions again .
And as you bend the edges of the book down , try to pull the book apart
If your pinch strength is strong enough , keep this grip on the book and continue to tear it .
You will now have to push with one hand and pull with the other to finish off the book .
If your pinch grip is not strong enough to do this , re-grip the book as in the picture below and then push / pull it apart .
There , that was too easy !
If the phone book you are trying to tear is too thick and you are killing yourself trying to rip it in half , open the book up to the middle and tear it in half down the binding so instead of one 2 ” book you have two 1 ” books .
Aside from stealing your neighbor ’s phonebooks before they wake up , there are several reliable sources for phone books that you should check out .
Some recycling centers have literally tons of the books and most will tell you that having the books torn in half actually helps them make it easier to recycle .
Be sure to recycle the books when you are finished tearing them though .
Motels are another great place to get phonebooks .
When the new books are delivered , call the local motels and ask them if you can have their old phonebooks .
Larger hotels that have several hundred rooms will have at least one book per room and can provide you with more phonebooks than you ’ll rip in a year .
The last option is not one I recommend , but it works .
If you are really hard up for phonebooks and the recyclers or motels do n’t have any to spare , you can call your local yellow page directory service and have new books delivered to your door .
One large phone company told me that my local directory was free and I could order as many as I wanted .
After I wiped the drool from my phone I had a couple dozen delivered .
Several phone companies I talked to that put out phone books told me that a couple months after they have distributed the new phone books , they usually have thousands upon thousands sitting in a warehouse waiting to be ordered and they are more willing to give those away since the extra ones will go to the recycler if they have n’t found a home .
Have fun with this , and if you have any aches or pains , wait until they are 100 % better before ripping more books !!

I like programming – it ’s what I do and I am blessed in that I get to spend most of my waking hours developing software .
Like a lot of programmers I obsess over how good my code is and how I can get better at it .
Over the years there have been reading a lot of articles and books on software development .
There has been a lot of ink spent ( both physical and virtual ) on ways to improve your “ programming foo ” and become a super ninja programmer !
There are some common pearls in all this ink and one of them is the advice on reading code .
This advice , is usually a one liner couched in the midst of a bunch of other recommendations and usually along the lines of – find some great open source software or any piece of software that you admire , open up the source code ( or print it out ) and read it .
While , this is on the whole , great advice there are some problems with actually putting it in practice .
In this post I endeavor to give some practical suggestions on reading code , but first let us enumerate the problems .
The usual impression conveyed ( in the posts that advise one to read code ) is that the dispenser of the advice is a programming guru who can literally sit back in their chair with a page of code and read it like a novel .
Well , I am sure there are some superb programmers out there who enjoy looking at pages of cryptic English - like statements over a cup of coffee and can hold entire class hierarchies and architectures in their heads .
This post is not meant for them – this post is for poor slobs like me who find staring at reams of code a boring , frustrating and ultimately pointless exercise .
Of course , it can be argued that one can learn simply by reading a single class or even a function of a the entire project code , but , IMO , except for the most simple problems , most software is interdependent .
It is often impossible to appreciate the design decisions and the rationale behind a particular function or class layout without knowing the rest of the system …

It is often impossible to appreciate the design decisions and the rationale behind a particular function or class layout without knowing the rest of the system …
The next problem is getting code to read ( actually before that you need to be able to identify code worth reading – check out this post for details on that ) .
There is a lot of great software out there – both open source and freely available and licensed or proprietary .
There are huge open source directories like Sourceforge and Google Code , and huge pieces of software like Open Office and Linux .
If you are working in a software development company , you can probably get access to the proprietary code in your source control repository .
A third common avenue are the programs distributed along with books on software development or as part of resources for education ( Minix being the canonical example ) .
Indeed we are actually spoiled for choice and from this universe of software identifying the ones that are good candidates for our purpose is a hard but essential task .
Another problem is the language in which the program is written – reading someone else ’s code is tough enough as it is , adding the burden of familiarizing yourself with the quirks and syntax of a new language while doing this , is , IMO , a recipe for disaster and immense frustration .
You need to find code written in a language that you are familiar with .
This particular problem is not relevant if you are going through the code distributed as part of a book or as an educational resource , since you would have the book or your mentor to explain things and set out the context .
If , despite this forewarning , you are planning to read code written in a different language than you are used to ( without the benefit of having a book or a mentor ) I would advise , that you at least learn enough of the language to create your own programs in it ( “ Hello World ” does not count :-) ) .
The bit about context brings me to the next problem – figuring out what the code is doing is a lot harder if you are not familiar with the software itself .
For example , it is far more difficult to go through the Linux code and figure out the concept of runlevels if you do n’t use Linux daily and see the Linux boot sequence .
Using the software gives one a context with which to read the code – this context includes the common terminology used , the functionality and features of the software , even the quirks and bugs that you experience .
I have realized that for me ‘ reading code ’ does not really describe the activities that I undertake – a better phrase for what I do is ‘ code comprehension ’ .
It is quite difficult for me to sit back with a laptop screen ( or a printout ) full of code and simply read through it .
I need a lot more than simply a piece of code – I like to be able to look at documentation , play with the software , step through the code and even write tests for it before I really appreciate it .
This is a significant investment of my time and effort , so I have to be very picky about the software I want to “ read ” ( comprehend ) .
The first filter I place on the code directory , when looking for code is the language filter – for me this means – C# or VB.NET or Python or Javascript ( while I am familiar with C++ , Ruby and F# as well I do not consider myself at a level where I can understand other people ’s code in them ) .
Next is to look for software that I have used – this allows me the a bit of a leg up since I know what the code is meant to do , cannot do and ( if I am familiar enough ) its limitations .
Good candidates are open source software that you use in your day job ( for eg . I use Cruise Control .
NET , NANT and NUnit which are open source tools written in C# )
I happen to work in a software product company ( a Microsoft shop ) , so one of the candidates for my reading list is the code in my companies source repository .
If you happen to work in a software company , you can look at other projects , and even older versions of the software you are working on .
In addition to providing insight on code , you get a pretty good idea of what was tried before and since .
There are a few caveats though – First , if you do n’t have direct access to other projects , you need to ask permission – some companies are very touchy about their “ intellectual property ” .
Second , the quality of the software may not be as high as you think , since , in general , proprietary code does not get the kind of scrutiny open source code does .
Warning signs to look out for are a lack of regular code reviews – if the software is not code reviewed the odds are that it would not be of good quality .
Third ( this point is inspired from feedback provided by my friend Praseed ) , if the code in your company is business software ( HR , Finance , ERP , etc ) there is a lot of business context that needs to be understood first .
Also , since most of this code tends to be factored by business functionality , it generally seems less modular than utility code or APIs .
Look for well documented projects ( this applies to open source as well as proprietary code ) .
By this I mean , that the documentation should highlight the overall design , and rationale for the way the code is .
Simply having auto - generated Java Doc type documents cannot be considered documentation :-) .
One useful avenue to explore is software created as educational resources ( like Minix ) .
Since , the target is to teach through the software , they are usually quite clearly documented and have plenty of material explaining the design rationale behind the code .
So , you have identified the software and downloaded the source code and documentation , so let ’s get down and start spelunking ;-)
Go through the design documentation and try to get a feel for the way the code has been built .
Good software projects follow certain architectural patterns – these dictate the code organization .
Once you get a handle on this , understanding the code becomes a whole lot easier .
If you can create a class diagram of the code you can get a good idea of the layout .
The next thing to do is to compile it and run it .
This can be straightforward or tough depending on the process followed in the project and it ’s documentation .
Now it ’s time to fire up your favorite IDE and go exploring .
A good place to start your code exploration would be to try to trace a functionality of the project that you are familiar with .
This would let you go through the various layers and sub-systems and get a handle on how they inter-connect .
For example when I was exploring NUnit – I started by writing a test and looking at the code classes I needed to do that .
Try and identify the design patterns used in the code .
If you do not know what design patterns are , then you need to stop reading this post right now and read this book .
Familiarize yourself with design patterns – they form a great way to recognize and understand the design of well written code .
This makes it easier to keep it in your head while reading code .
It also helps you identify nuances and customizations made by the programmers more easily .
Try to write tests for the code to fully understand it – this is really useful way to understand the dependencies between different parts of the code .
When you try to write a test for the code you first need to satisfy ( mock ) all its dependencies .
Next you need to understand the possible entry points as well as the exit values for the code .
This improves your understanding of the code and get you to the next level .
Finally , try to refactor the code .
In this step you have moved from simply understanding the code to becoming familiar enough to be able to modify it .
As the sophistication of your refactoring increases so too does your understanding .
At this point you can if needed contribute your own code to the project :-)
“ Code Reading ” IMO is more than just reading – it is a distinct set of activities that together help one understand code .
It might seem more intimidating than simply “ reading code ” but it is well worth then effort IMO .
Happy “ code reading ” :-)
Update : I came across this post by Joel Spolsky where he quotes Seth Gordon as saying code reading “ Is just like reading the Talmud ” … Yup , code reading is definitely not easy .

A huge cache of secret US military files today provides a devastating portrait of the failing war in Afghanistan , revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents , Taliban attacks have soared and Nato commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency .
The disclosures come from more than 90,000 records of incidents and intelligence reports about the conflict obtained by the whistleblowers ' website WikiLeaks in one of the biggest leaks in US military history .
The files , which were made available to the Guardian , the New York Times and the German weekly Der Spiegel , give a blow - by - blow account of the fighting over the last six years , which has so far cost the lives of more than 320 British and more than 1,000 US troops .
Their publication comes amid mounting concern that Barack Obama 's " surge " strategy is failing and as coalition troops hunt for two US naval personnel captured by the Taliban south of Kabul on Friday .
The war logs also detail :
• How a secret " black " unit of special forces hunts down Taliban leaders for " kill or capture " without trial .
• How the US covered up evidence that the Taliban have acquired deadly surface - to - air missiles .
• How the coalition is increasingly using deadly Reaper drones to hunt and kill Taliban targets by remote control from a base in Nevada .
• How the Taliban have caused growing carnage with a massive escalation of their roadside bombing campaign , which has killed more than 2,000 civilians to date .
In a statement , the White House said the chaotic picture painted by the logs was the result of " under - resourcing " under Obama 's predecessor , saying : " It is important to note that the time period reflected in the documents is January 2004 to December 2009 . "
The White House also criticised the publication of the files by WikiLeaks : " We strongly condemn the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organisations , which puts the lives of the US and partner service members at risk and threatens our national security .
WikiLeaks made no effort to contact the US government about these documents , which may contain information that endanger the lives of Americans , our partners , and local populations who co-operate with us . "
The logs detail , in sometimes harrowing vignettes , the toll on civilians exacted by coalition forces : events termed " blue on white " in military jargon .
The logs reveal 144 such incidents .
Some of these casualties come from the controversial air strikes that have led to Afghan government protests , but a large number of previously unknown incidents also appear to be the result of troops shooting unarmed drivers or motorcyclists out of a determination to protect themselves from suicide bombers .
At least 195 civilians are admitted to have been killed and 174 wounded in total , but this is likely to be an underestimate as many disputed incidents are omitted from the daily snapshots reported by troops on the ground and then collated , sometimes erratically , by military intelligence analysts .
Bloody errors at civilians ' expense , as recorded in the logs , include the day French troops strafed a bus full of children in 2008 , wounding eight .
A US patrol similarly machine - gunned a bus , wounding or killing 15 of its passengers , and in 2007 Polish troops mortared a village , killing a wedding party including a pregnant woman , in an apparent revenge attack .
Questionable shootings of civilians by UK troops also figure .
The US compilers detail an unusual cluster of four British shootings in Kabul in the space of barely a month , in October / November 2007 , culminating in the death of the son of an Afghan general .
Of one shooting , they wrote : " Investigation controlled by the British .
We are not able to get [ sic ] complete story . "
A second cluster of similar shootings , all involving Royal Marine commandos in Helmand province , took place in a six - month period at the end of 2008 , according to the log entries .
Asked by the Guardian about these allegations , the Ministry of Defence said : " We have been unable to corroborate these claims in the short time available and it would be inappropriate to speculate on specific cases without further verification of the alleged actions . "
Rachel Reid , who investigates civilian casualty incidents in Afghanistan for Human Rights Watch , said : " These files bring to light what 's been a consistent trend by US and Nato forces : the concealment of civilian casualties .
Despite numerous tactical directives ordering transparent investigations when civilians are killed , there have been incidents I 've investigated in recent months where this is still not happening .
Accountability is not just something you do when you are caught .
It should be part of the way the US and Nato do business in Afghanistan every time they kill or harm civilians . "
The reports , many of which the Guardian is publishing in full online , present an unvarnished and often compelling account of the reality of modern war .
Most of the material , though classified " secret " at the time , is no longer militarily sensitive .
A small amount of information has been withheld from publication because it might endanger local informants or give away genuine military secrets .
WikiLeaks , whose founder , Julian Assange , obtained the material in circumstances he will not discuss , said it would redact harmful material before posting the bulk of the data on its " uncensorable " servers .
WikiLeaks published in April this year a previously suppressed classified video of US Apache helicopters killing two Reuters cameramen on the streets of Baghdad , which gained international attention .
A 22 - year - old intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , was arrested in Iraq and charged with leaking the video , but not with leaking the latest material .
The Pentagon 's criminal investigations department continues to try to trace the leaks and recently unsuccessfully asked Assange , he says , to meet them outside the US to help them .
Assange allowed the Guardian to examine the logs at our request .
No fee was involved and WikiLeaks was not involved in the preparation of the Guardian 's articles .

Alexei Stukov ( also spelled Alexi Stukov ) was a human from Earth .
He was the vice admiral of the UED Expeditionary Fleet and tactical advisor to Admiral Gerard DuGalle .
He was later resurrected via infestation , and made into an infested terran .
Contents show ]
Biography Edit
Early Service Edit
Stukov grew up on Earth , rising through the ranks of the United Powers League alongside his friend Gerard DuGalle .
Both men were competitive throughout their youths and constantly played at getting the best of one another .
Unlike DuGalle however , Stukov spent most of his military career in top - secret research rather than in actual combat , constantly striving to push the limit of conventional technology and physical theory to increase the effectiveness of UPL troops in warfare .
His views on the subject were considered unconventional . [ 3 ]
Despite research taking up most of his time , Stukov was not completely unfamiliar with combat , his awards showing this .
He won the Crux de Valor with combat tags and , for his involvement in the quelling of the Ishanti Uprising , three Bronze Gammadons . [ 4 ]
Family matters were not unfamiliar to him either , fathering four children . [ 5 ]
The Brood War Edit
A New Enemy Edit
The discovery of alien species in the Koprulu sector changed the UPL 's stance to their wayward colonies along with its own power structure .
Now serving the United Earth Directorate , Stukov was appointed as second - in - command of an expeditionary force to bring the Koprulu Sector and its inhabitants under UED control .
Serving under DuGalle , Stukov departed Earth for the galactic fringe . [ 3 ]
Shortly after arriving in the sector , Stukov and DuGalle witnessed a demonstration of the zerg attacking the base of a Terran Dominion colony .
DuGalle had released the zerg onto an unsuspecting colony to " observe " them in warfare .
Stukov was indifferent , claiming to know " all about the zerg " from seeing tapes " a hundred times " but DuGalle forced him to watch , claiming that the live demonstration would instill a resolve within the Vice Admiral that recorded dissections could not .
In this he was correct , Stukov resolving to go " all the way . "
After seeing enough , the Aleksander then withdrew and left the besieged colonists to die by the zerg . [ 6 ]
First Strike Edit
Stukov tried to blockade Braxis when the protoss visited , for reasons unknown to him .
The protoss were able to penetrate the blockade , and eventually Stukov had to give up the chase . [ 7 ]
Later , Stukov ordered a Captain of the UED fleet , newly awakened from cryogenic hibernation , to assault Braxis and take control of its capital city of Boralis within two standard hours .
Unfortunately , the attacking forces were hampered by a lack of vespene gas . [ 8 ]
When the UED met the Confederate Resistance Forces , its commander Lieutenant Samir Duran offered his services and skills in return for amnesty .
Stukov was initially suspicious , but when Duran said that he could show an alternate route that leads to the rear of Boralis , Stukov accepted his aid and formally declared Duran and his troops as new conscripts of the UED — " Very well , Lieutenant .
Consider yourself and your men the first colonial conscripts of the United Earth Directorate . " [ 9 ]
The Iron Fist Edit
" Ah , General Duke .
I expected your forces to arrive sooner .
You should know that we represent not one of your rag - tag peasant Militias , but the combined might of the United Earth Directorate . " - Stukov greets General Edmund Duke as battle brews ( src )
Stukov accompanied the UED fleet when it attacked the Dylarian Shipyards .
Duran warned him and DuGalle of the impending Dominion counterstrike . [ 10 ]
The UED forces stole the shipyard 's battlecruisers and escaped . [ 11 ]
When a Confederate psi disrupter was discovered on Tarsonis , Duran convinced DuGalle of the need to destroy the device . [ 12 ]
Stukov however , believed the disrupter to be a useful tool to the UED and sent his personal guard to relieve Duran after he had secured it . [ 13 ]
Without telling DuGalle , he had the disrupter secretly dismantled , transported to Braxis , and reassembled . [ 14 ]
While the UED pursued Emperor Arcturus Mengsk and Commander Jim Raynor to Aiur in their campaign against the Dominion , Stukov became increasingly perturbed at the increasing number of allies that Mengsk was able to bring to bear against them .
When a massive wave of zerg attacked the UED just in time to allow Mengsk to escape their grasp once again , Stukov was horrified .
Not only had Raynor and the protoss joined forces with the Dominion , but the seemingly mindless zerg had done so as well . [ 15 ]
When Stukov realized that Duran had deliberately moved his forces out of place so as to allow the zerg to pass , [ 16 ]
Stukov finally grasped that their inconspicuous ally had not only been playing them from the start , but likely had been infested by the zerg as well .
With this new revelation , Stukov immediately fled back to Braxis with his troops loyal to him , where he activated the psi disrupter . [ 14 ]
Patriot 's Blood Edit
" I mean no offense , Admiral .
But perhaps Stukov 's loyalties are not as strong as you once believed . " - Lieutenant Samir Duran to Admiral Gerard DuGalle(src )
DuGalle was livid , especially since Duran was goading him .
He ordered Duran to execute Stukov for treason against the UED , a task Duran gladly accepted . [ 17 ]
Stukov 's personal forces resisted the UED , but eventually Duran located Stukov and shot him .
Duran promptly vanished .
With his dying breath , Stukov told DuGalle that Duran had been manipulating him from the beginning , was almost certainly infested by the zerg and may have been for a long time . [ 18 ]
Stukov 's last words were punctuated when the outer walls of the psi disrupter were breached by a massive wave of zerg , triggering alarms and possibly setting off the disrupter 's self - destruct sequence .
At DuGalle 's request , the remainder of Stukov 's personal forces assisted the UED forces in their efforts to recapture the disrupter from the zerg and succeeded in time . [ 14 ]
Legacies Edit
The vice admiral 's ignominious fate was hidden by UED propaganda , which claimed Stukov had died in the " final valiant assault on Char " against the zerg .
His body was then buried in space during the military funeral . [ 5 ]
DuGalle took Stukov 's death personally realizing the shortsightedness caused by his pride directly led to the death of his friend . [ 19 ]
Kerrigan would pick at the wound , taunting DuGalle after the UED victory on Char by declaring that Stukov was " twice the man you are . " [ 20 ]
Reanimation Edit
" Now you will taste the vengeance of the New Swarm .
Destroy them !!!! " - Stukov defies Taldarin and Jim Raynor ( src )
Stukov 's death , however , was temporary .
After being ' spaced , ' he was captured by the zerg . [ 21 ]
He was resurrected and infested by a cerebrate , Kaloth , [ 22 ] as an experiment in creating infested human leaders , [ 23 ] to turn them into leaders of their own colonies . [ 24 ]
Stukov also held Doctor Emil Narud responsible for his creation . [ 25 ]
His infestation gave the zerg some knowledge of the United Earth Directorate . [ 26 ]
The Kimeran Pirates raided a Terran Confederacy installation .
According to the stolen data , the Confederates were studying how to revive terrans using zerg reanimation techniques .
One subject of these experiments was an infested terran named Morik , who had maintained some of his sanity .
When the Pirates left , taking Morik with them , they were eventually tracked down . [ 27 ]
Stukov hired mercenaries to destroy enemies who had conveniently settled on the same dark planet , including the Kimeran Pirates .
The Kimerans were mostly or completely wiped out by Stukov 's mercenaries . [ 28 ]
Eventually , Stukov gained control of a zerg brood ( the New Swarm ) and moved to Braxis . [ 22 ]
The protoss discovered them quickly , [ 29 ] while Stukov was still maturing into the role . [ 22 ]
His weakness was reflected by poor efficiency in the zerg ; the suicidal infested terrans were much less potent . [ 30 ]
Nonetheless , Stukov could rely on a large zerg and renegade terran force .
The terran component was not wholly reliable ; doubts about Stukov 's sanity pushed many toward leaving the infested terran 's service .
The protoss developed a nanite serum to reverse Stukov 's infestation .
Assaulting Braxis and delivering the serum was entrusted to a small joint terran and protoss force led by Jim Raynor and Taldarin , a dragoon .
Raynor , a protoss ally , joined the operation at Artanis 's request .
Once on the surface , Raynor and Taldarin were joined by terran troops defecting from Stukov , including a Skullder pilot .
Additional help came by freeing Stukov 's protoss prisoners .
Stukov was cornered and captured after heavy fighting . [ 22 ]
The serum freed Stukov from the zerg long enough to escape with Raynor and Taldarin . [ 31 ]
Stukov lamented the serum 's effects . [ 32 ]
The protoss then burned Braxis ' surface from orbit . [ 22 ]
Heart of the Swarm Edit
" Let 's recap — I was betrayed and killed , shot into space , captured by the zerg , resurrected and infested , cured , given to Moebius to research the protoss cure , and was instead experimented on as the cure slowly failed .
Everyone up to speed ?
Good . " - Stukov narrates his experiences .( src )
Stukov was given to the Moebius Foundation so they could research the protoss cure , but as it slowly failed , they experimented on him , resulting in him being re-infested .
[ 21 ]
Stukov was imprisoned by Doctor Emil Narud and the Dominion at Skygeirr Station . [ 33 ]
Narud experimented on Stukov personally . [ 34 ]
The following section contains information from Heroes of the Storm and is not canon to StarCraft continuity
While Narud experimented on him , Stukov told himself that it could n't get worse .
But then it did . [ 35 ]
Joining the Swarm Edit
" Well , we both seem to be
" Indeed , and we share a common goal : the destruction of " You do not recognise me ?
I am Alexei Stukov .
We were enemies once .
" " Well , we both seem to be zerg now . " " Indeed , and we share a common goal : the destruction of this facility . " - Stukov introduces himself to Kerrigan ( src )
During the Second Great War , Stukov escaped and contacted Sarah Kerrigan , his former enemy , seeking revenge .
He told her of his imprisonment and that the base was also used for breeding protoss / zerg hybrids . [ 33 ] [ 36 ]
The two worked together to defeat the Dominion garrison there [ 37 ] as well as the hybrids in the facility 's lower levels . [ 25 ]
Despite this , not all was well .
The hybrid dominators in the lab had tried to sap Kerrigan 's energy , and she theorized that this was their purpose — to obtain psionic energy to be used to resurrect Amon , Narud 's master .
It would require a lot , but Stukov pointed out that when Kerrigan was de-infested at Char , all the power she 'd wielded as the Queen of Blades had to go somewhere .
If there were hybrids nearby when this had occurred , then Narud might have obtained all the psionic energy he needed to resurrect his master . [ 33 ] [ 38 ]
The pair entered the bottom level , where Narud and a Tal ' darim force loyal to him awaited .
Narud fired a null zone at Kerrigan , one that she was able to keep at bay with her own psionic powers , but at the cost of her mobility .
Stukov led the zerg on the field of battle , defeating the Tal'darim and deactivating xel 'naga temples that were feeding Narud 's power .
With the deactivation of these temples , Kerrigan was able to incapacitate Narud [ 39 ] and go on to kill him . [ 40 ]
With Narud dead and the lab destroyed , Stukov had achieved his vengeance .
He 'd assumed that Kerrigan would kill him once the battle was over , but she was willing to let him go his own way .
As Stukov pointed out though , there was nowhere he could go , given his status as an infested terran .
Kerrigan offered him a place in the Swarm until he made up his mind , which he accepted . [ 33 ] [ 41 ]
As the leviathan prepared to leave however , Stukov could see that something was wrong .
Kerrigan revealed that through her battle with Narud , she 'd discovered that Amon had indeed been resurrected , only she did not know where he was .
She would take the Swarm to face him , but only after tying up some remaining loose ends in the Koprulu sector . [ 42 ]
Searching for Raynor Edit
Stukov is with Kerrigan when she searches for Jim Raynor Plot branch :
" You ca n't go home again . "
" I know .
I have no place on Earth now . "
" I mean I wo n't let you . "
" When I see the stars arrayed before me like this , I think of Earth .
I remember its green hills . " " You ca n't go home again . " " I know .
I have no place on Earth now . "
" I mean I wo n't let you . "
- Stukov and Kerrigan discuss the prospects of Stukov returning to Earth ( src )
Raynor was held captive by the Dominion .
Kerrigan sought to free him and enlisted Raynor 's Raiders to find him . [ 43 ]
Stukov and Kerrigan conversed about Earth as the Swarm waited .
While he remembered Earth fondly , Stukov knew he could not return home ; also , Kerrigan would prevent any attempt to avoid drawing the attention of the UED .
Both agreed that the UED would eventually return to the Sector . [ 33 ] [ 44 ]
Plot branch ends here
A Return to Korhal Edit
" I do n't think it will be that simple .
It never is with
" But you 've been part of so many of his plans — as accomplice or victim .
I am sure you learned a trick or two , yes ? "
" I did .
We 'll find out very soon if I was a good student . "
" Here you are , at the enemy 's doorstep .
It is almost over . "
" I do n't think it will be that simple .
It never is with Arcturus .
He thinks around you , that one .
He knows where you 'll walk before you do .
" " But you 've been part of so many of his plans — as accomplice or victim .
I am sure you learned a trick or two , yes ? " " I did .
We 'll find out very soon if I was a good student . "
- Stukov and Kerrigan discussing the invasion of Korhal ( src )
Intent on taking vengeance against Mengsk , Kerrigan brought the zerg to invade Korhal .
Once again , Stukov found himself in a command position in regards to assaulting the Dominion throne world , only this time with the Swarm rather than the UED . [ 33 ] [ 45 ]
The opening attack went to the zerg 's favor , as they were able to establish a beachhead on the surface and destroy Korhal 's orbital defenses from below . [ 46 ]
Kerrigan cautioned Stukov that they should n't be overconfident , that Mengsk was a suave tactician and would have something up his sleeve . [ 33 ] [ 47 ]
That turned out to be the Psi Destroyer , its field ripping apart zerg through their hivemind connection .
Its deployment coincided with a Dominion counterattack , intended to keep them pre-occupied from the device .
Kerrigan assigned Broodmother Zagara command of the Swarm and to hold the center , while she assigned Stukov to screen Zagara 's flanks .
Kerrigan meanwhile went with Dehaka to destroy the device , in which she succeeded . [ 48 ]
Finally , all that was left to do was to make a final assault on Mengsk 's palace .
Before the assault , Kerrigan confided with Stukov , telling him that if she succeeded in killing Mengsk , she would take the Swarm to confront Amon , even though it was a fight that she did not believe she could win .
With the only other option being to bow to the inevitable however , fighting was the only choice to make , an assertion that Stukov agreed with , and told Kerrigan that he would stick with her to the end . [ 33 ] [ 49 ]
The attack was launched .
Kerrigan led her forces into the fray , while Stukov , Zagara , and Dehaka attacked the defending force 's flanks .
However , the defending flank forces were well entrenched , and none of the zerg attacking them were able to break through . [ 50 ]
Plot branch : Kerrigan clears the flanks
Kerrigan 's zerg attacked the entrenched positions from the rear , clearing them out .
The way clear , Stukov led a force of infested terrans into the fray . [ 50 ]
Plot branch ends here
Ultimately , the attack was successful , [ 50 ] and Mengsk was killed .
With that , the Swarm departed to find and confront Amon . [ 51 ]
End War Edit
This article or section contains information derived from Co-op Missions , and should not be considered part of the official StarCraft storyline .
Alongside fellow commanders , Stukov commanded infested terran forces during the End War . [ 52 ]
Into the Void Edit
" Hello , Duran .
Do you remember what you did to me ? "
" Stukov ... You 've come to gloat , have n't you . "
" No .
I 've come to say goodnight , you son of a bitch . " - Narud and Stukov 's final exchange ( src )
Stukov was among Kerrigan 's forces that she led into the Void in the final stages of the End War .
Within the Void , he found Narud , revealed as a xel'naga .
Narud assumed that Stukov was there to gloat .
However , Stukov was there to exact revenge for his death , and in an inverse of their confrontation six years ago , he personally slew Narud for good . [ 53 ]
The following section contains information from Heroes of the Storm and is not canon to StarCraft continuity
" My allegiance was to Kerrigan .
Not to you . " - Stukov to Zagara( src )
At some point after the End War , Stukov left the Swarm , which came under the rule of Overqueen Zagara .
While he had some personal allegiance to Kerrigan , that allegiance did not extend to the Swarm as a whole . [ 35 ]
Game Unit Edit

Alexei Stukov is a playable hero in Heroes of the Storm .
Personality and Traits Edit
" I 'd be more nihilistic if I was n't so fatalistic . " - Stukov( src )
As a human , Stukov enjoyed smoking and vodka , [ 6 ] and in infested form , sometimes missed the latter .
He speaks with a Russian accent .
As a child , he enjoyed horror stories . [ 21 ]
Despite the two men being on opposing sides during the Brood War , Jim Raynor considered Stukov to be an honorable man . [ 22 ]
As a UED naval officer , Stukov was highly professional , and completely dedicated to carrying out the mission of the Expeditionary Fleet .
He was unfailingly loyal to his best friend and superior , Admiral Gerard DuGalle , but was willing to disobey DuGalle when Samir Duran led DuGalle astray . [ 14 ]
As an infested terran under Kaloth , Stukov appeared to embrace his position to a degree . [ 22 ]
After his initial de-infestation and the subsequent return of the condition , Stukov displayed a more fatalistic outlook on his position , believing that he had no place other than in the Swarm , as no one else would accept what he had become . [ 33 ] [ 41 ]
The following section contains information from Heroes of the Storm and is not canon to StarCraft continuity
Stukov has indicated some lingering loyalty to the UED , even in his infested state .
He has called himself a traitor , along with other former fleet members .
He has expressed confidence and / or hope that the UED will return to the sector .
He dislikes Abathur , and his role in the Swarm was from personal allegiance to Kerrigan , rather than the Swarm as a whole .
He has expressed disdain for the protoss and terrans of the Koprulu sector , seeing the former as being inclined towards " indulgent speeches , " and the latter as " backwater peasants . "
He also dislikes siege tanks . [ 35 ]
Abilities Edit
" The experiment 's unique condition continues to display extensive regenerative properties causing wounds and even limbs to recover quickly .
An unforeseen side effect of the infestation is a unique pathogen that spreads quickly . "
- Moebius Foundation Report N-05 -98-30 ( excerpt ) ( src )
As a human , Stukov was considered to be a brilliant tactician by his peers .
[ 3 ]
It was an assessment that Kerrigan shared , considering Stukov to be " twice the man " that DuGalle was . [ 20 ]
In infested form , Stukov possessed psionic abilities , along with a corrosive projectile attack . [ 39 ]
Unlike most infested terrans , he retained his intelligence , his mind closed off from the rest of the zerg hivemind ( at least after his initial de-infestation ) . [ 55 ] [ 56 ]
In his second infested form , Abathur rated Stukov as being only second to the Primal Queen of Blades .
However , due to his having been experimented on by Duran / Narud , Stukov was a product of a specific design , and the interweaving of terran and zerg genetic material was on a level that not even Abathur was capable of . [ 57 ] [ 56 ]
The following section contains information from Heroes of the Storm and is not canon to StarCraft continuity
Stukov 's infested state grants him regenerative properties , allowing him to heal wounds and even regrow limbs quickly .
The infestation gave him a fast - spreading pathogen that can quickly lead to contamination . [ 58 ]
He also has the ability to grow his infested arm , though it causes him a large amount of pain . [ 35 ]
Notes Edit
The LAPD has performed a bltizkreig assault on the real Superheroes of Hollywood Blvd ( http://ow.ly/1Wsch ) .
Just in front of the world famous Grauman 's Chinese Theater , dozens of Real - Life people who dress as superheroes on a daily basis were rounded up in a raid .
In a sinister government plot not seen since " Heroes. , Police jailed members of the " X - Men , " Batman , Edward Scissorhands , Bumblebee , Mr. Incredible and Catwoman for loitering .
The Incredible Hulk and Superman were just two of the iconic loiterers who outsmarted the fuzz and returned to panhandle another day .
Unlike these classic , renowned panhandlers , here are 12 people who really make a difference with their superhero costumes .
Who are famous real life heroes ?
What do these now - celebrity real - life superheroes even want ?
This list will give you the definition of what a superhero is and in some cases , the actions of these people proves that good does exist in the universe and it's often times underreported thah some heinous crimes .
Hopefully these people will remind of all positive about the world by their heroic actions .

Mr. Schmidt said that Google would honor all existing agreements and seek to add new partners .
“ Airline travel and search are a perfect opportunity for more innovation , more investment and more interesting products , ” Mr. Schmidt said .
“ The whole idea is to give people more of what they want , and more information when they are searching . ”
Companies that may lobby against the deal include Microsoft , Expedia and Kayak ; reservation networks like Travelport , Sabre and Amadeus ; and possibly even some airlines .
The deal has been rumored in the travel press for months .
Airlines could be concerned “ how Google will present this information , how will it appear in Google search and whether they will have to pay for the results , ” said Henry H. Harteveldt , an analyst at Forrester Research .
“ What airlines do not know is whether they will have to bid to have their own Web sites listed against the travel agencies . ”
Google declined to predict what kinds of services might result from the acquisition .
In the conference call , Marissa Mayer , Google ’s vice president for search products and user experience , talked about being able to answer more open - ended travel queries , like “ Where can I get within seven hours and within this price ? ”
“ Travel is one of the hardest problems around , both in the way people like to address queries and the accuracy and speed which you need to give people the results they are looking for , ” she said .
Rick Seaney , the co-founder of farecompare.com , which uses ITA ’s technology , said the deal might prompt some antitrust concerns , especially from Microsoft .
“ We have got a couple of months to contemplate this , ” Mr. Seaney said , citing the expected lengthy review process .
“ We do n’t really know what it all means yet , other than they will continue on with their existing relationships . ”
Vice President Biden told USA TODAY that the Obama administration must do a good job of selling its plan for Afghanistan , as skepticism from the public and Democrats in Congress continues to mount .
In an interview at Fort Drum , N.Y. , after welcoming home troops from Iraq , Biden acknowledged some of the frustrations voiced recently about the 9 - year - old Afghan war -- the longest in U.S. history .
But the vice president said he remains optimistic that Obama 's strategy to send in 30,000 more U.S. troops is the right thing to do .
We can maintain support " as long as we 're straight with the American people and the Congress about the progress we 're making , " Biden told USA TODAY 's David Jackson .
He stressed that " no war can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people . "
On Tuesday , 102 House Democrats joined 12 Republicans to vote " no " against emergency funding for the war in Afghanistan .
Most Americans continue to support the war , launched in the wake of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
But in a Gallup Poll two weeks ago , a record high 38 % said the U.S. " made a mistake " in sending troops to Afghanistan .

License to Kill ?
Intelligence Chief Says U.S. Can Take Out American Terrorists
Intelligence chief affirms U.S. can target Americans who present terror threat .
Feb. 3 , 2010  --
The director of national intelligence affirmed rather bluntly today that the U.S. intelligence community has authority to target American citizens for assassination if they present a direct terrorist threat to the United States .
" We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community ; if … we think that direct action will involve killing an American , we get specific permission to do that , " Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee .
Rep. Peter Hoekstra D- Mich. , addressed the issue at today 's hearing .
" The targeting of Americans -- it 's a very sensitive issue , but again there 's been more information in the public domain than what has been shared with this committee , " he said .
" There is no clarity . " Hoekstra said .
" What is the legal framework ? "
" Whether that American is involved in a group that is trying to attack us , whether that American has -- is a threat to other Americans .
Those are the factors involved . "
Blair explained .
" We do n't target people for free speech .
We target them for taking action that threatens Americans . "
According to U.S. officials , only a handful of Americans would be eligible for targeting by U.S. intelligence or military operations .
The legal guidance is determined by the National Security Council and the Justice Department .
In the past , the U.S. has killed Americans overseas but they were viewed as " collateral damage . "
In 2002 , the CIA killed American - born Kamal Derwish , a member of the " Lackawanna 6 " terror group during a CIA Predator drone strike .
Derwish was driving in a car with other members of al Qaeda , the government said .
In 2008 , a missile strike in Somalia killed American Ruben Shumpert , a Seattle man suspected of being an Islamist radical .
Shumpert was wanted by federal authorities on gun and counterfeit currency charges .
He had agreed to plead guilty but fled the country days before sentencing in 2004 .
The Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al Awlaki , who has become a prominent influence with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , was at a meeting with leaders of the terror group when U.S. officials knowingly launched a cruise missile strike to eliminate the terror leaders .
Several people were killed but Awlaki survived .
Terrorism an Emergent Threat , Recruitment Efforts Grow
The disclosure about detailed guidance to target Americans as part of terror plots comes amid fresh warnings about increased threats and concerns about new al Qaeda attacks .
" We have been warning in the past several years that al Qaeda itself and its associated affiliates and al Qaeda - inspired terrorists remain committed to striking the United States , " Blair said today , " and in the past year we have some names that goes behind these warnings . "
Blair cited the cases of Colorado terrorism suspect Najibullah Zazi , the accused Christmas Day bomber Farouk Abdulmutallab and Major Nidal Hasan , who was charged in the November 2009 Fort Hood shooting that killed 13 people .
" We have made complex , multi - team attacks very difficult for al Qaeda to pull off , but as we saw with the recent rash of attacks last year … identifying individual terrorists , small groups with short histories using simple attack methods , is a much more difficult task , " Blair said .
Blair added that radicalization and recruitment foments suicide bombers .
" Al Qaeda 's radical ideology seems to appeal strongly to a group of disaffected young Muslims , and this is a pool of potential suicide bombers and this pool unfortunately includes Americans , " Blair said .
The DNI said that Internet and social media sites have become critical to terrorism recruitment efforts .
Speaking about the Hasan case and his alleged Internet communications with al Awlaki , Blair said , " The homegrown radicalization of people in the United States … is a relatively new thing . "
Blair said U.S. intelligence was rapidly working to counter the emerging problem .
" There are some technical things , which are making it more difficult , with the use of social networking as opposed to simply looking at a Web site and responding by e-mail . "
Increasing Threat ?
Blair said this is " a threat , which may be increasing .
We 're taking it more and more seriously and this is a -- this is something that is very -- is potentially very dangerous to us because of all of the -- for all of the reasons of the rights that American citizens have .
" We may be shooting behind the rabbit here and it's moving faster than we thought and we 're spending a lot of additional effort on that , to try and understand it . "
Blair said .
No money .
No yard signs .
No web site .
And yet Alvin Greene of South Carolina wins the Democratic primary .
( Via AP )
The hunt was on late Tuesday night to figure out the true identity of the man who defeated former judge and legislator Vic Rawl for the right to run against Republican U.S. Senator Jim DeMint .
Even the Huffington Post put out a plea to its readers as the news came across the wires : “ Do YOU know anything about Alvin Greene ?
Do you have any photos of him ? ”
All that was known about Greene in the immediate aftermath of his primary victory was that he was an unemployed military veteran .
Some speculated that he had launched an ambitious ground campaign , going door to door .
But Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said she had not seen Greene since he had initially filed papers to run .
And she had another , far less inspiring rationale for his victory : Voters who did not know either candidate and opted instead to pick alphabetically .
For her part , Fowler says the unknown Greene will be a far weaker candidate against tea partier DeMint .

BP Gulf Oil Well Blowout May Never End
As I have previously noted , it is now clear that there is damage to BP 's well beneath the sea floor .
Recently - retired Shell Oil President John Hofmeister told MSNBC yesterday :
The question is whether there is enough mechanical structure left at the base of the reservoir to hold the cement when they start pouring cement in [ from the relief well ] .
***
The more oil we some coming out , the more it tells you that the whole casing system is deteriorating .
The fact that more oil would be coming out rather than less oil , would suggest that the construction within the pipe is offering no resistance whatsoever , and we ’re just getting a gusher .
Newsweek gives a balanced view regarding the risk of a total structural failure of the well :
The likelihood of a complete collapse is difficult to assess , in part , engineers and legislators say , because BP has n’t shared enough information to evaluate the situation .
But a handful of clues suggest that the company is concerned .
On Friday , BP spokesperson Toby Odone acknowledged that the 45 - ton stack of the blowout preventer was tilting noticeably , but said the company could not attribute it to down - hole leaks .
“ We do n’t know anything about the underground portion of the well , ” he said .
But , the stack “ is tilting and has been tilting since the rig went down .
We believe that it was caused by the collapse of the riser . ”
The company is monitoring the degree of leaning but has not announced any plans to run additional supports to the structure .
As many have speculated ... concerns over structural integrity are what led BP to halt “ top kill ” efforts late last month .
When it was digging this particular well , the company ran out of casing –the pipe that engineers send down the hole–and switched to a less durable material called liner .
This may have created several weak spots along the well that would be particularly vulnerable to excessive pressure or erosion .
So instead of sealing the well , the company has been focused on trying to capture the oil as it flows out the top .
At this point , some experts say , additional leaks would n’t matter much .
“ It ’s very possible that there are subfloor leaks , ” says [ Roger Anderson - an oil geophysicist at Columbia University ] .
“ But that does n’t change the strategy moving forward . ”
The linchpin of that strategy involves drilling relief wells that would absorb all possible leaks , both at the top and the bottom of the hulking , teetering structure .
Relief wells are drilled straight down into the sea bottom .
After running parallel to the existing well for a few thousand meters , they cut in and intersect the original well bore .
BP is drilling two such wells , one on either side of the main well .
Once they are complete , the company will use them to pump heavy fluid and cement into the main well , stopping the oil at its source .
The approach usually has a 95 percent success rate .
But to work , the well must be sealed as far down as possible –if it ’s sealed too high , oil could still escape through any leaks beneath the seal .
In this case , relief wells will have to drill down to 5,500 meters , and that takes time , at least until August .
The real question now is whether the entire structure can hold out long enough .
One of the dangers which the relief wells are racing against is that the blowout preventer ( BOP ) is leaning ... and might fall over .
The well casing itself is attached to the BOP .
And - as discussed below - the BOP is very heavy .
So if the BOP fell over , it would likely severely damage the structural integrity of the casing .
As Think Progress points out :
In a press teleconference Monday , National Incident Commander Thad Allen announced that the riser package is tilting “ 10 or 12 degrees off perpendicular , ” twice the 5.5 degree tilt of the Leaning Tower of Pisa :
The entire arrangement is kind of listed a little bit .
I think it ’s 10 or 12 degrees off perpendicular so it ’s not quite straight up .
As the Times - Picayune notes :
The integrity of the well has become a major topic of discussion among engineers and geologists .
" Everybody 's worried about all of this .
That 's all people are talking about , " said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of geoscience programs at University of Houston .
He said the things that BP has being doing to try to stop the oil or gain control of it have been tantamount to repeatedly hitting the well with a hammer and sending shock waves down the pipe .
" I do n't think people realize how delicate it is . "
" There is a very high level of concern for the integrity of the well , " said Bob Bea , the University of California Berkeley engineering professor known to New Orleanians for investigating the levee failures after Katrina , who now has organized the Deepwater Horizon Study Group .
Bea and other engineers say that BP has n't released enough information publicly for people outside the company to evaluate the situation .
***
When wells are drilled , engineers send links of telescoping pipe down the hole , and those links are encased in cement .
The telescoping pipe , called casing , unfolds like a radio antenna , only upside down , so the width of pipe gets smaller as the well gets deeper .
The cement and layers of casing are normally quite strong , Van Nieuwenhuise said .
But with the BP well , there are several weak spots that the highly pressurized oil could exploit .
BP ran out of casing sections before it hit the reservoir of oil , so it switched to using something called liner for the remainder of the well , which is n't as strong .
The joints between two sections of liner pipe and the joint where the liner pipe meets the casing could be weak , Van Nieuwenhuise said .
Bill Gale , an engineer specializing in fires and explosions on oil rigs who is part of Bea 's Deepwater Horizon Study Group , said the 16 - inch wide casing contains disks that are designed to relieve pressure if necessary .
If any of those disks popped , it could create undesirable new avenues for the oil to flow .
Bea said there are also concerns about the casing at the seabed right under the blowout preventer .
Van Nieuwenhuise said he 's never actually heard of oil from a blown out well rupturing the casing and bubbling up through the ocean floor .
He would consider that an unlikely , worst - case scenario .
A more likely problem , he said , is that oil could find its way into open spaces in the casing string , known as the annulus , and travel up the well in areas where it is n't supposed to be .
This scenario could be one reason why more oil than expected is flowing at the containment cap that BP installed earlier this month to collect the oil .
Bea is more concerned about the worst - case scenario than Van Nieuwnhuise .
In an answer to a question , Bea said , " Yes , " there is reason to think that hydrocarbons are leaking from places in the well other than the containment cap .
" The likelihood of failure is extremely high , " Bea said .
" We could have multiple losses of containment , and that 's going to provide much more difficult time of trying to capture this ( oil ) . "
Meanwhile , observers monitoring the video feeds from the robotic vehicles working on the sea floor have noticed BP measuring a tilt in the 40 - ton blowout preventer stack with a level and a device called an inclinometer .
***
Bea said BP is n't sharing enough information for others to know .
If there is oil and gas escaping from the sides of the well , it could erode the sediments around the well and eat away at the support for all the heavy equipment that sits above .
Bea said reports that BP is using an inclinometer is significant news .
" It tells me that they are also concerned , " he said .
Here are videos of BP measuring the tilt of the BOP .
While the BOP weighs 40 tons , the riser package as a whole weighs over 450 tons .
If the BOP and riser package fell over , it would inflict severe damage to the attached well casing .
The Houston Chronicle reports :
Money - saving measures BP took while designing the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico appear to have dogged efforts to bring the massive oil spill under control .
Documents released by congressional investigators show that modifications to the well design BP made last year included a reduction in the thickness of a section of the casing — steel piping in the wellbore
The modification included a slight reduction in the specified thickness for the wall of a 16 - inch - diameter section of pipe toward the bottom of the well , according to a May 14 , 2009 , document .
***
The condition of the well also limits how much oil and gas can flow into containment systems now being used successfully to capture some of the flow .
Even if a vessel could capture all the hydrocarbons gushing from the well , some would have to be released to keep well pressure under control .
Marvin Odum , president of Houston - based Shell Oil , the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell , told the Houston Chronicle last week that the integrity of the well casing is a major concern .
Odum and others from the industry regularly sit in on high - level meetings with BP and government officials about the spill .
If the well casing burst it could send oil and gas streaming through the strata to appear elsewhere on the sea floor , or create a crater underneath the wellhead - a device placed at the top of the well where the casing meets the seafloor - that would destabilize it and the blowout preventer .
The steel casing used in oil wells is strong , said Gene Beck , petroleum engineering professor at Texas A&M , but pressures deep in a well are powerful enough to split strong steel pipe or " crush it like a beer can . "
The strength and thickness of casing walls are key decisions in well design , he said .
If the BP well 's casing was n't strong enough , it may already be split or could split during a containment effort .
BP spokesman Toby Odone said the decision to reduce the pipe thickness was made after careful review .
The company said it does n't know the condition of the well casing and has no way of inspecting it .
BP is drilling two relief wells to intercept the Macondo well near the reservoir and plug it with cement .
A rupture in the Macondo well casing probably would n't affect that effort , said Donald Van Nieuwenhuise , director of geoscience programs at the University of Houston .
" When they start the bottom kill the cement will try to follow oil wherever it 's escaping , so it would actually hide a lot of sins in the well bore , " Van Nieuwenhuise said .
So far there are no signs that the section of the pipe below the sea floor is leaking .
The blowout preventer has been listing slightly since the accident , but officials believe that may have happened when the Deepwater Horizon sank while still attached to the well via a pipe called a riser .
***
But the longer the well flows uncontrolled the more likely it is that the well casing could be damaged or the blowout preventer damaged further .
Sand and other debris that flows through the pipes at high velocity can wear through metal over time , said Van Nieuwenhuise .
The chances of the well eroding from underneath and the blowout preventer tipping may seem unlikely .
" But everything about this well has been unlikely , " said David Pursell , an analyst with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co
Indeed , oil industry expert Rob Cavner says that he would n't be surprised if the BOP ended up falling over entirely :

John Stossel – Is free trade good ?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iN74HmXrvE#t=4m30s
In this segment of John Stossel ’s on free trade , Stossel and Tom Palmer discus the connection between free trade and war .
Palmer points out countries that trade with one another are much less likely to go to war with one another .
The correlation between trading countries and warfare can not be stressed enough .
As long as there is positive activity between countries the chances of war are diminished .
Even countries with opposing political systems are less likely to go to war when trade is involved .
We all of know couples that ca n’t get along and constantly bicker , but manage to stay together because they are still having sex .
Trade has the same impact as sex in how countries interact .
Trade pushes countries with bad relationships to at least try to get along .
The reverse of the trade and sex analogy should pointed out as well .
Just as sex withheld in a relationship is likely to escalate into a fight , withholding trade ( tariffs , embargoes , restrictions ) is likely to escalate tensions between countries .
When countries are threatening to go to war , we look at the underlying problem–how long has it been since they had some good trading ?

Adrián Lamo responds : http://cryptome.org/0001/lamo-denies.htm
28 June 2010 Stephanie interview : http://cryptome.org/0001/wikileaks-views.htm
PGPboard references : http://cryptome.org/0001/wikileaks-fish.htm
A sends 28 June 2010 : Thanks for publishing your interview with Stephanie .
Granted it is a bit harsh -- but what you said is about journalism is entirely true , and I 'm glad you said it .
I decided to write in because I wanted to share my thoughts on the Wikileaks case .
First , through contacts I do not want to go into , I have crossed paths with Adrian Lamo and Kevin Poulsen .
They have reputations in the hacker community as being untrustworthy .
Lamo in particular .
Lamo's name is synonymous with both ' idiot ' and ' narc ' .
When Lamo was arrested previously , he called up any hackers he had contact with , and asked them for information about their activities for a ' book he was writing ' .
I know this from primary sources .
Obviously what had happened is that Lamo had offerred to cooperate with the feds in exchange for his assistance in giving the Feds information on other more competant hackers .
No book was ever published .
Lamo has a long history of working with feds and spooks , and has an insatiable desire for getting his name in the press .
He was in a mental hospital shortly before his latest ' news break ' in the Manning case -- an act of pure coincidence if we are to believe the official story .
I would n't be surprised if the Feds recruited Lamo for whatever is going on with this Wikileaks operation , considering he is easily manipulated and has a deep psychological need for attention , unburdened by the constraints of ordinary human morality .
So I 'm saying , I agree -- this whole thing is fishy .
I immediately became suspect of all my previous assumptions regarding Wikileaks once I realized that Lamo was directly connected to the Bradley Manning arrest .
Why would any whistleblower in their right mind contact Adrian Lamo ?
His name is a joke among hackers .
Just saying it in the presence of some hackers might induce laughter .
So like I said , this looks more and more like a covert operation .
It simply does not make sense for Manning to contact Adrian Lamo .
I keep thinking about the ' leaked ' report on destroying Wikileaks from Army Counterintelligence .
I want to propose two theories regarding Wikileaks after thinking about this at length : Theory # 1 -- ' Legitimate but Untrustworthy '
1 ) Wikileaks is indeed a legitimate outlet , poorly run by an spendthrift and egotistical hacker ( Assange ) .
If this is the case , then whoever is feeding you ' internal ' information via PGPboard is a probably a spook intending to seed doubt , foster division , and ultimately destroy the organizations fundraising ability .
It is less likely , but possible , that your ' mole ' on PGPboard is legitimate .
Very difficult to tell .
If the ' mole ' is legitimate , then Wikileaks must become transparent in order to survive .
Either way , in this ' Legitimate but Untrustworthy ' theory , the spooks are following the game plan from the Army Counterintelligence report , and are trying to destroy Wikileaks -- perhaps from the inside .
Exactly ' how ' Manning , Lamo , and Poulsen relate to the spooks is a question which I have not yet resolved .
Theory # 2 -- ' Controlled Opposition ' Wikileaks is run as ' controlled opposition ' , with or without Assange 's knowledge .
Perhaps he is an unwilling dupe .
Either way , if this theory is correct , the Army Counterintelligence report does not make sense -- unless Wikileaks is a ' deep black ' type program run by , or somehow indirectly controlled by , intelligence assets .
If this theory is actually the case , here are some potential purposes for running Wikileaks as ' controlled opposition ' : A ) Act as a ' honeypot ' to catch real leakers and sympathisers ( those who leak documents and donate money ) .
B ) Gain as much media credibility and exposure as possible , so that everyone knows what ' Wikileaks ' is .
C )
At some point , implode the organization in high - profile manner -- in order to send ' chilling effects ' throughout society -- amplified worldwide by the transmission channels of the mass media .
If # 2 is correct then the guy feeding you information via PGPboard is again , a spook , with the purpose of enabling covert actors ( read : his bosses ) to better control the implosion of the organization , as well as the manipulation of the public .

Officer reveals details
of Barka 's murder
By Lara Marlowe
PARIS LETTER :
Ahmed Boukhari remembers every detail of the acid tank they used to dissolve
Ben Barka 's body .
It was Boukhari , then a young officer in the Moroccan intelligence service ,
who ordered the tank from the company that made boilers for Moroccan
railways .
A Col Martin of the CIA highly recommended the system to his
trainees in the north African kingdom , saying it had worked well for the
Iranian SAVAK .
Made of stainless steel , 1.5 metres high and 2.5 metres wide , slightly curved
on the top and bottom , the tank was installed at the Dar - el - Mokri torture
centre in Casa Blanca .
It took two men wearing protective masks , suits and
gloves to fill it .
The acid was so strong it destroyed everything , " even big bones like the
femur " , Boukhari recalled in a landmark interview with Le Monde and the
Moroccan weekly , Le Journal , this summer .
Between 1961 and 1967 , Boukhari added , dozens of opponents to King Hassan II
disappeared inside the shiny receptacle .
" Pity we can't soak you in acid , " Mr
Abraham Serfaty , who survived King Hassan 's prisons ( see The Irish Times ,
February 21st , 2001 ) remembers his own torturer saying .
Boukhari 's testimony resolved two great mysteries surrounding the
disappearance in October 1965 , of the opposition leader Mehdi Ben Barka .
Who
killed the charismatic maths professor and Third World militant ?
And what happened to his body ?
Boukhari was the duty officer at the " cab 1 "
headquarters of the Moroccan intelligence service on the weekend when Ben
Barka was " arrested " outside the Brasserie Lipp in Saint - Germain - des - Pr�s by
two French policemen working for King Hassan .
" Mission accomplished .
The package is ready for shipment .
Send the aircraft , "
was the message dictated from France by Mohamed Achaachi , the head of the
Moroccan " counter - subversion " department , to his superiors .
Boukhari conveyed
the words to Gen Mohamed Oufkir and his deputy , Commandant Ahmed Dlimi .
Gen Oufkir was the King 's right - hand man , minister of the interior , head of
national security and the intelligence services .
Both Gene Oufkir and
Commandant Dlimi flew to Paris , where they joined in the interrogation of Ben
Barka , who was handcuffed and hung from the ceiling in a suburban villa .
Moroccan agents who witnessed the scene later told Boukhari how Oufkir cut
little pieces of flesh from Ben Barka 's chest with a dagger .
King Hassan had kept 30 agents working full time for seven months , tracking
Ben Barka from Cairo to Algiers to Geneva , listening to his phone calls ,
opening his mail .
Oufkir intended to drug the opposition leader and spirit
him back to Morocco on a military aircraft - not kill him .
Back in Rabat , the CIA colonel realised the operation had gone wrong and
nervously hung around Boukhari 's office .
At Orly airport , the liaison officer
between Air France and the French and Moroccan intelligence services , Antoine
Lopez , arranged for a Moroccan diplomatic car to transfer Ben Barka 's body to
a Moroccan military aircraft .
A French diplomat booked Gen Oufkir and Commandant Dlimi back to Morocco on a
commercial flight .
Boukhari saw a police commissioner rush off carrying an array of cameras .
The
body , still dressed in the suit Ben Barka wore when he was kidnapped , was
photographed on a stretcher in the courtyard of the torture centre .
For the pictures they kept in their files , Moroccan agents put Ben Barka's
hat and sunglasses back on his head .
The only copy of the film taken as the
body was lowered into the acid tank was given to King Hassan for his private
viewing .
Gen Oufkir was killed in an attempted coup against King Hassan seven years
later , and his wife and children were then imprisoned for 18 years .
Three
French thugs who participated in Ben Barka 's kidnapping fled to Morocco ,
where they were later murdered on Commandant Dlimi 's orders .
King Hassan died
in July 1999 , and was succeeded by his son , Mohamed VI .
For 36 years , the Ben Barka affair has symbolised the complicity of Western
intelligence services in propping up dictators .
Morocco changed , and one of Ben Barka 's comrades , Mr Abderrahmane Youssoufi ,
is now the country 's prime minister .
But socialist party activists still say
that " Ben Barka 's corpse lies between the left and the monarchy " .
King Mohamed VI has allowed Ben Barka 's family to visit Morocco ( see The
Irish Times October 27th , 1999 ) and a French investigating magistrate
travelled there in June .
Then Ahmed Boukhari 's sordid account of the murder
was published .
Prime Minister Youssoufi said this week that there could be no
statute of limitations for Ben Barka 's murder , " For it was a political crime
in which several states were implicated " .
At least three of the intelligence agents whom Boukhari says witnessed Ben
Barka 's death are now comfortably retired .
There are calls for them to be
questioned , but Mohamed VI has shown little inclination to delve into the
dark side of his father 's reign .

That 's easy enough -- the real key is to limit photos and videos you 're tagged in to the People I Trust list -- but we 're not done yet .
Go back up and hit " Edit album privacy " under Birthday to make sure only the right people are seeing the snapshots of your past .
This one 's totally on you -- you have to decide which of your albums you 're going to share with what list -- but every photo album you 've made should be assigned to a list , not just freely available to everyone or friends of friends .
Trust us on this one -- it 's easy enough to add someone to a list or to an album if they need access for some reason .
Okay , so now you 've assigned all your content to lists .
Now it 's time to organize your friends .
This is the fun part -- hit Edit Friends under the account menu again , click " Friends " under Lists on the left side , and you 'll get a long list of all your friends .
All you 've got to do is drill through , delete all the people you do n't know or do n't remember by hitting the X on the far right side , and assign everyone else to a list by clicking on the drop down and picking the appropriate category : People I Trust , People I do n't know very well , or Limited Profile .
You 'll be surprised at how easy it is to filter your social network into these categories -- they mirror your actual relationships with people , after all .
Just remember : everyone should be on a list !
This system does n't work at all if you do n't put everyone on a list -- after this big initial sorting , just add people to lists as you add friends -- it 's super easy to do .
So that 's my system -- this explanation might seem lengthy , but it really comes down to three steps :
Make three lists : People I Trust , People I do n't know well , and Limited Profile Tweak your privacy settings to use the lists
Sort your friends into the lists
P.S. Oh , while we 're at it , make sure you hit up
That 's easy enough -- and remember , you can always move people between lists , just like friends move between roles in your actual life .
Yes , it 's a little uncomfortable to think about relationships like this , but it 'll be even worse if your boss finds that FurryCon ' 07 album one day -- and once you 've got things set up the first time , it only takes a little maintenance to keep up .
Facebook does n't have to be terrifying , people -- get out there and make some lists .
P.S. Oh , while we 're at it , make sure you hit up Engadget 's official Facebook page -- you can also find me and Josh Topolsky if you like .
Step one is the easiest step -- you just need to make the lists .
Do n't worry about putting people in them yet , we 'll do that in a later step .
To make a list , first hit the Account menu in the upper right , and select " Edit Friends " as shown above .
That 'll take you to a large list of your friends , and at the top you 'll see " Create New List , " like so :
That 's it -- those are the only three lists you really need to make .
You can also make one forand possibly one for -- I have an Engadget list -- but any more than that just needlessly complicates things , and you want to keep this as simple as possible .
You ca n’t read models , but you do talk to entrepreneurs in Racine and Yakima .
Higher deficits will make them more insecure and more risk - averse , not less .
They ’re afraid of a fiscal crisis .
They ’re afraid of future tax increases .
They do n’t believe government - stimulated growth is real and lasting .
Maybe they are wrong to feel this way , but they do .
And they are the ones who invest and hire , not the theorists .
The Demand Siders are brilliant , but they write as if changing fiscal policy were as easy as adjusting the knob on your stove .
In fact , it ’s very hard to get money out the door and impossible to do it quickly .
It ’s hard to find worthwhile programs to pour money into .
Once programs exist , it ’s nearly impossible to kill them .
Spending now creates debt forever and ever .
Moreover , public spending seems to have odd knock - off effects .
Professors Lauren Cohen , Joshua Coval and Christopher Malloy of Harvard surveyed 42 years of government spending increases in certain Congressional districts .
They found that federal spending increases dampened corporate hiring and investment in those districts .
You wish somebody could explain that one to you before you pass on more debt burdens to your grandchildren .
So you have your doubts , but you are practical .
You want to do something .
Too much debt could lead to national catastrophe .
Too much austerity could lead to stagnation .
Well , there ’s a few short - term things you can do .
First , extend unemployment insurance ; that ’s a foolish place to begin budget - balancing .
Second , you need to mitigate the pain caused by the state governments that are slashing spending .
You need a program modeled on Race to the Top .
You will provide federal money now to states that pass responsible long - term budget plans that will reduce spending and pension commitments .
That would save public - sector jobs and ease contractionary pressures without throwing the country into a fiscal - debt spiral .
But the overall message is : Do n’t be arrogant .
This year , do n’t engage in reckless new borrowing or reckless new cutting .
Focus on the fundamentals .
Cut programs that do n’t enhance productivity .
Spend more on those that do .
You do n’t have the ability to play the economy like a fiddle .
You do have the ability to lay some foundations for long - term growth and stability .

The spot was first seen by an amateur Australian astronomer Anthony Wesley
An object that hit Jupiter last year with a force equivalent to a few thousand nuclear bombs , which left it with a scar the size of the Pacific Ocean was probably an asteroid , say astronomers .
Images of the " bruise " captured by the Hubble telescope show the aftermath of an asteroid striking a planet .
It could provide clues about what might happen if a similar object hit Earth .
The spot was first seen in 2009 by an Australian amateur astronomer .
The astronomer in question , Anthony Wesley , has recently taken another striking image of a bright fireball hitting the gas giant .
Scientists believe it to be a meteoroid - a small particle of space debris .
A team of scientists described in the Astrophysical Journal Letters how they compared the 2009 Hubble images with those of scars left on Jupiter by a comet in 1994 .
Jupiter impacts were thought to be quite rare .
After the latest collision with a comet called P / Shoemaker - Levy 9 , or SL9 , astronomers did n't expect any other strikes for at least several hundred years .
' A surprise '
That is why some 500 m - wide space rock plunging into the gas giant 's atmosphere was rather unexpected , said astronomer Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colorado , who led the study .
" This solitary event caught us by surprise , " she said .
" We can only see the aftermath of the impact , but fortunately we do have the 1994 Hubble observations that captured the full range of impact phenomena , including the nature of the objects from pre-impact observations . "
Dr Hammel 's team used the Hubble telescope 's Wide Field Camera 3 to zoom in on the blemish near the Jupiter 's southern pole and captured several sharp ultraviolet images .
Image caption Astronomers spotted a flash on Jupiter - possibly a meteoroid striking the planet
The scientists compared the pictures with those of the scars left by SL9 15 years earlier and saw important differences between the two impacts .
Most importantly , they found no " halo " around the latest collision site .
A comet would have generated a halo of fine dust as it impacted the surface .
The clues helped them to conclude that the mystery object was probably not a dusty comet but a solid space rock that perhaps came from a nearby asteroid belt .
Agustin Sanchez - Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao , Spain called Jupiter a " natural laboratory " to see what might happen to our planet in the event of a similar collision .
" It would be a catastrophe , " he said .
" The Jupiter impact produced a pattern of debris some 5,000 km long and 2,800 km wide - half the size of the Earth .
And even if the response of the Earth atmosphere is different from that of Jupiter , entire continents could be destroyed . "
Amateur astronomers
The scientist also commented on the latest flash spotted on Jupiter by Anthony Wesley and another amateur , Christopher Go from the Philippines .
It is believed to be the very first image of a meteoroid hitting a planet .
This also shows that amateur astronomers now have the necessary high quality technology to capture such events that only last a few seconds .
" We cannot devote the Hubble space telescope or other telescopes to observe Jupiter regularly , it is impossible , " he said .
" And the amateurs make a very good survey of what is happening there , contributing to our database . "
The other day , we spent the afternoon at the Museum of Natural History in New York City .
We went to look at the dinosaurs , which was fascinating .
I was even more interested in the skeletons of early humans and the exhibits of indigenous peoples .
I only had my iPhone camera with me , but I thought I 'd share some of the things that captured my attention .
First of all , the skulls .
I always love looking at caveman skulls .
I mean , just look at their teeth .
That perfect “ U ” shape that Dr. Weston Price described in his writings .
Unlike the narrowed “ V ” shaped palate most modern people today have .
The wider palate allowed for plenty of room for all the teeth , including the wisdom teeth , with no crowding .
I also enjoyed looking at the exhibits of indigenous peoples .
It 's amazing how straight and beautiful their teeth were .
Look at these photos of Indians from the Amazon :
Their teeth are naturally straight .
They did n't have dentists or orthodontists .
They did n't wear braces .
Does n't this make you wonder why we modern people have such crooked teeth ?
I looked at many other exhibits of indigenous peoples — from the native Americans to the Polynesians .
The exhibits had all kinds of household items , from spoons to cups to pipes and combs .
Not once did I see a toothbrush .
Not once did I see any kind of dental equipment like headgear or braces or palate adjusters .
Does n't this make people question ?
Do n't archeologists looking at these “ primitive ” people wonder why their teeth are so straight ?
I guess maybe archeologists are n't dentists , so they 're not thinking about people 's teeth .
It made Dr. Weston Price question .
Dr. Price was a dentist in the early 20th century in Cleveland , Ohio .
As he saw more and more kids coming in with crooked teeth and cavities , he wondered why it was happening .
Which is what set him on his quest to study indigenous peoples .
Dr. Price came to the conclusion that crooked teeth and cavities are caused by nutritional deficiencies , particularly deficiencies of the fat soluble vitamins A , D , E & K .
The groups he studied ate very different diets , but they all ate large quantities of these fat soluble vitamins .
Ten times the amount eaten by people in the 1920s and '30s .
And people in the ' 20s and '30s ate a lot more butter , lard , eggs , and whole milk than we do today .
If you have n't yet , check out Dr. Price 's book : Nutrition and Physical Degeneration .
You can read the whole thing online .
Just looking at the photos will blow your mind .
It 's amazing to see portraits of all these different cultures , all with perfectly beautiful straight teeth .
And then to compare those photos to the ones of people who abandoned their traditional diets for “ industrial ” food .
The good news is , according to a wealth of data out there ( including Dr. Price 's book ) , crooked teeth are not irreversible .
Nor are they caused by bottle feeding or pacifiers .
Sally Fallon Morell , Founder and President of the Weston A. Price Foundation , reported in the organization 's current quarterly journal ( Fall , 2009 ) that an in informal survey of Weston A. Price Foundation members with adopted babies who were raised on bottles of homemade formula made from raw milk ( see the recipe here ) , 6 out of 7 of those kids ended up with naturally straight teeth .
Is n't that incredible ?
Especially when you consider this :
Some 4.5 million children and adults are undergoing orthodontic treatment in the United States today , a number that has quadrupled since the 1960's , according to the American Association of Orthodontists .
Source
And this :
The AAO estimates that 75 percent of Americans suffer from malocclusion ( literally “ bad bite ” ) and could benefit from orthodontic treatment .
Source
75 % of Americans need orthodontic treatment , and yet 6 out of 7 WAPF moms raised adopted babies on raw milk formula with naturally straight teeth .
What does that tell you ?
Tells me something 's going on here .
Something very exciting .
I wish more people out there knew about this .
Think of the money people would save on braces !
Which is why I can't stop thinking about it and am compelled to keep writing about it .
If you 're new to this information , and you find it interesting , check out Dr. Price 's book and visit the Weston A. Price Foundation website to learn more .
If you 're not new to this information , share this post with someone who is .
You never know how powerfully you will impact someone else 's life by reaching out .
I know how much healthier my daughter will be , and how much healthier her children will be , and you can't put a price on that .
I 'm eternally grateful to my Uncle Roy for sending me the link to the Weston A. Price Foundation when my daughter was 4 months old .
And I 'm equally grateful to Dr. Weston Price , Sally Fallon Morell , and everyone who works to get this information out there .

Koral Wira , 14 , was fishing with her parents and a friend near Venice , Fla. , when a barracuda went for her dad 's bait and ended up biting her instead .
Her dad , Rob Parker , submitted these photos and Wira told the story .
After anchoring the boat 4 miles off shore , Parker baited his rod with herring .
Wira switched seats to get out of the hot sun , and watched as her dad cast .
Moments later , she heard a splash and saw a long silver flash in the air .
A barracuda jumped from the water and opened its mouth .
As it hit her left arm , it clamped down with razor teeth .
Force perpendicular to flow of surrounding fluid
The 1902 Wright Glider shows its lift by pulling up
A fluid flowing around the surface of an object exerts a force on it .
Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction .
[ 1 ]
It contrasts with the drag force , which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction .
Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity , but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow .
If the surrounding fluid is air , the force is called an aerodynamic force .
In water or any other liquid , it is called a hydrodynamic force .
Dynamic lift is distinguished from other kinds of lift in fluids .
Aerostatic lift or buoyancy , in which an internal fluid is lighter than the surrounding fluid , does not require movement and is used by balloons , blimps , dirigibles , boats , and submarines .
Planing lift , in which only the lower portion of the body is immersed in a liquid flow , is used by motorboats , surfboards , and water - skis .
Overview [ edit ]
Lift is defined as the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flow direction , and drag is the component that is parallel to the flow direction .
A fluid flowing around the surface of an object applies a force against it .
It makes no difference whether the fluid is flowing past a stationary body or the body is moving through a stationary volume of fluid .
Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction .
[ 1 ]
Lift is always accompanied by a drag force , which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction .
Lift is mostly associated with the wings of fixed - wing aircraft , although it is more widely generated by many other streamlined bodies such as propellers , kites , helicopter rotors , racing car wings , maritime sails , and wind turbines in air , and by sailboat keels , ship 's rudders , and hydrofoils in water .
Lift is also exploited by flying and gliding animals , especially by birds , bats , and insects , and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees . [ 2 ]
While the common meaning of the word " lift " assumes that lift opposes weight , lift can be in any direction with respect to gravity , since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity .
When an aircraft is cruising in straight and level flight , most of the lift opposes gravity . [ 3 ]
However , when an aircraft is climbing , descending , or banking in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical .
[ 4 ]
Lift may also act as downforce in some aerobatic manoeuvres , or on the wing on a racing car .
Lift may also be largely horizontal , for instance on a sailing ship .
The lift discussed in this article is mainly in relation to airfoils , although marine hydrofoils and propellers share the same physical principles and work in the same way , despite differences between air and water such as density , compressibility , and viscosity .
Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil [ edit ]
A cross-section of a wing defines an airfoil shape .
An airfoil is a streamlined shape that is capable of generating significantly more lift than drag . [ 5 ]
A flat plate can generate lift , but not as much as a streamlined airfoil , and with somewhat higher drag .
There are several ways to explain how an airfoil generates lift .
Some are more complicated or more physically rigorous than others ; some have been shown to be incorrect . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]
For example , there are explanations based directly on Newton 's laws of motion and explanations based on Bernoulli 's principle .
Either can be used to explain lift . [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
Flow deflection and Newton 's laws [ edit ]
When an airfoil deflects air downwards , Newton 's third law requires that the air must exert an equal upward reaction on the airfoil .
An airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past .
According to Newton 's third law , the air must exert an equal and opposite ( upward ) force on the airfoil , which is lift . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
The airflow changes direction as it passes the airfoil and follows a path that is curved downward .
According to Newton 's second law , this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil .
Then Newton 's third law requires the air to exert an upward force on the airfoil ; thus a reaction force , lift , is generated opposite to the directional change .
In the case of an airplane wing , the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing .
[ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ]
The downward turning of the flow is not produced solely by the lower surface of the airfoil , and the air flow above the airfoil accounts for much of the downward - turning action .
Increased flow speed and Bernoulli 's principle [ edit ]
Bernoulli's principle states that there is a relationship between the pressure at a point in a fluid and the speed of the fluid at that point , so if one knows the speed at two points within the fluid and the pressure at one point , one can calculate the pressure at the second point , and vice versa . [ 23 ]
For any airfoil generating lift , there must be a pressure imbalance , i.e. lower average air pressure on one side than on the other .
Bernoulli 's principle states that a speed rise must accompany any lower pressure , and a speed decrease must accompany any higher pressure .
Conservation of mass [ edit ]
Streamlines and streamtubes around an airfoil generating lift .
Note the narrower streamtubes above and the wider streamtubes below .
Starting with the flow pattern observed in both theory and experiments , the increased flow speed over the upper surface can be explained in terms of streamtube pinching and conservation of mass . [ 24 ]
For incompressible flow , the rate of volume flow ( e.g. volume units per minute ) must be constant within each streamtube since matter is not created or destroyed .
If a streamtube becomes narrower , the flow speed must increase in the narrower region to maintain the constant flow rate , to satisfy the principle of conservation of mass . [ 25 ]
The upper streamtubes constrict as they flow up and around the airfoil .
Conservation of mass says that the flow speed must increase as the stream tube area decreases . [ 26 ]
Similarly , the lower streamtubes expand and their flowrate slows .
From Bernoulli's principle , the pressure on the upper surface where the flow is moving faster is lower than the pressure on the lower surface where it is moving slower .
This pressure difference creates a net aerodynamic force , pointing upward .
Limitations of the simplified explanations [ edit ]
As explained below under a more comprehensive physical explanation , producing a lift force requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions , and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli 's principle .
The simplified explanations given above are therefore incomplete because they define lift in terms of only one or the other .
And depending on the details , they have other shortcomings as well .
The explanation based on flow deflection and Newton 's laws is correct but is incomplete .
It does not explain how the airfoil can impart downward turning to a much deeper swath of the flow than it actually touches .
Further , it does n't explain how the pressure differences in the horizontal direction are sustained .
That is , it leaves out the Bernoulli part of the interaction . [ 27 ]
Explanations based on increased flow speed and Bernoulli 's principle first try to establish that there is higher flow speed over the upper surface , but they fail to explain correctly what causes the flow to speed up :
The conservation of mass explanation that relies on narrowing of the streamtubes over the upper surface does not explain why the streamtubes change size .
To see why the air flows the way it does requires more sophisticated analysis . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ]
Sometimes a geometrical argument is offered to demonstrate why the streamtubes change size : it is asserted that the top " obstructs " or " constricts " the air more than the bottom , hence narrower streamtubes .
For conventional wings that are flat on the bottom and curved on top this makes some intuitive sense .
But it does not explain how flat plates , symmetric airfoils , sailboat sails , or conventional airfoils flying upside down can generate lift , and attempts to calculate lift based on the amount of constriction do not predict experimental results . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ]
A common version that relies on equal - transit - time is simply wrong , as explained below under false explanation based on equal transit - time .
Bernoulli - only explanations imply that a speed difference arises from causes other than a pressure difference , and that the speed difference then leads to a pressure difference by Bernoulli 's principle .
This implied one - way causation is a misconception .
The real cause - and - effect relationship between pressure and velocity is reciprocal .
Finally , Bernoulli - only explanations do n't explain how the pressure differences in the vertical direction are sustained .
That is , they leave out the downward - turning part of the interaction . [ 27 ]
Alternative explanations , misconceptions , and controversies [ edit ]
Many alternative explanations for the generation of lift by an airfoil have been put forward , most intended to explain the phenomenon of lift to a general audience .
Although the explanations may share features in common with the explanations above , additional assumptions and simplifications may be introduced .
Some explanations introduce assumptions which proved to be wrong , such as equal transit - time , and some used controversial terminology , such as " Coandă effect " .
False explanation based on equal transit - time [ edit ]
An illustration of the incorrect equal transit - time explanation of airfoil lift .
Basic or popular sources often describe the " equal transit - time " theory of lift , which incorrectly assumes that the parcels of air that divide at the leading edge of an airfoil must rejoin at the trailing edge , forcing the air traveling along the longer upper surface to go faster .
Bernoulli 's principle is then cited to conclude that since the air moves slower along the bottom of the wing , the air pressure must be higher , pushing the wing up . [ 35 ]
However , there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
In fact , the air moving over the top of an airfoil generating lift moves much faster than the equal transit theory predicts . [ 42 ]
Further , the theory violates Newton 's third law of motion , since it describes a force on the wing with no opposite force . [ 43 ]
The assertion that the air must arrive simultaneously at the trailing edge is sometimes referred to as the " equal transit - time fallacy " . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]
Controversy regarding the Coandă effect [ edit ]
In its original sense , the Coandă effect refers to the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow , and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow .
The effect is named for Henri Coandă , the Romanian aerodynamicist who exploited it in many of his patents .
More broadly , some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface , not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet .
It is in this broader sense that the Coandă effect is used by some to explain why airflow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil . [ 49 ] Jef Raskin , [ 50 ] for example , describes a simple demonstration , using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing .
The wing deflects upwards , thus demonstrating that the Coandă effect creates lift .
This demonstration correctly demonstrates the Coandă effect as a fluid jet ( the exhaust from a straw ) adhering to a curved surface ( the wing ) .
However , the upper surface in this flow is a complicated , vortex - laden mixing layer , while on the lower surface the flow is quiescent .
The physics of this demonstration are very different from that of the general flow over the wing .
[ 51 ]
The usage in this sense is encountered in some popular references on aerodynamics . [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
This is a controversial use of the term " Coandă effect . "
The more established view in the aerodynamics field is that the Coandă effect is defined in the more limited sense above , [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] and the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary - layer separation ; thus it is not an example of the Coandă effect . [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] [ 57 ]
Basic attributes of lift [ edit ]
Lift is a result of pressure differences and depends on angle of attack , airfoil shape , air density , and airspeed .
Pressure differences [ edit ]
Pressure is the normal force per unit area exerted by the air on itself and on surfaces that it touches .
The lift force is transmitted through the pressure , which acts perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil .
Thus , the net force manifests itself as pressure differences .
The direction of the net force implies that the average pressure on the upper surface of the airfoil is lower than the average pressure on the underside . [ 58 ]
These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow .
When a fluid follows a curved path , there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside . [ 59 ]
This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences , sometimes called the streamline curvature theorem , was derived from Newton 's second law by Leonhard Euler in 1754 :
d ⁡ p d ⁡ R = ρ v 2 R {\displaystyle {\frac {\operatorname {d} p}{\operatorname {d} R}}=\rho {\frac {v^{ 2}} {
R}}}
The left side of this equation represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow .
On the right hand side ρ is the density , v is the velocity , and R is the radius of curvature .
This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow ( R → ∞ ) the pressure difference is zero . [ 60 ]
Angle of attack [ edit ]
Angle of attack of an airfoil
The angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the oncoming airflow .
A symmetrical airfoil will generate zero lift at zero angle of attack .
But as the angle of attack increases , the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases , resulting in more lift .
For small angles a symmetrical airfoil will generate a lift force roughly proportional to the angle of attack . [ 61 ] [ 62 ]
As the angle of attack increases , the lift reaches a maximum at some angle ; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper - surface flow to separate from the wing ; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift .
The airfoil is said to be stalled . [ 63 ]
Airfoil shape [ edit ]
An airfoil with camber compared to a symmetrical airfoil
The maximum lift force that can be generated by an airfoil at a given airspeed depends on the shape of the airfoil , especially the amount of camber ( curvature such that the upper surface is more convex than the lower surface , as illustrated at right ) .
Increasing the camber generally increases the maximum lift at a given airspeed . [ 64 ] [ 65 ]
Cambered airfoils will generate lift at zero angle of attack .
When the chord line is horizontal , the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward . [ 66 ]
When a cambered airfoil is upside down , the angle of attack can be adjusted so that the lift force is upwards .
This explains how a plane can fly upside down . [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
Flow conditions [ edit ]
The ambient flow conditions which affect lift include the fluid density , viscosity and speed of flow .
Density is affected by temperature , and by the medium 's acoustic velocity - i.e. by compressibility effects .
Air speed and density [ edit ]
Lift is proportional to the density of the air and approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed .
Lift also depends on the size of the wing , being generally proportional to the wing 's area projected in the lift direction .
In calculations it is convenient to quantify lift in terms of a lift coefficient based on these factors .
Boundary layer and profile drag [ edit ]
No matter how smooth the surface of an airfoil seems , any surface is rough on the scale of air molecules .
Air molecules flying into the surface bounce off the rough surface in random directions relative to their original velocities .
The result is that when the air is viewed as a continuous material , it is seen to be unable to slide along the surface , and the air 's velocity relative to the airfoil decreases to nearly zero at the surface ( i.e. , the air molecules " stick " to the surface instead of sliding along it ) , something known as the no-slip condition . [ 69 ]
Because the air at the surface has near - zero velocity but the air away from the surface is moving , there is a thin boundary layer in which air close to the surface is subjected to a shearing motion . [ 70 ] [ 71 ]
The air 's viscosity resists the shearing , giving rise to a shear stress at the airfoil 's surface called skin friction drag .
Over most of the surface of most airfoils , the boundary layer is naturally turbulent , which increases skin friction drag . [ 71 ] [ 72 ]
Under usual flight conditions , the boundary layer remains attached to both the upper and lower surfaces all the way to the trailing edge , and its effect on the rest of the flow is modest .
Compared to the predictions of inviscid flow theory , in which there is no boundary layer , the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat , which results in a viscosity - related pressure drag over and above the skin friction drag .
The total of the skin friction drag and the viscosity - related pressure drag is usually called the profile drag . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]
Stalling [ edit ]
Airflow separating from a wing at a high angle of attack
An airfoil 's maximum lift at a given airspeed is limited by boundary - layer separation .
As the angle of attack is increased , a point is reached where the boundary layer can no longer remain attached to the upper surface .
When the boundary layer separates , it leaves a region of recirculating flow above the upper surface , as illustrated in the flow - visualization photo at right .
This is known as the stall , or stalling .
At angles of attack above the stall , lift is significantly reduced , though it does not drop to zero .
The maximum lift that can be achieved before stall , in terms of the lift coefficient , is generally less than 1.5 for single - element airfoils and can be more than 3.0 for airfoils with high - lift slotted flaps and leading - edge devices deployed . [ 74 ]
Bluff bodies [ edit ]
The flow around bluff bodies – i.e. without a streamlined shape , or stalling airfoils – may also generate lift , in addition to a strong drag force .
This lift may be steady , or it may oscillate due to vortex shedding .
Interaction of the object 's flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause vortex - induced vibrations . [ 75 ]
For instance , the flow around a circular cylinder generates a Kármán vortex street : vortices being shed in an alternating fashion from the cylinder 's sides .
The oscillatory nature of the flow produces a fluctuating lift force on the cylinder , even though the net ( mean ) force is negligible .
The lift force frequency is characterised by the dimensionless Strouhal number , which depends on the Reynolds number of the flow . [ 76 ] [ 77 ]
For a flexible structure , this oscillatory lift force may induce vortex - induced vibrations .
Under certain conditions – for instance resonance or strong spanwise correlation of the lift force – the resulting motion of the structure due to the lift fluctuations may be strongly enhanced .
Such vibrations may pose problems and threaten collapse in tall man-made structures like industrial chimneys . [ 75 ]
In the Magnus effect , a lift force is generated by a spinning cylinder in a freestream .
Here the mechanical rotation acts on the boundary layer , causing it to separate at different locations on the two sides of the cylinder .
The asymmetric separation changes the effective shape of the cylinder as far as the flow is concerned such that the cylinder acts like a lifting airfoil with circulation in the outer flow . [ 78 ]
A more comprehensive physical explanation [ edit ]
As described above under " Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil " , there are two main popular explanations : one based on downward deflection of the flow ( Newton 's laws ) , and one based on pressure differences accompanied by changes in flow speed ( Bernoulli 's principle ) .
Either of these , by itself , correctly identifies some aspects of the lifting flow but leaves other important aspects of the phenomenon unexplained .
A more comprehensive explanation involves both downward deflection and pressure differences ( including changes in flow speed associated with the pressure differences ) , and requires looking at the flow in more detail . [ 79 ]
Lift at the airfoil surface [ edit ]
The airfoil shape and angle of attack work together so that the airfoil exerts a downward force on the air as it flows past .
According to Newton 's third law , the air must then exert an equal and opposite ( upward ) force on the airfoil , which is the lift . [ 15 ]
The net force exerted by the air occurs as a pressure difference over the airfoil 's surfaces . [ 80 ]
Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense , [ 81 ] so that pressure must always be thought of as pushing , and never as pulling .
The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces .
The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the pressure on the wing 's upper surface and increasing the pressure on the lower surface .
The pressure on the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced pressure on the upper surface pushes down , and the net result is upward lift . [ 80 ]
The pressure difference which results in lift acts directly on the airfoil surfaces ; however , understanding how the pressure difference is produced requires understanding what the flow does over a wider area .
The wider flow around the airfoil [ edit ]
Flow around an airfoil : the dots move with the flow .
The black dots are on time slices , which split into two – an upper and lower part – at the leading edge .
A marked speed difference between the upper - and lower - surface streamlines is shown most clearly in the image animation , with the upper markers arriving at the trailing edge long before the lower ones .
Colors of the dots indicate streamlines
Pressure field around an airfoil .
The lines are isobars of equal pressure along their length .
The arrows show the pressure differential from high ( red ) to low ( blue ) and hence also the net force which causes the air to accelerate in that direction .
An airfoil affects the speed and direction of the flow over a wide area , producing a pattern called a velocity field .
When an airfoil produces lift , the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward , the flow above and below the airfoil is deflected downward , and the flow behind the airfoil is deflected upward again , leaving the air far behind the airfoil in the same state as the oncoming flow far ahead .
The flow above the upper surface is sped up , while the flow below the airfoil is slowed down .
Together with the upward deflection of air in front and the downward deflection of the air immediately behind , this establishes a net circulatory component of the flow .
The downward deflection and the changes in flow speed are pronounced and extend over a wide area , as can be seen in the flow animation on the right .
These differences in the direction and speed of the flow are greatest close to the airfoil and decrease gradually far above and below .
All of these features of the velocity field also appear in theoretical models for lifting flows . [ 82 ] [ 83 ]
The pressure is also affected over a wide area , in a pattern of non-uniform pressure called a pressure field .
When an airfoil produces lift , there is a diffuse region of low pressure above the airfoil , and usually a diffuse region of high pressure below , as illustrated by the isobars ( curves of constant pressure ) in the drawing .
The pressure difference that acts on the surface is just part of this pressure field . [ 84 ]
Mutual interaction of pressure differences and changes in flow velocity [ edit ]
The non-uniform pressure exerts forces on the air in the direction from higher pressure to lower pressure .
The direction of the force is different at different locations around the airfoil , as indicated by the block arrows in the pressure field around an airfoil figure .
Air above the airfoil is pushed toward the center of the low - pressure region , and air below the airfoil is pushed outward from the center of the high - pressure region .
According to Newton 's second law , a force causes air to accelerate in the direction of the force .
Thus the vertical arrows in the pressure distribution with isobars figure indicate that air above and below the airfoil is accelerated , or turned downward , and that the non-uniform pressure is thus the cause of the downward deflection of the flow visible in the flow animation .
To produce this downward turning , the airfoil must have a positive angle of attack or have sufficient positive camber .
Note that the downward turning of the flow over the upper surface is the result of the air being pushed downward by higher pressure above it than below it .
Some explanations that refer to the " Coandă effect " suggest that viscosity plays a key role in the downward turning , but this is false .
( see below under " Controversy regarding the Coandă effect " ) .
The arrows ahead of the airfoil indicate that the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward , and the arrows behind the airfoil indicate that the flow behind is deflected upward again , after being deflected downward over the airfoil .
These deflections are also visible in the flow animation .
The arrows ahead of the airfoil and behind also indicate that air passing through the low - pressure region above the airfoil is sped up as it enters , and slowed back down as it leaves .
Air passing through the high - pressure region below the airfoil is slowed down as it enters and then sped back up as it leaves .
Thus the non-uniform pressure is also the cause of the changes in flow speed visible in the flow animation .
The changes in flow speed are consistent with Bernoulli 's principle , which states that in a steady flow without viscosity , lower pressure means higher speed , and higher pressure means lower speed .
Thus changes in flow direction and speed are directly caused by the non-uniform pressure .
But this cause - and - effect relationship is not just one - way ; it works in both directions simultaneously .
The air 's motion is affected by the pressure differences , but the existence of the pressure differences depends on the air 's motion .
The relationship is thus a mutual , or reciprocal , interaction :
Air flow changes speed or direction in response to pressure differences , and the pressure differences are sustained by the air 's resistance to changing speed or direction . [ 85 ]
A pressure difference can exist only if something is there for it to push against .
In aerodynamic flow , the pressure difference pushes against the air 's inertia , as the air is accelerated by the pressure difference . [ 86 ]
This is why the air 's mass is part of the calculation , and why lift depends on air density .
Sustaining the pressure difference that exerts the lift force on the airfoil surfaces requires sustaining a pattern of non-uniform pressure in a wide area around the airfoil .
This requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions , and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed according to Bernoulli 's principle .
The pressure differences and the changes in flow direction and speed sustain each other in a mutual interaction .
The pressure differences follow naturally from Newton 's second law and from the fact that flow along the surface follows the predominantly downward - sloping contours of the airfoil .
And the fact that the air has mass is crucial to the interaction . [ 87 ]
How simpler explanations fall short [ edit ]
Producing a lift force requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli 's principle .
Each of the simplified explanations given above in Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil falls short by trying to explain lift in terms of only one or the other , thus explaining only part of the phenomenon and leaving other parts unexplained . [ 27 ]
Quantifying lift [ edit ]
Pressure integration [ edit ]
When the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface is known , determining the total lift requires adding up the contributions to the pressure force from local elements of the surface , each with its own local value of pressure .
The total lift is thus the integral of the pressure , in the direction perpendicular to the farfield flow , over the airfoil surface . [ 88 ]
L = ∮ ⁡ p n ⋅ k d S , {\displaystyle L=\oint p\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {k} \;\mathrm {d} S, }
where :
S is the projected ( planform ) area of the airfoil , measured normal to the mean airflow ;
is the projected ( planform ) area of the airfoil , measured normal to the mean airflow ; n is the normal unit vector pointing into the wing ;
is the normal unit vector pointing into the wing ; k is the vertical unit vector , normal to the freestream direction .
The above lift equation neglects the skin friction forces , which are small compared to the pressure forces .
By using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral , we obtain an expression for the pressure drag D p ( which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and , if the wing is three - dimensional , the induced drag ) .
If we use the spanwise vector j , we obtain the side force Y .
D p = ∮ ⁡ p n ⋅ i d S , Y = ∮ ⁡ p n ⋅ j d S .
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned }D_{p}&=\oint p\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {i} \;\mathrm {d} S , \\ [ 1.2ex ]
Y&=\oint p\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {j} \; \mathrm {d} S.\end{aligned}}}
The validity of this integration generally requires the airfoil shape to be a closed curve that is piecewise smooth .
Lift coefficient [ edit ]
Lift depends on the size of the wing , being approximately proportional to the wing area .
It is often convenient to quantify the lift of a given airfoil by its lift coefficient C L {\displaystyle C_{L}} , which defines its overall lift in terms of a unit area of the wing .
If the value of C L {\displaystyle C_{L}} for a wing at a specified angle of attack is given , then the lift produced for specific flow conditions can be determined : [ 89 ]
L = 1 2 ρ v 2 S C L {\displaystyle L={\tfrac { 1}{2}}\rho v^{2}SC_{L}}
where
Mathematical theories of lift [ edit ]
Mathematical theories of lift are based on continuum fluid mechanics , assuming that air flows as a continuous fluid . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ]
Lift is generated in accordance with the fundamental principles of physics , the most relevant being the following three principles : [ 94 ]
Because an airfoil affects the flow in a wide area around it , the conservation laws of mechanics are embodied in the form of partial differential equations combined with a set of boundary condition requirements which the flow has to satisfy at the airfoil surface and far away from the airfoil . [ 95 ]
To predict lift requires solving the equations for a particular airfoil shape and flow condition , which generally requires calculations that are so voluminous that they are practical only on a computer , through the methods of computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) .
Determining the net aerodynamic force from a CFD solution requires " adding up " ( integrating ) the forces due to pressure and shear determined by the CFD over every surface element of the airfoil as described under " pressure integration " .
The Navier–Stokes equations ( NS ) provide the potentially most accurate theory of lift , but in practice , capturing the effects of turbulence in the boundary layer on the airfoil surface requires sacrificing some accuracy , and requires use of the Reynolds - averaged Navier–Stokes equations ( RANS ) .
Simpler but less accurate theories have also been developed .
Navier–Stokes ( NS ) equations [ edit ]
These equations represent conservation of mass , Newton 's second law ( conservation of momentum ) , conservation of energy , the Newtonian law for the action of viscosity , the Fourier heat conduction law , an equation of state relating density , temperature , and pressure , and formulas for the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid . [ 96 ] [ 97 ]
In principle , the NS equations , combined with boundary conditions of no through - flow and no slip at the airfoil surface , could be used to predict lift in any situation in ordinary atmospheric flight with high accuracy .
However , airflows in practical situations always involve turbulence in the boundary layer next to the airfoil surface , at least over the aft portion of the airfoil .
Predicting lift by solving the NS equations in their raw form would require the calculations to resolve the details of the turbulence , down to the smallest eddy .
This is not yet possible , even on the most powerful current computer . [ 98 ]
So in principle the NS equations provide a complete and very accurate theory of lift , but practical prediction of lift requires that the effects of turbulence be modeled in the RANS equations rather than computed directly .
Reynolds - averaged Navier–Stokes ( RANS ) equations [ edit ]
These are the NS equations with the turbulence motions averaged over time , and the effects of the turbulence on the time - averaged flow represented by turbulence modeling ( an additional set of equations based on a combination of dimensional analysis and empirical information on how turbulence affects a boundary layer in a time - averaged average sense ) .
[ 99 ] [ 100 ]
A RANS solution consists of the time - averaged velocity vector , pressure , density , and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil .
The amount of computation required is a minuscule fraction ( billionths ) [ 98 ] of what would be required to resolve all of the turbulence motions in a raw NS calculation , and with large computers available it is now practical to carry out RANS calculations for complete airplanes in three dimensions .
Because turbulence models are not perfect , the accuracy of RANS calculations is imperfect , but it is adequate for practical aircraft design .
Lift predicted by RANS is usually within a few percent of the actual lift .
Inviscid - flow equations ( Euler or potential ) [ edit ]
The Euler equations are the NS equations without the viscosity , heat conduction , and turbulence effects .
[ 101 ]
As with a RANS solution , an Euler solution consists of the velocity vector , pressure , density , and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil .
While the Euler equations are simpler than the NS equations , they do not lend themselves to exact analytic solutions .
Further simplification is available through potential flow theory , which reduces the number of unknowns to be determined , and makes analytic solutions possible in some cases , as described below .
Either Euler or potential - flow calculations predict the pressure distribution on the airfoil surfaces roughly correctly for angles of attack below stall , where they might miss the total lift by as much as 10 - 20 % .
At angles of attack above stall , inviscid calculations do not predict that stall has happened , and as a result they grossly overestimate the lift .
In potential - flow theory , the flow is assumed to be irrotational , i.e. that small fluid parcels have no net rate of rotation .
Mathematically , this is expressed by the statement that the curl of the velocity vector field is everywhere equal to zero .
Irrotational flows have the convenient property that the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function called a potential .
A flow represented in this way is called potential flow .
[ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ]
In potential - flow theory , the flow is assumed to be incompressible .
Incompressible potential - flow theory has the advantage that the equation ( Laplace 's equation ) to be solved for the potential is linear , which allows solutions to be constructed by superposition of other known solutions .
The incompressible - potential - flow equation can also be solved by conformal mapping , a method based on the theory of functions of a complex variable .
In the early 20th century , before computers were available , conformal mapping was used to generate solutions to the incompressible potential - flow equation for a class of idealized airfoil shapes , providing some of the first practical theoretical predictions of the pressure distribution on a lifting airfoil .
A solution of the potential equation directly determines only the velocity field .
The pressure field is deduced from the velocity field through Bernoulli 's equation .
Comparison of a non-lifting flow pattern around an airfoil and a lifting flow pattern consistent with the Kutta condition , in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly
Applying potential - flow theory to a lifting flow requires special treatment and an additional assumption .
The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires circulation in the flow around the airfoil ( See " Circulation and the Kutta–Joukowski theorem " below ) , but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation .
The solution to this problem is to introduce a branch cut , a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance , and to allow a jump in the value of the potential across the cut .
The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented .
However , the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions , and the solution is thus indeterminate .
A potential - flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift .
One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the Kutta condition , [ 106 ] [ 107 ] which is that , of all the possible solutions , the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly .
The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with zero lift , in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge , and another flow pattern with positive lift , in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition .
Linearized potential flow [ edit ]
This is potential - flow theory with the further assumptions that the airfoil is very thin and the angle of attack is small .
[ 108 ]
The linearized theory predicts the general character of the airfoil pressure distribution and how it is influenced by airfoil shape and angle of attack , but is not accurate enough for design work .
For a 2D airfoil , such calculations can be done in a fraction of a second in a spreadsheet on a PC .
Circulation and the Kutta–Joukowski theorem [ edit ]
Circulation component of the flow around an airfoil
When an airfoil generates lift , several components of the overall velocity field contribute to a net circulation of air around it : the upward flow ahead of the airfoil , the accelerated flow above , the decelerated flow below , and the downward flow behind .
The circulation can be understood as the total amount of " spinning " ( or vorticity ) of an inviscid fluid around the airfoil .
The Kutta–Joukowski theorem relates the lift per unit width of span of a two - dimensional airfoil to this circulation component of the flow .
[ 82 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ]
It is a key element in an explanation of lift that follows the development of the flow around an airfoil as the airfoil starts its motion from rest and a starting vortex is formed and left behind , leading to the formation of circulation around the airfoil .
[ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ]
Lift is then inferred from the Kutta - Joukowski theorem .
This explanation is largely mathematical , and its general progression is based on logical inference , not physical cause - and - effect . [ 114 ]
The Kutta–Joukowski model does not predict how much circulation or lift a two - dimensional airfoil will produce .
Calculating the lift per unit span using Kutta–Joukowski requires a known value for the circulation .
In particular , if the Kutta condition is met , in which the rear stagnation point moves to the airfoil trailing edge and attaches there for the duration of flight , the lift can be calculated theorically through the conformal mapping method .
The lift generated by a conventional airfoil is dictated by both its design and the flight conditions , such as forward velocity , angle of attack and air density .
Lift can be increased by artificially increasing the circulation , for example by boundary - layer blowing or the use of blown flaps .
In the Flettner rotor the entire airfoil is circular and spins about a spanwise axis to create the circulation .
Three - dimensional flow [ edit ]
Cross-section of an airplane wing - body combination showing the isobars of the three - dimensional lifting flow
Cross-section of an airplane wing - body combination showing velocity vectors of the three - dimensional lifting flow
The flow around a three - dimensional wing involves significant additional issues , especially relating to the wing tips .
For a wing of low aspect ratio , such as a typical delta wing , two - dimensional theories may provide a poor model and three - dimensional flow effects can dominate . [ 115 ]
Even for wings of high aspect ratio , the three - dimensional effects associated with finite span can affect the whole span , not just close to the tips .
Wing tips and spanwise distribution [ edit ]
The vertical pressure gradient at the wing tips causes air to flow sideways , out from under the wing then up and back over the upper surface .
This reduces the pressure gradient at the wing tip , therefore also reducing lift .
The lift tends to decrease in the spanwise direction from root to tip , and the pressure distributions around the airfoil sections change accordingly in the spanwise direction .
Pressure distributions in planes perpendicular to the flight direction tend to look like the illustration at right . [ 116 ]
This spanwise - varying pressure distribution is sustained by a mutual interaction with the velocity field .
Flow below the wing is accelerated outboard , flow outboard of the tips is accelerated upward , and flow above the wing is accelerated inboard , which results in the flow pattern illustrated at right . [ 117 ]
There is more downward turning of the flow than there would be in a two - dimensional flow with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift , and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a two - dimensional flow . [ 118 ]
The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making , as if the freestream flow were tilted downward , with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions .
The additional backward component of the force vector is called lift - induced drag .
Euler computation of a tip vortex rolling up from the trailed vorticity sheet
The difference in the spanwise component of velocity above and below the wing ( between being in the inboard direction above and in the outboard direction below ) persists at the trailing edge and into the wake downstream .
After the flow leaves the trailing edge , this difference in velocity takes place across a relatively thin shear layer called a vortex sheet .
Horseshoe vortex system [ edit ]
Planview of a wing showing the horseshoe vortex system
The wingtip flow leaving the wing creates a tip vortex .
As the main vortex sheet passes downstream from the trailing edge , it rolls up at its outer edges , merging with the tip vortices .
The combination of the wingtip vortices and the vortex sheets feeding them is called the vortex wake .
In addition to the vorticity in the trailing vortex wake there is vorticity in the wing 's boundary layer , called ' bound vorticity ' , which connects the trailing sheets from the two sides of the wing into a vortex system in the general form of a horseshoe .
The horseshoe form of the vortex system was recognized by the British aeronautical pioneer Lanchester in 1907 . [ 119 ]
Given the distribution of bound vorticity and the vorticity in the wake , the Biot–Savart law ( a vector - calculus relation ) can be used to calculate the velocity perturbation anywhere in the field , caused by the lift on the wing .
Approximate theories for the lift distribution and lift - induced drag of three - dimensional wings are based on such analysis applied to the wing 's horseshoe vortex system . [ 120 ] [ 121 ]
In these theories , the bound vorticity is usually idealized and assumed to reside at the camber surface inside the wing .
Because the velocity is deduced from the vorticity in such theories , some authors describe the situation to imply that the vorticity is the cause of the velocity perturbations , using terms such as " the velocity induced by the vortex " , for example . [ 122 ]
But attributing mechanical cause - and - effect between the vorticity and the velocity in this way is not consistent with the physics . [ 123 ] [ 124 ] [ 125 ]
The velocity perturbations in the flow around a wing are in fact produced by the pressure field . [ 126 ]
Manifestations of lift in the farfield [ edit ]
Integrated force / momentum balance in lifting flows [ edit ]
Control volumes of different shapes that have been used in analyzing the momentum balance in the 2D flow around a lifting airfoil .
The airfoil is assumed to exert a downward force - L ' per unit span on the air , and the proportions in which that force is manifested as momentum fluxes and pressure differences at the outer boundary are indicated for each different shape of control volume .
The flow around a lifting airfoil must satisfy Newton 's second law regarding conservation of momentum , both locally at every point in the flow field , and in an integrated sense over any extended region of the flow .
For an extended region , Newton 's second law takes the form of the momentum theorem for a control volume , where a control volume can be any region of the flow chosen for analysis .
The momentum theorem states that the integrated force exerted at the boundaries of the control volume ( a surface integral ) , is equal to the integrated time rate of change ( material derivative ) of the momentum of fluid parcels passing through the interior of the control volume .
For a steady flow , this can be expressed in the form of the net surface integral of the flux of momentum through the boundary . [ 127 ]
The lifting flow around a 2D airfoil is usually analyzed in a control volume that completely surrounds the airfoil , so that the inner boundary of the control volume is the airfoil surface , where the downward force per unit span −
L ′ {\displaystyle - L'} is exerted on the fluid by the airfoil .
The outer boundary is usually either a large circle or a large rectangle .
At this outer boundary distant from the airfoil , the velocity and pressure are well represented by the velocity and pressure associated with a uniform flow plus a vortex , and viscous stress is negligible , so that the only force that must be integrated over the outer boundary is the pressure . [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
The free - stream velocity is usually assumed to be horizontal , with lift vertically upward , so that the vertical momentum is the component of interest .
For the free - air case ( no ground plane ) , the force − L ′ {\displaystyle - L'} exerted by the airfoil on the fluid is manifested partly as momentum fluxes and partly as pressure differences at the outer boundary , in proportions that depend on the shape of the outer boundary , as shown in the diagram at right .
For a flat horizontal rectangle that is much longer than it is tall , the fluxes of vertical momentum through the front and back are negligible , and the lift is accounted for entirely by the integrated pressure differences on the top and bottom . [ 128 ]
For a square or circle , the momentum fluxes and pressure differences account for half the lift each . [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
For a vertical rectangle that is much taller than it is wide , the unbalanced pressure forces on the top and bottom are negligible , and lift is accounted for entirely by momentum fluxes , with a flux of upward momentum that enters the control volume through the front accounting for half the lift , and a flux of downward momentum that exits the control volume through the back accounting for the other half . [ 128 ]
The results of all of the control - volume analyses described above are consistent with the Kutta–Joukowski theorem described above .
Both the tall rectangle and circle control volumes have been used in derivations of the theorem . [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
Lift reacted by overpressure on the ground under an airplane [ edit ]
Illustration of the distribution of higher - than - ambient pressure on the ground under an airplane in subsonic flight
An airfoil produces a pressure field in the surrounding air , as explained under " The wider flow around the airfoil " above .
The pressure differences associated with this field die off gradually , becoming very small at large distances , but never disappearing altogether .
Below the airplane , the pressure field persists as a positive pressure disturbance that reaches the ground , forming a pattern of slightly - higher - than - ambient pressure on the ground , as shown on the right .
[ 131 ]
Although the pressure differences are very small far below the airplane , they are spread over a wide area and add up to a substantial force .
For steady , level flight , the integrated force due to the pressure differences is equal to the total aerodynamic lift of the airplane and to the airplane 's weight .
According to Newton 's third law , this pressure force exerted on the ground by the air is matched by an equal - and - opposite upward force exerted on the air by the ground , which offsets all of the downward force exerted on the air by the airplane .
The net force due to the lift , acting on the atmosphere as a whole , is therefore zero , and thus there is no integrated accumulation of vertical momentum in the atmosphere , as was noted by Lanchester early in the development of modern aerodynamics . [ 132 ]

July 14 , 2010  -- A New York police officer is in hiding and under round - the - clock protection today after his house was burned to the ground , possibly in retaliation for the fatal shooting of the subject of a narcotics investigation earlier this year , a spokesman for the officer 's family said today .
Ithaca police Sgt. Bryan Bangs was in his home early Saturday morning when the fire began .
Bangs , who was home alone , escaped with minor smoke inhalation injuries .
By the next day , the New York State Police had determined arson was the cause of the fire -- a " despicable , unconscionable " attack , according to Ithaca Police Chief Edward E. Vallely .
" An attack on any police officer is an attack on all police officers , " Vallely said in a statement Monday .
" And the entire law enforcement community will work on this investigation until the person or persons responsible are identified , arrested and brought before a court to answer for what they have done . "
Earlier this month , Bangs was exonerated of any wrongdoing in the fatal February shooting of local man Shawn Greenwood .
The death of Greenwood , who was African - American , fiercely divided the Ithaca community .
Though Vallely said previously there was no hard evidence to support the two incidents are related , Bangs family friend and spokesman Eric Cleveland had no doubt .
" It racially charged the community .
When the incident first took place at the end of February , there were a lot of people that questioned the actions , " Cleveland told ABC News .
" Any logical person would make that connection ... it 's pretty easy to connect the dots . "
The Tompkins County District Attorney 's office conducted a five - month investigation into the shooting .
Bangs , a SWAT team leader and 13 - year police veteran , shot the 29 - year - old Greenwood , after he refused to get out of a van when ordered and then ran into a police officer with the van , according to reports .
Cocaine was discovered in the van Greenwood was driving .
Jeff Bangs , Bryan Bangs ' father , told ABC News that since the July 1 finding , his son's family had moved in with him and then spent some time out of state in fear of retaliation .
Bryan Bangs stayed in a series of hotels before returning home late Thursday night .
The home was attacked late the next night .
Jeff Bangs said that while it's " everybody 's assumption " that the fire was a form of payback for the ruling , he said it is the police 's job determine that .
" We have to let the legal system proceed the same way we let the legal system proceed for the past four months , " Bangs ' father , Jeff Bangs , told ABC News , referring to the investigation that cleared his son .
" Somebody can't accept the report – that 's my personal opinion … [ but ]
I 'm not a cop and I do n't want to be . "
Shooting Case Divides Community
In March , mourners piled into St. James AME Zion Church to remember Greenwood 's life and death , which some said was a murder , The Ithaca Journal reported .
" Things , in my estimation , had calmed down , " after the district attorney 's finding two months later , Cleveland said .
" This attack on Bryan happened right after we had all collectively sort of exhaled and thought we were beyond it .
" Some people felt they had to take matters into their own hands , " he said .
New York State Police , who are heading the investigation with the assistance of the Ithaca police department , declined to comment on the possible connection between the fire and the shooting , except to say the department is " looking into all aspects of the investigation .
" We 're not zeroing in or ruling out any particular angle , " Lt. William McEvoy told ABC News .
Comments on the Ithaca Journal 's message boards seemed to support Cleveland 's speculation and give a glimpse at the division over the Greenwood shooting case .
" The odds of this being unrelated to the Greenwood shooting and / or the aftermath of it , are so slim as to defy credibility , " one commenter said .
" We all know why the fire was set , " said another .
Outpouring of Support
Though a member of the Bangs family told ABC News Bryan Bangs is " doing great , " the crime sent a shockwave through the relatively small town of Ithaca .
There , police officers are " responsible , most often , for maintaining quality of life issues , " Ithaca Mayor Carolyn Peterson said in a statement .
" This terrible crime emphasizes that our officers not only strive to keep the peace but do indeed put their lives at risk , " the statement said .
Cleveland , who spoke to ABC News from the wreckage that used to be the Bangs ' home , said the community 's outpouring of support -- from volunteers to donations -- has been inspiring .
Within hours of hearing about the fire , more than 50 police officers , firefighters and other volunteers turned out at the Bangs ' home to sort through the rubble and make the site safe , should the family want to comb through it for personal items .
" It 's not because of the family name as much as the brotherhood of emergency services , " Jeff Bangs said .
The Bangs family is well known in the town , having been around for more than 70 years , Bangs said .
Local businesses have chipped in the cleanup , including one Home Depot that refused to let Bangs pay for some bins .
" The community support we are receiving from this has been just astronomical , " Jeff Bangs said .
Cleveland said that despite there being nothing left but " a charred , burned out , shell of a home , " a few sentimental momentos -- Bangs ' son's toys and the couple 's wedding album -- somehow survived the fire .
Though he was the last person alive in the house , Bryan Bangs has not seen the damage for himself , Jeff Bangs said .
Jeff sent periodical picture updates to his daughter - in - law of the cleanup .
" I could tell by the texts back that she was just in tears , " he said .
A local fund , called the Bryan Bangs Relief Fund , was set up just two days after the fire and a benefit concert with local acts is scheduled next month .

BP plans to reduce payments to some 40,000 oil - spill claimants , potentially making life more difficult for individuals and businesses affected by the Gulf oil spill , a Louisiana official has said .
The Associated Press reports that Louisiana ’s secretary for children and family services , Kristy Nichols , found “ a significant cut in daily payments ” during a recent review of claims against BP , which appears to be related to incomplete forms .

In a letter to Ken Feinberg , the federal administrator of the oil spill claims process , Nichols wrote that it was “ rash ” of BP to cut payments to 40,000 of the 99,000 claims filed so far .
Nichols wrote :
It is rash for BP to make this decision without consulting the State to determine if there are alternative methods for obtaining the documentation in State records .
If not quickly rectified , the direct impact will be devastating to individuals surviving financially month - to - month .
This action is irresponsible and in complete contrast to BP ’s repeated promise that they will “ make things right . ”
BP has negatively impacted these people ’s livelihoods as a result of the oil spill and has not kept pace with their needs .
Nichols suggested that BP use government records , such as those held by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries , to fill in missing information .
She argued that claimants often do n’t have access to the information required on the claim forms .
Nichols went on to say that BP is differentiating between claims made as a result of the oil spill and claims made as a result of the moratorium on deepwater drilling enacted by the Obama administration , and recently overturned by federal judge .
“ When the State asked BP how many claims fall into this category , representatives stated that the current design of their database does not allow them to identify that information , ” Nichols wrote , adding that that amounts to “ a significant flaw ” in the system ’s design .

“ The moratorium is the direct result of the oil disaster and people affected should be adequately , accurately and promptly compensated , ” she wrote .
Nichols also suggested that BP ’s willingness to pay claims may be correlated to the political pressure it ’s feeling to respond to the oil spill .
“ Analysis has shown that BP issued the most claims checks in the middle of June , with a spike that came within a week of additional pressure placed on BP by the State .
Payments to large loss claimants show the same type of spike immediately after the state pressured BP regarding those claims , ” she wrote .
Some of these produce seeds readily and it 's possible to collect them .
Hardy annual seeds ( such as cornflower , ammi and calendula ) , can be sown in autumn and over - wintered in a frame for early summer flowers .
However , more often the seeds of annuals are stored and sown in March or April .

john snow wo n’t have to worry about his retirement .
When he left the csx railroad to become George W. Bush ’s second treasury secretary , he took with him a $ 2.5 million annual pension .
The figure was based on 44 years of employment at csx , never mind that Snow had been there for only 25 ( during which , incidentally , he brutally cut safety and maintenance , to the point where a jury awarded a widow $ 50 million in punitive damages after a derailment — money paid by the taxpayers because of a little - known law that insulated Snow and his company from the costs of his egregious judgment ) .
That kind of boost is unheard of for the rank and file , but not at all uncommon for corporate executives and owners .
Snow ’s case is typical of the way corporate executives have , for the past 35 years , managed to gild their retirement benefits even as they hollowed out workers ’ pensions .
It started with the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act , the law ostensibly designed to ensure that workers could collect the retirement benefits they ’d earned .
erisa brought some important reforms — including establishing the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ( pbgc ) to help workers whose pensions went bust — but it also was riddled with favors to business .
And in the decades since , legions of lobbyists have helped create numerous new loopholes , exemptions , and special deals .
The result is two separate and unequal pension systems : Executives get the equivalent of antebellum mansions , while workers get leaky shacks liable to collapse at the first harsh economic wind .
Here are 10 of the key ways in which it happened .
( Be warned : This stuff gets a bit technical .
Washington is full of people who are very well paid to figure out insanely complex ways to take money from you and me . )
The Top Hat Club :
In erisa , lawmakers put a cap on how much of an employee ’s pay companies could count in calculating his retirement benefits .
The reasoning was solid : Congress let companies take a tax deduction for money they put in their pension plan , but did n’t want to extend that taxpayer subsidy to the highest - paid workers .
The cap rises with inflation ; this year it amounts to $ 245,000 .
That is more than 99 percent of workers earn , but it is also far below what top executives are paid .
So to guarantee a retirement in keeping with the income they are accustomed to , executives have created their own plans , known appropriately enough as Top Hat plans .
If you thought ceo pay was lavish , consider this :
Most of the numbers you see reported do n’t include retirement benefits , even though they typically raise compensation by about a third .
And since these funds are separate from the regular workers ’ pensions , executives have no personal motivation to safeguard the latter .
The government does not guarantee these executive benefits ; in theory , if a company ends up in bankruptcy , creditors can take the money .
But as Diana B. Henriques and I showed in a 1996 series for the New York Times , in practice executives get nearly every cent ( and some even double their money ) when their companies fail .
The reason ?
Executives of bankrupt companies threaten to walk unless they get their pension money in full , but promise to stay and help rehabilitate the firm if their money is guaranteed .
The Tax Dodge : Contributions to pension plans are tax free , but companies have to pay taxes on the money they put into Top Hat plans — a cost that can amount to several billions over the years for a large firm .
How do companies pay for that extra cost ?
First , they shortchange the rank and file by reducing their benefits .
( Workers are often told their benefits must be cut because of competition ; they just do n’t realize that the competitors are their own bosses . )
Second , they buy tax shelters — depriving the Treasury of revenue that must be made up by the rest of us .
The Bonus Bonus : Under most pension plans , workers ’ benefits are calculated based on salary and years worked .
However , a number of subtle rules tend to reduce these benefits — such as averaging pay for the last five years on the job , excluding overtime and bonuses , etc .
For executives , it works exactly the opposite way : Benefits are maximized by counting only their highest - paid year , bonuses and supplemental pay are included , and so on .
In calculating Snow ’s pension , for example , csx even counted the 250,000 shares of stock it gave him .
Based on similarly generous pension rules , controversial ceo Jack Welch left General Electric in 2001 with a pension worth $ 9 million a year , and Lee Raymond retired as ceo of ExxonMobil in 2006 with a lump - sum pension payment of $ 98 million .
The Social Security Swindle : erisa allowed com­panies to reduce prom­ised pension benefits by the equivalent of most of a worker ’s Social Security check .
Thus , if a secretary were due a pension of $ 1,000 but could expect $ 732 in Social Security , she might receive as little as $ 400 from the pension fund .
( Thanks to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , only half a pension can be taken away via the Social Security offset . )
Prudent Man’s Hand :
When you buy an annuity ( which is essentially an individually financed pension plan ) , the insurance company that manages it will invest primarily in high - quality , safe corporate bonds .
Had Congress held to this sound accounting principle , few pension plans would be in trouble today .
But instead , Congress in 1974 created a “ prudent man test ” for plan managers , who were expected simply to look to what others in their field were doing .
Soon , plans were falling over each other chasing the higher returns to be found in stocks and even hedge funds ; at the same time , pension lobbyists worked to kill laws limiting pension investments in stocks .
The Phantom of the Pension Fund : In erisa , Congress allowed companies to treat their own estimates of how much their pension investments would earn as if they had actually earned that much , even when the true returns were much smaller .
Thus , a company can estimate that it will earn 8 percent , actually make 3 percent , yet still value its pension plan as if it had made the higher amount .
In theory , this process , known as “ smoothing , ” is supposed to account for fluctuations in asset valuations over time .
In practice , it means that pension plans can become filled with phantom assets .
At one point in 2004 , the New York Times reported , the entire net worth of General Motors was accounted for by these imaginary investment gains in its pension plans .
( The fanciful accounting practice has since been limited somewhat . )
Under erisa , if a plan had $ 1 in assets for each dollar owed in benefits , no more tax - deductible money could be put in .
( In 2006 , that ceiling was changed to $ 1.50 . )
So when the stock market was riding high , companies would stop making pension contributions even though they were flush with profit and could afford to put money aside .
In the ’80s and ’90s , some big firms like General Electric , ibm , and US Steel went years without adding a dime to their pension plans because the soaring stock market made the funds appear flush .
Then the inevitable cyclical declines came , leaving some plans deep in the hole — and with the economy weakened , companies claimed they could n’t afford make - up contributions .
The Boehner Bungle : Under the 2006 Pension Protection Act , a misleadingly named law sponsored by Rep. John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , now the House Republican leader , companies can convert single - employer plans to multi-employer plans .
A little - noticed side effect :
If those pension plans fail , the maximum government guarantee is no longer $ 1,000 - plus per week , but about $ 250 per week .
Public disclosure is limited , so it ’s hard to tell how many companies have done this .
40 Is the New 60 : Since 1985 , more and more companies have switched from traditional “ guaranteed benefit ” pensions to a new system , called a cash balance plan , that is a mixture of the traditional pension and a 401 ( k ) - type plan .
A cash balance plan typically costs a company about 20 percent less than a traditional pension plan and can cost workers 40 and older half their expected retirement benefits .
Yet the federal courts have rejected claims by ibm employees and others that this amounts to illegal age discrimination .
The Deep Freeze :
Once upon a time , only troubled companies shut down their pension plans .
But in the last decade , ibm , Neiman Marcus , and many other healthy companies have done effectively the same thing by freezing their plans , meaning that employees ’ benefits will not go up no matter how long they work for the company .
Other companies , including Alcoa , Nissan North America , and Lockheed Martin , have kept their plans going but barred new hires from joining , while others yet ( such as DuPont ) cut newly accrued retirement benefits by as much as two - thirds .
The Coming Bailout :
In February 2008 , just as the stock market was beginning to tank , the three - person board of the pbgc ( Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez ) ordered the agency ’s staff to sell some of its bond holdings and buy stocks and hedge funds instead .
Fortunately , that did n’t happen .
Still , as of last September 30 the guaranty corporation owed $ 11.2 billion more to workers in failed pension plans than it had available to pay them .
And while the feds could simply boost employer premiums to the pbgc to make up for the shortfall , a likelier outcome is a taxpayer bailout if ( or when ) more plans fail .
At least this time the money will go to elderly people who did nothing to bring on their misfortune .
Back when Congress created the contemporary pension system , the idea was that workers ’ benefits ( which are really just wages deferred to old age ) should be guaranteed even if their employers failed .
Executives ’ benefits , meanwhile , were supposed to be risky , tied to their companies ’ fortunes .
What we now have is the opposite .
Nearly 44 million workers are at risk of not being paid the benefits they are due .
But few executives will miss out on their golden years .

BRANDON -- A Brandon man has been acquitted of impaired driving on his snow machine because an RCMP constable went too far when he pulled his gun on the accused , a provincial court judge has ruled .
Judge John Combs acquitted Joel Donald Kempthorne , 49 , of impaired driving and driving with his blood alcohol level over the legal limit , because the arresting officer 's actions were " excessive . "
The judge said the nervous constable could have waited for backup to arrive , instead of trying to arrest Kempthorne and his buddy by himself .
" His doing so with his firearm pointed at them was , in my view , unnecessary and potentially very dangerous , " Combs stated in a written decision delivered this week .
Kempthorne and his friend were arrested in the early morning of Jan. 6 , 2008 .
During his trial on Dec. 16 , 2009 and March 24 of this year , Kempthorne testified that he and a friend went on a snowmobile ride .
He had a beer before leaving Brandon , then four drinks during two hours at a Carberry bar .
Kempthorne and his buddy then rode away from the bar , stopping just outside Carberry , where they had two beers each .
Kempthorne also swigged from a bottle of schnapps after his snowmobile got stuck at that spot .
It was then that he and his friend were arrested .
Kempthorne testified that a pistol was put to his neck as he lay on the ground .
The arresting officer told court he pulled out his gun because he was concerned for his safety .
He believed he was dealing with two riders who had " fled " after the officer spotted them in Carberry .
Combs ruled that the officer did n't have reasonable grounds to conclude Kempthorne was one of the elusive snowmobile riders .
At the time , Kempthorne was told he was being arrested after showing signs of impairment and because he was found with a quarter - full bottle of schnapps and a pair of beers .
Breathalyzer tests later placed his blood - alcohol level at more than double the legal limit .
Combs agreed Crown attorney Garry Rainnie proved Kempthorne 's blood - alcohol level was over the legal limit when he rode his machine .
However , the evidence of impairment and the breathalyzer results can't be accepted , Combs ruled .
The gunpoint arrest was arbitrary and unnecessary and breached Kempthorne 's rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the judge wrote .
" The public would be concerned if evidence was admitted which was obtained in the manner of this case . "

St. Peter ’s Anglican Church has long been known as an open and inclusive place .
So open , it seems , they wo n’t turn anyone away .
Not even a dog .
That ’s how a blessed canine ended up receiving communion from interim priest Rev. Marguerite Rea during a morning service the last Sunday in June .
According to those in attendance at the historical church at 188 Carlton St. in downtown Toronto , it was a spontaneous gesture , one intended to make both the dog and its owner – a first timer at the church — feel welcomed .
But at least one parishioner saw the act as an affront to the rules and regulations of the Anglican Church .
He filed a complaint with the reverend and with the Anglican Diocese of Toronto about the incident – and has since left the church .
“ I wrote back to the parishioner that it is not the policy of the Anglican Church to give communion to animals , ” said Bishop Patrick Yu , the area bishop of York - Scarborough responsible for St. Peter ’s , who received the complaint in early July .
“ I can see why people would be offended .
It is a strange and shocking thing , and I have never heard of it happening before .
“ I think the reverend was overcome by what I consider a misguided gesture of welcoming . ”
Rev. Rea was contacted numerous times about the incident , but did not want to comment .
“ She is quite embarrassed by it , ” said Yu .
But congregants of the church say the act was n’t meant to be controversial .
Peggy Needham , the deputy people ’s warden was sitting near the front of the church when the dog was given the wafer .
It was the first time Needham had seen the man and his dog in church .
He had been invited to the service after an incident where police heckled him as he sat peacefully on the steps of the church early one morning during the G20 weekend .
Angry over the experience , he called the church to vent .
They invited him to come to church , and he did , bringing his dog with him .
When it was time for communion , the man went up to receive the bread and the wine , with the dog .
“ I am sure for Marguerite that was a surprise , like it was for all of us , ” said Needham .
“ But nobody felt like it was a big deal , because it was n’t a big deal . ”
According to the account
Yu heard , the man asked the reverend to give the dog a wafer .
But Needham says she does n’t recall the man making such a request .
Instead , she said Rev. Rea instinctively leaned over and placed a wafer on the dog ’s wagging tongue .
“ I think it was this natural reaction : here ’s this dog , and he ’s just looking up , and she ’s giving the wafers to people and she just gave one to him , ” said Needham .
“ Anybody might have done that .
It ’s not like she ’s trying to create a revolution . ”
Days later , the church and diocese received a complaint from one parishioner , who felt the church offended the sacred ritual .
The bread and wine are meant to represent the body and blood of Jesus Christ and are only to be given to those who have been baptized .
Yu said when he spoke to Rev. Rea , she apologized for what she had done and said she would not do it again .
“ Unless there is any further evidence that she is giving communion to animals , the matter is closed . . . we are after all , in the forgiveness and repair business , ” he said .

Needham said the church has always been open to animals and once a year conducts a service to bless pets .
Which is why the incident hardly caused a stir among the congregants – except for one .
“ In his email , the man ’s argument was that Christ would n’t have liked it , ” said Needham .
“ But in my opinion , Christ would have thought it was neat .
It was just being human .
And it made everyone smile . ”
Those of you who have been paying attention know that this series is spiraling towards what can be considered the core of Python ’s Virtual Machine , the “ actually do work function ” ./ Python /ceval.c : PyEval_EvalFrameEx .
The ( hopefully ) last hurdle on our way there is to understand the three significant stack data structures used for CPython ’s code evaluation : the call stack , the value stack and the block stack ( I ’ve called them collectively “ Interpreter Stacks ” in the title , this is n’t a formal term ) .
All three stacks are tightly coupled with the frame object , which will also be discussed today .
If you give me a minute to put on my spectacles , I ’ll read to you what Wikipedia says about call stacks in general :
In computer science , a call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program …
A call stack is composed of stack frames ( … ) .
These are machine dependent data structures containing subroutine state information .
Each stack frame corresponds to a call to a subroutine which has not yet terminated with a return .
Hrmf .
Jim , I do n’t understand … how does this translate to a virtual machine ?
Well , since CPython implements a virtual machine , its call stack and stack frames are dependant on this virtual machine , not on the physical machine it ’s running on .
And also , as Python tends to do , this internal implementation detail is exposed to Python code , either via the C - API or pure Python , as frame objects ( ./ Include / frameobject.h : PyFrameObject ) .
We know that code execution in CPython is really the evaluation ( interpretation ) of a code object , so every frame represents a currently - being - evaluated code object .
We ’ll see ( and already saw before ) that frame objects are linked to one another , thus forming a call stack of frames .
Finally , inside each frame object in the call stack there ’s a reference to two frame - specific stacks ( not directly related to the call stack ) , they are the value stack and the block stack .
The value stack ( you may know this term as an ‘ evaluation stack ’ ) is where manipulation of objects happens when object - manipulating opcodes are evaluated .
We have seen the value stack before on various occasions , like in the introduction and during our discussion of namespaces .
Recalling an example we used before , BINARY_SUBTRACT is an opcode that effectively pops the two top objects in the value stack , performs PyNumber_Subtract on them and sets the new top of the value stack to the result .
Namespace related opcodes , like LOAD_FAST or STORE_GLOBAL , load values from a namespace to the stack or store values from the stack to a namespace .
Each frame has a value stack of its own ( this makes sense in several ways , possibly the most prominent is simplicity of implementation ) , we ’ll see later where in the frame object the value stack is stored .
This leaves us with the block stack , a fairly simple concept with some vaguely defined terminology around it , so pay attention .
Python has a notion called a code block , which we have discussed in the article about code objects and which is also explained here .
Completely unrelatedly , Python also has a notion of compound statements , which are statements that contain other statements ( the language reference defines compound statements here ) .
Compound statements consist of one or more clauses , each made of a header and a suite .
Even if the terminology was n’t known to you until now , I expect this is all instinctively clear to you if you have almost any Python experience : for , try and while are a few compound statements .
So where ’s the confusion ?
In various places throughout the code , a block ( sometimes “ frame block ” , sometimes “ basic block ” ) is used as a loose synonym for a clause or a suite , making it easier to confuse suites and clauses with what ’s actually a code block or vice versa .
Both the compilation code ( ./ Python/compile.c ) and the evaluation code ( ./ Python /ceval.c ) are aware of various suites and have ( ill - named ) data structures to deal with them ; but since we ’re more interested in evaluation in this series , we wo n’t discuss the compilation - related details much ( or at all ) .
Whenever I ’ll think wording might get confusing , I ’ll mention the formal terms of clause or suite alongside whatever code term we ’re discussing .
With all this terminology in mind we can look at what ’s contained in a frame object .
Looking at the declaration of ./ Include / frameobject.h : PyFrameObject , we find ( comments were trimmed and edited for your viewing pleasure ) :
typedef struct _frame { PyObject_VAR_HEAD
struct _frame * f_back ; /* previous frame , or NULL */ PyCodeObject * f_code ; /* code segment */ PyObject * f_builtins ; /* builtin symbol table */ PyObject * f_globals ; /* global symbol table */ PyObject * f_locals ; /* local symbol table */ PyObject ** f_valuestack ; /* points after the last local */ PyObject ** f_stacktop ; /* current top of valuestack */ PyObject * f_trace ; /* trace function */ /* used for swapping generator exceptions */ PyObject * f_exc_type , * f_exc_value , * f_exc_traceback ; PyThreadState * f_tstate ; /* call stack 's thread state */ int f_lasti ; /* last instruction if called */ int f_lineno ; /* current line # ( if tracing ) */ int f_iblock ; /* index in f_blockstack */ /* for try and loop blocks */ PyTryBlock f_blockstack [ CO_MAXBLOCKS ] ; /* dynamically : locals , free vars , cells and valuestack */ PyObject * f_localsplus [ 1 ] ; /* dynamic portion */ } PyFrameObject ;
We see various fields used to store the state of this invocation of the code object as well as maintain the call stack ’s structure .
Both in the C - API and in Python these fields are all prefixed by f_ , though not all the fields of the C structure PyFrameObject are exposed in the pythonic representation .
I hope some of the fields are intuitively clear to you , since these fields relate to many topics we have already covered .
We already mentioned the relation between frame and code objects , so the f_code field of every frame points to precisely one code object .
Insofar as structure goes , frames point backwards thus that they create a stack ( f_back ) as well as point “ root - wards ” in the interpreter state / thread state / call stack structure by pointing to their thread state ( f_tstate ) , as explained here .
Finally , since you always execute Python code in the context of three namespaces ( as discussed there ) , frames have the f_builtins , f_globals and f_locals fields to point to these namespaces .
These are the fields ( I hope ) we already know .
Before we dig into the other fields of a frame object , please notice frames are a variable size Python object ( they are a PyObject_VAR_HEAD ) .
The reason is that when a frame object is created it should be dynamically allocated to be large enough to contain references ( pointers , really ) to the locals , cells and free variables used by its code object , as well as the value stack needed by the code objects ‘ deepest ’ branch .
Indeed , the last field of the frame object , f_localsplus ( locals plus cells plus free variables plus value stack … ) is a dynamic array where all these references are stored .
PyFrame_New will show you exactly how the size of this array is computed .
If the previous paragraph does n’t sit well with you , I suggest you read the descriptions I wrote for co_nlocals , co_cellvars , co_freevars and co_stacksize – during evaluation , all these ‘ dead ’ parts of the inert code object come to ‘ life ’ in space allocated at the end of the frame .
As we ’ll probably see in the next article , when the frame is evaluated , these references at the end of the frame will be used to get ( or set ) “ fast ” local variables , free variables and cell variables , as well as to the variables on the value stack ( “ fast ” locals was explained when we discussed namespaces ) .
Looking back at the commented declaration above and given what I said here , I believe you should now understand f_valuestack , f_stacktop and f_localsplus .
We can now look at f_blockstack , keeping in mind the terminology clarification from before .
As you can maybe imagine , compound statements sometimes require state to be evaluated .
If we ’re in a loop , we need to know where to go in case of a break or a continue .
If we ’re raising an exception , we need to know where is the innermost enclosing handler ( the suite of the closest except header , in more formal terms ) .
This state is stored in f_blockstack , a fixed size stack of PyTryBlock structures which keeps the current compound statement state for us ( PyTryBlock is not just for try blocks ; it has a b_type field to let it handle various types of compound statements ’ suites ) .
f_iblock is an offset to the last allocated PyTryBlock in the stack .
If we need to bail out of the current “ block ” ( that is , the current clause ) , we can pop the block stack and find the new offset in the bytecode from which we should resume evaluation in the popped PyTryBlock ( look at its b_handler and b_level fields ) .
A somewhat special case is a raised exception which exhausts the block stack without being caught , as you can imagine , in that case a handler will be sought in the block stack of the previous frames on the call stack .
All this should easily click into place now if you read three code snippets .
First , look at this disassembly of a for statement ( this would look strikingly similar for a try statement ) :
>>> def f( ) : ... for c in ' string ' : ... my_global_list.append( c ) ... >>> diss(f ) 2 0 SETUP_LOOP 27 ( to 30 ) 3 LOAD_CONST 1 ( ' string ' ) 6 GET_ITER >> 7 FOR_ITER 19 ( to 29 ) 10 STORE_FAST 0 ( c ) 3 13 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 ( my_global_list ) 16 LOAD_ATTR 1 ( append ) 19 LOAD_FAST 0 ( c ) 22 CALL_FUNCTION 1 25 POP_TOP 26 JUMP_ABSOLUTE 7 >> 29 POP_BLOCK >> 30 LOAD_CONST 0 ( None ) 33 RETURN_VALUE >>>
Next , look at how the opcodes SETUP_LOOP and POP_BLOCK are implemented in ./ Python/ceval.c .
Notice that SETUP_LOOP and SETUP_EXCEPT or SETUP_FINALLY are rather similar , they all push a block matching the relevant suite unto the block stack , and they all utilize the same POP_BLOCK :
TARGET_WITH_IMPL( SETUP_LOOP , _setup_finally ) TARGET_WITH_IMPL( SETUP_EXCEPT , _setup_finally ) TARGET ( SETUP_FINALLY ) _setup_finally : PyFrame_BlockSetup(f , opcode , INSTR_OFFSET ( ) + oparg , STACK_LEVEL ( ) ) ; DISPATCH ( ) ; TARGET ( POP_BLOCK ) { PyTryBlock * b = PyFrame_BlockPop(f ) ; UNWIND_BLOCK ( b ) ; } DISPATCH ( ) ;
Finally , look at the actual implementation of ./Object/frameobject.c : PyFrame_BlockSetup and ./Object/frameobject.c : PyFrame_BlockPop :
void PyFrame_BlockSetup( PyFrameObject *f , int type , int handler , int level ) { PyTryBlock * b ; if ( f-> f_iblock >= CO_MAXBLOCKS ) Py_FatalError ( " XXX block stack overflow " ) ; b = &f->f_blockstack[f->f_iblock ++ ] ; b-> b_type = type ; b-> b_level = level ; b-> b_handler = handler ; } PyTryBlock * PyFrame_BlockPop( PyFrameObject * f ) { PyTryBlock * b ; if ( f-> f_iblock <= 0 ) Py_FatalError ( " XXX block stack underflow " ) ; b = &f->f_blockstack[--f-> f_iblock ] ; return b; }
There , now you ’re smart .
If you keep the terminology straight , f_blockstack turns out to be rather simple , at least in my book .
We ’re left with the rather esoteric fields , some simpler , some a bit more arcane .
In the ‘ simpler ’ range we have f_lasti , an integer offset into the bytecode of the last instructions executed ( initialized to - 1 , i.e. , we did n’t execute any instruction yet ) .
This index lets us iterate over the opcodes in the bytecode stream .
Heading towards the ‘ more arcane ’ area we see f_trace and f_lineno .
f_trace is a pointer to a tracing function ( see sys.settrace ; think implementation of a tracer or a debugger ) .
f_lineno contains the line number of the line which caused the generation of the current opcode ; it is valid only when tracing ( otherwise use PyCode_Addr2 Line ) .
Last but not least , we have three exception fields ( f_exc_type , f_exc_value and f_exc_traceback ) , which are rather particular to generators so we ’ll discuss them when we discuss that beast ( there ’s a longer comment about these fields in ./ Include / frameobject.h if you ’re curious right now ) .
On a parting note , we can mention when frames are created .
This happens in ./Objects/frameobject.c : PyFrame_New , usually called from ./ Python/ceval.c : PyEval_EvalCodeEx ( and ./ Python/ceval.c : fast_function , a specialized optimization of PyEval_EvalCodeEx ) .
Frame creation occurs whenever a code object should be evaluated , which is to say when a function is called , when a module is imported ( the module ’s top - level code is executed ) , whenever a class is defined , for every discrete command entered in the interactive interpreter , when the builtins eval or exec are used and when the -c switch is used ( I did n’t absolutely verify this is a 100 % exhaustive list , but it think it ’s rather complete ) .
Looking at the list in the previous paragraph , you probably realized frames are created very often , so two optimizations are implemented to make frame creation fast : first , code objects have a field ( co_zombieframe ) which allows them to remain associated with a ‘ zombie ’ ( dead , unused ) frame object even when they ’re not evaluated .
If a code object was already evaluated once , chances are it will have a zombie frame ready to be reanimated by PyFrame_New and returned instead of a newly allocated frame ( trading some memory to reduce the number of allocations ) .
Second , allocated and entirely unused stack frames are kept in a special free - list ( ./Objects/frameobject.c : free_list ) , frames from this list will be used if possible , instead of actually allocating a brand new frame .
This is all kindly commented in ./Objects/frameobject.c .
That ’s it , I think .
Oh , wait : if you ’d like to play with frames in your interpreter , take a look at the inspect module , maybe especially this part of it .
In gdb , I used a rather crude method to look at the call stack ( I dereferenced the global variable interp_head and went on from there ) .
There ’s probably a better way , but I did n’t bother looking .
Now that ’s really it .
In fact , I believe at last we covered enough material to analyze ./ Python/ceval.c : PyEval_EvalFrameEx .
Ladies and Gentlemen , we can read it .
We have the technology .
But , alas , we ’ll only do it in the next post , and who knows when that will arrive .
And until it does , do good , avoid doing bad and keep clearing your mind .
Siddhārtha Gautama said that , and I tend to think that if that particular bloke lived today he ’d have some serious Python - Fu going for him , so heed his words .
I would like to thank Nick Coghlan for reviewing this article ; any mistakes that slipped through are my own .
LAS VEGAS – A hacker group known as the Ninjas has created what may be the best DefCon badge ever .
The badge allows wireless ninja battle between badge holders .
Unlike the official badge , attendees can't buy this one : it 's free .
DefCon , the world 's largest hacker convention , is more than just a group of hackers getting together to exchange the latest exploit code and hacking techniques .
It 's a time for hackers who may only see one another once a year , to socialize face to face .
One of the most exclusive venues for fraternizing at DefCon is the Ninja party .
To attend the party attendees have to know one of the Ninjas and they have to give them a badge .
In years past , a Ninja would give a party attendee a sticker or a paper invite that would get them in to the party .
Last year the Ninjas took the party invite to the next level when they created their own custom badge for their party attendees .
This year , badge designers Amanda Wozniak and Brandon Creighton decided to take the badge to the next level , and then some .
What started as a sketch on a napkin ended up as an amazing hacker gaming and development platform .
The DefCon 18 Ninja Networks badge is an interactive wireless game system , consisting of role - playing style Ninja battles .
The badge shows a list of other badges within range and allows the badge holder to fight them .
Every time players fight , they gain experience points , making them more powerful .
The badge has a column of LEDs with the same color coding as World of Warcraft items .
The players receive virtual items by completing missions in various locations around DefCon and Las Vegas .
The badge transmits stats intermittently to a number of Android - badge - powered base stations hidden around the convention .
A leader board at the convention shows current scores .
The badges also interact wirelessly with other undisclosed devices at the convention and in addition to ninjas the badge also contains a pirate .
This year 's badge also addresses the recurring problem of party attendees heading in and out of the party with two badges and bringing in uninvited guests .
The wireless badge checks in when attendees enter or leave the party , and a black - badge holder can grant a +1 guest .
The badges were designed , programmed , manufactured and assembled in the United States .
To offset the high cost of the badges and the party that serves free alcohol , the badges were sponsored by Facebook and Lookout .
When the photos were taken last weekend , the badge software was still being tested .
See below for more photos of the badge , software and manual .
The DefCon 18 Ninja Networks badge on the left is clearly leaps and bounds ahead of the the previous year 's badge , which was impressive for a badge permitting entry to a free party .
The badge comes with a booklet that is a near - perfect replica of a Nintendo video game manual .
The badge 's LCD display connects to an Arduino for graphics testing .
The back of the badge lists the creators and sponsors and contains hidden messages .
The badge comes in a fancy box with an instruction booklet , battery and lanyard .
The badge is wired in to an Android phone running custom software that passively collects player 's scores and uploads them to the leader board display .
With the LCD removed the processor , shift - registers and handily placed and labeled test and debugging points can be seen .
Note the headers on the lower left for easily attaching a programming cable .
Creators used an iPhone app to test gameplay while the badges were being built .
This screen shows the general stats of a player 's ninja .
The enemy list shows nearby ninjas a player can choose to fight .
During the fight , stats are displayed onscreen .
Page 1 of the instruction manual warns the badge holder that the badge they have is wireless and talks to other badges .
Page 2 shows a quick - start guide .
Page 3 of the manual explains the controls of the badge .

It 's game engines as art , innit ?
In a week where Red Dead Redemption proved its sales dominance throughout the summer , with DLC announcements just yesterday , Digital Foundry set about completing its own RDR project : the world created by Rockstar San Diego , displayed via the beauty of time - lapse video .
Although based on the same RAGE engine as GTA IV with plenty of commonalities and parallels , it 's clear that Red Dead Redemption stands apart as a distinct technical and artistic achievement in itself : the attention to detail in what is basically a barren wasteland is simply phenomenal , and the scale of the game 's vistas is hugely impressive .
It 's almost as if the draw distance goes on forever : compare and contrast to the pared - back , fog - shrouded GTA IV environments in the far distance .
However , similar to GTA IV , the use of lighting and shadow is key to the overall effect of the game and in this respect , the time - lapse shows just how much care and attention has gone into this .
The whole scene is realistically lit from the major light source ( the sun ) with what looks like two animated 3D layers of clouds backed by a larger , inanimate rotating layer .
Lighting seems to filter accurately through each element before bathing the environment realistically .
More than that , an extra level of immersion is lent to the lighting via the use of hazing that increases as you move from foreground to background , and this too is affected by the time of day .
The scenes themselves benefit from some really high quality dynamic shadows ( in the vista mode we used to get these shots anyway ) , backed by ambient occlusion baked into the environments .
Water is beautifully brought to life , but again also realistic in that it accurately reflects the surrounding environments plus the overhead cloud layer .
The animation itself is pretty basic ( perhaps just a couple of normal maps ) , but the transition into the land is seamless , sealing the deal .
The overall sensation is simply breathtaking .
Putting this video together required ... patience .
A full 24 - hour cycle in - game amounts to an hour of real time , but you need to record more than that to ensure you get a full uninterrupted capture of the crucial dawn and sunset periods .
As just one minute of HD capture footage usually weighs in at over 1GB , we opted to capture at just one frame per second , massively reducing the space requirement and requiring so little CPU that the workstation could be used for other things at the same time .
49 shots were taken in total , with 39 making their way into the final edit .
These captures were then sped up to run at 120 FPS in order to get the accelerated effect seen in the completed video .
Getting a HUD - less , solid , first - person viewpoint is usually a challenge too .
Red Dead Redemption made the job easier for us with its in - built " afk " mode .
Leave the controller alone for a few minutes and the game pops up a pre-defined vista view .
They do n't seem to be random , giving the impression that these viewpoints were added , chosen by the creators , as the maps were put together .
A lovely assist from the developers then , though the option to choose our own shots would 've been helpful !
There 's also the sense that this " vista mode " was designed as more than just a throwaway addition , it was a showcase for the engine and for the phenomenal world the Rockstar San Diego team created .
View distances are of course immense , but also shadowmap detail in this mode is consistently high , whereas in - game a more dynamic LOD system seems to be in place .
Fine as the final time - lapse video is embedded into this page , the final 720p60 asset sitting on our hard drives is better still .
So we 've created a master version , encoded into h264 and playable on PS3 , Xbox 360 and computer ( so long as you have the requisite decoder ) .
And we 've mirrored it across the board elsewhere .

The Phantom Leaf Phenomenon
A Kirlian photo of a complete leaf .
After all but the stem is torn away , and the leaf is Kirlian photographed again , the destroyed portion still appears .
KIRLIAN PHOTOGRAPHY is a special form of imaging that some believe may be able to photograph the energy field of a person or object .
Kirlian photographs are made by passing a brief electrical current through the subject while the subject is in direct contact with a photographic plate .
The prints show a fiery aura of light around the specimen ; a coronal discharge .
Some believe these energy fields are usually too subtle to be photographed .
However , the additional electrical current enhances the field , making it photographically visible ( in addition to the corona produced by the artificial current ) .
If one photographs a leaf , the developed print shows an aura of light around it .
However , if a portion of the leaf is torn away , and the entire leaf is photographed again , the destroyed portion will sometimes still appear !
This is known as the phantom leaf phenomenon , and it�s a controversial issue .
It may prove that an energy body exists even after the physical body is destroyed , hence the existence of some ghosts .
This might explain why most people can still feel a limb after an amputation .
Those who deny the phenomenon say it�s the product of incompetent photographers .
Over the past year , the L.E.M.U.R. team has been experimenting with Kirlian photography .
At times , the results have been astounding !

More women in the developed world are choosing not to have children .
So why do friends , family , colleagues and even strangers think it 's OK to question their decision ?
We 've come a long way , baby .
Until a few decades ago , it was widely assumed that a woman would marry and , soon after , the stork would arrive with a special delivery .
Today , there are many more choices - or more openness .
To have a baby out of wedlock .
To have a baby without a father .
To have a baby and return to work .
To have a baby and give up work .
To have fertility treatment , and then a baby ( or not ) .
Find out more Woman 's Hour on Radio 4 had a child - free by choice special on Wednesday 28 July
And a phone - in on Thursday 29 July Catch up with the iPlayer
But what about not becoming a mother at all ?
Studies in the UK , Europe and the United States show this is now the choice of significant numbers of women .
Once this was considered insane or unnatural .
Even today , it is viewed with suspicion - women with no desire to procreate say they sometimes face awkward questions and disapproval .
" A woman at work was recently quite shocked by my saying I did n't want children .
She said : ' You 're a woman , you were born with a womb , God gave a womb so we could procreate ' , " Jenny , aged 25 , told BBC Radio 4's Woman 's Hour .
" My friends and I have occasionally likened coming out as child - free to coming out as a gay person 40 or 50 years ago .
There 's the same sense of shock - perhaps that 's too strong a word .
But it 's a lifestyle people do n't expect and it may challenge their world view , " says 31 - year - old Rhona Sweeting .
Sociologist Dr Catherine Hakim , of the London School of Economics , has studied voluntary childlessness in the UK and Europe for many years .
She says this is a new social phenomenon , with women now open and positive about such a lifestyle choice .
" An early study in Canada years ago found roughly half of all the women who were childless in their 40s actually chose to be that way from a very early age .
" But very many of them did n't say so because of the social pressure they would get if they mentioned a preference for staying childless .
Maybe not baby
One in five UK women will not have children , many by choice
Among female graduates , this rises to one in three according to some studies
Teenage single mums are becoming biggest social group giving birth in the UK
Infertility affects 2 - 3 % of women globally , says the UN
US Census Bureau says 36 % of American women have no children Advice on step - family life from BBC Health
" The contraceptive revolution has completely changed perspectives .
Whereas before having children just inevitably happened to all people who got married or had sex , now it 's something you have to make a choice about . "
And the disapproval some experience ?
" It 's a question of generations and age .
There was a stigma in the past . "
But suspicion of childless women has n't entirely disappeared .
Julia Wallace , at 40 a step - mother to three children who live elsewhere , says she is questioned about why she has no baby of her own .
" They say , ' you do n't know what you 're missing , you wo n't know until you 've had a child that that 's what you wanted to do ' .
That 's a hypothetical question - if you 've got no motivation to have a child in the first place , why would you do it ?
I would n't chose to become a nurse on the chance I might love the career once I get there . "
Image copyright Other Image caption Forgotten something ?
Actually , no
Natalie Haynes , 35 , has been with her partner for four years and has never dreamed of the pitter - patter of little feet .
" My parents are very well trained [ not to ask ] .
I worked hard at school and at college , then I ran away and became a comedian - that worked out , so they 've already won the lottery .
I think my mum might like grandchildren , but I have a brother and it's his problem . "
But not everyone is as breezy about their decision as Natalie .
Beth Follini counsels women agonising over whether to reproduce .
It 's a decision she herself has struggled with .
Until her early 30s , she had n't wanted children and told her partner so .
" Then I just started to feel this urge .
I spent a year or two battling it out and in the end I decided I wanted a child .
But I know that if I had n't , I would have a very different but equally fulfilled life . "
Many of her clients do not want children but feel pressurised .
" Often this pressure comes from friends who have had children - ' you do n't know what you 're missing ' or ' you 'd make a great mum ' .
Or joking that you hate children .
Sometimes it 's from parents hoping for a grandchild . "
But it can be the most passing of acquaintances who pass comment .
" Many people assume if you a single and child - free that you have n't met the right man yet .
But if you are in a relationship , they ask ' when are you taking the next step ? '
A woman 's fertility status is still very much considered public property .
There are still assumptions about women 's role in society , about families and about family size . "

To work or not ?
Mothers also find everyone has an opinion on their choices
Lisa Davies , 38 , says the assumption is often that she cannot have a baby .
" What I 'm unhappy about is people looking at me and speaking to me - very often unashamedly - as if there is something wrong with me .
As with other choices that you make , the key is it 's not for everyone . "
In the United States , New Yorker Melanie Notkin , founder of the Savvy Auntie website , wants a national day to celebrate child - free women who are loving aunts or godmothers .
" It would be a chance for these women to feel whole , for everything that they are , instead of having to focus on all the things they 're not - ie mothers . "
She says modern families need extra hands .
" Mothers and fathers are working overtime .
So an aunt who is able to give quality time to the family , especially to the children , is very welcome . "

Just a day before Microsoft Corp. drops support for Windows XP Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) , the company announced on Monday that people running some versions of Windows 7 can " downgrade " to the aged operating system for up to 10 years .
The move is highly unusual .
In the past , Microsoft has terminated downgrade rights -- which let customers replace a newer version of Windows with an older edition without paying for two copies -- within months of introducing a new operating system .
While few consumers may want to downgrade from Windows 7 to XP -- unlike when many mutinied against Vista three years ago -- businesses often want to standardize on a single operating system to simplify machine management .
Monday 's announcement was the second Windows XP downgrade rights extension .
Microsoft originally limited Windows 7 - to - Windows XP downgrades to six months after Windows 7's release , but it backtracked in June 2009 after a Gartner Inc. analyst called the plan a " real mess . "
Instead , Microsoft later said it would allow downgrades to Windows XP until 18 months after the October 2009 debut of Windows 7 , or until it released Windows 7 SP1 .
In either scenario , XP downgrade rights would have expired sometime in 2011 , perhaps as early as April .
On Monday , Microsoft again changed its mind .
Users running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate will now be able to downgrade to Windows XP Professional throughout the entire life cycle of Windows 7 .
" Our business customers have told us that the removing end - user downgrade rights to Windows XP Professional could be confusing , " said Microsoft spokesman Brandon LeBlanc , in an entry on the company blog .
Windows 7
Professional wo n't be fully retired until January 2020 ; the Ultimate edition will be put out to pasture five years earlier , in January 2015 .
Although Microsoft said it made the change to simplify the work in tracking licensing rights for PCs , the continued popularity of Windows XP may have had something to do with it .
At Microsoft 's Worldwide Partner Conference ( WPC ) , which opened Monday in Washington , D.C. , a company executive acknowledged that 74 % of business computers still run XP .
The downgrade rights are available only from OEM copies of Windows 7 , those that are pre-installed by computer makers .
The world is an idiot .
Last week , it completely snubbed one of the greatest records set in baseball -- Jamie Moyer 's unprecedented 506th home run dished up .
" We just thought it was a dubious record that Jamie would rather ignore , " a Phillies executive said .
Ignore it ?
Are you nuts ?
Celebrate it !
Bronze it !
Throw it a parade !
The game should have been stopped and Moyer handed a live gopher !
A phone that dials only room service !
A car made of meat !
The Phillies now have the two greatest yard salesmen in MLB history -- Moyer and Hall of Famer Robin Roberts .
Do you have any idea how good you have to be to get this record ?
They should 've given Moyer 506 bells that ding , 506 taters , 506 baseballs to replace the ones he lost !
This is not an albatross !
This is an achievement !
Look , can you tell me which NFL quarterback was sacked the most all - time ?
John Elway ( 516 ) .
Most interceptions thrown ?
Brett Favre ( 317 ) .
Most shots missed in NBA history ?
John Havlicek ( 13,417 ) .
Most second - place finishes in a golf major ?
Jack Nicklaus ( 19 ) .
Most times losing in a major tennis final ?
Ivan Lendl ( 11 ) .
Do n't you see ?
To be historically bad , you have to be historically great !
To be able to give up more home runs than anybody in history , they have to keep handing you the ball .
You 're that good .
You hand out more bombs than Raytheon , but they do n't care .
They still give you the ball and point you toward that hill .
They want you on that hill .
" The way I look at it , " said Moyer , 47 ( not a misprint ) , " there 's two pitchers in the 500 - home - run - given - up club , me and Robin .
There 's what , 25 guys in the 500 - home - run - hit club ?
But there 's only Robin and I in this one .
That 's way more elite . "
That 's the spirit !
People should be writing songs about Moyer !
Like this :
Moyer Long Balls

This is epic .
I know former major league pitchers who would sell their sister to Afghan rebels to have this record .
Roberts held The Silver Platter record for 52 years , 321 days .
That 's longer than Babe Ruth held the home run record -- 52 years , 284 days , according to the Elias Sports Bureau .
This is n't dubious .
It 's distinctive !
It 's glorious !
Somebody needs to put up a statue of him !
Maybe in the right - field stands ?
That a guy like Moyer has lasted long enough in the game to own it is unthinkable , is n't it ?
A guy who can hardly make the radar gun light up ?
Who was released four times in his career ?
Who gums hitters to death ?
And yet is having -- yet again -- one of his best years ?
Considering the man pitched through the entire steroids era , 506 is laughably low .
And yet he survived .
This is a man who 's pitched more than 4,000 innings now .
When he was born , John F. Kennedy was president !
He 's been throwing baseballs pretty much nonstop ever since .
Do you have any idea how much Cramer Red Hot that is ?
" I do n't watch them go around , " said Moyer .
" They can have their 15 seconds of glory . "
" Well , of the 506 , it 's not like there 's one I wanted to happen .
But I 've faced some great hitters in my life .
They 're supposed to hit home runs .
They get paid to do that .
I used to kid [ Ken ] Griffey [ Jr. ] that he never hit one off me .
He always said he did .
We made a bet .
He said he was going to look it up , but he never did , so I still do n't know . "
He did .
April 29 , 1994 , in Baltimore .
" I do n't watch them go around , " Moyer said .
" They can have their 15 seconds of glory .
I guess it 's a good feeling .
I would n't know .
I 've never hit one . "
Never ?
" Hit just above the double doors in left - center at Wrigley once , but that 's it . "
That 's like owning the world 's largest pizzeria and never having a slice .
Anyway , the point is , marvel at the Superkid , Stephen Strasburg , but marvel at Jamie Moyer , too .
Because if Strasburg is still pitching like Moyer at 47 , I 'll eat a gopher .
1. Cecil ( one homer off Moyer ) and Prince Fielder ( two homers off Moyer )
2. Darryl Strawberry hit his only homer off Moyer in 1988 .
3. The Chicago White Sox 's Frank Thomas touched Moyer for six .
The all - time leader is Manny Ramirez with 10 .
Both are Hall of Famers .
The Angels have the team lead ( 45 ) .
4. Alex Rodriguez ( six )
5. Lenny Dykstra ( one )
6. Rex Hudler ( three ) , Kenny Lofton ( three )
7 . But not one to a pitcher !
8 . Just think how long this guy has been around !
These guys hit the first five home runs he gave up in the bigs : Juan Samuel , Schmidt , Mookie Wilson , Keith Hernandez and Barry Bonds .
Hell , Wilson has been out of the league for 19 years !
9 . Guess who holds the record for most double plays hit into ?
Ripken , with 350 .
10 . Five
11 . Besides the aforementioned Fielders , the Penas -- Tony Sr. and Jr. -- each contributed to the list .
12 . Bengie ( four ) and Jose ( one ) Molina .
13 . Moyer - feasters who 've been linked to performance - enhancing drug use : Mark McGwire ( two ) , Barry Bonds ( five ) , Jose Canseco ( one ) , Gary Sheffield ( four ) , Rafael Palmeiro ( five ) .
14 .
But at no higher percentage than most MLB pitchers .
Moyer averages 1.1 homer per nine innings pitched , in about the same ballpark as Johnny Podres , Cliff Lee and Curt Schilling .

Clean energy investments show resilience in recession ;
Share of renewable energy continues to grow ; Growth of wind power in China a key feature of 2009 .
In 2009 , for the second year in a row , both the US and Europe generated more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind farm and solar than from conventional sources like coal , gas and nuclear , according to twin reports launched today by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century ( REN21 ) .
Renewables accounted for 60 per cent of newly installed capacity in Europe and more than 50 per cent in the USA in 2009 .
This year or next , experts predict , the world as a whole will add more capacity to the electricity supply from renewable than non-renewable sources .
The reports detail trends in the global green energy sector , including which sources attracted the greatest attention from investors and governments in different world regions .
Investment in core clean energy ( new renewables , biofuels and energy efficiency ) decreased by 7 % in 2009 to the value of $ 162 billion .
Many sub-sectors declined significantly in money invested , including large ( utility ) scale solar power and biofuels .
However , there was record investment in wind power .
If spending on solar water heaters , as well as total installation costs for rooftop solar photovoltaic , were included , total investment in 2009 actually increased in 2009 , bucking the economic trend .
New private and public sector investments in core clean energy leapt 53 per cent in China in 2009 .
China added 37 gigawatts ( GW ) of renewable power capacity , more than any other country , mainly wind turbines .
Globally , nearly 80 GW of renewable power capacity was added , including 31 GW of hydro and 48 GW of non -hydro capacity .
China surpassed the US in 2009 as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy .
China ’s wind farm development was the strongest investment feature of the year by far , although there were other areas of strength worldwide in 2009 , notably North Sea offshore wind investment and the financing of power storage and electric vehicle technology companies .
Wind power and solar PV additions reached a record high of 38 GW and 7 GW , respectively .
Investment totals in utility - scale solar PV declined relative to 2008 , partly a result of large drops in the costs of solar PV .
However , this decline was offset by record investment in small - scale ( rooftop ) solar PV projects .
The reports also show that countries with policies encouraging renewable energy have roughly doubled from 55 in 2005 to more than 100 today – half of them in the developing world – and have played a critically important role in the sector ’s rapid growth .
The sister reports , UNEP ’s Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2010 and the REN21 ’s Renewables 2010 Global Status Report , were released by UN Under - Secretary - General Achim Steiner , UNEP ’s Executive Director , and Mohamed El - Ashry , Chair of REN21 .
The UNEP report was prepared by London - based Bloomberg New Energy Finance .
The REN21 report was produced by a team of authors in collaboration with a global network of research partners .
The UNEP report focuses on the global trends in sustainable energy investment , covering both the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors .
The REN21 report offers a broad look at the status of renewable energy worldwide today , covering power regeneration , heating and cooling and transport fuels , and paints the landscape of policies and targets introduced around the world to promote renewable energy .
Achim Steiner said : " The sustainable energy investment story of 2009 was one of resilience , frustration and determination .
Resilience to the financial downturn that was hitting all sectors of the global economy and frustration that , while the UN climate convention meeting in Copenhagen was not the big breakdown that might have occurred , neither was it the big breakthrough so many had hoped for .
Yet there was determination on the part of many industry actors and governments , especially in rapidly developing economies , to transform the financial and economic crisis into an opportunity for greener growth . "
" There remains , however , a serious gap between the ambition and the science in terms of where the world needs to be in 2020 to avoid dangerous climate change .
But what this five years of research underlines is that this gap is not unbridgeable .
Indeed , renewable energy is consistently and persistently bucking the trends and can play its part in realizing a low carbon , resource efficient Green Economy if government policy sends ever harder market signals to investors , " he added .
Mohamed El - Ashry said , " Favorable policies now in place in more than 100 countries have played a critical role in the strength of global renewable energy investments recently .
For the upward trend of renewable energy growth to continue , policy efforts now need to be taken to the next level and encourage a massive scale up of renewable technologies . "
Says Michael Liebreich , chief executive of Bloomberg New Energy Finance : " The relatively resilient performance of the sector during the current economic downturn shows that clean energy was not a bubble created by the late stages of the credit boom , but is instead an investment theme that will remain important for the years ahead . "
By the numbers :
In 2009 renewable sources represented :
25 per cent of global power ( electricity ) capacity ( 1,230 gigawatts ( GW ) out of 4,800 GW total all sources , including coal , gas , nuclear )
18 per cent of global power production
60 per cent of newly installed power capacity in Europe and more than 50 per cent in the US ; the world as a whole should reach 50 per cent or more in newly - installed power capacity from renewables in 2010 or 2011
Major highlights ,
UNEP Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative and REN21 reports
For the first time , private sector green energy investments in Asia and Oceania , some $ 40.8 billion in 2009 , exceeded that in the Americas , at $ 32.3 billion .
Private sector investment in Europe was down 10 percent at $ 43.7 billion .
Major economies in 2009 began to spend some of the estimated $ 188 billion in global " green stimulus " programs announced in September 2008 .
However , at the end of 2009 , only 9 percent of the money had been spent , with larger proportions expected to flow in 2010 and 2011 .
After a weak first quarter attributed to the banking crisis , sustainable energy investments rebounded in the final three quarters of last year .
The new investment total of $ 162 billion in 2009 represented the second highest annual figure ever ( after 2008 ) – nearly quadruple the sum invested in 2004 .
New investment of $ 162 billion has added an estimated 50 gigawatts ( GW ) of renewable energy generation capacity worldwide ( not including hydro- electric ) .
This represents a sharp rise from the 40GW added in 2008 .
Fifty GW is roughly the output of 75 coal - fired power plants .
Looking forward
The green power sector survived the economic downturn better than many expected , with share prices rising almost 40 % in 2009 , reversing roughly one third of losses experienced in 2008 .
Clean energy share prices under - performed wider stock markets by around 10 percent in the first four months of 2010 .
Although oil prices were buoyant , prices of electricity and natural gas stayed low , cramping returns for project developers .
Nevertheless , new clean energy investments in the first quarter of 2010 ( often the most subdued quarter of the year ) were up more than 50 percent on the same three months of 2009 .
Sector Highlights
From 2005 to 2009 inclusive , the annual average rate of growth in wind power capacity was 27 percent ; solar hot water 21 percent rate ; ethanol production 20 percent and biodiesel production 51 percent .
The use of biomass and geothermal for power and heat also grew strongly .
Wind Energy
Wind farm was even more dominant as a destination for investment in 2009 than 2008 .
In 2008 , it accounted for $ 59 billion or 45 percent of all financial investment in sustainable energy ; in 2009 , it accounted for $ 67 billion and its share rose to 56 percent .
Wind power additions reached a record high of 38 GW , 13.8 GW of which was installed in China , 10 GW in the US , and 2.5 GW in Spain .
Wind power existed in just a handful of countries in the 1990s , but now exists in over 82 countries .
Solar
Total global investment in solar PV reached a record $ 40 billion in 2009 .
Grid-connected solar power has grown by an average of 60 percent every year for the past decade , from 0.2 GW at the start of 2000 to 21 GW at the end of 2009 .
The year 2009 was very different for large - scale ( utility - scale ) solar however , suffering a 27 percent fall in financial investment in the year , to $ 24 billion .
The sharp decline links to several factors , including falling prices , a sudden over - supply of photo - voltaic products , new caution on the part of investors towards equity in young solar companies , a shortage of bank financing for projects in Europe and North America and a temporary freeze on permits for new capacity in Spain , the most active solar market in 2008 .
Solar PV additions nevertheless reached a record high of 7 GW in 2009 .
Germany was the top market , with 3.8 GW added , or more than half the global market .
Other large markets were Italy , Japan , the United States , the Czech Republic , and Belgium .
Spain , the world leader in 2008 , saw installations plunge to a low level in 2009 after a policy cap was exceeded .
In 2009 , China produced 40 percent of the world ’s solar PV supply , 25 percent of the world ’s wind turbines ( up from 10 percent in 2007 ) , and 77 percent of the world ’s solar hot water collectors .
Power produced by solar PV dropped in price some 50 to 60 percent by some estimates – from highs of $ 3.50 per watt in mid-2008 , to lows approaching $ 2 per watt .
An estimated 70 million households worldwide now employ solar hot water heating .
Biofuels
Biofuels , which ranked third after wind and solar in 2008 with $ 18 billion of financial investment , ended up fourth last year with just $ 7 billion .
Biomass and waste - to - energy , which was fourth in 2008 with $ 9 billion , moved up to third in 2009 with $ 11 billion .
Biofuels displaced the energy equivalent of 8 percent of global gasoline consumption .
Latin America is seeing many new biofuels producers in countries like Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru , as well as expansion in many other renewable technologies .
Investment in new biofuels plants also declined from 2008 rates , as corn ethanol production capacity was not fully utilized in the United States and several firms went bankrupt .
The Brazilian sugar ethanol industry likewise faced economic troubles , with no growth despite ongoing expansion plans .
Europe faced similar softening in biodiesel , with production capacity only half utilized .
Geothermal
Geothermal suffered a 29 percent drop in financial investment in 2009 , to $ 2 billion ,
Energy efficiency
Energy - smart technologies such as power storage and efficiency saw a 34 percent rise in investment , to $ 4 billion .
For the first time , energy - smart technologies attracted more venture capital and private equity investment than any other clean energy sector .
* * * * *
Regional highlights
* Europe maintained its position as the world region with the largest share of global financial investment in clean energy – but only just .
Its total came in at $ 43.7 billion , down from $ 48.4 billion in 2008 .
* Asia and Oceania produced a sharp increase in financial investment in 2009 , to $ 40.8 billion from $ 31.3 billion .
India is fifth worldwide in total existing wind power capacity and is rapidly expanding many forms of rural renewables such as biogas and solar PV .
* North America suffered a fall in investment , to $ 20.7 billion from $ 33.3 billion
* Middle East and Africa enjoyed a modest increase to $ 2.5 billion in 2009 , from $ 2.1 billion .
* South America saw investment slip to $ 11.6 billion from $ 14.6 billion .
Brazil produces virtually all of the world ’s sugar - derived ethanol and has been adding new biomass and wind power plants .
Public policy : fueling the rapid growth of renewables
A significant milestone was reached in early 2010 – more than 100 countries had enacted some type of policy target and / or promotion policy related to renewable energy , up from 55 countries in early 2005 .
Many new targets enacted in the past three years call for shares of energy or electricity from renewables in the 15 - 25 percent range by 2020 .
Most countries have adopted more than one promotion policy , and there is a huge diversity of policies in place at national , state / provincial , and local levels .
Manufacturing leadership is shifting from Europe to Asia , as countries like China , India , and South Korea continue to increase their commitments to renewable energy .
As a group , developing countries have more than half of global renewable power capacity .
Developing countries now make up nearly half of all countries with policy targets ( 38 out of 80 countries ) and also make up half of all countries with some type of renewable energy promotion policy ( 41 out of 81 countries ) .
Markets for renewables are growing at rapid rates in countries such as Argentina , Costa Rica , Egypt , Indonesia , Kenya , Tanzania , Thailand , Tunisia , and Uruguay , to name a few .
At least 20 countries in the Middle East , North Africa , and sub-Saharan Africa have active renewable energy markets .
Outside of Europe and the United States , other developed countries like Australia , Canada , and Japan are seeing recent gains and broader technology diversification .
Globally , renewable energy industries employ an estimated 3 million people directly , about half of them in the biofuel industry , with additional indirect jobs well beyond this figure .
Both within and outside of Europe , public - sector banks like the European Investment Bank and Germany ’s KfW have been taking an expanding role , including in many emerging markets like Brazil .
Another force propelling renewables in developing countries is the huge increase in development assistance flows .
Such flows jumped to over $ 5 billion in 2009 , compared with some $ 2 billion in 2008 .
The largest providers are the World Bank Group , Germany ’s KfW , the Inter - American Development Bank , and the Asian Development Bank .
Dozens of other development agencies provide growing amounts of loans , grants , and technical assistance .
Public support for sustainable energy remained high in most countries but action to curb emissions dropped as a priority for some voters due to the recession , controversies over climate science last winter and cold winter weather that hit the most populated parts of the Northern Hemisphere .
By spring 2010 , the sector was facing fresh challenges as a second phase of the economic downturn developed , with governments running into pressure to cut their deficits and volatility returning to markets .

According to documentary film maker , James Fox , reporting from Louisiana , there is a massive media black out being perpetrated in the Gulf of Mexico BP Oil spill .
While that much may have seemed obvious to many , James says that people with cameras are being threatened with arrest , and locals are seriously afraid to talk .
The place is swarming with both government officials and corporate officials , and by the sounds of this interview it ’s a pretty scary situation .
SAGINAW —
They ’re angry and aim to peacefully show it at this week ’s “ Saginaw Freedom March , ” says a leader from the 15,000 - member Michigan Marijuana Association .
Joe Cain , chief executive officer for the Lansing based nonprofit that aims to “ empower Michigan ’s medical marijuana community , ” said Saginaw can expect to see 100 and potentially as many as 1,000 protesters outside the Saginaw County Courthouse when the rally commences at 11 a.m. Wednesday .
“ More and more people keep committing to me , ” Cain said .
“ They ’re setting up car pools to come out of Jackson County , we ’ve got people coming from all over the state — and probably all over the country . ”
Cain said the protest is a response to the third and latest raid of a registered medical marijuana patient and caretaker in Saginaw County .
The Drug Enforcement Agency , supported by Thomas Township police , raided the barn and home of John Roberts , 49 , and his fiancée ,
Stephanie Whisman , 38 ,
on July 6 .
Roberts had organized a protest at the courthouse on July 1 , which Cain and Michigan Medical Marijuana Association members believe was the impetus for the raid less than a week later .
Cain said the rally also is a protest against Saginaw County Sheriff
William L .
Federspiel
.
“ The only logical conclusion we can come to is that we dared challenge the sheriff , ” Cain said .
“ And if that ’s the case , it ’s a really sad day for democracy . ”
Federspiel said he had nothing to do with the DEA raid , although his agency previously raided Roberts ’ home with DEA agents April 15 , at which time no arrests were made but plant samples and harvested marijuana was seized .
“ I can assure you that that ’s the last thing in my mind , interfering with people ’s free speech , ” Federspiel said .
“ I never want to interfere with anybody ’s free speech .
I welcome them . ”
The growing equipment , which Robert ’s said is worth $ 10,000 ; marijuana - based medicine for 10 patients , whom Roberts and Whisman are
caretakers for ; and
plants were seized July 6 .
“ There ’s not a lot we can comment on , other than confirm that marijuana was seized at that address , ” said DEA Spokesman Special Agent Rich Isaacson .
“ No one was arrested at that time but the investigation is ongoing . ”
“ The DEA uses our resources to target what we consider ... large - scale drug trafficking groups , ” Isaacson said .
“ In regards to medical marijuana , in the federal government ’s eyes , there is no legitimate medical use .
That being said , we ’re not using our resources to target individuals that are following state law . ”
He went on to say hundreds of plants would be considered a large operation .
Regjeringen regnet med at prosjektet ville koste 2,3 milliarder kroner da vedtaket om flytting ble gjort i januar 2008 .
Nå viser tall som Statsbygg har lagt fram for Veterinærforeningen at budsjettet sprekker med en milliard .
Verne matjord
Grunnen skal være svært store kostnader til riving av eksisterende bygninger for å verne matjord , skriver Nationen .
Veterinærforeningen mener prosjektet med å flytte skolen fra Oslo til Ås er over 50 prosent dyrere enn planlagt .
– Tallene kommer fra kalkyler Statsbygg la fram for interimsstyret til Veterinærhøgskolen i vinter .
Jeg har sett beregninger på 4 milliarder kroner , sier president Marie Modal i Veterinærforeningen .
Foreningen var negativ til flytteplanene allerede i 2008 og advarte mot at prosjektet ville bli dyrere enn ventet .
Lekve sier kostnadsrammene ikke er fastsatt .

Ikke satt av penger
Et alternativ med å beholde utdanningen i Oslo ville ha kostet 1.145 millioner kroner , alts å under halvparten så mye som det opprinnelige budsjettet for flytting .
Stortinget har ennå ikke satt av penger til flyttingen .
– Kostnadsrammen er ikke endelig fastsatt .
Det blir ofte endringer i prislappen på slike prosjekter underveis .
Hvor mye det er snakk om kan jeg ikke kommentere , sier statssekretær Kyrre Lekve i Kunnskapsdepartementet .
Kjente ikke detaljene
Statsbygg tror ikke flytteprosjektet vil bli så mye som 50 prosent dyrere enn planlagt .
– Beregningen ble gjort i 2005 , så man må oppjustere verdien til 2010 - kroner .
Flyttingen vil bli noe dyrere fordi prosjektet har fått større omfang .
Man kjente ikke til alle detaljene i forhold til utvikling av Veterinærinstituttet og Senter fir husdyrforsøk i 2008 , sier Per Roar Nordby i Statsbygg .
Videre sier Nordby at de nå jobber for å få ned kostnadene samtidig som stortingsvedtaket åpner for en endring .

The almost - nine - minute mini-movie for M.I.A.'s single " Born Free " came out today and it 's already been taken down from YouTube in the U.S.
It 's definitely NSFW , but it 's also her latest attempt to drum up some attention .
First of all , the track kicks ass .
The Bed -Stuy by way of Sri Lanka musician takes a break from her usual hip - hop / world beat sound to make something that 's basically a hard - driving rock track — full of heavy guitar hooks and a driving , dismal beat — and adds her signature spoken - style lyrics .
How that fits into a video that 's about a ginger genocide complete with children being shot in the head and bodies blown up by landmines , well , we 're not quite sure .
As the video starts , a group of soldiers ransack an apartment building , bypassing an old man smoking crack and barging in on a couple having sex .
When the soldiers find a young man and start hauling him out of the building , it seems like it 's going to be another tired video about the brutality of war .
Then the young man is thrown into a bus and we see that it 's full of other red - headed young men .
Ah , a twist .
As the bus pulls away , some ginger militants can be seen throwing bottles at the bus in front of a mural that depicts red - headed men holding guns aloft .
When the bus arrives at its final destination , a dusty minefield , the military men tell the carrot tops to run across a minefield .
When they do n't budge , we see the officer in charge shoot what appears to be a 12 - year - old in the head at point blank range .
It is graphic and shocking .
As the men run across the field , the soldiers pursue both on foot and in an armored van while shooting at their prisoners .
One of the runners hits a mine and we see his body explode .
Finally the soldiers catch up with the initial man from the apartment building and they beat him , presumably to death .
There is no happy ending or redemption here .
The movie just ends .
M.I.A.'s video has already been pulled from YouTube for both its sexuality and violence , and she tried to kick start the controversy engine by blaming Universal Music Group for barring the video from YouTube , redirecting people to her website to watch .
( She soon recanted without further explanation . )
Controversy sells , though , and in these cases we often remember the stories around the videos long after we remember the songs or videos themselves .
Which might be why M.I.A. , who has a history of milking her violent past for attention , is courting it so closely .
Ironically , the video comes on the heels of an attention - grabbing interview in which M.I.A. blasted Lady Gaga — who can be thanked for the resurgence of 9 - minute video as an art form — for being a mimic rather than progressive .
M.I.A's sci - fi dystopian vision is certainly startling .
It can be seen as a comment on the senselessness of genocide or the state of immigration in the U.S. Closer to M.I.A.'s home , it can been viewed as an analogy to the Sri Lankan civil war and the government 's crackdown on the Tamil people , a subject she 's tackled — controversially — on numerous occasions and a cause she 's used her fame to draw attention to .
But she 's no longer the daughter of a penniless " freedom fighter " :
Her husband is Benjamin Brewer , the son of billionaire mogul ( and Warner Music chairman ) Edgar Bronfman , Jr .
Is the video too violent ?
Probably .
The imagery is not for the squeamish , and personally I 'd find it hard to watch that young boy get shot in the head again .
But it 's no worse that what one can see in most rated - R movies or even on some prime - time television shows ( 24 can be downright gory ! ) .
And is this little piece of entertainment — a music video , for heaven 's sake — worse than what the people who have actually survived immigration nightmares , police brutality , or genocide had to witness in their actual lives ?
Certainly not .
I can't fault any artist for creating something that 's designed to spur debate , but for those who do n't want their summer jams tainted by a helping of questionable - politics , it 's going to be a turn - off .
The world is full of many mysterious and spectacular animals , but our knowledge of the breadth and depth of nature 's diversity is scattered and fractured and fragmented .
The Aboriginal is fully aware of the great healing powers of the koala snout , whereas the posh businessman knows nothing of the sort .
The great hunters of the west have long known of a horse 's love for rare gems whereas in China they have for years attempted to lure them with precious metals without luck .

A friend of mine recently subscribed to XNA , and has started a pet project that will perhaps eventually result in a game being for sale among other Xbox Live Community Games .
I 've been pitching him ideas and scribbling up concept art in ms paint , and while doing so I had the idea that it would be amusing to make an animal fact book .
These I made when I was trying to convince him the game should be about bees and / or frogs .
And this I made just for the thread .
The idea is to ms paint an animal in its natural environment ( i.e. a field , the hood of your car on the freeway , etc ) along with a little - known factoid pertaining to said animal .

The happy man you see above is not the nine gazillionth owner of an iPad , but the Indian minister for HR Development , Kapil Sibal .
What he ’s holding in his hand is , he claims , a $ 35 tablet that will give the OLPC a run for its money .
It is , he told the press , “ our answer to MIT ’s $ 100 computer . ”
Developed by students and professors at India ’s tech universities –including the IITs of Madras and Bombay .
It ’s a Linux - based machine with videoconferencing , word processing and browsing capabilities , and has a solar - powered add - on .
The warning bells , however , ring when you hear that they are expecting the cost of the device to drop to $ 10 in a few years ’ time .
Was n’t that the price of last year ’s answer to the OLPC ?
Well , first of all , let ’s take the good stuff out of this piece of news .
Mr Sibal turned to his nation ’s bright sparks after Indian manufacturers refused to look at the project .
They rose to the challenge , with one student at VIT Vellore creating his own motherboard for the project , its PCB made at IIT Kanpur .
Total cost at this point was $ 47 – Mazel Tov and all that .
So , if it ’s a PR campaign to remind the world just how geeky some Indians are , well done fella .
However , we already know that India is one of the places to go for low - cost , mass - produced devices .
Tata , anyone ?
Perhaps it ’s a campaign to get big U.S. tech firms such as HP and Apple to start manufacturing their devices out there .
Fans of internecine nastiness might like to suggest it ’s a bit of political power play .
We know from a teardown of the iPad just how much its components cost to put the thing together–and that ’s $ 230 .
But let ’s not forget that its screen is a hi-tech IPS ( that ’s in - plane switching , the highest quality LCD you can get ) .
That alone costs $ 80 .
Now let ’s look at pricing guestimates for some other well - known and loved mobile device components .
A 4 - inch screen for the iPhone 3GS costs $ 16 .
8 GB of RAM costs around $ 15 .
Kindle ‘s 6 - inch e-ink screen ( the Indian tablet looks like a seven - incher to us ) costs $ 60 , and its PCB is $ 10 .
Throw in another $ 7.50 for your battery and you ’re suddenly looking rather over - budget .
Where has the bargain basement price come from ?
ISTANBUL —
The Turkish charity that led the flotilla involved in a deadly Israeli raid has extensive connections with Turkey ’s political elite , and the group ’s efforts to challenge Israel ’s blockade of Gaza received support at the top levels of the governing party , Turkish diplomats and government officials said .
The charity , the Humanitarian Relief Foundation , often called I.H.H. , has come under attack in Israel and the West for offering financial support to groups accused of terrorism .
But in Turkey the group has helped Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan shore up support from conservative Muslims ahead of critical elections next year and improve Turkey ’s standing and influence in the Arab world .
According to a senior Turkish official close to the government , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political delicacy of the issue , as many as 10 Parliament members from Mr. Erdogan ’s governing Justice and Development Party were considering boarding the Mavi Marmara , the ship where the deadly raid occurred , but were warned off at the last minute by senior Foreign Ministry officials concerned that their presence might escalate tensions too much .
When leaders of the charity returned home after nine Turks died in the Israeli raid , they were warmly embraced by top Turkish officials , said Huseyin Oruc , deputy director of the charity , who was aboard the flotilla .
Welcome to the first issue of The Irish Anarchist Review , the new political magazine from the Workers Solidarity Movement .
This magazine will explore ideas and practical struggles that can teach us about building a revolutionary movement today .
We decided to cease printing Red & Black Revolution , and start this project , aimed at provoking debate and discussion among anarchists and the left .
For this purpose , we will be pursuing a non-sectarian approach , taking ideas from various left currents , mainstream discourse , and reflections on experiences of life and struggle .
We will take , print , and discuss , anything that we find useful for our needs .
We hope that readers will have a similar attitude , and will use the magazine to discuss , debate and develop ideas .
We will also welcome submissions and responses to articles .
This issue is shaped by the current financial crisis , and more particularly , by the reactions of the Irish political and capitalist classes , as they pursue an aggressive strategy of cutbacks .
We have seen the implosion of the building sector , the foundering of the banks upon corruption and incompetence and the failure of our foreign investment based economic model .
Moreover , we have seen that the government response has been to protect the banks and builders by transferring wealth from social services , public pay and increased taxation straight into bank bailouts and NAMAland .
This needs to be identified for what it is : an act of outright class warfare .
We are faced with a situation where a strong and organised response to government attacks is absolutely necessary , but is constrained by the prevailing ideology and practice of partnership .
The most pressing concern for Irish radicals today is to build a labour movement that rejects the corporatist mentality and service - delivery model of ICTU and poses instead workers self - organisation as the basis for struggle .
With this in mind , this and future issues will look for inspiration in revitalising class - based politics .
The weakening of Irish organised labour through the ‘ Celtic Tiger ’ period is examined by James R ’s article , and he poses some requirements for the emergence of a class movement that can deal with the threats of the present while bearing a vision of a better future .
Andrew Flood looks at some of the positive elements of recent struggles , emphasising the possibilities for self - organisation and direct action made visible in the recent struggles .
We feature two articles that try to learn from the experiences of radicals internationally .
Ronan McAoidh reviews the work of Swedish group , Kämpa Tillsammans ! , which argues that affinity between workers , not just union organisation , is the basis of successful struggles .
An interview with Alex Foti explores organising tactics that try to deal with the growing trend of flexible working conditions .
The reviews also tie into this theme , assessing the development of an American working - class counter - culture and , by looking at workplace blogging , discussing some ways in which this can be done today .
Overall , this issue attempts to learn from the current weakness of the Irish working class , and explores both the origins of this weakness and some routes towards a combative class movement , capable of disrupting the ruling class offensive on living and working conditions and posing an altogether different vision of society , and , most importantly , a way of getting there .

Reflections on the 24th November
On the 24th of November something extraordinary happened .
Some 250,000 workers acted together in a day - long strike against the public sector wage cuts planned by the government .
The vast majority of these workers had never gone on strike before , yet across almost all workplaces the strike involved 90 % or more of those working .
Capitalist crisis and union resistance in Ireland
Late 2008 saw the Irish capitalist class wage a major ideological struggle against the Irish working class .
They called for workers to bear the brunt of the capitalist crisis .
Print media , TV and radio carried segment after segment where well - paid commentators argued that workers , in particular public sector workers , were earning too much , had overly generous pensions and that the public had unrealistic expectations of public services .
The usefulness of Faceless Resistance
Although Faceless Resistance as a concept has been discussed among radical circles in Sweden for several years , it has only recently begun to be noticed in the English speaking world , primarily due to delays in texts being translated .
In this article I will look primarily at the work of Kämpa Tillsammans , who developed the core ideas of Faceless Resistance , but I will also situate these ideas in their historical and social context and introduce other tendencies that have been influenced by and adapted some of the theory .
Mayday had become like a funeral - interview with Alex Foti
In the middle years of this decade , Alex Foti became known across activist circles for involvement in the Euromayday Parades .
In a special themed issue of Green Pepper , Foti and the Chain Workers Collective sketched a very attractive understanding of the work discipline of contemporary capitalism .
In their understanding , society had found itself in a situation of profound disjuncture with our working pasts - life today was defined by contingent employment rather than the traditional job for life .
The unions after the celtic tiger
A rather strange figure is moving to centre stage in Irish politics , that of the trade unions - absent from mass struggles until recently and weakened over the decades of social partnership , they are now the only possible source of a movement that can confront attemps to transfer the cost of the recession to working people .
This statement does not come with out some qualms .
Checkout : Life On The Tills
“ Anna Sam ” , as you might guess , is a pseud - onym , the handle of a French blogger who decided to put her years behind the till to good use on a website describing the day - to - day experience of supermarket workers in all its tedious glory .
In a way it ’s refreshing to discover that the psychology of the checkout girl / boy appears to be the same wherever you go - my own days at Centra and the like are well imprinted on the brain , but they could have been an atypical reflection of my general misanthropy , grumpiness and ill will towards the rest of the species .
Review : The IWW and The Making of a Revolutionary Working Class Counter culture
The book can be read in a number of ways ; on one hand it rescues the IWW from Stalinist critics that fashionably flounced after Russian Bolshevism ; it gives insight to the politics and personalities of the union itself and rescues
Hill the man .
But as suggested by the subtitle , it ’s Rosemont ’s treatment of how the IWW built a counter hegemonic working class culture that is the most interesting facet of this brick thick work .

Shifu and the possibilities for Chinese Anarchism
In July 1914 , the Shanghai Association of Anarchist Communist Comrades published its statement of principles , concluding with the resolution that , " the implementation of anarchist communism depends on the strength of our party .
If we wish to increase our party 's strength , uniting as a whole body and advancing together is our most important task today .
Wherever they are , all our comrades should unite with those who share the same purposes and establish groups in free association . ”
The key member of this group was a Chinese anarchist known as Shifu who was to die a mere nine months later .
Although the group carried on after his death , the core concept of this paragraph was never to be implemented .

Solid - state drives ( SSDs ) have grown popular in recent years for the impressive speed increases your system gains using them .
To get the most from your SSD , however , you can ( and should ) do a few things differently .
Advertisement
This post is part of a larger series on SSDs .
For more , check out our complete guide to solid - state drives .
Advertisement
Upgrading your regular old hard drive to a solid - state drive is one of the best upgrades you can make to your computer nowadays , as our hard drives tend to be among the biggest bottlenecks in performance .
SSD read times are insanely fast , meaning using one will make your boot times and application launches super short .
One of the most publicized downsides of SSDs is that they have a limited number of writes before they wear out — however , with most newer SSDs , this is n't actually a problem .
Most modern SSDs will become outdated before they die , and you 'll probably have upgraded by then , so there 's not really a huge need to worry about writing to the drive too many times .
That said , there are still a number of tweaks you can make to your system to account for the idiosyncrasies of solid - state drives .
This guide assumes you 're using Windows ( apart from a few general tips that can apply to all OSes ) , and also assumes you 're using one of the newer SSDs that is n't subject to a super low number of writes or horrible write times .
If you are using an older SSD , do a bit of research to see if there are any other tweaks you should make to your system .
Store Media and Other Personal Files on Another Drive
Advertisement
One of the main strategies in SSD usage is to use the SSD only for system files and applications .
This will give you all the perks of fast boot times and application launches , but you wo n't fill up your drive as fast .
SSDs are expensive , and there 's no reason to break the bank for a large one — instead , just buy a small one for your OS files and buy a regular , magnetic drive ( any size you want ; they 're pretty cheap nowadays ) for your music , movies , and documents .
I understand this is n't possible for everyone .
Desktop users should absolutely do this , but while some laptop users may be able to mod their laptop to contain two drives , some may prefer not to ( and netbook users just plain can't ) .
Thus , I 'll point out in this guide where the tip only applies to one of these camps , and if the other camp should do anything differently .

To change where your files are stored automatically , you just need to edit the location of your user folder .
We 've already discussed how to do this in Windows XP and Mac OS X , and Windows 7 users can just create new folders on the second drive and use the Libraries feature .
Linux distributions may vary , but in Ubuntu , you just need to go to System > Administration >
Users and Groups , hit Advanced Settings , and change your home directory under the Advanced tab to a folder on your magnetic drive .

Use Windows 7 ( Instead of XP or Vista )
Advertisement
Windows 7 has a lot of important features that will help your SSD , such as the TRIM command , disabling defragmentation , and disabling Superfetch .
If you 're still using XP or Vista , I recommend upgrading , as some of these are not supported in versions before 7 .
Furthermore , if you have an SSD , Windows 7 will make a lot of these adjustments automatically , so you do n't need to worry about them .
If you 've been using XP up until now ( or upgraded from XP to Vista without doing a clean install ) , you 'll want to do a clean install of Windows , as it will fix your partition alignment , thus greatly increasing performance .
If you absolutely must continue using Windows XP , however , you 'll need to fix your partition alignment manually ( note that you 'll still have to do a clean install ) .
This is one of the most important performance tweaks if you 're using an SSD , as an incorrect alignment ( such as XP 's default ) can severely reduce the speed of your drive .
There is a good guide over at the OCZ Forum that details the necessary steps .
Note that you can run diskpart from a Vista or Windows 7 installation disc , too , if you 'd prefer to do that instead of running it from a separate computer — just use the same settings described in that guide .
Of course , you 'll want to back up all your data before doing this , and then restore it after you 've reinstalled Windows .
The main fix is fixing the physical alignment of the partition ; it has nothing to do with the actual data itself .

Use Hibernation Instead of Sleep
Advertisement
Using hibernation is especially useful on laptops when you 're trying to conserve battery life .
When you sleep a computer , it saves your state to the RAM , but when you hibernate , it saves your state to the hard drive , thus using less power while " asleep " .
Usually , this means it takes a bit longer to start back up , but with an SSD in your system , it should wake up fairly quickly , so the big downside of hibernation is n't as much of an issue .
On Windows , you may need to enable hibernation to customize when your computer uses it .
To do so , open up Command Prompt as an administrator ( by right clicking on it ) and type powercfg / hibernate on .
Then , open up the start menu and type in " power options " and hit enter .
Click the link on the left that says " Change when the computer sleeps " and then hit " Change advanced power settings " .
If you expand the Sleep setting , you can edit when your computer sleeps as opposed to hibernates .
Also , turning off " Allow hybrid sleep " will let you choose Hibernate from the start menu if you 'd like to be able to do it manually .
On a Mac , you 'll need an app like SmartSleep to customize sleep and hibernation preferences .
Advertisement
Note , however , that if you are running out of space on your SSD , you 'll actually want to do the opposite and turn hibernation off , since it creates a file on your hard drive that takes up as much space as the amount of RAM in your system .
To disable hibernation completely , just run the above command but with " off " in place of " on " .
For the most part , though , if you followed the first tip in this guide , you should have plenty of room to spare for the hibernation file .

Disable Disk Defragmentation ( on XP and Vista )
On a magnetic drive , defragmentation organizes your drive in a way that data sectors are close to one another to improve performance .
However , on Solid State Drives , having the data close together makes no difference , since SSDs can access data at the same speed no matter where it is .
Thus , you do n't need to defragment your SSD , and you can probably increase performance by turning it off .
Advertisement
To do so , head into your Start menu , right click on the Computer icon , and hit Manage to enter Computer Management .
Under Services and Applications >
Services , right click on Disk Defragmenter and hit Properties .
Change the Startup Type to Disabled and hit OK .
Advertisement
Note that you probably wo n't need to do this on Windows 7 , since it is turned off automatically when you 're using a solid - state drive .
Popular Tweaks That You Probably Don't Need
Despite the fact that Windows 7 automatically turns off Superfetch when using SSDs that can handle it , it is n't all that important since modern SSDs have a perfectly adequate lifespan .
If you 're using Windows Vista , you can try disabling Superfetch , but I will not cover it in this guide as it will more often than not decrease performance on your system ( our friends over at The How - To Geek have a guide for disabling it , however ) .
Advertisement
Once upon a time , many people — including us — recommended disabling indexing on your SSD , because it could shorten the lifespan of a drive .
These days , that is n't much of a concern , so there 's no need to fiddle with the search settings .
Advertisement
Similarly , disabling write caching and the page file are often counted as good tips for SSD owners , but they 're likely to cause more problems than they solve ( or they just plain do n't matter ) .
However , if you are in the camp that is using just an SSD , tweaking the page file 's size will help you save some space on your drive .
You can do this by going to the Start menu , right clicking on Computer , and hitting Properties .
Hit the Advanced System Settings link on the left , hit the Setting button under Performance , and then hit the Advanced tab .
Click the Change button and uncheck " Automatically manage paging file size for all drives " and set a custom size to something that more suits your space needs .
These are , of course , not the only tweaks you can make to your system , but they are some of the best ones that will help you get the most out of your SSD .
There are always other things you can do to speed up your computer ( for example , you can move your caches to a RAM disk ) , but they are n't all specific to SSDs and they are n't all perfect for everyone .
So , if you have some of your favorite tweaks that we have n't featured here , be sure to share them in the comments .
Fairhope , Alabama ( CNN ) -- Mark Castlow and Jimbo Meador have a solution for saving the oil - covered birds in the Gulf of Mexico .
However , they also have a problem .
I saw the solution firsthand during a quick ride through a Gulf inlet , near Meador 's home of Fairhope , Alabama , about a 20 - minute drive outside Mobile .
The two co-owners of Florida - based Dragonfly Boatworks have been working at a breakneck pace for weeks to modify the design of their shallow draft fishing boats , turning them into mobile triage units for pelicans , seagulls , and pretty much any kind of critter caught in the catastrophe .
Their concern on the 65th day of the underwater gusher is deep rooted .
Castlow , who says he has " salt water in his blood , " grew up surfing off Miami and the Keys .
Meador , a former shrimper , was raised along Alabama 's Gulf shores .
They 're keenly aware that each day adds to the death toll of birds and other animals dying in pockets of oil that invade their natural habitat .
" We have to do everything we can to take care of them , " said Meador , who said he has a serious interest in the " birding world . "
" We want to do try to do what 's right to help them because they can't help themselves . "
Oil - soaked birds : Rescue or kill ?
Unlike more traditional boats , which have deep keels that bog down when they push into shallow marshlands , the custom Dragonfly boats can operate in less than a foot of water .
Their broad hulls create very little wake that might further alarm wildlife ; and they 've even been painted a light green color to blend better with their surroundings .
On board , Castlow and Meador have added a whole set of tools to help wildlife rescuers : a large , skid - proof worktable for crews to handle animals , an adjustable shade canopy which can be easily lowered to slip beneath bayou tree branches , fine mist nozzles to cool the scorching summer temperatures for workers and critters .
The oil wo n't hamper the boat 's engines , thanks to a special cleaning solution .
The men consulted wildlife biologists and other scientists as they rushed to make the improvements , and they 've found big donors , like Florida musician Jimmy Buffett , who are willing to help them make the boats available to rescuers free of charge .
The vessels will be outfitted with wireless Internet access , and plans are in the works to team up with Google Earth to enable anyone to track the boats online in real time .
Onboard Web cameras donated by a group in Houston , Texas , will allow classrooms or anyone else to watch rescuers in action .
So far , Buffett has funded construction of one prototype boat , according to the duo .
The plan is to produce a new boat every seven days from here on out .
After the cleanup , the animal rescue groups will be allowed to keep the boats for use in research projects .
Clean up crews trample pelican nests
No one will make money off of the deal , but the animals could benefit immensely , including brown pelicans , a species native to the eastern Gulf which has fallen victim to the oil .
Brown pelicans spent almost 40 years on the endangered species list until last year .
Salvaging just a few of the birds is so vital to the survival of the species , said Lee Hollingsworth , a wildlife adviser with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Wales .
" Something has got to be done , and of course , it 's worth saving the bird . "
Brown pelican : Symbol of survival
Every day adds to the death toll of the region 's birds and other animals .
According to a June 22 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , rescue officials have collected 1,746 birds along the coastline from Louisiana to Florida .
Of those , 749 were alive and " visibly oiled . "
Another 997 were found dead , and 265 of those were visibly oiled .
Birds that were found alive and then euthanized numbered 143 .
The report states BP's Deepwater Horizon spill is not responsible for all dead birds .
How much is a pelican worth ?
Although the vessels have been praised by wildlife experts , including marine biologists at the University of Southern Mississippi , Castlow and Meador say they 've run into dead ends trying to get their boats into the hands of animal rescuers .
They 've called federal authorities and BP too , but they say no one seems able to willing to tell them how and when the boats might be put to work .
Castlow and Meador call their support network the DEA , the Dragonfly Environmental Army , which is made up of those who have extended a helping hand , which include suppliers , donors and volunteers .
They 're hoping the combined forces of their group can break through the bureaucracy and get their boats in the hands of animal rescuers .
It is frustrating to both men , but they say they 've been so encouraged by wildlife experts who have universally praised their innovation , that they 're pressing on , convinced that no less than the lives of thousands of birds are at stake , and the future of their beloved Gulf too .
" And we 're going to get all of these people , and we are going to break that ceiling , " said Castlow .
" And we will go through it -- because it 's our livelihood . "
CNN 's Katie Ross and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report .
Fresh off NPD 's latest Mobile Phone Track report claiming that Android has leapfrogged the iPhone in US sales , Apple is commenting on the numbers -- and as you might expect , they 're not exactly taking a congratulatory tone with Google .
Speaking to AllThingsD's John Paczkowski , Cupertino had this to say :
" This is a very limited report on 150,000 US consumers responding to an online survey and does not account for the more than 85 million iPhone and iPod touch customers worldwide .
IDC figures show that iPhone has 16.1 percent of the smartphone market and growing , far outselling Android on a worldwide basis .
We had a record quarter with iPhone sales growing by 131 percent and with our new iPhone OS 4.0 software coming this summer , we see no signs of the competition catching up anytime soon . "
The factual accuracy of Apple 's words here can't really be disputed , but as Paczkowski notes , the context can : lumping the iPod touch into this equation is n't really fair , since NPD 's report is about smartphones , not mobile operating systems ( which would 've let devices like non-phone Android MIDs into the picture ) .
Besides , this is about the US market in the first quarter of 2010 , not global sales , nor is it about Apple 's development pipeline .
In other words , Apple 's not disputing NPD 's report here -- rather , they 're simply trying to change the subject , as any properly - trained PR department would .
There 's no question Android still has an uphill battle to dominate market ( and mind ) share the world over , but the odds that it outsold the iPhone in the US in Q1 remain very real .
More than 150 people from the Edmonton area marched from City Hall to police headquarters demanding a public inquiry into the arrests of 900 people following G20 protests in Toronto .
A number of local activists who travelled to Toronto to protest the G20 summit witnessed the violence first - hand and say they do n't agree with the way police handled the situation .
" The things I witnesses were baton charges into people sitting on streets , singing songs , there were snatch squads going around pulling people off of buses , " said Scott Harris , an activist with the Council of Canadians who was arrested in Toronto .
Similar protests were held in cities across Canada including Montreal and Winnipeg .
While many are demanding answers about police action in Toronto last weekend , the premier of Ontario says that wo n't happen .
" I do n't believe the circumstances warrant an inquiry , " said Premier Dalton McGuinty .
" Some people have some concerns and they have various avenues available to them . "
However , protesters say that answer is n't adequate .
They vow to keep protesting until their concerns are addressed .
" We 're holding our government accountable and by protesting it 's more direct democracy and that 's a right that 's just too , too precious to take away , " said Edmonton activist Keely Kidner .

I continued to work on Photoshop ( PS in text further ) brush presets support in Krita .
I was exploring what features we miss and I started to implement some of them .
I implemented parsing of the brush and tip dynamics and brush properties serializing so far .
Parsing of the presets is complicated as it can be somehow context related .
Some attribute is present only when some other attribute is present .
I realized that a lot of work will be needed to support the brush presets .
I think that support of the PS brush presets is big project and with Action Plan II we do n’t want only new features , but we aim for user - readiness and that means fixing serious bugs .
I and Boudewijn , we decided to post - pone the brush preset support .
My task was to write a list of missing features .
I did that in our wiki , which was moved recently to http://community.kde.org/.
As you can see there , it is quite a lot of work .
I managed to implement mirroring feature shortly before we decided to post - pone this task .
So you can turn on mirroring of the brush mask in new dialog added to Pixel Brush .
It is equivalent to Flip X , Flip Y from the PS .
So far it is dynamic attribute controlled by sensor like pressure .
If you use mouse + pressure and turn on mirroring and e.g. mirroring horizontally , the mask will be mirrored .
Basically the mask is mirrored when pressure is more or equal of 0.5 ( 50 % ) which is what the sensor gives by default .
If you use tablet , the pressure is changing .
If you want to mirror the mask always , select pressure sensor and tweak the curve , so that it always gives 1.0 result ( move the first point of the curve from bottom left to top left ) .
Brush masks can be mirrored vertically , horizontally or in both ways .
Equivalent feature to Flip X , Flip Y in PS .
One interesting problem is where to put the feature in UI .
Some features are shared among the brush masks ( autobrush , predefined brush , text brush ) like spacing and it is duplicated on every tab .
It might be interesting to clean it in some way so that it is shared instead of duplicated .
I did not know where to put the mirroring .
If only to autobrush and make it part of the brush mask generation or if I should duplicate it on tabs like the spacing is .
It is dynamic parameter in PS so I decided to implement it as sensor .
It is not part of the brush mask generation , it is operation that post - process the brush mask .
It can be dynamically controlled by pressure , tilt , randomness ( fuzzy sensor ) etc .
Then I was at Akademy for the first time .
Thanks to the KDE e.V. I was able to go there .
The travel expenses to Finland are quite big for Central East European .
Thanks again .
I had presentation about Krita , little bit similar to the one for Libre Graphics Meeting .
I was demonstrating the brush engines a bit and talk about what I ’m working on in Krita .
You can see it on - line here .
I was giving the presentation on Sunday .
I attended also a lot of the program , it was interesting .
E.g. Lubos Lunak ’s KDE Performance or Tips &Tricks for KDE development was nice and some more I liked that I can’t remember now
We decided that I will spent the week devoted to Krita on Windows here .
I joint the KDE Windows team at Akademy and I managed to build Krita on Windows with huge support from Patrick and others from KDE Windows team !
It took few days .
I complied Qt , kdelibs and some other dependencies .
It took quite a lot of time .
Especially Qt’s WebKit took forever to compile and kdelibs are also longer to compile .
I compiled Krita on Windows 7 with MS Visual Studio Express ( free edition ) using emerge , tool written by the KDE Windows team .
Nice tutorial I followed is on TechBase .
After that it quite easy .
Patrick prepared target krita for me .
It builds only Krita and not other KOffice applications like KWord etc .
All I needed to do is “ emerge krita ” and follow console if the compilation fails or not .
We used kdelibs - 4.4 , it ’s more stable , last time I tried , kdelibs were used from trunk and that had some compilation problem I was not able to solve .
I split the compilation into steps as I knew that it took quite long to compile some dependencies .
So I did emerge kdelibs - 4.4 etc.
Hopefully I managed to compile Krita , and then run it .
I have development environment , I could develop Krita now on Windows .
What is better is probably debugger .
What is worse – valgrind does not work on Windows .
I will stay in my beloved Linux environment .
Krita on Windows : Native look&feel
Higher resolution
I was scared from the native look &feel from Windows , but that ’s maybe because I do n’t spend much time on Windows .
Good thing is that you can tweak kdeglobals and use Oxygen for Widgets .
With Oxygen it looks more native to Linux user
Higher resolution
I tested Wacom Intuos 3 tablet on Windows .
It worked , I prepared the screenshot with the tablet ^ .
You can see that pressure works !
I had small problem , the tablet was not calibrated .
I had small screen dependent offset between the stroke and cursor in both apps – GIMP and in Krita .
The performance was quite good and I think usable .
I even used debug build which is usually slower then release build .
Last problem that we need to solve is to have simple installer for users .
I discussed with Patrick about it , but it is not very easy issue , so I do n’t know what will happen .
We will see .
That ’s it .
I will work on bug fixing these days .
Also it seems like a lot of features will be scratched off from Action Plan and we will focus more on stability .
I will report again next week 😉
Eight people have been killed in a car crash in County Donegal , about 15 miles from the Northern Ireland border .
The two - car collision happened on the Drumfree to Clonmany road at 2230 BST on Sunday .
Seven of the dead were travelling in a black Volkswagen Passat , the driver of which survived .
The eighth person to die was the driver of the second car .
It is believed the 66 - year - old man had been returning home after playing bingo in Buncrana .
The seven young men who died in the Passat were 21 - year - old Mark McLaughlin , from Fahan ; Paul Doherty and Ciaran Sweeney who were 19 and from Ballyliffin ; Patrick McLaughlin , 21 , from Burnfoot ; 22 - year - old Eamonn McDaid and 21 - year - old Damien McLaughlin , both from Buncrana , and James McEleney , 23 , from Clonmany .
The driver of the other car was Hugh Friel from Clonmany .
Image caption
It is believed the car hit a Renault minutes before the fatal accident
The surviving driver was taken to Letterkenny General Hospital where he is said to be in a critical condition .
Traffic police said the black Passat saloon was believed to have collided with a white Renault before the driver lost control and ploughed into a red Toyota 200 m away .
' Tight bends '
BBC NI reporter Paddy O'Flaherty said the road where the accident happened was very narrow .
" It 's a twisty , windy road .
Lots of tight bends with high hedges , " he said .
" There are a few straight stretches but they are few and far between . "
At Mass in Buncrana on Monday morning , Father Rafal Januszewski said it was a " tragedy of all Inishowen people " .
" Words are nothing , it is better to be with them ( the families ) , " he added .
In Clonmany , Fr Fintan Diggin , spoke of how he went to the scene of the accident .
" I got the word that there had been an accident at about a quarter to midnight , " he said .
" By that stage the fire services and ambulances were already there .
I prayed with those involved and annointed them and tried to be some sort of comfort to all the services that were there as well .
" This morning , people are just overwhelmed by a sense of loss . "
Donegal senator Cecelia Keaveney said it was " an ordeal " for all of the families involved .
" Because of the close - knit community it affects very , very many people in Inishowen particularly , " she said .
Ms Keaveney said she believed many of the victims were local people .
" We have had so many fatalities on the roads over the past decades , for many families , this will reawaken the difficulties they faced , " she said .
" The immediate concern is for the families , but it will reawaken histories for many people as well . "
The Irish prime minister Brian Cowen , on a trip to New York , extended his sympathy to the families of those killed .
" I am deeply saddened to learn of these deaths and I want to extend my sincere sympathies to everyone who lost loved ones , " he said .
NI Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness also passed on his condolences to the families of those killed .
One of the main takeaways from Rand Paul 's disturbing musings on civil rights -- as well as his sturdy defense of the indefensible that is British Petroleum -- clearly was , as John put it , that he 's a typical out - of - touch country - club conservative Republican -- not to mention that he likewise manages to carry on his dad 's tradition of right - wing extremism .
But these also are revealing moments about the limitations of libertarianism as a political philosophy -- because it clearly demonstrates how libertarian " principle " all too often , and all too consistently , essentially gives unbridled permission to behavior and actions that are toxic to our communities and their well - being , and to our democratic institutions as a nation .
Which means that libertarianism all too often is often merely used as a pseudo - principled front for the worst impulses in American society , all under the pretense of " freedom " .
Well , that very limitation is also readily self - evident when it comes to Paul 's position on a subject that directly affects the Kentuckians he wants to represent in the United States Senate : mountaintop - removal coal mining .
This issue , perhaps more than any other , reveals Rand Paul , and all the libertarians like him , to be nothing more than the corporate tools they really are .
Here 's Rand Paul in an interview from October 5 , 2009 , via Jeff Biggers :
PAUL : I think people out here would find that I would be a great friend to coal .
Not ' cause I come to Eastern Kentucky to pander to coal , but because I believe business should be left alone from government .
I think the permit process needs to be made easier from the federal level and the state level .
I think we should n't have special taxes on their profit .
I think we should have lower corporate taxes .
Those who create jobs -- I would much more rather lower taxes on the coal industry so they can hire a new hundred new workers than I would say , let 's tax the coal industry , send it to Washington , so that we can get a hundred new people digging a ditch that may or may not need to be dug .
So yeah , I 'm greatly in favor of that .
I think coal 's a big part of our future because we have a lot of it , still , in the United States , it 's fairly readily accessible , and it's where we get most of our electricity .
Coal now competes -- you may not know this , a lot of people out here know this -- but about half of our electrical needs come from coal .
And it 's cheaper than oil and gas , actually , for your electricity .
Q : What about mountaintop removal ?
PAUL : I think whoever owns the property can do with the property as they wish , and if the coal company buys it from a private property owner and they want to do it , fine .
The other thing I think is that I think coal gets a bad name , because I think a lot of the land apparently is quite desirable once it 's been flattened out .
As I came over here from Harlan , you 've got quite a few hills .
I do n’t think anybody 's going to be missing a hill or two here and there .
And some people like having the flat land .
Some of it apparently has become quite valuable when it 's become flattened .
And I think they do a good job at reclaiming the land , and you know , adding back in topsoil , bringing in help .
So the bottom line is , it 's not just me pandering to coal .
It 's me believing in private property .
If they bought the property , they own the property , they can do with that property , as long as they do n't pollute someone else 's property .
And I do n't think they want to .
If they dump something in the river that goes to the next property , your local judges here will stop them .
But I do n't think they 're doing that .
I think what they 're doing is what they can do with property they own , and does n't appear to me to be something the federal government should be getting involved with .
It 's harder to get any more afactual and ignorant than that , when it comes to the realities .
Indeed , either Paul has just swallowed coal - company lies and propaganda whole , or he 's just flatly lying himself .
The facts :
With 95 % accuracy , analysis shows that nearly 1.2 million acres ( 10 % of Central Appalachia ) have been surface - mined for coal .
It also revealed that more than 500 mountains have been severely impacted or destroyed by mountaintop removal coal mining .
The study was completed in 2009 by Appalachian Voices based on 2008 aerial and mining permit data .
Over 89 percent of the sites identified in the survey are not being reclaimed .
Heckuva job , Paulie !
Wanna see those now - missing " hill or two here or there " ?
Here 's a map of all the hilltop mining operations in the Appalachians .
The little green and yellow tabs mark the " reclaimed " sites , while the red ones are for unreclaimed ones :
And here 's what a typical mountaintop - removal site looks like without " reclamation " -- this is the Hobet mine in West Virginia , seen from space :
Go here for a before - and - after look at the Hobet mine , just so you can get some perspective of the enormity of this purposeful manmade eco-disaster .
Now multiply that by five hundred , and you 'll have a sense of the enormity of what has befallen people living in the Appalachians .
The NRDC's Rob Perks has more :
Of the 500 mountaintop removal sites we examined , we excluded 90 from our survey due to active , ongoing mining activity .
That left 410 supposedly reclaimed mine sites , for which we found that : * 366 ( 89.3 % ) had no form of verifiable post - mining economic reclamation excluding forestry and pasture
* 26 ( 6.3 % of total ) yield some form of verifiable post - mining economic development
* Only about 4 % of mountains in Kentucky and West Virginia , where the vast majority of this mining is occurring , had any post - mining economic activity .
* Virginia had the highest proportion of economic activity on its reclaimed mountaintop removal sites at 20 % .
* Tennessee , which has relatively little mountaintop removal compared to the other three states , had no economic activity on the 6 sites examined in that state .
* Overall , economic activity occurs on just 6 % to 11 % of all reclaimed mountaintop removal sites surveyed as part of this analysis .
The so - called beneficial development projects include : * industrial parks ( 4 )
* oil and gas fields ( 3 )
* golf courses ( 3 )
* airports ( 2 )
* municipal parks ( 2 )
* hospital ( 1 )
* ATV training center ( 1 )
* county fairground ( 1 ) In addition , commercial agriculture or farming was identified on nine sites , sometimes in conjunction with other land uses such as residential development .
The post - mining land use status of all but 18 mountain locations was identified with a high level of confidence .
These locations were identified as having “ possible ” post - mining economic land uses .
This means that some evidence of potential economic reclamation exists on these sites , such as mowed fields or improved structures , but specific land use was not clear .
In some cases , it was unclear whether structures were abandoned or directly connected to former or existing mining activity on site or nearby .
What is clear is that mountaintop removal has yielded little economic development on reclaimed mine lands in Appalachia despite the abundance of landscapes with flattened topography available for industrial , commercial , or residential post - mining economic activity .
What was particularly risible was Paul 's contention that if these operations polluted their neighbors , why , local judges would surely hold the polluters liable for the damages to their neighbors .
Evidently , Paul knows nothing about the history of broad form deeds , which were the legal instrument used by the coal companies to obtain rights to the lands they then leveled without regard to their neighbors :
When coal companies bargained with landowners to buy mineral rights , they commonly negotiated favorable terms for themselves and did not adequately explain the terms to the largely uneducated landowners , who often did not understand the contracts .
The companies paid very little for the coal , despite the fact that they reserved the right to use the land surface for coal development .
Most of the mineral rights deeds were made in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century , when underground mining was common and surface mining was rare .
Land owners who signed these deeds never expected that their homesteads would be turned into strip mines .
Yet up until the mid-1980 ’s , courts in Appalachia consistently interpreted broad form deeds to permit surface mining operations even though the grantor had retained the surface rights to the land above the coal seam .
Broad form deeds included language that waived mining companies ’ liability for surface impacts that were “ convenient or necessary ” to the mining operation .
Based on the turn - of - the - century mining technologies in use during that time period , this language meant that the mining company , which owned only the subsurface mineral rights , could build roads , buildings , coal waste piles , and other structures , as well as harvest timber , on the surface land to facilitate an underground mining operation .
Moreover , they could completely trash neighboring streams without regard to consequence .
This is why , as Ashley Judd put it the other day , " Children in eastern Kentucky draw creeks black .
They do n’t know they 're supposed to run clear . "
John McQuaid explains that mountaintop removal has already destroyed 1,500 miles of streams in the Appalachians :
The spread of mountaintop removal through central Appalachia in the past 15 years has given scientists the opportunity to study environmental destruction on a previously unthinkable scale : The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) estimates that by 2013 a forested area the size of Delaware will have been destroyed and that more than 1,200 miles of streams have already been severely damaged .
As that footprint has grown , so has the evidence , outlined in peer - reviewed scientific papers and ongoing investigations , showing that the damage is far more extensive than previously understood .
Moreover , the health impacts , particularly on children , of this form of mining are both pernicious and widespread -- and have been fully documented .
You see , this is how the real world works : wealthy interests manipulate policy at the state and federal level , and likewise manipulate the law and the courts in their favor , all while the interests of ordinary people are bulldozed .
And it's all done under the supposed " principles " of libertarianism -- which really are just convenient way for corporate interests to run amok without regard to the consequences for any of their fellow citizens .
One has to suspect that Rand Paul actually is perfectly aware of this -- and just does n't care .
He has his precious " principles " to run on .
He calls them " libertarian " .
We call him a corporate tool .

Today on ABC’s This Week , Sam Donaldson urged President Obama to stand up to and take on Fox News .
Donaldson said , “ President Obama , do n’t be afraid of them .
Take them on , and let the people judge . ”
Here is the video on the roundtable discussion on This Week :

While speaking out the Shirley Sherrod story , Sam Donaldson compared racist witch hunts at Fox News to McCarthyism , “ But I think , except for her , there ’s enough blame to go around for everyone here .
The people who maliciously and with intention misrepresented the facts , I mean , I — I believe in the First Amendment .
There ’s nothing you can do about them , although you wish for Joseph Welch to say as he did to Joe McCarthy when Joe McCarthy was destroying someone on television , have you no decency , at last ? ”
He also had a message for President Obama , “ But from the standpoint of Obama and the administration , who are these people that they should pay attention to and be afraid of ?
Who ’s Glenn Beck ?
I mean , who ’s Bill O’Reilly ?
Who ’s Brett whatever his name is ?…
I want to quote another president who also said he had enemies , I ’m going to — of financial monopoly , speculation , reckless banking , class antagonism , sexism .
They are unanimous in their hatred for me , and I welcome their hatred , said Franklin Roosevelt , who said I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made .
So , President Obama , do n’t be afraid of them .
Take them on , and let the people judge .
You may lose , but if you lose , you will lose grandly . ”
The tactics Fox News has been employing are straight out of the playbook of Sen.
Joe McCarthy , and that is not a coincidence .
Fox News intentionally targets African Americans who are relatively unknown and easily defined .
Much like McCarthy was , they are bullies pick on those who ca n’t fight back .
( Actually very few people have the resources to fight back against a 24/7 cable news network ) .
Donaldson brought up a great point here .
If Fox News was an actual news organization , they would not go around inventing baseless scandals and attacks .
On his second point , Donaldson ’s advice to Obama concerning Fox News , I agree that there is no reason why this administration should give
Fox credibility that they do n’t have .
If Obama is worried about FNC , he should n’t be .
Fox News viewers represent a tiny sliver of America .
These are also the people who would not support Obama under any circumstances .
They ca n’t be swayed , and their closed minded objections render them irrelevant for political purposes .
I think it would be a mistake for Obama to go after Fox News , because that is what they want .
Instead of giving credibility to their attack machine , Obama should ignore them .
Fox News needs Obama to engage them .
The worst thing that could happen to FNC would be if Obama simply did n’t acknowledge them .
The president listened to them once and was made to look like a fool , so let ’s hope that his administration has learned something from this embarrassment , and tunes out Fox News .

Conservatives argue that the public is in full deficit reduction mode and that there ’s nothing more important to them than cutting government spending .
The grain of truth here is that the public is in fact concerned about the size of the deficit .
But everything else is wrong .
There are many more important things to the public than cutting the deficit .
Take jobs , for example .
The public declared by 60 - 38 in a mid-June Gallup / USA Today poll that they favored Congress passing new legislation this year that would provide “ additional government spending to create jobs and stimulate the economy . ”
Of course , this is exactly the kind of legislation conservatives are now strenuously opposing on the grounds the public is sick and tired of spending to create jobs .
Nor does the public want to see budget cuts in social spending .
A late June Pew poll asked the public if they ’d approve of various spending cuts to balance their state ’s budget this year .
The public opposed all of them .
This included 73 - 21 opposition to cutting funding for K - 12 public schools ; 71 - 25 opposition to cutting funding for police , fire , and other public safety departments ; 65 - 27 opposition to cutting health care services provided by state or local government ; and 50 - 43 opposition to cutting funding for maintaining roads and public transportation systems .
The most important priority to conservatives and a fair number of media commentators may well be deficit reduction through spending cuts .
But this most assuredly is not the public ’s most important priority .
Policymakers would do well to remember this as they consider bills that would pump additional money into the economy by extending unemployment benefits , preventing teacher layoffs , and the like .
Killing these bills in the name of deficit reduction is not doing the public ’s bidding — it ’s exactly the reverse .

Image caption Mr Ban is insisting on an international element to the investigation
The UN Secretary General has insisted other nations should oversee an investigation into Israel 's deadly boarding of a Turkish ship .
Ban Ki-Moon restated the demands days after Israel rejected a similar suggestion that the probe be carried out by an international tribunal .
Israel is insisting it should carry out the investigation itself .
Nine people died when Israel prevented a flotilla of ships docking in the Gaza Strip on 31 May .
Israel has outlined the focus of the probes it will conduct .
They will look exclusively into the legality of Israel 's naval blockade of Gaza and the raid on the aid flotilla , Israeli minister without portfolio Benny Begin told public radio on Tuesday .
Rejection
But a UN spokesman said Mr Ban still hoped for " credible international involvement " in the investigation to ensure it was " prompt , credible , impartial and transparent " .
He said they had not received an official rejection from Israel .
On Sunday Israel 's ambassador to the US , Michael Oren , told US broadcaster Fox News that Israel has the ability and the right to investigate its own military .
That came hours after Mr Ban had called the Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to outline plans for an international tribunal .
At a regional security conference in Turkey on Tuesday 21 out of 22 member countries denounced the raid on the Turkish ship the Mavi Marmara .
Israel , also a member of Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia , rejected criticism at the meeting .
Ah , the cool , refreshing feel of air conditioning on a sweltering summer day .
Ugh , the discomfort when those energy bills in July , August and September come due -- $ 200 , $ 400 , $ 600 or more .
Feel miserable , or dig deep into your wallet -- not much of a choice for the 250 million Americans who live in climates where heat , humidity or both are a Catch - 22 for three to 12 months a year .
A soothing solution may be on its way , thanks to a melding of technologies in filters , coolers and drying agents .
The U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has invented a new air conditioning process with the potential of using 50 percent to 90 percent less energy than today 's top - of - the - line units .
It uses membranes , evaporative cooling and liquid desiccants in a way that has never been done before in the centuries - old science of removing heat from the air .
" The idea is to revolutionize cooling , while removing millions of metric tons of carbon from the air , " NREL mechanical engineer Eric Kozubal , co-inventor of the Desiccant - Enhanced eVaporative air conditioner ( DEVap ) , said .

" We 'd been working with membranes , evaporative coolers and desiccants .
We saw an opportunity to combine them into a single device for a product with unique capabilities . "
Hot and Humid Climates are Tricky
Evaporative coolers are a lower - cost alternative to A/C in dry climates that do n't get too hot or humid -- say , Denver , but not Phoenix or Miami .
Water flows over a mesh , and a fan blows air through the wet mesh to create humid , cool air .
In humid climes , adding water to the air creates a hot and sticky building environment .
Furthermore , the air cannot absorb enough water to become cold .
In Phoenix or Tucson , the evaporative cooler can bring down the temperature , but not enough to make it pleasant inside on a 100 - degree day or during the four to eight week moist period known as monsoon season .
The cooling bumps up against the wet bulb temperature , the lowest temperature to which air can be cooled by evaporating without changing the pressure .
The wet bulb temperature could be 75 or 80 degrees on a mid-summer Tucson day .
Typically , evaporative coolers only can bring the temperatures about 85 percent of the way to the wet bulb level .

So , for most of the country , refrigeration - based air conditioning is the preferred way of keeping cool .
Cooling Requires Temperature Drop and Less Moisture
Cooling comes in two forms -- sensible cooling , which is a temperature drop , and latent cooling , which comes from pulling the moisture out of the air .
One intriguing product already on the market in arid , temperate climates is the Coolerado cooler .
It differs from a typical evaporative cooler by never increasing the moisture content of the supply air .
It provides cool air through indirect evaporative cooling .
Indirect evaporative systems use a purge air stream that removes heat from the product or supply air stream that is then directed into a building .
That way , the Coolerado can cool the air all the way to the wet - bulb temperature .
" It 's a big improvement on evaporative cooling because it does n't add moisture and still gives you cold air , " Kozubal said .
However , in a humid climate , it still does not provide cold air or humidity control .
DEVap : Liquid Desiccants , Permeable Membranes
The DEVap solves that problem .
It relies on the desiccants ' capacity to create dry air using heat and evaporative coolers ' capacity to take dry air and make cold air .
" By no means is the concept novel , the idea of combining the two , " Kozubal said .
" But no one has been able to come up with a practical and cost - effective way to do it . "
HVAC engineers have known for decades the value of desiccants to air conditioning .
In fact , one of the pioneers of early A/C , Willis Haviland Carrier , knew of its potential , but opted to go the refrigeration route .
Most people know of desiccants as the pebble - sized handfuls that come with new shoes to keep them dry .
The kind NREL uses are syrupy liquids -- highly concentrated aqueous salt solutions of lithium chloride or calcium chloride .
They have a high affinity for water vapor , and can thus create very dry air .
Because of the complexity of desiccant cooling systems , they have traditionally only been used in industrial drying processes .
Inventing a device simple enough for easy installation and maintenance is what has impaired desiccant cooling from entering into commercial and residential cooling markets .
To solve that problem , the NREL device uses thin membranes that simplify the process of integrating air flow , desiccants , and evaporative cooling .
These result in an air conditioning system that provides superior comfort and humidity control .
The membranes in the DEVap A/C are hydrophobic , which means water tends to bead up rather than soak through the membranes .
Imagine rain falling on a freshly waxed car .
That property allows the membranes to control the liquid flows within the cooling core .
" It 's that property that keeps the water and the desiccant separated from the air stream , " Kozubal said .
" We bring the water and liquid desiccant into DEVap 's heat - mass exchanger core , " Kozubal said .
" The desiccant and evaporative cooling effect work together to create cold - dry air . "
The air is cooled and dried from a hot - humid condition to a cold and dry condition all in one step .
This all happens in a fraction of a second as air flows through the DEVap air conditioner .
The result is an air conditioner that controls both thermal and humidity loads .
DEVap helps the environment in many ways .
DEVap uses 50 percent to 90 percent less energy than top - of - the - line refrigeration - based air conditioning .
Because DEVap uses salt solutions rather than refrigerants , there are no harmful chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs ) to worry about .
A pound of CFC or HCFC in refrigerant - based A / Cs contributes as much to global warming as 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide .
A typical residential size A/C has as much as 13 pounds of these refrigerants .
The release of this much refrigerant is equivalent to burning more than 1,300 gallons of gasoline , or driving over 60,000 miles in a 2010 Toyota Prius .
That 's based on the Environmental Protection Agency 's fuel efficiency rating for the 2010 Toyota Prius and on the standard of 19.5 pounds of carbon dioxide for every gallon of gasoline burned .
Traditional air conditioners use a lot of electricity to run the refrigeration cycle , but DEVap replaces that refrigeration cycle with an absorption cycle that is thermally activated .
It can be powered by natural gas or solar energy and uses very little electricity .
This means that DEVap could become the most energy efficient way to cool your house whether you live in Phoenix , New York , or Houston .
NREL has patented the DEVap concept , and Kozubal expects that over the next couple of years he will be working on making the device smaller and simpler and perfecting the heat transfer to make DEVap more cost effective .
Eventually , NREL will license the technology to industry , " We 're never going to be in the air conditioner manufacturing business , " said Ron Judkoff , Principle Program Manager for Building Energy Research at NREL .
" But we 'd like to work with manufacturers to bring DEVap to market and create a more efficient and environmentally benign air conditioning product . "

Social networks are made up of different types of social interactions .
This multi-relational aspect is usually neglected in the analysis of large social networks .
A monochrome representation , such as provided by mobile phone data ( see figure 1 ) , leads to a gross representation of the system .
The richness of the interactions can only be uncovered by identifying the nature of the links between people ( represented by the different colours in figure 2 ) .
Because players are immersed in a virtual world in online games , all their actions / communications are stored in log files , resulting in rich data .
A new study analysing interactions between players in a virtual universe game has for the first time provided large - scale evidence to prove an 80 year old psychological theory called Structural Balance Theory .
The research , published today in PNAS , shows that individuals tend to avoid stress - causing relationships when they develop a society , resulting in more stable social networks .
Today 's study , carried out at Imperial College London , the Medical University of Vienna and the Santa Fe Institute , analyses relationships between 300,000 players in an online game called Pardus .
In this open - ended game , players act as spacecraft exploring a virtual universe , where they can make friends and enemies , and communicate , trade and fight with one another .
Scientists currently study data from people 's electronic interactions , such as emails , mobile phones and online retail behaviour , to improve our understanding of human societies .
Online games such as Pardus produce vast amounts of data that scientists can also use to study interactions between players , applying their findings to understanding the way that people interact in society .
Structural Balance
Theory is an 80 year old psychological theory that suggests some networks of relationships are more stable than others in a society .
Specifically , the theory deals with positive and negative links between three individuals , where ' the friend of my enemy is my enemy ' is more stable ( and therefore more common ) than ' the friend of my friend is my enemy ' .
In today 's study , information about interactions between players in the game is more detailed than that from other electronic sources , because it includes data on the types of relationship and whether the interactions are positive or negative .
This has enabled the authors of the study to show that positive relationships form stable networks in society , proving Structural Balance Theory for the first time .
Dr Renaud Lambiotte , one of the authors of the study from the Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Imperial College London , said : " I find it fascinating to understand how we all interact with one another to form complex social networks .
I think it is astounding that I 'm this tiny point in such an enormous network of people .
Our new study reveals in more detail than ever before the key ingredients that make these networks stable . "
In today 's study , mathematicians looked at six types of interaction between players in an online game : friendship , communication , trade , hostility , aggression and punishment .
Each one defines a network on its own ; all six together combine to form one large network .
A unique aspect of the data is that some of the links have a positive connotation ( friendship , communication and trade ) , while others correspond to negative interactions ( hostility , aggression and punishment ) .
The researchers analysed data from the game on two levels : first by analysing individual networks ; and then by looking at the interplay between all the networks .
The authors found that in positive relationships , players are more likely to reciprocate actions and sentiments than in negative ones .
For example , if player A declares player B to be their friend , player B is likely to do the same .
If player A declares player B to be their enemy , however , player B is not likely to reciprocate .
The research also revealed strong interactions between different types of links , with some networks overlapping extensively , as players are likely to engage in similar interactions , and others tending to exclude each other .
For example , friendship and communication networks overlap : as we would expect , friends tend to talk to each other .
However , trade and hostility did not overlap at all , showing that enemies tend not to trade with one another .
Dr Renaud Lambiotte said : " This may seem like an obvious finding , as we would all prefer to communicate more with people we like .
However , nobody has shown the evidence for this theory on such a large scale before . "
The researchers are currently developing their mathematical tools for large , complex networks in order to study patterns of communication between millions of people from mobile phone data and also to examine biological problems such as the way different regions of the brain communicate with each other .

Stanley Fish on education , law and society .
I wore my high school ring for more than 40 years .
It became black and misshapen and I finally took it off .
But now I have a new one , courtesy of the organizing committee of my 55th high school reunion , which I attended over the Memorial Day weekend .
I wore the ring ( and will wear it again ) because although I have degrees from two Ivy league schools and have taught at U.C. Berkeley , Johns Hopkins , Columbia and Duke , Classical High School ( in Providence , RI ) is the best and most demanding educational institution I have ever been associated with .
The name tells the story .
When I attended , offerings and requirements included four years of Latin , three years of French , two years of German , physics , chemistry , biology , algebra , geometry , calculus , trigonometry , English , history , civics , in addition to extra-curricular activities , and clubs — French Club , Latin Club , German Club , Science Club , among many others .
A student body made up of the children of immigrants or first generation Americans ; many , like me , the first in their families to finish high school .
Nearly a 100 percent college attendance rate .
A yearbook that featured student translations from Virgil and original poems in Latin .
Sounds downright antediluvian , outmoded , narrow and elitist , and maybe it was ( and is ; the curriculum ’s still there , with some additions like Japanese ) , but when I returned home I found three new books waiting for me , each of which made a case for something like the education I received at Classical .
The books are Leigh A. Bortins ’ “ The Core : Teaching Your Child the Foundations of Classical Education , ” Martha C. Nussbaum ’s “ Not for Profit : Why Democracy Needs the Humanities ” and Diane Ravitch ’s “ The Death and Life of the Great American School System : How Testing and Choice are Undermining Education . ”
Three more different perspectives from three more different authors could hardly be imagined .
Leigh A. Bortins writes as an engineer , a home schooling advocate and the C.E.O. of Classical Conversations , Inc .
She sees learning “ as a continuing conversation that humankind has been engaged in for centuries ” and believes that the decisions we must make today will be better if they are informed by “ classical content , ” that is , by an awareness of what great thinkers of the past have made of the problems we encounter in the present .
She wants her children and ours to “ hear the collective wisdom of the ages ” and “ regularly consult the advice of wise and virtuous men and women ” when faced with modern “ predicaments . ”
To this end , she proposes a two - pronged program of instruction : “ classical education emphasizes using the classical skills to study classical content . ”
By classical skills she means imitation , memorization , drill , recitation and above all grammar , not grammar as the study of the formal structure of sentences ( although that is part of it ) , but grammar as the study of the formal structure of anything : “ Every occupation , field of study or concept has a vocabulary that the student must acquire like a foreign language . . . .
A basketball player practicing the fundamentals could be considered a grammarian . . . as he repeatedly drills the basic skills , of passing dribbling , and shooting . ”
“ Every student , ” Bortins counsels , “ must learn to speak the language of the subject . ”
“ Classical content ” identifies just what the subjects to be classically studied are .
They are the subjects informed and structured by “ the ideas that make us human ” — math , science , language , history , economics and literature , each of which , Bortins insists , can be mastered by the rigorous application of the skills of the classical Trivium , grammar , the study of basic forms , logic , the skill of abstracting from particulars and rhetoric , the ability to “ speak and write persuasively and eloquently about any topic while integrating allusions and examples from one field of study to explain a point in another . ”
Assiduously practice , or as Bortins puts it , “ overpractice ” these skills , and “ a student is prepared to study anything . ”
Notably absent from Bortins ’ vision of education is any mention of assessment outcomes , testing , job training ( one of her sub - chapters is entitled “ The Trivium Replaces Careerism ” ) and the wonders of technology .
Her emphasis is solely on content and the means of delivering it .
She warns against the narrowing distractions of “ industrialization and technologies ” and declares that “ students would be better educated if they were n’t allowed to use computers . . . until they were proficient readers and writers . ”
Martha Nussbaum , philosopher , classicist , ethicist and law professor , starts from the same place .
She critiques the current emphasis on “ science and technology ” and the “ applied skills suited to profit making ” and she argues that the “ humanistic aspects of science and social science — the imaginative and creative aspect , and the aspect of rigorous critical thought — are . . . losing ground ” as the humanities and the arts “ are being cut away ” and dismissed as “ useless frills ” in the context of an overriding imperative “ to stay competitive in the global market . ”
The result , she complains , is that “ abilities crucial to the health of any democracy ” are being lost , especially the ability to “ think critically , ” the ability , that is , “ to probe , to evaluate evidence , to write papers with well - structured arguments , and to analyze the arguments presented to them in other texts . ”
While not the language of the Trivium ( which Nussbaum knows well ) , it breathes the same spirit , and we might well be reading Bortins when Nussbaum praises the kind of course that pays “ attention to logical structures ” and thus “ gives students templates that they can then apply to texts of many different types . ”
But this and related abilities will look “ dispensable if what we want are marketable outputs of a quantifiable nature , ” if we embrace an “ economic growth ” paradigm rather than a “ human development paradigm . ”
For Nussbaum , human development means the development of the capacity to transcend the local prejudices of one ’s immediate ( even national ) context and become a responsible citizen of the world .
Students should be brought “ to see themselves as members of a heterogeneous nation . . . and a still more heterogeneous world , and to understand something of this history of the diverse groups that inhabit it . ”
Developing intelligent world citizenship is an enormous task that can not even begin to be accomplished without the humanities and arts that “ cultivate capacities for play and empathy , ” encourage thinking that is “ flexible , open and creative ” and work against the provincialism that too often leads us to see those who are different as demonized others .
Unfortunately , at least according to Nussbaum , the trend toward a narrower and narrower vision of education is not being resisted by the Obama administration .
Rather than decreasing the focus on testing and test preparation — a focus that reverses the relationship between test and content ; the test becomes the content — “ the administration plans to expand it . ”
Obama and his secretary of education , Arne Duncan ( who , says Nussbaum , “ presided over a rapid decline in humanities and arts funding ” as head of the Chicago public schools ) , continue to implement the assumptions driving the Bush administration ’s No Child Left Behind , chiefly the assumption that “ individual income and national economic progress ” should be education ’s main goals .
Diane Ravitch , noted historian and theorist of education , writes as someone who once strongly supported the promise and goals of No Child Left Behind but underwent a de-conversion in 2007 : “ Where once I had been hopeful , even enthusiastic , about the potential benefits of testing , accountability , choice , and markets , I now found myself experiencing profound doubts about these same ideas . ”
Her conclusions , backed up by exhaustive research and an encyclopedic knowledge both of the literature and of situations on the ground , are devastating .
The mantra of choice produced a “ do your own thing ” proliferation of educational schemes , “ each with its own curriculum , and methods , each with its own private management , all competing for . . . public dollars ” rather than laboring to discover “ better ways of educating hard - to - educate students . ”
The emphasis on testing produced students who could “ master test taking methods , but not the subject itself , ” with the consequence that the progress claimed on the basis of test scores was an “ illusion ” :
“ The scores had gone up , but the students were not better educated . ”
A faith in markets produced gamesmanship , entrepreneurial maneuvering and outright cheating , very little reflection on “ what children should know ” and very little thought about the nature of the curriculum .
Ravitch , like Nussbaum , finds little hope in the policies of President Obama , who promised change but seems to have picked up “ the same banner of choice , competition , and markets that had been the hallmark of his predecessors . ”
The result is that we continue to see “ the shrinking of time available to teach anything other than reading and math ; other subjects , including history , science , the arts , geography , even recess , were curtailed . ”
Ravitch ’s recommendations are simple , commonsensical and entirely consonant with the views of Bortins and Nussbaum .
Begin with “ a well conceived , coherent , sequential curriculum , ” and then “ adjust other parts of the education system to support the goals of learning . ”
This will produce a “ foundation of knowledge and skills that grows stronger each year . ”
Forget about the latest fad and quick - fix , and buckle down to the time - honored , traditional “ study and practice of the liberal arts and sciences : history , literature , geography , the sciences , civics , mathematics , the arts and foreign languages . ”
In short , get knowledgeable and well - trained teachers , equip them with a carefully calibrated curriculum and a syllabus filled with challenging texts and materials , and put them in a room with students who are told where they are going and how they are going to get there .

Amy Locane Charged With DUI and Vehicular Homicide ( PHOTOS , VIDEO )
Former Melrose Place actresshas been charged with second - degree vehicular homicide and DUI following a car crash at 9:05 p.m. on Sunday night that caused a death in Montgomery , N.J. Locane told authorities that she drank several glasses of wine prior to getting behind the wheel .
Blood alcohol testing was done at Princeton hospital .
According to court documents , the 38 - year - old actress was driving a Chevy Tahoe that struck the passenger side of a Mercury Milan that was turning into a driveway .
Helene Seeman was pronounced dead at the scene .
Fred Seeman was airlifted to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick where he is listed in critical condition .
Locane was arraigned Monday at the Somerset County Courthouse where bail was set at $ 50,000 .
Besides the second - degree vehicular homicide and DUI , she was also charged with third - degree assault by auto for rear - ending a different car shortly before the fatal crash .
Several witnesses saw Locane swerving and knocking down mailboxes prior to the crash on Cherry Hill Road .
If convicted , Locane could get up to 10 years in prison .
The actress is the mother of two daughters , Paige 3 , and Avery , 1 , and is married to Mark Bovenizer , owner and operator of Community Liquors in Princeton .
He teaches wine seminars at Harvard Business School , Princeton University , and is a wine educator at the Carlow Cookery in Doylestown , PA .
The actress just wrapped a starring role in " Missed Connections " at Hopewell Off - Broadway Theater earlier Sunday .
Her film roles include " Secretary " , " School Ties " , " Blue Sky " , " Carried Away " , and " Cry Baby " .
Her last film project " Throttle " was released in 2005 .

“ We are an oil producing country and that obligates us to take even more care of the environment — on an extreme level — and to avoid contamination , and to reduce contamination in all areas : earth , water and air . ”
– President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela , February 24 , 2007 .
As the world gets accustomed to the effects of global climate change such as increasingly frequent extreme weather events including forest fires , government are compelled to direct greater attention and resources to mitigate environmental impacts .
In the United States alone , the cost of fighting ever - intensifying forest fires has exceeded $ 1 billion every year since 2000 .
In contrast , in Venezuela , the Environment Ministry has launched a nationwide tree - planting campaign known as Misión Árbol , or “ Tree Mission ” , an integral reforestation and conservation effort that depends largely on popular participation .
Global estimates for 2009 cite deforestation as the source of one - fifth of the human - caused greenhouse effect and note that worldwide forest fires release an amount of carbon dioxide equal to 50 % of what is released from fossil fuel combustion .
Forest fires are especially problematic since they are both a cause and result of global warming .
[ 1 ]
In 2006 , researchers at the University of Arizona in Tucson published a report claiming that as a result of climate change , western wildfire season in the United States is now starting earlier , involving fires that last longer and occurring during fire seasons that end later .
The report noted that increased global temperatures on the whole would lead to more frequent and intense forest fires . [ 2 ]
According to a 2010 assessment on global forest resources released by the United Nation ’s Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , the loss of forested area worldwide was 5.2 million hectares per year from 2000 to 2010 , which represents a decline compared to the 8.3 million hectares per year of the 1990’s .
The FAO notes that reductions in deforestation rates offset by the planting of new forests , have served to lower the high level of carbon emissions tied to deforestation .
[ 3 ]
Venezuela , ranked by the FAO in 2005 among the top ten countries with the highest deforestation rates [ 4 ] , is now at the forefront of international reforestation efforts as a direct result of the Environment Ministry ’s Tree Mission .
Misión Árbol
As Green Left Weekly ’s Federico Fuentes points out , “ before President Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998 , successive Venezuelan governments allowed the multinational companies operating there to massively contaminate Venezuela 's lakes and rivers , and carry out rampant deforestation . ” [ 5 ]
Then , in 2006 , Venezuela launched the Tree Mission , a government initiative seeking to construct a new community - driven development model based on the restoration , conservation and sustainable use of forests for quality of life improvements [ 6 ] .
The central players behind the Mission , known as Conservation Committees , are groups of concerned citizens that have come together in local assemblies to define priority projects for reforestation in their community .
Committee members elect coordinators who serve to communicate priorities to local government representatives of the Environment Ministry , which also works directly with Consejos Comunales ( Community Councils ) , an entity central to the Bolivarian Revolution ’s participatory democracy .
Conservation Committees are entirely responsible for implementing the projects they propose , managing the funds provided by the national government and following - up on project implementation and management .
At the time of the launch of Tree Mission 2010 , there were over 5,100 Conservation Committees at work nationwide .
According to Jesús Alejandro Cegarra , Vice Minister of Environmental Conservation , “ The Tree Mission to date has produced over 37 million tree seedlings and built over 3,000 greenhouses across the nation , 80 % of which are managed by the communities themselves and the other 20 % by schools . ”
In the process , a National Forest Seedbank has been recovered and 19 million tree seedlings have been planted across a 23,000 hectare ( 56,810 acres ) area .
Mount Avila
Tree Mission was founded at Warairarepano National Park , also known as Mount Avila , back in 2006 .
The park is home to a diverse array of endemic plant and animal species found only in the Cordillera de la Costa , separating Caracas from the Caribbean Ocean , and is visited by thousands of locals , nationals and internationals each year [ 7 ] .
In 1999 , heavy rains and unprotected soils caused massive mudslides off the northern coast off Mount Avila that resulted in the most devastating natural disaster in 20th century Venezuela .
The Vargas Tragedy , as it is known , resulted in an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 deaths , displacing more than 100,000 people .
This catastrophic event led the then newly - elected Chavez Government to bring civilian and military forces together to address the immediate needs of those most affected .
This was also the first time that Venezuela rejected U.S. offers of military personnel for emergency support , a preview of the future Venezuela - U.S. relationship .
At Warairarepano National Park , known to many as the living lungs of Caracas , fires burned 2,000 hectares ( 4,950 acres ) of forested parklands during the 2009 – 2010 dry season with new burns reported in the 2010 – 2011 period that just began .
In an effort to restore the affected areas in this important national resource , the Tree Mission recently began the first of two phases in reforestation efforts .
Phase 1 , which began on May 30th and continues weekly through the end of September , stipulates the planting of 120,000 tree seedlings , the sowing of 2.8 million seeds from 47 plant species , and the construction of 12 nurseries with a total capacity of 245,000 seedlings .
This first phase is expected to restore 65 % of damaged areas within the park .
Phase 2 , scheduled to begin in October , will see the planting of 179,000 tree seedlings produced by on - site greenhouses and the culmination of recovery efforts by December this year .
On Sunday , June 13th , over 500 people ; Caracas residents , public sector employees , young and old - came together with their Conservation Committees to plant over 4,000 tree seedlings [ 8 ] .
The following Sunday , over 14 Committees , represented mostly by their youth and student members , went into the park and planted over 2,000 more trees [ 9 ] .
Every weekend for the rest of 2010 , different members of Conservation Committee will come together to move this effort forward .

Sue Zheng was happy to land her first job in Toronto at a manicure salon .
But there was a catch : she had to pay a $ 400 deposit to work there , and receive only $ 25 a day for 10 hours of work , seven days a week .
She took the job anyway .
“ I do n’t know any English and had no idea what my rights were , ” she explained in Mandarin during an interview Thursday .
“ Workers do n’t have a lot of rights where I came from . ”
Zheng , 40 , who arrived in Toronto from Fuzhou , China in 2006 , said she was desperate to find work last year after raising two young children .
“ You just accept what you are given . ”
Hers is one of numerous stories of abuse and exploitation of immigrant workers uncovered in a survey by the Chinese Interagency Network of Greater Toronto , an umbrella group of 33 social and health service agencies serving the Chinese community .
The survey found fewer than one in five know what the maximum hours of work are in Ontario .
Of the 119 people interviewed , 66 per cent were unaware of overtime and holiday pay .
And four out of 10 people did not know the current minimum wage or that they were protected by labour laws even if they did n’t have a written employment contract .
Though not statistically representative , the results are not surprising and in fact are reflective of other immigrant communities , said Daniel Yau of the Metro Toronto Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic .
“ The problem is newcomers are not familiar with their rights in Canada .
They also face the language barrier and do n’t know the social infrastructure and supports available to them , ” he said .
Zheng said she finally quit the salon job after two months due to exhaustion .
She had no idea about her labour rights until she was asked to participate in the July street survey in Chinatown .
She has since been put in touch with a legal clinic to try and get back her $ 400 deposit .
Beixi Liu of the Workers ’ Action Centre in Toronto said Ontario ’s proposed legislation , Bill 68 , which would mandate workers to first confront their employer with their concerns before filing a complaint with the Ministry of Labour , will only make matters worse .
“ Requiring workers to go back to their employers is unreasonable , very intimidating to workers , ” Liu said .
More than 500 individuals were approached for the survey , but an overwhelming majority declined to comment for fear they would be seen by their employer and risk losing their job .
“ Many of the workers have worked in those kinds of conditions for years and they just do n’t care about their rights .
They just do whatever their bosses order them to do and accept what they pay them .
They never challenge , ” said a disheartened Wei Sun , one of eight volunteers who conducted the survey .
“ It ’s shocking in Canada that these people are working 70 hours a week , with an average hourly wage of $ 4 . ”
Andy Mark of Toronto ’s Chinese Canadian National Council said many skilled immigrants put up with poor working conditions because their foreign credentials are not recognized .
“ It is difficult to find jobs in the mainstream job market .
They want to keep their jobs .
It ’s simply about survival , ” Mark said .
Hui-min
Li said he worked in a Chinese - run Toronto automobile parts factory for eight years before the company abruptly laid off its workers and moved to Mexico in late 2008 .
The Shanghai immigrant was owed $ 8,000 in severance pay .

“ It was not unusual for us to work 70 hours a week .
We worked from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. and the boss would n’t let you go until you finished the work , ” said Li , who filed a complaint and won his case with the Ontario Labour Relations Board this year .
“ Most people do n’t have knowledge of their rights .
Even if they do , they do n’t dare to fight for their rights because they are not the type to rock the boat . ”
The survey calls for stronger workplace audits and outreach to educate newcomers about their rights , including incorporating the topic in newcomer English classes .
Workers ' rights in Ontario
Minimum hourly wage : $ 10.25
Maximum work hours per week : 48 hours , without written consent
Eligibility for overtime pay : more than 44 hours
Overtime pay rate : 1.5 times base pay

His fight plan is a simple one : enter the Octagon , deliver the knockout blow and go home .
Former boxing champion James Toney has 83 professional fights under his belt , but none as a mixed martial artist .
That will change Aug. 28 when he meets Randy Couture at UFC 118 in Boston .
Taking on one of the greatest fighters in mixed martial arts history does n't bother Toney .
He believes the strategy that has worked throughout his boxing career will serve him well on fight night -- just keep punching .
His fight with Couture will be contested under MMA rules , but Toney could n't care less .
To him , it 's just another fight , and he promises to rely solely on his boxing skills to prove a point .
" I look at this [ fight ] as a way to show everybody that boxing ranks supreme , " Toney told ESPN.com recently while in Las Vegas to observe UFC 116 .
" It 's still the No. 1 sport ; it 's still the best sport .
I like MMA ; I 'm not a hater .
I watch it all the time .
" But when somebody like [ UFC president ] Dana White , who started in the boxing game , says that MMA is better than boxing -- then hold on .
You 're wrong there . "
It 's this attitude that motivated Couture to ask White for the chance to fight Toney .
Couture loves boxing , but not the disrespect he believes many boxers show toward mixed martial arts .
" The mixed martial artists I know have a ton of respect for boxers and what boxers do , " Couture told ESPN.com .
" Most of us train in boxing as part of our mixed martial arts training .
" You do n't hear too many mixed martial artists going around , running their mouths about how boring boxing is , which is what we could easily be saying about boxing .
On the other side of the coin , you continuously hear boxers running their mouths about how terrible mixed martial artists are with striking and how they 'd knock everybody out . "
The former UFC heavyweight and light heavyweight champion is confident his hand , not Toney 's , will be raised when the bout is over .
The Octagon is his domain , and he refuses to let a boxer walk in and dominate .
Couture ( 18 - 10 - 0 ) is one of the best fighters ever to compete in MMA .
His wrestling abilities are legendary , and he's also comfortable applying several other fighting disciplines .
The same can't be said for Toney .
The former International Boxing Federation middleweight , super middleweight and cruiserweight champion has never competed in wrestling , Muay Thai , jiu - jitsu or kickboxing .
Toney will rely primarily on his hands and is confident that will be enough to get the job done .
" In [ MMA ] you have people like Randy Couture who are scared , and will try to hold me like a girl , " said Toney , who has a professional boxing mark of 72 - 6 - 3 ( 2 no-contests ) .
" I 'm going to make him pay for that .
Everybody knows that if you 're inside on me , one mistake and that 's your ass .
" Did y'all tell Randy Couture that I 'm wearing smaller gloves ?
What do you think is going through his head right now ?
' How am I going to stay away from his hands ? '
That 's what he 's thinking . "
Interestingly , that is exactly what Couture has on his mind .
He knows
Toney is a very skilled striker whose hand speed and punching power are likely to increase with five - ounce MMA gloves .
There is n't a thing Randy Couture has n't seen in his 13 years inside the cage .
Martin McNeil for ESPN.com
But Couture is a seasoned mixed martial artist who knows his way around the Octagon .
There is nothing in the cage that Couture has n't seen or experienced .
He will have a huge advantage in the experience department .
Couture plans to avoid Toney 's striking , then use his inexperience in the cage against him .
" He 's a great striker ; he 's got good power .
To be honest , he 's going to be dangerous in that realm of the fight , " Couture said .
" If I try to trade punches with him , then [ getting knocked out ] is a possibility .
" That 's why I 'm doing my homework , and have no intention of standing in there and boxing with James Toney .
That would be stupid .
" Experience is a huge thing in our sport , but you can't discount the boxing experience that James has .
Many people did that with me when I started ; they discounted the years of wrestling experience I had .
This is an individual combative sport ; experience counts for something . "
Cage experience should play a significant role in this fight , especially if Couture can get Toney off his feet .
But like all fights , this contest will begin standing and that 's where Toney is at his best .
Toney will enter the cage with a chip on his shoulder .
He knows
White wants him to lose but vows it will never happen .
In fact , his intent is n't just to defeat Couture , but to humiliate him by registering a knockout .
" I heard all the things that Dana said , but if I listened to that I would n't be me , " Toney said .
" Losing is not an option .
I 'm not going in there to lose ; I 'm going in there to destroy this dude . "
Competing in the Octagon excites Toney .
He does n't have a shred of fear as the days wind down to his MMA debut .
His confidence is at an all - time high .
And while he wo n't allow the thought of losing to enter his mind , Toney is n't taking Couture lightly .
" Y'all talk about Randy this and Randy that , but if you look at my background , you know I have never had an easy fight , " Toney said .
" I 've fought the biggest and best fighters in the world .
Why should I be afraid of an MMA fighter ? "

One of the interesting things that the Lindau Meeting made clear is that ( if you 'll excuse a gross generalization ) , the physics community is splitting in two .
A large chunk of it , from theoreticians to cosmologists , is focused on CERN's Large Hadron Collider , waiting to see whether dark matter and supersymmetric particles come out of its collisions ( We 'll have much more on that in the near future , as our Lindau trip included a detour to CERN ) .
A good chunk of the rest of it , including CERN 's former Director General Carlo Rubbia and fellow Nobel Laureate Steven Chu , have decided to focus on something with the potential for a more immediate payback : energy .
Energy and climate issues were major topics at Lindau , featuring in the thoughts of and talks from various Laureates .
The events wrapped up with a panel discussion of energy issues that included Rubbia and Yuan Tseh Lee , as well as a physicist - turned - climate expert , the Potsdam Institute 's Hans Schellenhuber .
They were joined by a German politician , Georg Schütte , who spoke on some of the policy challenges .
Energy issues were presented as just one aspect of a larger sustainability challenge .
As Lee pointed out , if everyone on the planet lived the lifestyle of a typical American , we 'd need over five Earths to accommodate that level of consumption — he joked that countries should be categorized as " overdeveloped " or " not yet overdeveloped " while noting that even some of the developing world , like his native Taiwan , has already reached the overdeveloped state .
Because some of the things we now rely on , like hydrocarbons and helium , are present in deposits that will only be refreshed on geological time scales , Lee said that humanity is simply living beyond its means .
Rubbia echoed this point , suggesting that we 're living in the fossil age now , but the younger audience members would see it come to an end , replaced by advanced versions of solar and nuclear power , which would be relatively sustainable — the caveats being that accessible nuclear fuel supplies are finite .
If the implications of Rubbia 's expectations were n't clear , Schellenhuber spelled them out : to limit the risk of pushing the climate into a new equilibrium state , we'd have to decarbonize and move to sustainable energy sources within the next 40 years , after which we can focus on sustainability , which he termed " perpetual progress within boundaries . "
Unfortunately , population trends are going to add to that challenge ; he noted that estimates are that the global population will hit 9 billion by 40 years from now , before declining to something similar to today 's levels by the end of the century .
Lots of those people will be in the developing world , which has its good and bad points .
As Schütte , the government minister , noted , societies simply do n't develop an environmental awareness until they have a sufficient standard of living .
But Lee noted that if we take the amount of carbon we can afford to put in the atmosphere and divide it on a per-capita basis , then the citizens of places like Bangladesh are so far below the final figure that it provides them with an incredible development opportunity .
Solutions are in energy , not the atmosphere
With the rough issues outlined , the panel then fielded questions about some of the technologies that might play a role in a sustainable energy economy .
There was a clear consensus among the panel that the key tech would be emissions limiting , rather than something that would help us continue burning fossil fuels near current rates .
Nearly everyone thought carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology was terrible , but we should research it anyway .
Rubbia argued that removing 20 Gigatonnes a year would never be trivial , and we'd never have confidence that the storage locations would contain things for the sorts of time scales we 'd need .
He 'd rather see the CO 2 pulled out of the atmosphere via biofuels .
Schellenhuber said that , at the moment , CCS was only being used as cover for building more coal plants , but he feared we 'd probably overshoot our emissions targets , and needed to make sure we had the technology to pull some carbon back out of the atmosphere .
Similar things applied to geoengineering — it should only be used if we fail to get emissions down .
Most geoengineering solutions only fix part of the problem , since they do nothing about ocean acidification , which Schellenhuber termed " a big , big sleeping giant that will really come to get us . "
When it comes to generating power , there was a general sense that most of it would come from advanced versions of existing technologies like solar and wind .
Throughout the entire conference , there was a general pessimism about fusion , in part from a technological and physics standpoint , and because of the funding crisis being faced by the ITER fusion reactor .
About the only new technology that had anyone excited was nuclear fission of thorium , which is cleaner and more abundant than uranium — Rubbia is a big fan .
The panel was also asked a bit about transport issues , and largely echoed Robert Laughlin 's talk .
Physics seems to dictate that batteries will never get the same energy density as hydrocarbons , and their production relies on materials that also can't be extracted sustainably .
Hydrogen simply has too many storage and transport issues .
Rubbia is partial to methanol - based biofuels , while Schellenhuber thinks it might be time to rethink the car model entirely — he joked that we do n't expect ownership and autonomous control of elevators , even if we live in a high - rise .
Getting society onboard
So , if most of the technology we 'd need for sustainability is evolutionary , and sustainability is an issue we 'll have to deal with in one way or another , why is n't more of the public committed to doing something about the challenges ?
Here , the panel generally thought it was a problem with communications — one mentioned a job candidate that was recently rejected at his institution because people thought he spent too much time doing outreach to the public .
There was some thought that matters were better in the US , but that may simply be a product of none of the participants working here .
Even if things are better in terms of communications , recent public polling suggests that the public acceptance of climate science has , at best , been stable , and there 's certainly been little in the way of political action .
The panel suggested that there are two problems here .
The first , pointed out by Lee , is simply that the public does n't get the significance of global mean temperatures , in part because the daily changes in temperature are much larger .
Put another way , would we really notice a 2 °C shift when the daily temperature range is 20°C ?
Schellenhuber suggested the right metaphor might be body temperature .
When that rises by 2°C , we know there 's something wrong ; if we let it rise by 5 °C for a significant length of time , we 're dead .
The second is that the public has become completely confused about what areas of the science are well understood .
Schellenhuber said that attribution — assigning the recent temperature rise to anthropogenic CO 2 — is on strong footing .
Paleoclimatology shows that greenhouse gasses can " force " the climate ( that is , give the climate a shove ) , while the signature of greenhouse warming is apparent in data showing large temperature deviations after the sun sets and the atmosphere warming from the bottom up .
Modeling , he said , is useful , but is n't at the same level of sophistication .
It 's possible to make better models , but doing so involves large costs in terms of computing power and code , and we already know enough that the money is probably better spent on doing something about what we already know .
Overall , the value of the panel did n't seem to come from any new information they provided ; anyone who follows energy issues has heard all of this before .
Instead , it provided a glimpse into how some of the smarter people around view the huge array of potential solutions that have been offered .
There are definitely people out there excited by geoengineering and CSS , but they certainly did n't have fans on the panel , and nobody from the audience ( which included dozens of other Nobel Laureates ) leapt to defend them , or to promote fusion as being viable any time soon .
And the sorts of people who were on the panel , since they run major institutions and have a large voice in policy decisions , are likely to have a lot of say in where things actually go within the next 40 years , as the push to get the carbon out of our energy system intensifies .
A Japanese artist named Isao Hashimoto has created a series of works about nuclear weapons .
One is titled " 1945 -1998 " and shows a history of the world 's nuclear explosions .
Over the course of fourteen and a half minutes , every single one of the 2053 nuclear tests and explosions that took place between 1945 and 1998 are is plotted on a map .
A metronomic beep every second represents months passing , and a different tone indicates explosions from different countries .
It starts out slowly , with the Manhattan Project 's single test in the US and the two terrible bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended World War II .

After a couple of minutes or so , however , once the USSR and Britain entered the nuclear club , the tests really start to build up , reaching a peak of nearly 140 in 1962 , and remaining well over 40 each year until the mid-80s .
It 's a compelling insight into the history of humanity 's greatest destructive force , especially when you remember that only two nuclear explosions have ever been detonated offensively , both in 1945 .
Since then , despite more than 2,000 other tests and billions of dollars having been spent on their development , no nuclear warheads have been used in anger .

Albert Haynesworth 's inability to run a third 300 - yard sprint in a satisfactory time in the eyes of coach Mike Shanahan prevented him from practicing with the Redskins Thursday .
Haynesworth had to pass a conditioning test Thursday and he entered the day planning to do two sprints .
According to a source , Shanahan believed Haynesworth had too much rest time between his runs and asked for a third .
Haynesworth failed the third sprint .
A source said Haynesworth told Shanahan he never ran three such sprints during his best Pro Bowl seasons .
Shanahan then told Haynesworth that he must not have ever been in shape , according to the source .
" The bottom line , " Shanahan said , " is we 're going to get him in shape . "
Shanahan and Haynesworth have been feuding since Shanahan became coach of the Redskins in early January .
Haynesworth skipped all offseason work with the team because he did n't want to be in the team 's new 3 - 4 defensive scheme .
Haynesworth reported to the team Wednesday 30 to 40 pounds lighter but was told he would work with the backups when he returned to the field .
Haynesworth's only appearance came after the practice was over , when he spent about 20 minutes walking through some plays with two assistant coaches .
Looking perhaps 30 pounds leaner than he did a year ago , Haynesworth hovered around large upside - down trash bins -- representing offensive linemen -- as he learned the defense 's terminology .
He did n't speak to reporters .
Shanahan said Haynesworth will take the test once a day until he passes .
If Haynesworth fails , he 'll have to spend extra time on the treadmill -- as he did Thursday -- and will continue to be absent from practice .
Haynesworth boycotted the team 's offseason workouts and minicamps because he is unhappy with the Redskins ' switch to a 3 - 4 defense and wanted a trade .
When he finally returned to Redskins Park on Wednesday , he was told he would have to pass the conditioning test to take part in training camp and would start off practicing with the reserves .
Haynesworth was the only player required to take the test .
Everyone else on the team attended a certain percentage of offseason workouts required by Shanahan .
" The conditioning test , I do n't even think a lot of us guys that were even here 100 percent could have passed that thing , " cornerback DeAngelo Hall .
" But that 's what conditioning tests are , that 's what they 're supposed to be , they 're supposed to be some of them unattainable .
Some we 've had in the past were definitely unattainable . "
But Shanahan maintained that Haynesworth was not set up to fail .
He said all the other linemen essentially passed the test by taking part in the offseason workouts .
" It 's a very fair test , " Shanahan said .
" But more importantly , it keeps a guy from getting hurt .
I do n't want to put a guy out there that 's not ready to go , and all of a sudden there 's a setback for two weeks . "
Shanahan 's reasoning carried less weight on a day when practice was not particularly demanding , and on a day when receiver Malcolm Kelly was allowed to practice on a wet field despite nursing a sore hamstring .
Also , while conditioning tests are routine among NFL teams , failure to pass has n't necessarily excluded a player from participation .
The Redskins had three players fail the test in 2008 , but all three took part as usual in training camp practices .
When told he had failed the test , Haynesworth was " first - class all the way " in accepting the news , according to Shanahan .
The coach indicated there were no harsh words exchanged .
FoxSports.com first reported that Haynesworth had failed his conditioning test .
Haynesworth does n't want to play nose tackle in a 3 - 4 defense and would rather be in a scheme that gives him the freedom that helped make him a dominant player for many years with the Tennessee Titans .
But he also declined Shanahan 's offer to find another team and accepted a $ 21 million bonus on April 1 , part of the seven - year , $ 100 million deal signed as a free agent a year ago .
The saga overshadowed the team 's start of a new chapter with new coach Shanahan and new quarterback Donovan McNabb .
Players have tried to ignore the distraction , but several called Haynesworth " selfish " when he skipped the mandatory minicamp last month .
" The sooner all this gets behind us , " center Casey Rabach said , " it 'll be better for this team . "
Notes
CB Carlos Rogers signed his $ 1.54 million restricted free agent tender and took part in practice .
He waited until the last possible moment because he was unhappy not to get a long - term contract .
... OL Mike Williams , who is being treated for blood clots , was placed on the reserved non - football illness list .
... No. 4 overall draft pick Trent Williams is officially a holdout , missing the first day of camp while contract negotiations continue .
" I 'd be surprised if he 's not in here quickly , " Shanahan said .

Former Pentagon personnel official :
The warrior units are holding tanks for misfits
Here is a thoughtful and worried note from Noel Koch , who recently left his position at the Pentagon overseeing the " wounded warrior " program , about " warrior transition units , " or WTUs , which he says that despite their publicity have become dumping grounds for soldiers who never should have been recruited - and most , he reveals , have never seen combat .
By Noel Koch
Best Defense guest columnist
Our men and women in uniform today represent the finest fighting force ever fielded .
The only problem ?
There are n’t enough of them .
The evidence has been multiplying and cascading down on the Pentagon since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It includes the assignment of military duties to extravagantly paid private contractors because there are not enough soldiers to perform these duties ; the use of " stop - loss " orders to keep personnel past the end of their contracts , at which point their service is no longer " voluntary " ; and , because " stop - loss " is not a sufficient expedient , the call up of National Guardsmen to deploy , at the age of 45 or 50 , to Iraq or Afghanistan .
These desperate attempts at patching institutional shortfalls have human consequences : spouses are deployed multiple times as marriages falter and fail and children grow up with a parent they scarcely know ; soldiers take their lives in record numbers , their deaths lamely assigned to " relationship problems " ; and , most tellingly , recruiting NCOs commit suicide because they can’t bear the brutal stress put on them to bring in more people when qualified people are unwilling to join the military .
The Army says it is meeting its recruiting quotas , but many of those recruited are unfit for service .
The evidence for that can be found in the failure of our Warrior Transition Units .
Over the past eleven months my colleagues and I spent countless weeks visiting these units and hundreds of hours talking to the men and women in them .
The WTUs were created following the discovery of substandard conditions in temporary quarters at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
They were intended to assist with the healing of combat - wounded service personnel .
Yet the majority of the people in these units today are not combat - wounded .
To the contrary , most have never left the country .
To understand how this happens , recall the stressed - out recruiting sergeants .
To meet their quotas people who are physically unfit ; mentally unfit ; emotionally unstable ; or , who have criminal histories and disciplinary problems are recruited .
Commanders refuse to deploy with these people .
So , commonly , they are put in the Warrior Transition Units , which is why these are called " warehouses " and " dumping grounds . "
Here ’s a snapshot : I am in a room with 35 soldiers .
The one first in front of me is glassy - eyed , staring into the middle distance , and I have to raise my voice to get his attention .
Wilson , what are you doing here ?
" I ’m schizophrenic , sir . "
How old are you ?
" Nineteen , sir . "
You have n’t been downrange , have you , son ?
" No , sir . "
Smith , why are you here ?
" I ’m bi-polar , sir . "
How old are you ?
" Twenty , sir . "
Have you deployed ?
" No , sir . "
Same glassy - eyed look .
The next youngster is also twenty .
He suffers from depression .
He ca n’t be deployed .
And so on .
Some are physically unfit .
Some exhibit mental health problems .
Others are disciplinary cases .
All dumped in the WTUs .
Oddly enough , many tend to get quite comfortable in these units and are adept at finding ways to remain in them for months reaching into years , as they dream up new complaints .
Meanwhile , the limited numbers of personnel who actually are combat - wounded feel stigmatized by being lumped together with people they consider malingerers ; they do n’t want to be in the WTUs , but would rather be sent back to their regular units to heal .
So , in the end , the entire purpose of the WTUs is defeated .
About the glassy - eyed look ?
Here ’s a snapshot from another WTU session .
A visibly agitated soldier tells me , " A lot of times I run out of my meds when the dispensary is closed and I ca n’t get a refill when I need it . "
I ask him what he is taking , and he tells me Percocet .
I ask him how many he takes that he can’t time his refills with the dispensary schedule .
He says he has a jar of the stuff that he takes when he needs it .
This turns out to be a common problem , and an uncontrollable one in the WTUs .
In Vietnam the enemy turned our war fighters into drug addicts .
Today , their caregivers are doing it .
These , in aggregate , are the results of going to war with insufficient manpower .
These are the evidences of the failure of the All Volunteer Force .
There was a time when the draft bound our nation together .
Many believe that any attempt to restore it today could risk tearing us apart .
Still , more and more people , quietly , are coming to the conclusion that careful consideration has to be given to restoring the draft .
The alternative is to continue to rely on that less than one percent of the American population that currently defends the nation to produce our war fighters and the question that prompts is simple enough :
Are we going to continue to send these few back to the battle again and again and again until their marriages collapse , and their children are resentful strangers to them , and they are either battle - crazed or suicidal or homicidal – the way we do now ?
And how long can we depend on that expedient ?
How long can we afford to delude ourselves about the efficacy of the All Volunteer Force ?
All the problems noted here were regularly recorded and reported to the appropriate officials in the Defense Department .
Noel Koch served as the Obama Administration ’s first Deputy Undersecretary of Defense heading the Office of Wounded Warrior Care and Transition Policy .
He is a Vietnam Veteran , served as Special Assistant to two Presidents and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and Director for Special Planning in the Reagan Administration .
Everyone and their brother intuitively knows that the current government fiscal deficits in the developed world are unsustainable .
They have to be brought under control , but that requires some short - term pain .
Today we look at a rather remarkable piece of research from the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) on what the fiscal crisis may morph into in the future , how much pain will be needed , and what will happen if various countries stay on their present courses .
Some countries could end up paying north of 20 % of GDP just on the interest to serve their debt , within just 30 years .
Of course , the markets will not allow that to happen , long before it ever gets to that level .
And what makes this important is that this is not some wild - eyed blogger , it 's the BIS , a fairly sober crowd of capable economists .
We will pay some attention .
Then I 'll throw in another few paragraphs about Goldman .
But first , I want to bring a very worthy cause to your attention .
For my Strategic Investment Conference last weekend , Jon Sundt and I bought some mighty fine wine for our guests .
That of course , is to be expected .
But each of those bottles also bought a wheelchair for someone in a most needy part of the world .
Here 's the story .
Gordon Homes at Lookout Ridge Winery in Napa Valley has gotten five cult winemakers to create special wines for him .
These are winemakers whose production is sold out well in advance - they 're the all - stars of wine ( like Screaming Eagle ) .
And while they can't sell them from their own wineries , they blend these special signature wines for Lookout Ridge .
Each bottle sells for $ 100 , well below what it would take to get one of these cult artists ' bottles - even if you could get them .
And then Lookout Ridge donates the entire amount to buying a wheelchair for someone who can't afford one in a less - developed country .
Attendees at our conference bought enough to send 200 chairs to people desperate for mobility all over the world .
Part of it was , I am sure , that it is a very worthy cause , and part of it is that the wines are damn good .
The web page is http://www.lookoutridge.com/lookoutridge/index.jsp.
Click on " wine for wheels " on the top bar , and then on some of the links on the page that comes up .
Look at the smiles on the faces of people who got a chair !
And then order a few bottles .
You will thank me when you drink it , and someone in need of mobility will thank you .
Now , on to the letter .
There Had to Be a Short
Somebody needs to brief Senators before they get on TV and ask irate questions which demonstrate they have no idea what they are talking about .
Expressing shock that someone was short on the trade in question shows you do n't understand the trade .
Let me see if I can offer some clarity .
Normally , you think of a Collateralized Debt Obligation ( CDO ) as a pool of mortgages .
This pool is broken into anywhere from 6 to 15 tranches .
The highest - rated tranches get their money back first , and the rating agencies made them AAA .
While the lowest level would be called the equity portion and be first in line to lose , in theory it paid a very high yield .
It was usually not rated .
But the level just above that is BBB ( just barely investment - grade ) , and that was typically about 4 % of the total deal , but paid a much higher yield than the " safe " AAA portion .
Now , here is where it gets interesting .
Investment banks would take the BBB portions of these Residential Mortgage - Backed Securities , which were not as easy to sell , and combine them in a CDO , which the rating agencies then rated using models based on data provided by the investment banks themselves .
Since this combining of BBB tranches supposedly created diversification that the rating firms ' models indicated would drastically limit delinquencies and defaults , the AAA tranche of the CDO was jacked up to 75 % of the total capital structure , with 12 % rated AA .
Only 4 % was typically considered BBB .
So pools of mortgages that probably should have been rated below BBB were miraculously turned into a CDO with 87 % of its capital structure rated AAA and AA and only 4 % rated BBB , with a chunk as equity .
( I wrote about this in January of 2007 , based on material from Gary Shilling and others , plus my own research , although I think I wrote about it in an earlier letter as well . )
Who would buy this stuff ?
Mostly institutions that were reaching for yield in what was , in 2007 , a very low - yield world .
Yield hogs .
And institutions that trusted the rating agencies .
But the CDO in the Goldman case was not this type of CDO .
It was hard to find enough BBB pieces to put together a CDO of the type described above , and the demand was high .
Remember , everyone knew that housing could only go up .
So , what 's an investment bank to do ?
They create a synthetic CDO .
Follow this closely .
The various investment banks - it was way more than just Goldman ; rumors are it was up to 16 of them - would construct an artificial CDO fund based on the performance of BBB tranches in other deals .
Let me see if I can simplify this .
It is as if I had a very negative view about a particular industry for which there was no future or index or liquid security .
We could go to an investment bank and ask them to create a " hypothetical " index that would mirror the performance of this industry .
I would be willing to short that index .
But unless the bank wanted to be long that index , they would have to find a buyer who would take the long position .
Presumably the buyer would have a different view than me .
Now , by definition there has to be a short for the long , and vice versa .
This is a synthetic index .
It exists only as a spreadsheet and performs in conjunction with the components it 's modeled upon .
Numerous hedge funds did not think the rating agencies knew what they were talking about when it came to the mortgage ratings .
They also believed we were in a housing bubble .
So they went to a number of investment banks and asked them to construct synthetic ( derivative ) CDOs that they could short .
And there were buyers on the other side who wanted the yield , who trusted the agencies , and who believed that housing could only go up .
As to the Goldman deal , the buyers had to know there was someone short on the other side .
By definition there was a short .
Besides , they had a guarantee from ACA on the AAA portion ( which of course went bad , as I wrote about later that year ) - there was a guaranteed AAA yield a few points higher than with normal AAA debt .
What could be better ?
Except of course that it was too good to be true .
Learn a lesson , gentle reader .
Do n't reach for yield .
The hedge funds that shorted the synthetic CDOs took real risk .
They had to pay the interest on the underlying tranches to the investors who were long .
And if the housing market continued to rise , and the bubble did not burst , they could easily lose a lot , if not all , of their money .
No one knows when a bubble will burst .
The markets can be irrational longer than you can remain solvent .
Let 's be very clear .
This was purely gambling .
No money was invested in mortgages or any productive enterprise .
This was one group betting against another , and a LOT of these deals were done all over New York and London .
The SEC alleges that there was material lack of disclosure .
I must admit that I would want to know that the person who was taking the short position had a hand in the creation of the pool of BBB paper I was buying .
And if Fabrice Tourre told someone that Paulson was $ 200 million long when they were actually net short , that could be problematic .
Now , if he just said that Paulson bought the equity portion of the synthetic CDO ( there has to be one ) , that will be a different matter .
The prosecutor for the SEC is by all accounts a very solid and serious person who would not move this case forward if he did not think they would win .
This is not one the SEC will want to lose .
On the other hand , I hope that Goldman takes this to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ( the final decision maker in a long and arduous process ) , as there are some very interesting aspects to this case that I would like to see resolved , as an individual in the industry .
On someone else 's legal bill .
I wonder why Goldman 's witnesses seemed ill - prepared .
Did their lawyers tell them to keep it simple and not get into a spirited defense ?
My instinct says that a lot more will come out about this case .
If it was just this one deal , then Goldman should pay the fine and walk away .
Done all the time .
I suspect there is more here .
Or maybe it was just that they did n't want to explain why they were doing a synthetic CDO .
We 'll see when someone writes the book .
How Should Our Institutions Invest ?
However , the larger and far more critical question is , why were institutions buying synthetic CDOs in the first place ?
This is an investment that had no productive capital at work and no remotely socially redeeming value .
It did not go to fund mortgages or buy capital equipment or build malls or office buildings .
It seems to me there is a certain social responsibility when you have institutional capital and manage pensions .
It 's one thing to buy a gambling stock ; it 's quite another to be the gambler , especially if it is not your capital at risk , and by being a yield hog you increase your bonuses .
The hedge funds were risking their capital .
The institutions were risking other people 's money .
And let 's be clear , the counterparties in the Goldman deal , at least , were very knowledgeable players .
They knew exactly what they were buying .
OK , enough .
Let 's move onto the BIS paper .
The Future of Public Debt
For the rest of this letter , and probably next week as well , we are going to look at a paper from the Bank of International Settlements , often thought of as the central bankers ' central bank .
This paper was written by Stephen G. Cecchetti , M. S. Mohanty , and Fabrizio Zampolli . ( http://www.bis.org/publ/work300.pdf?noframes=1)
The paper looks at fiscal policy in a number of countries and , when combined with the implications of age - related spending ( public pensions and health care ) , determines where levels of debt in terms of GDP are going .
The authors do n't mince words .
They write at the beginning :
" Our projections of public debt ratios lead us to conclude that the path pursued by fiscal authorities in a number of industrial countries is unsustainable .
Drastic measures are necessary to check the rapid growth of current and future liabilities of governments and reduce their adverse consequences for long - term growth and monetary stability . "
Drastic measures is not language you typically see in an economic paper from the BIS .
But the picture they paint for the 12 countries they cover is one for which drastic measures is well - warranted .
I am going to quote extensively from the paper , as I want their words to speak for themselves , and I 'll add some color and explanation as needed .
Also , all emphasis is mine .
" The politics of public debt vary by country .
In some , seared by unpleasant experience , there is a culture of frugality .
In others , however , profligate official spending is commonplace .
In recent years , consolidation has been successful on a number of occasions .
But fiscal restraint tends to deliver stable debt ; rarely does it produce substantial reductions .
And , most critically , swings from deficits to surpluses have tended to come along with either falling nominal interest rates , rising real growth , or both .
Today , interest rates are exceptionally low and the growth outlook for advanced economies is modest at best .
This leads us to conclude that the question is when markets will start putting pressure on governments , not if .
" When , in the absence of fiscal actions , will investors start demanding a much higher compensation for the risk of holding the increasingly large amounts of public debt that authorities are going to issue to finance their extravagant ways ?
In some countries , unstable debt dynamics , in which higher debt levels lead to higher interest rates , which then lead to even higher debt levels , are already clearly on the horizon .
" It follows that the fiscal problems currently faced by industrial countries need to be tackled relatively soon and resolutely .
Failure to do so will raise the chance of an unexpected and abrupt rise in government bond yields at medium and long maturities , which would put the nascent economic recovery at risk .
It will also complicate the task of central banks in controlling inflation in the immediate future and might ultimately threaten the credibility of present monetary policy arrangements .
" While fiscal problems need to be tackled soon , how to do that without seriously jeopardising the incipient economic recovery is the current key challenge for fiscal authorities . "
They start by dealing with the growth in fiscal ( government ) deficits and the growth in debt .
The US has exploded from a fiscal deficit of 2.8 % to 10.4 % today , with only a small 1.3 % reduction for 2011 projected .
Debt will explode ( the correct word ! ) from 62 % of GDP to an estimated 100 % of GDP by the end of 2011 .
Remember that Rogoff and Reinhart show that when the ratio of debt to GDP rises above 90 % , there seems to be a reduction of about 1 % in GDP .
The authors of this paper , and others , suggest that this might come from the cost of the public debt crowding out productive private investment .
Think about that for a moment .
We are on an almost certain path to a debt level of 100 % of GDP in less than two years .
If trend growth has been a yearly rise of 3.5 % in GDP , then we are reducing that growth to 2.5 % at best .
And 2.5 % trend GDP growth will NOT get us back to full employment .
We are locking in high unemployment for a very long time , and just when some one million people will soon be falling off the extended unemployment compensation rolls .
Government transfer payments of some type now make up more than 20 % of all household income .
That is set up to fall rather significantly over the year ahead unless unemployment payments are extended beyond the current 99 weeks .
There seems to be little desire in Congress for such a measure .
That will be a significant headwind to consumer spending .
Government debt - to - GDP for Britain will double from 47 % in 2007 to 94 % in 2011 and rise 10 % a year unless serious fiscal measures are taken .
Greece 's level will swell from 104 % to 130 % , so the US and Britain are working hard to catch up to Greece , a dubious race indeed .
Spain is set to rise from 42 % to 74 % and " only " 5 % a year thereafter ; but their economy is in recession , so GDP is shrinking and unemployment is 20 % .
Portugal ?
71 % to 97 % in the next two years , and there is almost no way Portugal can grow its way out of its problems .
Japan will end 2011 with a debt ratio of 204 % and growing by 9 % a year .
They are taking almost all the savings of the country into government bonds , crowding out productive private capital .
Reinhart and Rogoff , with whom you should by now be familiar , note that three years after a typical banking crisis the absolute level of public debt is 86 % higher , but in many cases of severe crisis the debt could grow by as much as 300 % .
Ireland has more than tripled its debt in just five years .
The BIS continues :
" We doubt that the current crisis will be typical in its impact on deficits and debt .
The reason is that , in many countries , employment and growth are unlikely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the foreseeable future .
As a result , unemployment and other benefits will need to be paid for several years , and high levels of public investment might also have to be maintained .
" The permanent loss of potential output caused by the crisis also means that government revenues may have to be permanently lower in many countries .
Between 2007 and 2009 , the ratio of government revenue to GDP fell by 2 - 4 percentage points in Ireland , Spain , the United States and the United Kingdom .
It is difficult to know how much of this will be reversed as the recovery progresses .
Experience tells us that the longer households and firms are unemployed and underemployed , as well as the longer they are cut off from credit markets , the bigger the shadow economy becomes . "
We are going to skip a few sections and jump to the heart of their debt projections .
Again , I am going to quote extensively , and my comments will be in brackets [ ] .
Note that these graphs are in color and are easier to read in color ( but not too difficult if you are printing it out ) .
Also , I usually summarize , but this is important .
I want you to get the full impact .
Then I will make some closing observations .
The Future Public Debt Trajectory
" We now turn to a set of 30 - year projections for the path of the debt / GDP ratio in a dozen major industrial economies ( Austria , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Japan , the Netherlands , Portugal , Spain , the United Kingdom and the United States ) .
We choose a 30 - year horizon with a view to capturing the large unfunded liabilities stemming from future age - related expenditure without making overly strong assumptions about the future path of fiscal policy ( which is unlikely to be constant ) .
In our baseline case , we assume that government total revenue and non-age - related primary spending remain a constant percentage of GDP at the 2011 level as projected by the OECD .
Using the CBO and European Commission projections for age - related spending , we then proceed to generate a path for total primary government spending and the primary balance over the next 30 years .
Throughout the projection period , the real interest rate that determines the cost of funding is assumed to remain constant at its 1998 - 2007 average , and potential real GDP growth is set to the OECD - estimated post - crisis rate .
[ That makes these estimates quite conservative , as growth - rate estimates by the OECD are well on the optimistic side . ]
Debt Projections
" From this exercise , we are able to come to a number of conclusions .
First , in our baseline scenario , conventionally computed deficits will rise precipitously .
Unless the stance of fiscal policy changes , or age - related spending is cut , by 2020 the primary deficit / GDP ratio will rise to 13 % in Ireland ; 8 - 10 % in Japan , Spain , the United Kingdom and the United States ; [ Wow ! ] and 3 - 7 % in Austria , Germany , Greece , the Netherlands and Portugal .
Only in Italy do these policy settings keep the primary deficits relatively well contained - a consequence of the fact that the country entered the crisis with a nearly balanced budget and did not implement any real stimulus over the past several years .
" But the main point of this exercise is the impact that this will have on debt .
The results plotted as the red line in Graph 4 [ below ] show that , in the baseline scenario , debt / GDP ratios rise rapidly in the next decade , exceeding 300 % of GDP in Japan ; 200 % in the United Kingdom ; and 150 % in Belgium , France , Ireland , Greece , Italy and the United States .
And , as is clear from the slope of the line , without a change in policy , the path is unstable .
This is confirmed by the projected interest rate paths , again in our baseline scenario .
Graph 5 [ below ] shows the fraction absorbed by interest payments in each of these countries .
From around 5 % today , these numbers rise to over 10 % in all cases , and as high as 27 % in the United Kingdom .
" Seeing that the status quo is untenable , countries are embarking on fiscal consolidation plans .
In the United States , the aim is to bring the total federal budget deficit down from 11 % to 4 % of GDP by 2015 .
In the United Kingdom , the consolidation plan envisages reducing budget deficits by 1.3 percentage points of GDP each year from 2010 to 2013 ( see eg OECD ( 2009a ) ) .
" To examine the long - run implications of a gradual fiscal adjustment similar to the ones being proposed , we project the debt ratio assuming that the primary balance improves by 1 percentage point of GDP in each year for five years starting in 2012 .
The results are presented as the green line in Graph 4 .
Although such an adjustment path would slow the rate of debt accumulation compared with our baseline scenario , it would leave several major industrial economies with substantial debt ratios in the next decade .
" This suggests that consolidations along the lines currently being discussed will not be sufficient to ensure that debt levels remain within reasonable bounds over the next several decades .
" An alternative to traditional spending cuts and revenue increases is to change the promises that are as yet unmet .
Here , that means embarking on the politically treacherous task of cutting future age - related liabilities .
With this possibility in mind , we construct a third scenario that combines gradual fiscal improvement with a freezing of age - related spending - to - GDP at the projected level for 2011 .
The blue line in Graph 4 shows the consequences of this draconian policy .
Given its severity , the result is no surprise : what was a rising debt / GDP ratio reverses course and starts heading down in Austria , Germany and the Netherlands .
In several others , the policy yields a significant slowdown in debt accumulation .
Interestingly , in France , Ireland , the United Kingdom and the United States , even this policy is not sufficient to bring rising debt under control .
[ And yet , many countries , including the US , will have to contemplate something along these lines .
We simply cannot fund entitlement growth at expected levels .
Note that in the US , even by " draconian " estimates , debt - to - GDP still grows to 200 % in 30 years .
That shows you just how out of whack our entitlement programs are .
Sidebar :
This also means that if we - the US - decide as a matter of national policy that we do indeed want these entitlements , it will most likely mean a substantial VAT tax , as we will need vast sums to cover the costs , but with that will come slower growth . ]
[ Long before interest rates rise even to 10 % of GDP in the early 2020s , the bond market will have rebeled .
This is a chart of things that can not be .
Therefore we should be asking ourselves what is the End Game if the fiscal deficits are not brought under control . ]
" All of this leads us to ask : what level of primary balance would be required to bring the debt / GDP ratio in each country back to its pre-crisis , 2007 level ?
Granted that countries which started with low levels of debt may never need to come back to this point , the question is an interesting one nevertheless .
Table 3 presents the average primary surplus target required to bring debt ratios down to their 2007 levels over horizons of 5 , 10 and 20 years .
An aggressive adjustment path to achieve this objective within five years would mean generating an average annual primary surplus of 8 - 12 % of GDP in the United States , Japan , the United Kingdom and Ireland , and 5 - 7 % in a number of other countries .
A preference for smoothing the adjustment over a longer horizon ( say , 20 years ) reduces the annual surplus target at the cost of leaving governments exposed to high debt ratios in the short to medium term .
[ Can you imagine the US being able to run a budget surplus of even 2.4 % of GDP ?
$ 350 billion - plus a year ?
That would be a swing in the budget of almost 10 % of GDP . ]
That is enough for today .
We will delve further next week .
Montreal , New York , Connecticut , and Italy
Join Me in Paris
I have to tell you , the conference last week was awesome .
The energy in the room was great .
The speeches and conversations were amazing .

NSFW A Paraguayan model has promised to run naked through the streets of Asunción , painted in her team 's colours , if the South American country triumphs in the World Cup .
Larissa Riquelme has been getting plenty of coverage for lending her considerable support to the national side from a square in the capital , where she has has been eyeballing the big - screen action with thousands of fellow fans .
Much to the delight of photographers , the 24 - year - old turns out in a patriotic low - cut top with a mobile phone wedged between her ample bosoms , as you can see in the snap from her Facebook photo album .
This , according to globoesporte.com , is a publicity stunt for a mobile phone company , which has proved less successful for the sponsors than for Ms Riquelme .
Indeed , while globoesporte.com fails to name the company in question , it notes that the model has been bombarded with offers of work , while flashing her assets around the world .
Regarding her promise to bare all , we sadly suspect she wo n't be obliged to deliver . ®
Image caption Israel claims munitions seized were first loaded on a Manx - registered ship
A BBC investigation has uncovered questions over whether Iranian ships have been registered in the Isle of Man to evade international sanctions .
Later this month Foreign Secretary William Hague and his EU counterparts are expected to release more details about the latest round of European sanctions aimed at halting Iran 's military machine and possible development of weapons of mass destruction .
But a File on 4 investigation has discovered questions over whether the Iranians have already sidestepped the international arms embargo , on the UK's own doorstep by setting up companies in the Isle of Man to register ships for its fleet .
The Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line ( IRISL ) has been under increasing levels of international sanctions during the past two years for its part in smuggling nuclear technologies and ballistic missile parts as well as for running weapons to other groups allied to the regime in Tehran .
Thousands of miles away from the Gulf , on the Isle of Man , a tiny UK Crown Dependency in the Irish Sea which has its own laws and an ancient parliament , a local businessman has been involved in transferring the ownership of IRISL vessels into six companies he has helped to form .
' Normal ownership '
Captain Nigel Malpass , a marine consultant based in the island 's capital Douglas , is one of two directors named for these companies , the other is Ahmad Sarkandi , an Iranian who is also a leading executive in the state shipping line .
Captain Malpass would not be interviewed by the BBC but said the companies had been formed at the request of a German bank which holds a mortgage on all of the ships .
In a statement he said the transactions were governed by English law and the way companies were set up was " the absolute norm in the business of ship ownership " .
We should n't be expected to take action the rest of the world wo n't .
Tony Brown , Chief Minister , Isle of Man
He added that the Manx authorities approved his business dealings which were arranged some years before the sanctions came into force .
Captain Malpass did not address whether these arrangements are also helping the Iranians evade the sanctions .
Concerns were raised last month in the Manx Parliament but the island 's chief minister Tony Brown maintained that an investigation had revealed no wrongdoing and he denied that the island had aided any breach of the sanctions .
" We have to be realistic we can't do any more , we should n't be expected to do any more . "
He added : " Why should we shut down legitimate businesses .... we should n't be expected to take action the rest of the world wo n't . "
Arms seizure
However incidents such as the seizure of a huge cache of arms and ammunition by Israeli naval commandos last November on a ship called the Francop off Cyprus pose further questions for Manx authorities .
The Israelis claim the arms were in crates carrying the logos of IRISL or the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , and alleged the consignment had originally set sail from Iran to Egypt in an IRISL ship , the Douglas - registered Visea .
The BBC has found that the Visea 's owners are Byfleet Shipping company , which is also based in the Manx capital .
Captain Malpass is one of Byfleet 's two directors , which also has some of its shares owned by IRISL .

File on 4 was broadcast on Radio 4 at 2000 BST on Tuesday , 6 July and at 1700 BST on Sunday , 11 July Subscribe to the File on 4 podcast
There is no suggestion that Captain Malpass had any knowledge of the activities of the ships owned by the companies of which he was the director .
In a statement he said : " IRISL has always strenuously denied these unproven allegations made by Israel 's Foreign Ministry in respect of MV Visea .
" The matter was investigated in depth by the authorities in the Isle of Man responsible for monitoring such activities and after fully investigating the allegations , the authorities have been satisfied that that there was nothing carried out by myself or my associates which could be interpreted as infringing the appropriate sanctions . "
' Untouchable firms ? '
Manx chief Minister Mr Brown said Israel should raise the matter with the UN .
But this attitude has been sharply criticised by Israeli official , Ran Gidor , a political adviser at its embassy in London .
" Even assuming the resident in the Isle of Man had no clear knowledge of the contents of the ship the very fact he chose to get involved with shipping traffic going in and out of Iran would expose him or risk .
" We think the word should spread IRISL and its straw companies and subsidiaries are untouchables .
You may think you know what you are getting involved in but you do n't really "
In a statement to the BBC , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in regards to sanctions : " The issue is a matter for the Isle of Man government . "
It added : " The Ministry of Justice is in regular touch with the governments of the Crown Dependencies , including the Isle of Man , about a wide range of issues . "

The dollar plunged today following a United Nations report which called for the greenback to be replaced as the global reserve currency by the International Monetary Fund ’s special drawing rights ( SDRs ) .
The dollar ’s trend of moving inversely to the stock market has seemingly been snapped , with the Dow Jones falling over 100 points at one stage today .
However , as soon as markets began to claw back losses , the greenback failed to follow suit , indicating that whichever way markets move , the dollar is in big trouble .
The UN report called for “ abandoning the U.S. dollar as the main global reserve currency , saying it has been unable to safeguard value , ” according to Reuters .
“ A new global reserve system could be created , one that no longer relies on the United States dollar as the single major reserve currency , ” stated the report , adding that this new system should not be based on a basket of currencies , but on IMF - controlled SDR’s .
Following globalist moves to restore confidence in the single currency euro in the aftermath of the Bilderberg and G20 meetings , the concern has shifted from sovereign debt issues of countries like Greece and Spain , to the worsening state of the U.S. economy and the risk of a double - dip recession .
In the immediate aftermath of the 2010 Bilderberg meeting in Spain , at which globalists resolved to save the euro from collapse in an effort to restore confidence in their ultimate goal of a global single currency , the euro began to make a recovery and today rose against the dollar by over 1.5 per cent .
A cascade of negative U.S. economic data was released today , with job figures turning sour once again .
“ Jobless claims were a disaster , coming in at 472 k , on expectations of 455 k , ” reports Zero Hedge .
“ The economy has now entered the “ total freefall ” area ” .
The dollar is being targeted for destruction because the financial terrorists who caused the economic collapse in the first place want to exploit the crisis in order to institute a new global currency issued by a global central bank .
In May , IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn told elitists in Zurich Switzerland that the introduction of a global currency backed by a global central bank would act as the “ lender of last resort ” in the event of a severe economic crisis , another lurch towards fascist centralization of power in pursuit of a system of global governance .
Alex Jones breaks down the takeover by offshore banking powers– newly empowered by Congress ’ banking “ reform , ” expanded taxes worldwide , as well as accelerated moves towards ending the Dollar ’s reserve status , including urging from a recent United Nations report .
“ This is as big as World War I or World War II , ” Alex Jones warns .
“ What is happening now is bigger than the banking takeover of 1913 … it is a worldwide financial coup d’etat . ”

Two parents have claimed that a toy cow they bought for their child advocates ' learning sex ' .
Jodie Cairns , 20 , and her partner Zac Walker , 20 , of Wester Hailes , had given the Moosical Beads plush toy to their 4 - month old son Ethan , Edinburgh Evening News reports .
According to the lyric sheet , the cow sings : " I 'm a cow come play with me / Learning colours and shapes , yippee ! / A , B , C and 1,2,3 / We 'll have so much fun , you 'll see . "
However , the couple are convinced that the singing product from electronic toy company VTech sings " learning colours and sex " .
Cairns said : " Ethan 's grandma bought the toy from Tesco in March as a present , but we did n't get it out of the box because he was too little .
Then yesterday we started playing with it and we noticed that it appeared to be saying ' sex ' .
" We listened to it again and again and thought ' Oh my God ' .
It 's shocking - what if my boy had been a lot older ?
What would they say about us as parents . "
Ethan 's grandfather Brian Walker , 55 , added : " I recorded it on my computer so I could get a clearer version of the song , and I played it over and over .
I 'm certain it 's saying ' sex ' .
" My theory is that some technician has been having a laugh , but I suppose somebody could have gotten the word wrong by accident as it was made in China .
We know he 's just young and does n't understand now , but what if a toddler was listening to it ? "
Grandmother Beverley Walker said : " We 've confiscated the cow . "

Just before Climategate , we were reflecting on the apparent non-“ robustness ” of the Yamal chronology to inclusion of Khadyta data .
Briffa ’s response was that he could still “ get ” a HS by adding in Yadoyayakha and Porzayakha ring width data that had n’t been used in Briffa ( 2000 ) .
As noted in other posts , Khadyta is n’t the only site with a divergence problem .
Divergence , if anything , is the rule , rather than the exception .
Briffa did n’t discuss why there were such differences between the sites – something that I ’ll consider briefly today .
First here is a plot showing the ten YAD core chronologies ( the chronologies , as usual , divide ring width by a negative exponential to adjust for aging . )
YAD061 , the “ most influential tree in the world ” , surges off the page , closing at an astonishing 8 units .
Next is a plot showing 15 Khadyta River core chronologies that go to 1990 .
None of these core chronologies are rocketing off the top of the page – an entirely different impression to the YAD chronologies .
Statistically , the inconsistency between the two sites creates all sorts of problems .
The idea behind using chronologies as a proxy for temperature is that ring widths , after an allowance for aging , are a linear function of temperature .
However , something else needs to be invoked in order to explain the huge difference between nearby sites .
How can one “ thermometer ” read 8 - sigma , while the other is below normal ?
This is a difficult and interesting statistical question – one that is n’t even posed in Team literature .
A relatively recent study , Devi et al 2008 ( needless to say , not cited by Oxburgh ) , appears to me to shed considerable light on the conundrum .
here ’s their Figure 8 , showing ring widths for Siberian larch that switched from a creeping ( krummholz ) form to an upright form in the 20th century .
The generic shape of these diagrams is highly reminiscent of the YAD core plots at issue .
Devi et al 2008 Figure 8 .
Devi et al described their observations as follows :
Vertical stems started to appear after 1900 , with most of them appearing in the 1920s and 1930s ( Figs 7 and 8 ) .
The change from creeping to vertical growth led to significant growth enhancements of the multi-stemmed trees , as indicated by the increases in the ring widths of the horizontal stems of multi-stemmed trees ( Fig. 8 ) .
Approximately one to two decades after the stems had started to grow vertically , ring widths increased 2 - to 10 - fold , which were much greater than the increases in ring width of single - stemmed trees during the same period .
2- to 10 - fold increases in ring width !
The same sort of thing that we ’re seeing at the YAD site .
Look back at core YAD061 .
It grows at relatively low rates for its first 100 years or so and then surges to 8 times the growth rate around 1950 – in this case , a little later than the growth surge in the Polar Urals cores shown here .
Now look at core YAD041 – its fluctuations are highly correlated to YAD061 , but it experienced a growth surge early in the 20th century and has dramatically tailed off in the second half of the 20th century .
The shapes of these curves is very similar to the Polar Urals krummholz - to - upright curves .
It sure seems plausible to me that the huge “ late - life ” growth surge in important YAD cores might be due to the same effect .

A Supreme Court decision forced a California state university Christian society to accept gays as members as a condition of receiving support from the school ( " Other groups may exclude or mistreat Jews , blacks , and women — or those who do not share their contempt for Jews , blacks , and women .
A free society must tolerate such groups .
It need not subsidize them , give them its official imprimatur , or grant them equal access to law school facilities . " ) .
This ruling has upset Mike Adams , a prof at UNC Wilmington .
He 's vowed to disrupt atheist student societies by filling their rosters with Christian evangelical students , " to use my young fundamentalist Christian warriors to undermine the mission of every group that disagrees with me on the existence of God . "
As PZ Myers points out , if the situation were reversed , Adams and his fellow travelers would doubtless be even more apoplectic : " I can just imagine what would happen if I tried to turn freethinkers on campus into militant disruptors of other organizations : their faculty advisors would descend on me in fury . "
But Mike Adams is n't looking for debate .
As he says , " I do not seek robust debate .
I seek power over the godless heathen dissident . "
Christianist Professor Calls for Religious McCarthyism
Avant - garde Samodurov under guard
A CONTEMPORARY work of art can provoke outrage disproportionate to its artistic merit .
In Russia it can also herald a change in the course of history .
In 1962 the then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev famously denounced and banned an exhibition of avant - garde artists in Moscow , saying his grandson could paint better .
This marked the end of the short post - Stalinist thaw and ushered in the period of “ stagnation ” .
Khrushchev himself was deposed two years later .
Nearly 50 years on , Russian prosecutors are demanding a three - year jail sentence for the organisers of a contemporary - art exhibition in Moscow .
The verdict , expected on July 12th , could have an impact far greater than the exhibition itself and determine the balance of power between ultranationalist religious radicals and secular pragmatists in Russia .
The exhibition , called “ Forbidden Art ” , was organised three years ago by Andrei Yerofeev , a contemporary - art curator , who put together works barred in recent years from other exhibitions .
Symbolically , it was shown at the Sakharov museum and centre , a bastion of human rights named after the late Russian physicist and dissident , Andrei Sakharov .
Its director , Yuri Samodurov , is a co-defendant .
To highlight the censored nature of the show , the works were concealed from public view by a fake wall and could be seen only by climbing onto a stool and peering through small holes .
Photography was banned to prevent the dissemination of the images and people under the age of 16 were warned to stay away .
One picture showed a Russian general raping a soldier with the caption “ Glory to Russia ” ; another placed an Order of Lenin medal in place of Christ 's head .
A group of militant religious radicals , who claim to have the support of the Russian Orthodox Church , overcame all the obstacles .
They were duly offended , and started a vitriolic campaign against the organisers .
More troubling , however , was the response of the state prosecution service , which took up their case and charged the organisers with “ debasing the religious beliefs of citizens and inciting religious hatred ” .
The exhibition , the prosecution alleged , was a continuation of the museum 's “ anti-state ” and “ anti-Orthodox ” activity , equating the two .
A church representative endorsed the prosecution and condemned the exhibition as blasphemous .
In a letter to Kirill , the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church , Mr Yerofeev apologised for inadvertently hurting the feeling of believers , but blasted the church for siding with a group of anti-Semitic , militant radicals .
Gleb Yakunin , a liberal cleric , says the campaign against the exhibition is driven by fanatics akin to the revolutionary guards that preserve Iran 's Islamic regime .
They are seeking to push Kirill into a corner , he says .
It was not the first time that Mr Samodurov 's work has got him into trouble .
Five years ago he was fined 100,000 Roubles ( $ 3,200 ) for organising an exhibition called “ Caution , Religion ” .
This time , however , the prosecution is demanding a jail sentence .
If the judge grants it , Mr Yerofeev and Mr Samodurov will become the first people since the end of Communism to be jailed for artistic expression .
But they may not be the last .
A guilty verdict , says Andrei Zorin , an historian of Russian culture at Oxford University , would send a powerful signal to the ultra-Orthodox radicals and nationalists , who will inevitably seek more repression and control over people 's lives .
“ It is as naive to assume that it would not touch on everyone 's lives , as it was naive seven years ago to think that the jailing of Mikhail Khodorkovsky [ a former business tycoon ] would have no impact on business and politics in Russia , ” he argues .
A conviction will hurt Russia 's international reputation and undermine any talk of modernisation .
This may be why Alexander Avdeev , Russia 's minister of culture , has criticised the criminal proceedings .
Kirill has not spoken against the prosecution being carried out in the name of the church — even though a conviction could harm its reputation more than any exhibition could ever do .
A man carrying bags containing more than 70 dead babies has been arrested in Nigeria .
He was employed by the Lagos University Teaching Hospital to take the corpses to a cemetery .
The worker was allegedly trying to dump the corpses as he could not afford burial fees .
A hospital spokesman said it was co-operating with police investigations into the incident .
A BBC correspondent in Lagos says many families are too devastated to deal with the dead babies and others cannot afford morgue fees , so abandon them outside hospitals .
Hospitals hire contractors to bury the corpses .
' Embarrassment '
A police preliminary investigation also led to the arrest of some workers in the Department of Morbid and Anatomy at the teaching hospital , said Lagos state police public relations officer Frank Mba .
He also said that the suspect had not intended to use the bodies in any rituals .
" We are sure that the suspect is neither a ritualist nor a murderer nor a trafficker .
Other contending issues like corruption and abuse of office will be investigated , " Mr Mba added .
The hospital described the incident as an embarrassment to the organisation .
The BBC's Fidelis Mbah says there 's been a state of shock and disbelief among people in Lagos who cannot believe that a hospital with the magnitude of Lagos University Teaching Hospital would allow a contactor to handle that many corpses without supervision from its staff .
" Apple 's attempt to draw RIM into Apple 's self - made debacle is unacceptable .
Apple 's claims about RIM products appear to be deliberate attempts to distort the public 's understanding of an antenna design issue and to deflect attention from Apple 's difficult situation .
RIM is a global leader in antenna design and has been successfully designing industry - leading wireless data products with efficient and effective radio performance for over 20 years .
During that time , RIM has avoided designs like the one Apple used in the iPhone 4 and instead has used innovative designs which reduce the risk for dropped calls , especially in areas of lower coverage .
One thing is for certain , RIM 's customers do n't need to use a case for their BlackBerry smartphone to maintain proper connectivity .
Apple clearly made certain design decisions and it should take responsibility for these decisions rather than trying to draw RIM and others into a situation that relates specifically to Apple . "
Thought Nokia 's statement was strongly worded ?
That was nothing compared to the little tirade put together by RIM co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie -- a pair of dudes known for having some of the bigger mouths ( and bigger egos ) in the wireless industry -- in direct response to Apple 's Friday press conference on antenna issues .
Of course , unlike Nokia , Apple made it personal for RIM because it used the Bold 9700 as a demonstration device in its attempt to prove that signal loss was a problem for phones and manufacturers from all walks of life , but Mike and Jim are having none of it .
Phrases like " self - made debacle " and " deliberate attempts to distort the public 's understanding " should give you an idea of the statement 's overall flavor , but basically , they 're saying that RIM puts a lot of time , money , and energy into avoiding dropped call issues and that you do n't need a case to use any of their phones .
Snap !
Here 's the full statement :
Do n't miss " AC360° " at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday for more on this story .
Washington ( CNN ) -- BP has been trying to shut down an internal safety watchdog agency it set up under congressional pressure four years ago , according to sources close to the office and a leading congressman .
The Ombudsman Program was set up after a 2005 explosion at a BP refinery in Texas that killed 15 workers and a massive oil spill in Alaska the following year .
Its chief , former federal judge Stanley Sporkin , would not comment for this story -- but a source inside his office told CNN , " I 'm surprised we 're still here . "
The Washington - based office was set up to hear BP workers ' safety concerns after investigations into the Texas City refinery explosion raised questions about whether employees feared retaliation for speaking up .
Since then , 112 employees have filed complaints , and 35 of them have dealt with " system integrity or safety issues " that the office says are extremely serious .
But sources close to the office say BP does n't like having independent investigators pursuing those complaints .
A union representative told CNN that some workers who complained have faced retaliation .
Jeanne Pascal , a former lawyer for the Environmental Protection Agency , agreed .
" They 've been demoted , they 've been terminated , they 've also been blackballed , " Pascal said .
BP spokesman Steve Rinehart said the company has a " zero - tolerance " policy toward retaliation and said it is unaware of any unresolved cases that violate that policy .
" Concerns raised internally or with the Ombudsman 's office in respect to our operations are fully investigated and appropriate actions are implemented , " he said in a statement supplied to CNN .
He added , " If Ms. Pascal or others believe there are cases that have not been resolved appropriately , they can be raised through the ombudsman 's office .
BP has promised Rep. Bart Stupak , the chairman of a congressional subcommittee investigating the April sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , that it will keep the watchdog office in place for another year .
But Stupak said the head of BP's American subsidiary , Lamar McKay , told him earlier this year that the ombudsman 's office was slated for elimination .
McKay had become the head of BP America in January 2009 , more than a year before the the Deepwater Horizon disaster killed 11 workers and uncorked the worst oil spill in U.S. history .
Stupak , D - Michigan , and other lawmakers met with McKay in January and March of that year .
" One of the first things Mr. McKay said was , ' I 'm going to replace the ombudsman .
I 'm going to shut her down , ' " Stupak told CNN .
" He was n't even on the job for more than a few weeks , maybe a month or two , and he wanted to shut down the ombudsman .
We encouraged him not to do so . "
Stupak said lawmakers were " shocked " that McKay would bring up the topic so soon .
" The logic was , ' Well , we will make things better , ' " he said .
" Well , I 'm not sure . "
BP has said it can do a good job investigating complaints through an established internal system -- without the ombudsman 's office .
But Pascal , who spent 26 years prosecuting polluters for the EPA , has called BP a " serial environmental criminal . "
She said BP repeatedly violates environmental laws , scoffs at safety regulations and treats U.S. government safety and pollution control officials as a mere nuisance .
The company paid record federal fines and pleaded guilty to a felony in connection with the Texas City explosion .
It also pleaded guilty in 2007 to one count of criminally negligent discharge of oil , a misdemeanor , in Alaska .
In 2009 , the Justice Department filed a civil complaint alleging the company had violated clean air and water laws in Alaska .
That record indicates that BP considers safety " a secondary or tertiary concern , " with no indication that will change , Pascal said .
" From my perspective , BP for a long time has been a company that is interested in profits first and foremost , " she said .
" Safety , health and the environment are subjugated to profit - making , and I do not think that has changed . "

The number of students who live in one Washtenaw County school district but attend a different traditional school district has grown by nearly 450 percent in the last eight years , Michigan Department of Education data shows .
In the fall of the 2009 - 10 school year , 2,910 of the 47,000 students in Washtenaw County 's traditional school districts opted to switch districts through the schools of choice program .
That 's up from 655 students in the fall of the 2002 - 03 school year .
That increase outpaces the growth in the number of Washtenaw County students who are enrolled in a charter school .
That number grew by 238 percent over the same time period .

Schools of choice takes financial toll on Washtenaw County school districts
The local rise also eclipses the schools of choice growth across the state , which was 111 percent during that eight - year span .
The movement showcases the increase in competition among traditional school districts for a shrinking pool of students , Washtenaw County education officials say .
" ( Education ) is becoming a market - driven enterprise , " Washtenaw Intermediate School District Superintendent Bill Miller said .
" And with more competition , combined with a decline in enrollments overall , school districts are having to create a brand for themselves .
You have to market your identity . "
A rising tide
On a recent morning , a group of students stood at a bus stop as an Ypsilanti school district bus rumbled down the street .
Eight students climbed aboard , and the bus made two more quick stops to pick up five more students .
But it was n't just another Ypsilanti district bus route .
The bus was n't even in the Ypsilanti's district boundaries .
It was driving through neighborhoods in the Willow Run school district , taking students who normally would go to Willow Run , but instead choose Ypsilanti through schools of choice .
State records show this school year , 2,910 students live in one of Washtenaw County 's 10 traditional school districts but attend a different traditional school district .
That 's up about 700 students from the fall of 2008 and represents an increase of 2,255 students since 2002 , the last year data is available .
Another 3,800 students live in a Washtenaw County traditional school district but attend a charter school .
That 's up by about 360 students from the fall of 2008 , and up about 2,200 students since 2002 .
" It 's a profound social change taking place in our schools , " said William Price , a professor of leadership and counseling in the school of education at Eastern Michigan University .
" We are really moving away from the model of community school districts , connected to neighborhoods .
We 're moving to a marketplace where schooling is a commodity to be shopped . "
Since state law changed in 1996 to allow students in one traditional school district to use schools of choice to go to another district , the number of local students taking advantage of the program has grown steadily , Miller said .
The program allows a district to decide whether to accept students from neighboring districts , as well as deciding whether to place limits on the number of students accepted or specific grades to accept students in .
The district - to - district schools of choice shuffling is accompanied by student losses to charter schools and overall enrollment declines in Washtenaw County .
In the 2003 - 04 school year , the number of students in the county hit its peak at 52,621 .
It 's slid every year since , to 51,543 in 2009 - 10 , WISD records show .
Enrollment in private schools has remained relatively flat during the same time period , ranging from a high of 4,689 students in 2007 - 08 to a low of 3,678 in 2005 - 06 .
In the 2009 - 10 school year , 4,459 students who live in Washtenaw County are enrolled in private schools , WISD records show .
The bulk of the movement occurs on the east side of Washtenaw County , particularly in the Ypsilanti- area districts of Lincoln , Willow Run and Ypsilanti .
Each of those districts saw more than 500 students transfer to another traditional school district this school year .
When charter schools are factored in , each of them has lost more than 1,400 students living inside their boundaries this school year .
Why move ?
When Annette Green 's family bought a house in the West Willow neighborhood of Ypsilanti Township , they ended up in the Van Buren school district .
Her oldest son started there , but did n't stay long .
" It just was n't a good fit for him and us , " she said .
" People were just treating him different because they heard he was from West Willow . "
So Green started looking at other local school districts .
Her oldest son enrolled in the Ypsilanti school district , while her younger son spent some time at a local charter school before also enrolling in the Ypsilanti district .
" It 's a big difference .
There 's a bigger mix of kids there , " she said .
" My youngest son goes to a middle school that 's being closed down ( East ) , but I 'll keep him going to West .
The teachers there just care so much about my kids . "
Green used to drive her children to school , but so many kids in the neighborhood now go to Ypsilanti that the district sends a bus through to pick them up .
Green 's reasoning for switching school districts is commonly cited by parents , experts said .
But academic quality or perceptions of academic quality often lead the list of reasons why parents send their children to a different district .
" The biggest increases ( in movement ) occurred between 2000 and 2005 , " said Sharif Shakrani , a professor of measurement and quantitative methods and co-director of the Education Policy Center at Michigan State University .
" It was largely due to the labeling of schools through the ( Adequate Yearly Progress ) .
If I was a parent and found out my school was labeled as failing , I 'd be looking for another school district . "
Other reasons are n't tied to quality of education , Miller said .
" We 're just mobile .
Instead of having your friends in your neighborhood , it Â¹s not uncommon to drive around to friends from a variety of activities , versus those who just live by you , " Miller said .
" It part of the change in our social fabric . "
Impact on the education system
The movement has impacted districts across the state
Â­ financially and in other ways , experts said .
It 's led to competition for students because each student is accompanied by a per-pupil state aid grant , making students a valuable commodity as state aid shrinks and districts struggle with budget deficits .
" This is a business , " Shakrani said .
Districts are spending more on advertising in an attempt to lure students to their districts .
For example , the Lincoln school district paid $ 25,000 to be featured on a television infomercial about the " Best Schools in Michigan . "
" School districts have to create a brand , " Miller said .
" You have to market your identity .
You have to find that something that sets your school apart .
" What are your points of pride ?
How do you communicate that ? "
Ann Arbor was n't a schools of choice district until this spring , when it began accepting applications for several grades .
This school year , the district expects to spend about $ 55,000 on advertising online , in print , and in specialty publications like directories and sports programs , district spokeswoman Liz Margolis said .
The Ypsilanti district has been aggressive in its advertising campaigns , including running ads on billboards inside the Ann Arbor school district boundaries in past years .
The district is scheduled to spend $ 26,000 on advertising this year .
" Our promotion is two - fold , to retain and attract , " said district spokeswoman Emma Jackson .
" Some promotions , specifically for Ypsilanti New Tech High School , is tailored to attract students that are currently not enrolled in our district .
We have had great success enrolling students who are attending charter schools that only go through eighth grade .
Our district newsletter , mailed to parts of ( zip code ) 48197-98 , is geared toward communicating to our families , to reach our stakeholders to inform them of what is taking place in our district and to appeal to new families .
We also place ads to promote our open houses and high school fair , which targets both current and new students . "
Another effect of the student movement is changing demographics in districts .
That 's because those with money are able to flee many poorer performing districts , Shakrani said .
" Why should we condemn the poor kids to a failing school ?
To me , that 's economic discrimination , " Shakrani said .
Transportation often influences a student 's ability to switch districts since most schools of choice districts do n't provide transportation outside their boundaries .
State statistics show the percentage of students classified as poor is increasing in local school districts that have the largest numbers of students leaving for other traditional school districts or charter schools .
But it 's unclear from the data how much of the increase in poverty rates is connected to students with money leaving and how much is due to the economy .
The future
The schools of choice program appears to be here to stay , experts and school officials said .
" You 're not going to go back to forcing kids to go to a specific district , " Shakrani said .
Miller agreed and said he expects to see more movement , particularly at the high school level .
Miller cites a number of specialty high schools opening in various districts and said the future could include one district with a technology - focused high school , another with a medical - focused high school and a third with a business - based high school .
In that example , students would be able to choose among districts based on what high school they wanted to attend .
Many Washtenaw
County school officials said schools of choice could eventually force consolidation among districts as some lose large amounts of students .
Ann Arbor school board Secretary Glenn Nelson said heÂ¹d prefer a " more managed consolidation and connectivity . "
Locally , more districts are electing to participate in schools of choice and are opening up more spots as they look for ways to pull in additional revenue .
Ann Arbor was the latest district to opt into schools of choice , opening seats in kindergarten , first and sixth grades for next year .
" The intent of the ( law ) was to let parents have choice , " Shakrani said .
" It 's done that .
The challenge is now for parents to make good decisions and
find good information to make their decisions on . "

Two suicide bombers have carried out a deadly attack on a Sufi shrine in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore .
At least 42 people died in the blasts at the popular Data Darbar shrine late on Thursday evening , officials say .
At least 175 other people were hurt in the attack , believed to be the first to target a shrine in Lahore .
Thousands of people were visiting the shrine at the time , officials say .
It holds the remains of a Persian Sufi saint , Abul Hassan Ali Hajvery .
Analysis
No group has yet said that it carried out the attack , but the finger of blame is being pointed at the Taliban .
The type of target , a Muslim shrine , is unusual .
There are some elements among Islamist extremists , including the Taliban , who believe that worshipping at the shrines of saints is un-Islamic , and this is one theory why this shrine was attacked .
There was another sectarian attack just over a month ago in Lahore in which 80 people died , when two mosques used by Ahmadi Muslims were hit by militants .
This could be a battle within a battle that the militants are having with the Pakistani state .
The shrine is visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year from both Sunni and Shia traditions of Islam .
For the first time in centuries , the mosque of the shrine was closed temporarily for security reasons on Friday , although officials say it may be opened later in the day .
The impact of the two blasts ripped open the courtyard of the shrine .
Rescue workers could be seen clambering over the rubble as they carried out the victims .
The first attacker struck in the underground area where visitors sleep and prepare themselves for prayer , officials said .
As people fled , a second bomber detonated his explosives in the upstairs area .
The bombers are thought to have used devices packed with ball - bearings to maximise the impact of their attack .
A volunteer security guard at the shrine described scenes of devastation .
" It was a horrible scene , " said Mohammed Nasir .
" There were dead bodies all around with blood and people were crying . "
The attack is the biggest on a Sufi shrine in Pakistan since militant attacks began in 2001 .
No group has said it carried out the attack , but correspondents say the attacks continue a growing trend among militants to target members of other sects as well as minorities .
Lahore has been hit by a series of bomb attacks , including a suicide blast at anti-terrorist offices in March , when at least 13 people died .
BIG MILITANT ATTACKS 28 May 2010 - 93 people killed in attacks on two Ahmadi mosques in Lahore
19 Apr 2010 - At least 23 die in suicide bombing at market in Peshawar
1 Jan 2010 - A bomb at a volleyball match kills about 100
28 Oct 2009 - At least 120 die in car bomb attack on packed market in Peshawar
15 Oct 2009 - About 40 die in a series of gun and bomb attacks
9 Oct 2009 - At least 50 die in Peshawar suicide blast
In May , more than 90 people were killed in a double attack on the minority Ahmadi sect in the city .
Earlier , security chiefs had been congratulating themselves after June was the first month in two years in which there had been no suicide bombings in Pakistan , the BBC's Aleem Maqbool reports from Islamabad .
They said it was proof the militant networks had been disrupted .
Last year Pakistan launched a major military offensive against militant strongholds in South Waziristan .
In December the military said they had achieved victory , but subsequent reports have suggested the militants remain active in the region .
Gen . David Petraeus has an unprece dented opportunity to seize back the momentum in Afghanistan : Neither President Obama nor Congress wants a confrontation with this general .
During his honeymoon , he can write his own rules .
And he needs to .
Fast .
To turn the current situation around , Petraeus has to address hundreds of what - now - boss ?
issues — but a 10 - item to - do list should top his priorities .
First , the big - picture stuff :
Define victory down : Above all , we need realistic expectations as to what can be achieved in Afghanistan .
We ca n’t remake the place into a cartoon of Western values .
We can continue to gut al Qaeda across the border in Pakistan and gore those Taliban who cooperate with bin Laden ’s butchers .
If Petraeus could only do a single thing , he should nail down achievable goals .
Push the Pakistanis to stop harboring terrorists :
Because we ’ve gotten ourselves in a logistics mess , we imagine we need the Pakistanis more than they need us .
The reverse is true : China ai n’t going to be no sweet sugar - daddy .
And if India declares war again , the Pakistanis wo n’t have time to say goodbye in Urdu .
Petraeus sees the Pakistanis with refreshing clarity .
The problem is that senior administration officials have drunk Pakistani Kool - Aid by the vat .
Team with Ambassador Karl Eikenberry in Kabul : Calls to bring in Ambassador Ryan Crocker , Petraeus ’s tag - team partner in Iraq , are misguided .
Eikenberry knows the current situation better than any other senior player on our side .
And he has Afghan President Hamid Karzai ’s number .
Streamline the rest of the team : Richard Holbrooke , Obama ’s special envoy to the region , needs to go .
Petraeus must be the go - to guy in AfPak .
Given the right mission , Holbrooke ’s a brilliant operator .
But he ’s not a team player and does n’t understand the region .
At present , the Afghans and Pakistanis simply play off our fly - by dignitaries against each other .
Quietly build relations with alternatives to Karzai :
We need to start removing some of our eggs from the Karzai basket .
We must have a post - Karzai Plan B. And Plans C and D .
Now , at the dirty - boots level :
Rethink operational priorities :
While Petraeus could get an extension on the 2011 deadline for removing surge troops , he needs to re-evaluate the use of those troops now .
The general does n’t have to admit that his counterinsurgency doctrine has failed — as long as he moves beyond it ( as he did in Iraq ) .
Planting alternative crops does n’t work ; planting the bodies of dead terrorists does .
Loosen the rules of engagement : Rational policies to protect civilians are fine , but sacrificing our troops while handing our enemies the initiative is nuts .
Better dead Afghans than dead Americans .
More - sensible ROE would be a huge morale booster for our troops — and we already have indications that Petraeus will produce them .
Take the fight to the enemy :
Our current passive posture is a prescription for losing slowly .
The only “ terrain ” that matters is the enemy .
We need to stop hugging dirt and go back to holding onto the enemy .
We should maximize our mobility , not sit in place and wait for the mortar rounds .
Our conventional operations should look like special ops writ large — devastating raids that allow our enemies no rest or refuge .
We ca n’t win playing defense .
More special operations , please :
At present , strikes by our special - ops forces are all that ’s really working inside Afghanistan .
Caught up in one recent raid , a high - value target simply walked out and surrendered .
He told our special operators he was weary of running from them .
That ’s how we need all our enemies to feel .
Insist on a long - term detention policy for dangerous captives :
In the words of one frustrated officer , we ’re “ policing them up in vast numbers , and our own DoD is releasing them as fast .
We ’re risking the best lives we have to risk , and we ’re having to re-snag or kill many of our historical guests .
Sickening . ”
We ’ve refused to stand up a wartime regime for holding terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan .
We release them onto “ a nonexistent judicial system . ”
The Afghans actually want us to hold them .
But we wo n’t .
Fix that one , Dave .
Petraeus is in a unique position of power for a general .
Now he has to deliver .
HARARE , Zimbabwe — International rights campaigners have given a cautious welcome to the decision by the World Diamond Council to allow diamonds from the controversial diggings in Chiadzwa , in Zimbabwe ’s eastern districts , to be exported under the supervisory Kimberley Process .
But they have warned that close inspection will be needed to ensure President Robert Mugabe ’s government does not renege on undertakings it has given in weeks of intense negotiations .
Mining in the Chiadzwa area near the border with Mozambique has been shrouded in controversy with charges of gross human rights abuses from local and international organizations including Global Witness and Partnership Africa Canada .
Zimbabwean rights campaigner Farai Maguwu was last week released from jail where he had spent three weeks , much of that time beyond the reach of his family and lawyers .
He was charged with “ peddling falsehoods prejudicial to the state . ”
The charge derived from confidential material he supplied to Kimberley Process monitor Abbey Chikane , a South African , disclosing details of killings , kidnappings and other abuses at the hands of Zimbabwe ’s military .
Maguwu ’s arrest produced a wave of outrage which delayed the negotiations aimed at finding a solution to the impasse .
Agreement was finally reached in St Petersburg , Russia , last week .
“ The ball is now firmly in Zimbabwe ’s court to make good on its promises and act to end one of the most egregious cases of diamond - related violence for many years , ” said Annie Dunnebacker of Global Witness .
The campaign groups hope the agreement , if fully implemented , will end the widely reported abuses in Zimbabwe ’s diamond fields .
At one stage Chikane claimed that his luggage had been opened by “ naughty ” intelligence officers .
Correspondence between him and U.S officials subsequently appeared in Zimbabwe ’s government - owned press as Mugabe ’s regime anticipated a negative outcome .
Australia , the EU , Canada and the United States have opposed lifting restrictions on the sale of what rights campaigners refer to as “ blood diamonds . ”
The agreement in Russia was welcomed by Zimbabwe as a triumph for its diplomacy .
Mines minister Obert Mpofu has been characterizing Western hostility as part of a regime - change plot .
The Mugabe government now has stockpiled diamonds worth an estimated $ 1.7 billion .
Under the agreement Zimbabwe will be allowed to export a limited quantity of diamonds produced since May 28 at two mines in the Marange district where Chiadzwa is located .
Zimbabwe will be allowed to export one more batch of diamonds at the beginning of September but will be subject to stringent Kimberley Process inspection .
Any further exports will be contingent on “ measurable improvements ” in the conditions in the diamond fields .
The government has harassed mining companies with long - standing claims in the Marange fields .
African Consolidated Resources , quoted on the London Stock Exchange , has been a notable victim .
Meanwhile , two companies with little experience in mining but headed by retired Zimbabwe army officers have been awarded a virtual monopoly of mining activity through their links to state - controlled corporations .
One retired officer gave evidence against then - opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai at his treason trial seven years ago .
There are concerns that the concessions given to new mining companies were not above board .
“ This agreement is far from perfect , ” said Nadim Kara of Partnership Africa Canada .
“ It will take considerable effort by all parties to the Kimberley Process , especially Zimbabwe , to make it work . ”
Observers have pointed out that well - established companies have suffered the same fate as commercial farmers .
The companies have seen their legally acquired rights to mine the diamond fields summarily suspended or have seen the mining areas occupied by Mugabe ’s cronies .
The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper last week published a dossier released by the new Home Affairs minister , Theresa Makone of Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change , detailing cases where powerful individuals , including army officers , have refused to obey High Court orders instructing them to leave farms they have seized .
The police have refused to intervene .
“ It is the same pattern , ” said Shadreck Dube who has witnessed land - grabbing first hand .
“ They just take what they want .
It ’s criminal . ”
Chikane has said Zimbabwe exported $ 30 million worth of diamonds but the money could not be accounted for by Treasury .
Finance minister Tendai Biti told parliament that the money had to be accounted for in terms of the law .
“ This will avoid the current opaqueness and suspicions over the quality and actual value of resources being generated from the current diamond mining operations in Marange , ” Biti said .
Given the Mugabe regime ’s record of moving in on any successful activity , the diamond sector ’s future looks set to be turbulent .

We can all learn a few lessons from this four - time lottery winner ...
I think it ’s safe to say that Joan Ginther is the world ’s luckiest gambler .
After all , this lady from Texas , USA won her fourth lottery jackpot this month !
Lady Luck ’s best friend
Last week , Ginther won over $ 1 million ( £ 659,000 ) in the Texas state lottery for the fourth time .
This favourite of Lady Luck won $ 10 million ( £ 6.59 million ) by scooping one of three top prizes from a $ 140,000,000 Extreme Payout scratchcard costing $ 50 , beating odds of 1 in 1.2 million .
Also , store manager Bob Solis must be pleased , as he receives a $ 10,000 bonus for selling this winning ticket .
This is the largest of Ginther ’s four million - plus lottery wins .
In total , she has won $ 20.4 million ( £ 13.4 million ) in 17 years , as follows :
1993 : Ginther wins $ 5.4 million of an $ 11 million jackpot in the Lotto Texas game ( at odds of 15.8 million to one ) ;
2006 : She nets $ 2 million from a Holiday Millionaire scratchcard ( one in 1,028,338 ) ;
2008 : Ginther banks another $ 3 million from a Millions and Millions scratchcard ( one in 909,000 ) ; and
2010 : She bags a whopping $ 10 million from a $ 140,000,000 Extreme Payout scratchcard , ( one in 1.2 million ) .
It could be you !
Somewhat surprisingly , multiple jackpot winners are not unheard of .
Indeed , several gamblers have ‘ bagged the big one ’ more than once , including one American who won two jackpots in the same month .
However , there is no known ( legal ) way to beat scratchcard odds , so Ginther ’s four wins are purely down to dumb luck .
As a former mathematician , I do n’t play the Lotto or buy scratchcards , because I know how awful the odds are .
For the record , I consider all gambling to be a tax on the poor and people who are bad at maths .
Therefore , here are my five lessons inspired by Ginther ’s luck :
1. Avoid publicity
Ginther asked for minimal publicity from the Texas Lottery Commission , so very little is known about her -- other than she lives in Las Vegas , Nevada , but bought three of her four winning tickets in her home town of Bishop , Texas .
Related blog post Tony Levene writes :
My phonecall from a scammer Find out what happened when Tony Levene got a phonecall from a scammer ....
Read this post
Personally , I ’d tick the ‘ no publicity ’ box every time .
Otherwise , you risk spending the rest of your life being bombarded with begging letters , death threats and even ransom notes .
By keeping the source of your sudden wealth a secret , you may stay below criminals ’ radar .
In fact , Dr Robert Uomini -- a professor of research mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley , who won $ 22 million in 1995 -- has this advice for lottery winners : “ Change your phone number . ”
2. Quit while you ’re ahead
Given Ginther ’s string of wins , and the fact that she moved to Las Vegas , I suspect that she is an habitual gambler .
In other words , her remarkable luck could be explained by the fact that she has bought a very large number of scratchcards over the decades .
Ginther has been extraordinarily lucky , but many gamblers find their habit becomes an addiction .
( I speak from experience , as I spent five years of the Nineties throwing my money across the green baize before turning my back on casinos . )
In many cases , even a massive win does n’t make some gamblers quit the habit .
Often , big wins are ‘ recycled ’ by more frequent betting with larger stakes .
For example , UK - listed gaming company PartyGaming reported that one lucky punter had won its Mega Gold jackpot of $ 5 million in December 2009 .
Alas , within weeks , this VIP gambler had handed back $ 2 million to PartyCasino in subsequent losses .
Oops !
3 . Beware the curse of lottery winners
Survey after survey has demonstrated that -- contrary to popular belief -- suddenly coming into a large sum of money is n’t a guarantee of happiness .
Although lottery winners do see an increase in the quality of their lives , their happiness levels are n’t measurably higher a couple of years following their win .
In fact , a survey by Lotto organiser Camelot in 1999 found that four in nine winners ( 45 % ) were no happier or less happy than they were before their big win .
If you do n’t believe that winning millions can leave you in ruins , then watch documentary Lucky , a newly released film about lottery winners laid low .
4. Remember the losers
One of the biggest problems with lotteries ( and gambling in general ) is that they encourage ‘ selective perception ’ .
In other words , all the focus is on big winners while millions of small losers are ignored .
Of course , for Joan Ginther -- or anyone else -- to win a fortune , then millions of punters have to lose a great deal more .
For example , the UK Lotto returns only 45 p of every pound staked .
In other words , less than half ( 45 % ) of the sum spent on lottery tickets is returned in prizes .
Thus , in 2009 / 10 , we gave £ 5.4 billion to Camelot , but got back just £ 2.43 billion in prizes .
The remaining £ 2.97 billion was shared by HM Treasury , good causes , Camelot ’s shareholders and retailers .
5 . Watch out for deductions
Here in the UK , all winnings from legal gambling are free of personal taxes ( although bookmakers and other gaming companies pay various duties to HM Treasury ) .
What ’s more , lottery and scratchcard wins are paid out as lump sums ( except for some special games which offer a tax - free monthly income for life ) .
However , this tax - free , lump - sum deal is rarely the case elsewhere in the world .
For example , in the US , you can elect to take your win as a one - off lump sum or as yearly payments over 20 years .
Indeed , Joan Ginther took her 1993 win over 20 years , but chose lump sums for her next three lottery wins .
Her latest prize of $ 10 million comes to $ 7.5 million after taxes .
In summary
My advice would be to ignore the hype surrounding lottery winners .
Instead , remember that as a nation we lose almost £ 3 billion a year from playing the Lotto and scratchcards .
If you want to make money from gambling , then buy a bookmaker !

Sens. Jim Webb ( left ) and Russ Feingold are joining forces to challenge the notion that the ' open - ended presence of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan ' is in the national interest .
Senate Dems demand more war input
Two Senate Democrats who have become leading voices on military issues sent a letter to President Barack Obama on Wednesday , demanding the Senate have more influence in bilateral agreements between the United States and its strategic partners .
With news from Afghanistan becoming bleaker , Sens. Jim Webb of Virginia and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin asked the president to respect the Senate 's constitutional obligation to give " advice and consent " on treaties and declarations of war .
They ask that any agreement with Afghanistan should " carry the weight of a treaty and be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent in keeping with Constitutional requirements . "

Feingold , long an opponent of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , joined forces with his Foreign Relations Committee colleague to challenge the notion that the " open - ended presence of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan serves our national interest . "
The senators cautioned Obama against repeating President George W. Bush 's efforts to sidestep restrictions on the executive in declaring and funding wars .
" Agreements governing these operations have profound implications for our troops , the American people , and Congress ' constitutional responsibility to declare war and make spending decisions about military operations .
Any such agreements carry the weight of a treaty and should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent in keeping with constitutional requirements . "
The Democrats ' letter comes on the heels of a highly publicized information dump last weekend of more than 90,000 pages of documents detailing U.S. operations in Afghanistan that revealed Pakistan — a country receiving significant American aid to combat the Afghan Taliban — has been assisting the insurgency .
Feingold and Webb emphasized the " dangerous precedent " created when the United States and Iraq entered into a bilateral agreement without Senate review .

Indispensable or insolvent ?
If the United States reduced its defense budget significantly , how would this affect international affairs ?
I raise this point because one of the primary justifications for America ’s disproportionately high level of defense spending is the idea that U.S. military dominance is an essential stabilizing force in contemporary world politics .
This argument has been advanced by scholars like William Wohlforth and Michael Mandelbaum , was implicit in Madeleine Albright ’s infamous characterization of the United States as the " indispensable power , " and runs throughout the Clinton , Bush and now Obama versions of the National Security Strategy .
It is also one of those well - established verities that are rarely questioned in the American foreign policy establishment .
Given our current budget situation , however , that assumption really ought to be questioned .
The United States spends more on national security than the rest of the world combined , and a substantially larger fraction of its GDP than other major powers do .
According to the 2010 edition of the IISS Military Balance , in 2008 the US spent about 4.9 percent of GDP on national security , and the defense budget has grown in real terms by about 3 percent per year since 2001 .
By contrast , China spent about 1.4 percent of its GDP on defense , Russia 2.4 % Great Britain only 2.3 percent , and German and Japan roughly 1.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively .
Lucky them .
Meanwhile , the United States has been piling up impressive amounts of red ink in recent years .
The federal deficit reached 10 percent of GDP in FY2009 ( the highest level since 1945 ) , and various projections suggest that total U.S debt could reach 80 to 100 percent of GDP by FY2020 .
( My thanks to Gordon Adams of the Stimson Center and George Washington University , the author of an unpublished paper from which I drew these numbers ) .
This situation led President Obama to form a bipartisan commission to study ways to reduce the federal deficit , and the president and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates have both made it clear that defense spending has to be part of that process .
No doubt defense contractors and congressional hawks will try to insulate DoD from significant cuts , but that position will be politically untenable if other sectors are being slashed .
In fact , if we were really serious about trying to close the deficits mentioned above , we ’d be looking at cuts similar to the " peace dividend " that accompanied the end of the Cold War .
Measured in constant dollars , for example , the DoD budget fell 36 percent in constant dollars between 1985 and 1998 , accompanied by comparable reductions in the active - duty force and the Pentagon ’s civilian workforce .
So here ’s my question : Would similar cuts today produce a dangerous shift in the structure of world politics and invite all sorts of nasty regional instability ?
I do n’t think so .
If the U.S. cut defense by 20 - 30 percent ( an enormous reduction ) , it would still be devoting roughly $ 400 billion per year to keeping Americans safe .
Our national security spending would still be six times larger than China ’s , ten times larger than Russia ’s and a whopping forty times larger than Iran’s .
And because many militarily consequential powers are U.S. allies , its actual position is even better than those crude comparisons suggest .
Thus , even seemingly draconian defense cuts would still leave the United States far stronger than any current rivals , especially if the reductions were done intelligently .
Moreover , if you look region - by - region , it ’s not obvious that reductions of this magnitude would change things very much .
It would have little or no effect on Europe , because a large U.S. presence is n’t central to European security any longer .
There ’s little danger of serious conflict in Europe these days ( and certainly no potential threat that the European states can’t handle ) , and all that ’s needed from the United States is a mostly symbolic presence to help hold NATO together and remind Europeans not to let security competition reignite on the continent .
And please do n’t try to tell me that Putin ’s Russia poses a resurgent threat to the rest of Europe .
NATO
Europe spends roughly $ 300 billion on defense each year compared to Russia ’s $ 40 billion ; if our European allies can’t handle Russia ’s not -very - impressive military , then they do n’t deserve U.S. help .
I ’d say much the same thing about Latin America and Africa .
Although the United States will remain diplomatically engaged with both regions ( and maintain various security partnerships with states in each area ) , it is not likely to undertake major military operations on either continent .
The United States could sustain its current level of peacetime activity in both regions with a smaller force structure , and political developments in both places have been and will probably remain largely independent of the size of the U.S. military presence or the level of U.S. defense spending .
Put differently , we would n’t be able to determine Africa ’s political future even if we spent ten percent of our GDP on defense , and major cuts would n’t make much difference either .
The Persian Gulf is a different matter , but not as much as one might think .
Once the United States is out of Iraq , it will be time to revert to its previous strategy of " offshore balancing . "
The United States has no need to control these oil - rich regions , it just wants to ensure that no single hostile power does .
So long as the Gulf is divided , oil producers will continue to deliver oil to world markets where we can buy it .
We can rely on local allies and naval power to preserve our access and influence , and keep a smaller version of the Rapid Deployment Force in reserve should the situation there deteriorate .
Fortunately , none of the countries in the Gulf have significant power - projection capabilities , which will make it relatively easy to maintain a stable balance - of - power in the region .
Remember : a reduced U.S. budget would still leave the U.S. far stronger than any other country in the world , and it would not herald a return to isolationism .
The Gulf still matters , but we would have enough to protect our interests there , particularly if we allocated assets wisely .
East Asia is another place where dramatic U.S. reductions might have noticeable effects over time .
America ’s ability to act with impunity in areas very close to China ( such as the Sea of Japan , or Taiwan ) might begin to erode ( though it would not disappear overnight ) , particularly if China built up its own forces rapidly and our Asian allies did nothing in response .
What this means , it seems to me , is that we would want to reallocate a larger percentage of defense assets to Asia , thereby mitigating the effects of an overall budget decrease .
We also want to devote more attention to nurturing security ties with other states in the region , who are increasingly concerned about China ’s rise and should be willing to do more to maintain a balance in the region .
Of course , they are more willing to contribute their fair share if they understand that the United States is n’t going to do it all .
And then there ’s Central Asia .
We ’re now spending $ 100 billion or so each year trying to defeat the Taliban and establish a functioning state in Afghanistan , and there ’s no end in sight if we persist in that quest .
( That ’s why you keep getting reminded that the summer 2011 " deadline " is n’t particularly firm ) .
Getting out of Afghanistan could have significant effects there , but as I ’ve noted before , I do n’t think it would have particularly significant effects on U.S. security .
More to the point , it is far from obvious that investing more money and lives in that mission is going to yield positive long - term effects for U.S security .
In other words - and contrary to the Obama administration ’s positions — it may not matter very much for us if we win or if we lose .
So if reducing defense expenditures also means getting out of the nation - building business there , fine by me .
The bottom line is that major cuts in defense spending might not be nearly as destabilizing as many people think .
I ’m not saying it would have no effects , but they would be less dramatic than we often assume and in some cases might even be salutary .
Do n’t forget that continuing to live beyond our means carries ample risks too , as well as sizeable opportunity costs .
And if you do n’t believe me , just ask our last five - star general .
Of course , this blog post is hardly a systematic study of this issue , and it ’s possible that I ’m being overly sanguine .
The question of how reduced U.S. defense budget would affect world politics cries out for systematic analysis , and it is precisely the sort of topic that our intelligence services ought to be tasked with evaluating , preferably under the guidance of a smart and independent - minded director .
Because there tens of billions of dollars at stake , we know the answers we are likely to get from the Pentagon , or from think tanks that depend on defense contractors for their livelihood .
Ideally , an effort to address this question would draw upon the knowledge and expertise of academic experts , journalists with regional expertise , and some members of our diplomatic corps as well .
Disclaimer : I do n’t for one second believe that we are going to see defense cuts of the sorts imagined here under the Obama administration , though I think downward pressure will be hard to resist .
When that happens , doomsayers will undoubtedly predict disaster if the budget is held flat .
If my analysis is right and even drastic cuts would have little impact , then it follows that holding the budget flat would have no negative geopolitical effects at all .
P.S , : I ’m told that the Gordon Adams paper referenced above will be available shortly on one of the Stimson Center ’s blogs , here .
This is a very useful site from which you can learn a lot .
Well , it 's turning out to be quite a day of surprises .

better fog - 2010
Intro
Colored fog
Without fog it's not easy to tell the scale of the terrain
With fog we immediately understand the size the terrain
vec3 applyFog ( in vec3 rgb , in float distance ) { float fogAmount = 1.0 - exp ( - distance *b ) ; vec3 fogColor = vec3 ( 0.5,0.6,0.7 ) ; return mix ( rgb , fogColor , fogAmount ) ; } vec3 applyFog ( in vec3 rgb , in float distance , in vec3 rayDir , in vec3 sunDir ) { float fogAmount = 1.0 - exp ( - distance * b ) ; float sunAmount = max ( dot ( rayDir , sunDir ) , 0.0 ) ; vec3 fogColor = mix ( vec3 ( 0.5,0.6,0.7 ) , vec3 ( 1.0,0.9,0.7 ) , pow( sunAmount , 8.0 ) ) ; return mix ( rgb , fogColor , fogAmount ) ; }
Note how fog colors tints to yellow in the background mountains near the sun
Final image ( Elevated , 2009 )
finalColor = mix ( pixelColor , fogColor , exp ( - distance * b ) ) ;
finalColor = pixelColor *( 1.0 - exp ( - distance *b ) ) + fogColor *exp ( - distance *b ) ;
vec3 extColor = vec3 ( exp ( - distance * be.x ) , exp ( - distance * be.y ) exp( - distance * be.z ) ) ; vec3 insColor = vec3 ( exp ( - distance * bi.x ) , exp ( - distance * bi.y ) exp(- distance *bi.z ) ) ; finalColor = pixelColor *( 1.0- extColor ) + fogColor*insColor ;
Non constant density
d (y ) = a⋅b - by
r (t ) = o y + t⋅k y
we have that the total amount of fog is
where T is the distance from the camera to the point .
This integral can be solved analytically , giving
so that our non-constant - density - fog shader is
vec3 applyFog ( in vec3 rgb , in float distance , in vec3 rayOri , in vec3 rayDir ) { float fogAmount = c * exp(- rayOri.y*b ) * ( 1.0 - exp ( - distance*rayDir.y*b ) ) /rayDir.y ; vec3 fogColor = vec3 ( 0.5,0.6,0.7 ) ; return mix ( rgb , fogColor , fogAmount ) ; }
which means that by adding no more than one division to the original formula we can get some cool height based fog ( note that the rest of the formula is constant for a given frame ) .
Not of course that in the code above c equals a/b .
we have that the total amount of fog iswhereis the distance from the camera to the point .
This integral can be solved analytically , givingso that our non-constant - density - fog shader iswhich means that by adding no more than one division to the original formula we can get some cool height based fog ( note that the rest of the formula is constant for a given frame ) .
Not of course that in the code aboveequals
The integral of the fog density function d(y ) over the ray gives the final amount of fog
Note low altitude parts get extra fog
Without height based fog
Fog is very popular element in computer graphics , so popular that in fact we are always introduced to it early in textbooks or tutorials .
However these textbooks , tutorials and even APIs only go as far as a simple distance based color blending , and stop there .
Even advanced demos , interactive applications and games go no further that the simple color blending .
Hopefully one can do much better and introduce some extra beauty and / or realism to the images with very little additional work on top of the basic idea .
Traditionally fog is introduced as being the visual element that gives distance cues in an image .
And indeed the fog quickly helps us understand the distances and therefore scale of objects , and the world itself .
However we should note that fog can also provide more information than that .
For example , the color of the fog can tell us about the strengh of the sun .
Even more , if we make the color of the fog not constant but orientation dependant we can introduce an extra level of realism to the image .
For example , we can change the typical bluish fog color to something yellowish when the view vector aligns with the sun direction .
This gives a very natural light dispersion effect .
One would argue that sucha an effect should n't be called fog but scattering , and I agree , but in the end of the day one simply has to modify a bit the fog equation to get the effect done .
The effect can be done much more sophisticated .
For example the exponent of the dot product between the sun and view vectors ( which of course controls the influence of the directional color gradient ) can be varyied with distance too .
With the right settings one can fake glowing / blooming and other light scattering effects without actually doing any multipass or render to texture but a simple change to the fog equation .
Color can change with altitude too , or any other parameters you might think of .
Another variation of the technique is to split the usual mix ( ) command in its two parts , ie , replacewithNow , according to classic CG atmospheric scattering papers , the first term could be interpreted as the absortion of light due to scattering or " extinction " , and the second term can be interpreted as the " inscattering " .
We note that this way of expressing fog is more powerfull , because now we can choose independent fallof parametersfor the extinction and inscattering .
Furthermore , we can have not one or two , but up to six different coefficients - three for the rgb channels of the extintion color and three for the rgb colored version of the inscattering .
This way of doing fog , combined with the sun direction coloring and other tricks can give you a very powerfull and simple fog system , yet very compact and fast .
It 's also quite intuitive , and you do n't have to deal with tons of physics , maths and magic constants for Mie and Rayleight spectral constants and stuff .
Simple and controlable is the win .
The original and simple fog formula has two parameters : the color and the density ( which I calledin the shader code above ) .
Same way we modified it to have non constant color , we can also modify it so it does n't have constant density .
I 'm gonna follow Crytek 's trick in this one , but you can play and get some cool results with your own formulas too , although the derivation in that case might be a bit more complex .
Real atmosphere is less dense in the height athmosphere than at the sea level .
We can model that density variation with an exponential .
The good thing of the exponential function is that the solution to the formulas is analytical .
Let 's see .
We start with this exponential density function , which depends on the heightof our point :
The parametercontrols , of course , the fallof of this density .
Now , as our ray traverses the atmosphere from the camera to the point , it will be accumulating opacity as it traverses the athmosphere .
The amount of fog it gathers in each of these infinite amount of infinitelly little steps is driven by the fog density ( that we just defined ) at those points .
So we have to add them all together .
But of course , adding an infinte amount of ridiculosuly small things is called " integral " in maths .
So , given our rayAgain , there are many variations that one can add to this constanst - vertical - exponential - fallof - density - function shader .
Some 230,000 New Zealanders have been told that their personally identifiable information may have fallen into the hands of hackers who apparently compromised the network of a locally famous food chain , Hell Pizza .
From a story in The New Zealand Herald :
The personal details of several Kiwi celebrities have been released by hackers as proof they have cracked Hell Pizza 's customer database .
Private information including passwords , e-mail and home addresses , phone numbers - plus pizza orders - has fallen into the hands of the anonymous cyber hackers .
Credit card information was not included in the haul , according to the company , although confidence in that assertion may be tempered by the details of how the chain has handled the matter .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
Patrick Gray of the security Web site Risky .
Biz first broke the story and his report suggests that Hell was waiting for a cold day before taking aggressive action :
The information is ' doing the rounds ' across New Zealand .
Some who came into contact with the database contacted the company last year , posing as ' concerned customers , ' but received no acknowledgement of the data breach .
They fear the database may have already found its way into the wrong hands .
According to Gray , the company initially denied knowledge of any data breach to him but contacted the authorities after being provided with samples of what was " doing the rounds . "
Only last Friday did the chain finally inform its customers .
New Zealand apparently has no law mandating that customers be told when their personally identifiable information has been compromised .
Although a company official suggested that " a rogue employee " may have been responsible for the breach , Gray quoted a security expert as describing " the security arrangements of the online ordering portal ... as ' about 50 steps of fail . ' "
Meanwhile , among the " notables " reported by The Herald to have had their info spilled are radio personality Mike Puru , comic Dai Henwood , entrepreneur Seeby Woodhouse and former Green Party MP Nandor Tanczos .
OK , they 've probably never heard of Lindsay Lohan , either , but at least New Zealand celebrities know how to conduct themselves when caught up in such an episode : with humor and the proper perspective .
From the story :
Puru said he was shocked to hear his information had been hacked .
" It does scare me to think how easy it is to get that information .
I can confirm I do like chicken tenders . "
Tanczos appears to like lemon pepper wedges and vegan pizzas .
" I am not too worried about people knowing my taste in pizza but the other information concerns me .
Once someone can get into your e-mail it is easy to rip off a wider network of people . "
But Henwood , who enjoys a side of kumara wedges or garlic bread , said he was n't overly concerned .
" My Twitter has been hacked , my Facebook has been hacked and I 'm pretty sure half of New Zealand has my phone number already .
I have nothing bad to say about Hell . "
Prior to this incident , the chain 's Web site was perhaps best known for a rather hellacious brand of irreverence .
( You can even drag and drop the little devils scurrying across the bottom of the homepage after finding your closest " Hell Hole " on this store - locator map . )
There are 64 Hell Pizza outlets in New Zealand , nine in Australia , three in England and one in Ireland .

The U.S. Department of Transportation ’s five - year strategic plan was released recently and is open for comment .
It has straightforward goals around safety , environmental stewardship , and organizational excellence that do n’t appear to be too much of a departure from the current plan .
Yet a new set of strategies around the plan ’s Livable Communities chapter has generated a fair share of commentary — and some controversy .
For the most part , the elements of the Livable Communities strategy are clear and focused : coordinated planning , demand management , transportation choices .
These are not dissimilar to recent recommendations from two national transportation commissions .
The controversy seems centered around two main concerns : the ambiguity of the term ‘ livability ’ and the question about whether or not the plan proposes too doctrinaire a role for the federal government in how this nation grows and develops .
The first concern is legitimate ; livability is a vague term and is likely to remain so .
Yet this nation is too big and diverse , has such unique traditions , and is facing wildly divergent growth patterns to expect a lot of clarity .
Terms like ‘ public interest , ’ ‘ green building , ’ ‘ mixed -use ’ , and even ‘ infrastructure ’ have been criticized for being similarly vague but are now part of our daily lexicon .
Adding to the challenge , our recent State of Metropolitan America report showed that even previously predictable metropolitan growth trends — from in -migration to Florida to out - migration in Pittsburgh — reversed since 2000 .
The collapse of fast - developing suburban housing markets meant primary cities and inner , dense suburbs saw growth tick upward at the expense of outer suburbs and exurbs .
Three Grand Central workers were busted for sneaking whiskey and pot into their underground office during their overnight shift on Thursday .

Howard Carter spent years documenting the thousands of artefacts from Tutankhamun 's tomb .
Now , thanks to the efforts of an Oxford archaeologist , this remarkable archive of pictures and notes can be viewed online
From the circular main hall of the Sackler Library in Oxford , an unassuming corridor leads to a staircase that takes you down below street level .
Through a door marked " archive " , office ceiling tiles and fluorescent lights stare down on a cheap blue carpet and a row of grey rolling stacks .
The hum of the air - conditioning lets slip that this ordinary - looking room is hiding something special .
The temperature is held at 18.5C ( 65 F ) , several degrees cooler than the sunny July day outside , while a humidifier keeps the moisture level tightly controlled .
For those grey stacks contain the forgotten secrets of the most famous find in Egyptology , if not all of archaeological history : the tomb of Tutankhamun .
This is the Griffith Institute – arguably the best Egyptology library in the world .
One of its most prized collections incorporates the notes , photographs and diaries of the English archaeologist Howard Carter , who discovered Tutankhamun 's resting place in 1922 .
The only intact pharaoh 's tomb ever discovered , it contained such an array of treasures that it took Carter 10 years to catalogue them all .
Yet despite the immense significance of the discovery , the majority of Carter 's findings have never been published , and many questions surrounding the tomb remain unanswered .
Jaromir Malek is the soft - spoken keeper of the archive whose own Tutankhamun project is nearing completion .
By making all of Carter 's notes available online , Malek wanted to ensure that the public would have access to the full extent of the discovery – and to spur Egyptologists into finishing the job of studying the tomb 's contents .
He has ended up creating a model that other researchers hope will transform the field of archaeology .
The effort has taken even longer than Carter 's gruelling excavation .
It began in 1993 , when Malek says he realised that fewer than a third of the artefacts from Tutankhamun 's tomb had been properly studied and published , a situation he describes as " unacceptable " .
A total of 5,398 objects were found in the tomb , covering every aspect of ancient Egyptian life , from weapons and chariots to musical instruments , clothes , cosmetics and a treasured lock of the royal grandmother 's hair .
A few , like Tutankhamun 's gold burial mask , are instantly recognisable , but many are not well known , even to experts .
Part of the reason is that Carter died in 1939 , just seven years after his excavation ended , and before he could fully publish his findings .
" He started working on the final publication , but he was physically and mentally exhausted after a very hard 10 years , " says Malek .
By all accounts a difficult man to work with , Carter had no collaborators left to continue his work when he died .
And while the artefacts themselves are held in the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Cairo , Carter 's notes were donated to the Griffith Institute , where they have lain largely undisturbed ever since .
The sheer size and importance of Carter 's haul seems to have discouraged scholars from tackling it .
" I often say that the real curse of Tutankhamun is that Egyptologists have tended to shy away from working on the material , " says Marianne Eaton - Krauss , an expert who has written three books about objects from the tomb .
" These pieces are beautifully made .
To study them takes a lot of work , and requires expertise not only on the symbolism , but also the technology . "
So Malek decided that the best way to ensure that Carter 's discoveries saw the light of day was to post the entire archive online .
" We can't make Egyptologists work on the material if they are not inclined to do so , " he says .
" But we could make sure that all of the excavation records are available to anyone who is interested .
Then there will be no excuse . "
A simple idea , but still a daunting task , particularly as a lack of funding meant that Malek and his handful of staff had to carry out the entire project in their spare time .
Carter recorded his finds on more than 3,500 densely written cards , with additional notes by Carter 's chemist and conservator Alfred Lucas , and more than 1,000 images taken by his photographer Harry Burton .
There are also around 60 maps and plans of the excavation site , plus hundreds of fragile pages from Carter 's journals and diaries .
A succession of secretaries scanned and transcribed Carter 's notes in between other work , then Malek proofread the results at evenings and weekends .
Jonathan Moffett , head of IT at the affiliated Ashmolean Museum , built a database that could hold images of the original material as well as transcripts , so the text could be easily searched .
In 1995 the team started posting the records in one of the first websites dedicated to Egyptology .
They called it Tutankhamun : Anatomy of an Excavation .
More than 15 years later , the internet has been transformed : a Google search for Egyptology now returns more than 3 million results .
And Malek 's project is almost complete .
Around 98 % of the material is available , with the last pages to follow within the next three months .
Among the highlights is Carter 's diary from the period in which he discovered Tutankhamun 's tomb .
When I ask to see it , Malek 's assistant Elizabeth Fleming pulls the yellowed notebook from a stiff cardboard case , and with white - gloved hands settles it on a pillow on the table in front of me .
Funded by the Egypt enthusiast Lord Carnarvon , Carter had been searching the Valley of the Kings – ancient Egypt 's royal burial ground – for seven years .
A few objects bearing Tutankhamun 's name had been found in the area and the two were convinced that his tomb lay somewhere beneath thousands of years ' worth of limestone rubble .
Yet season after season of arduous digging , during which their workmen cleared large areas of the valley down to bedrock , produced nothing .
Then on Saturday 4 November 1922 , the dig revealed a step cut into the rock of the valley floor , beneath the foundations of a group of huts .
It was the beginning of a stairway that led to a walled - up doorway : Tutankhamun 's resting place had been found .
Fleming shows me two words from the next day 's entry – " seals intact " – the crucial sign that the tomb had lain undisturbed since the second millennium BC .
Carter 's handwriting , in small , neat pencil , suggests a disciplined , down - to - earth man , not inclined to florid outbursts .
A typical diary entry reads simply " two donkeys " – a reference to the transportation that Carter and his assistant took to the dig site each day .
On Sunday 26 November , however , after his first glimpse inside the 3,300 - year - old antechamber , Carter could no longer contain himself .
As he peeped through a newly burrowed hole , he later wrote in his journal that " the hot air escaping caused the candle to flicker " .
As his eyes became accustomed to the light , " the interior of the chamber gradually loomed before one , with its strange and wonderful medley of extraordinary and beautiful objects heaped upon one another " .
Strange ebony - black effigies of the king , gilded couches , exquisitely painted caskets , flowers , shrines , chests , chairs and chariots glinting with gold gave the appearance of " the property room of an opera of a vanished civilisation " .
Elizabeth Fleming also shows me one of Carter 's plans – the valley 's contours , neatly conveyed in sparse yet graceful black - ink lines .
The dig site was located in the deepest point of the valley , where floodwater dumps debris when it rains .
This , along with the fact that the later tomb of Ramses VI was built almost on top of it , kept Tutankhamun hidden from robbers over the centuries , and from the wholesale dismantling of royal tombs by Ramses XI in the 11th century BC .
The real meat of the archive , however , is in the notes and photographs that record every item found in the tomb in painstaking detail .
Any other archaeologist working in the 1920s might have bundled the treasures out of the tomb in a matter of hours , but Carter worked methodically and meticulously .
Burton 's black - and - white photographs show the team 's progress through the tomb , and these too are available online .
Despite the difficult lighting conditions , these images – acknowledged as some of the best in archaeology – capture the eerie stillness of the tomb when it was first opened .
Chairs and chariot wheels have been casually propped against the wall , while statues stand in their linen shawls as if placed there hours before .
I 'm struck by how messy and jumbled the objects look .
This is partly because Tutankhamun died unexpectedly , so his belongings had to be crammed into a much smaller tomb than would have been intended , and partly because the tomb was robbed shortly after the unfortunate king was buried , and the guards seem to have done a rather careless job of righting the ransacked contents before resealing the doors .
" We can see things missing , " says John Taylor , who looks after the Egyptian mummies collection at the British Museum in London .
" We have the plinths for gold statuettes but not the statuettes themselves .
They broke the gold fittings off furniture .
And we can see fingermarks inside a jar where a robber stuffed his fingers in and scooped out a sticky mass of very valuable scented oil . "
Burton 's photos document each artefact after removal from the tomb : a quick browse of the database reveals some charming treasures – from a leopardskin cloak with a golden head and silver claws to a collection of green and blue draughtsmen and even a folding bed .
A search for " mummy " returns 68 photos taken at various stages of the unwrapping process , from plump outer bandages to fragile bone .
For Malek , a principal aim of the project is to bring the forgotten details of the tomb to as many people as possible .
" We felt this was important because the discovery is so well - known , " he says .
" This does n't belong to Egyptologists only , or even to Egypt only .
Everybody should have the right to see what 's there . "
Taylor agrees that the failure of Egyptologists to publish the discovery in its entirety has left the public in the dark about much of what was in the tomb .
" A lot of the objects will be very unfamiliar to people , " he says .
" What is needed is for schools and people with a more general interest to have access to the basic data and see what 's there . "
In this , the website appears to be succeeding .
It has informed countless school projects and even an interactive DVD being produced by the BBC to accompany an Egypt - themed episode of Doctor Who .
Semmel , the German event promoter , has used Carter 's technical diagrams to make exact replicas of many of the treasures from Tutankhamun 's tomb for an exhibition that is currently touring Europe .
But Malek also hopes to put " moral pressure " on Egyptologists , to encourage them to study this immensely important collection .
Tutankhamun 's is the only royal tomb that we have that was n't gutted by tomb robbers .
If we want to know what an Egyptian pharaoh took with him to the afterlife , he says , " it 's the only one we can look at " .
Everything in the tomb was there so that the king could continue living in luxury , from the food he would eat and clothes he would wear , to ceremonial items such as huge animal - headed couches on which he would have been carried into the afterlife .
" Nothing in the tomb was accidental , " says Malek .
" We will not be able to understand the tomb as a unit until all of the objects are properly explained . "
Egyptologists are particularly excited about what the objects from the tomb can tell us about the technology of the ancient Egyptians .
" We can study how these objects were made , the materials and techniques that were used , " says Malek .
" That is quite rare .
There is a great difference between being able to look at a representation of a chair on the wall of a tomb or a temple and being able to study that particular object in reality . "
Although researchers will always want to study objects directly , gaining access to many of the most priceless items from Tutankhamun 's tomb can be difficult .
Carter 's archive is a useful source of back - up information .
But it also provides a lot of data that would be difficult or impossible to glean from studying the objects today .
For a start , Carter recorded exactly where items were found in the tomb , and how they were positioned relative to each other .
This has helped researchers to make sense of the jumble of objects in the antechamber .
" It seems like just a pile of things , but there is a system , " says Malek .
" You can see what the thinking behind it was . "
For example , items of food should have gone into another room but the space was too small , so at the last minute they were placed into the antechamber .
Marianne Eaton - Krauss recently used the Griffith Institute website in a study of how Tutankhamun was buried .
" It 's a mine of information , " she says .
Eaton - Krauss was able to tell from Carter 's excavation journal that the innermost shrine of Tutankhamun 's tomb was too small to fit properly around his sarcophagus , suggesting that the sarcophagus had in fact been intended for someone else – something that it is impossible to tell from the objects as they are set up on display in Cairo .
Eaton - Krauss points out that many objects from Tutankhamun 's tomb seem to have originally belonged to other kings , and says she hopes the website will stimulate other Egyptologists to investigate further .
" If these were all studied , it would be of great historical significance . "
Also crucial for researchers is the fact that Carter and his colleagues recorded the artefacts almost immediately after the tomb was opened .
" They were the first to see the objects , and therefore saw them in the best condition possible , " says André Veldmeijer of the PalArch Foundation in Amsterdam , who used the website in a recent analysis of the footwear found in Tutankhamun 's tomb .
This is particularly important for finds made of organic material .
One pair of leather sandals , delicately embellished with gold leaf and coloured beads , is shown perfectly preserved in Burton 's photographs , yet Veldmeijer says his visit to the Cairo museum revealed an oozing black mess .
He describes the online archive as " one of the best things in Egyptology " .
As Malek 's project edges closer to completion , the Carter archive offers researchers an unprecedented view of the collection as a whole .
" What 's really interesting is to see the totality of what is in the tomb , " says John Taylor of the British Museum .
" There tends to be a lot of focus on the mummies and the jewellery , but these are just part of a complex of objects .
Only if you study the whole lot together can you see why they are there . "
" You can easily compare different types of object because you have that overview , " agrees Veldmeijer .
" It 's a good example of how you can get so much more from archaeological research . "
He is now pushing for archaeologists working in other areas to take a similar approach , instead of leaving their dig notes on huge collections of record cards that soon become too unwieldy for anyone to study .
Veldmeijer notes a dig at Qasr Ibrim in southern Egypt that is recorded on 20,000 separate cards .
" So many excavations have not been properly published , " he says .
Sitting in front of those grey rolling stacks , Malek tells me that after going through every single page of Carter 's excavation notes he has a new appreciation of the archaeologist 's strength of character .
" He was not easy to work with , " says Malek .
" He was quite often short tempered , perhaps not always tactful .
But what I find really impressive is that there was this massive task , and in spite of all the difficulties , he finished it . "
Something that Malek himself hopes to live up to within the next few months .

YouTube , a division of Google , is exploring a new way to get more high - quality clips on its site : financing amateur video creators .
On Friday morning at Vidcon , an inaugural gathering of the online video community , YouTube is announcing that it will create a $ 5 million Partner Grants Program , which will back emerging auteurs who are attracting growing audiences on its site .
YouTube , which recently turned 5 , has been tremendously successful in capturing the homemade videos of the Flip - cam - armed filmmaker .
But when it comes to more professionally produced video , apart from certain exceptions like music videos , far more material has gone to a rival , Hulu.com .
The grants program is designed to help change that .
YouTube says it will reach out to creators whose work appeals to large audiences and mainstream advertisers , and who are adept at marketing their work across the Web .
Average contributions will range from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand dollars .
The program is similar to efforts at other Internet companies to forge direct relationships with content creators , bypassing the traditional gatekeepers of the media business .
Amazon.com , for example , has introduced a number of self - publishing tools on its Kindle platform and set a high royalty rate for authors .
“ Ultimately the game has changed and people are throwing the rules out the window , ” said George Strompolos , the partner development manager at YouTube .
“ Folks who 10 years ago could n’t even get their content shared to friends across the street are now connecting with audiences around the world .
We see that not only as a cute thing , where someone has a viral hit , we see these people as the next content creators , the next brand in original programming .
It ’s where our roots have always been and we are doubling down on that type of programming . ”

Thanks to Japanese based JFE Engineering , you can now add half - charging your EV to the list , courtesy of its ultra - fast charge station .
Designed to comply with the CHAdeMo standard developed by Tokyo Electric Power Company , Nissan , Mitsubishi , Subaru and Toyota , the system is capable of charging a 2011 Mistubishi i-Miev from empty to 50 % full in just three minutes .
Even just three minutes plugged into the fast - charge station was enough to enable a standard 2011 Mitsubishi i-Miev to travel a further 50 miles before further charging was required .
Mitsubishi's own fast charger , as illustrated at the end of this article by EV advocate , actor and TV presenter Robert Llewellyn , takes between 15 and 30 minutes to fill up an empty i-Miev to full .
The cheapest version of the JFE Engineering charger costs a massive $ 60,000 so it 's highly unlikely they will be purchased in large numbers for private use .
However , with a 0 - 50 % recharge taking three minutes and a 0 - 70 % recharge taking five minutes the charging station may well be fast enough to be utilized at conventional gas stations , where a five minute refill time is in line with any gas car on the market today .
For gas stations placed in prime EV markets such as the Washington DC to New York Corridor , a $ 60,000 investment could pay for itself very quickly as EV drivers willingly pay to enable them to drive several hundred mile trips in one day .
While there are as yet no plans to bring the charger to the U.S. market , JFE Engineering plans to install its ultra - fast charging stations at gas stations and convenience stores all over Japan by the end of March 2011 .
Fast , high power charging , or Level III Fast DC charging as it is known , has yet to be defined as part of the SAE J1772 electric vehicle charging standard adopted by U.S. automakers .
However , the 2011 Nissan Leaf will ship with support for both CHAdeMo and J1772 charging stations .
At 24kWh the 2011 Nissan Leaf has a much larger battery pack than the 16kWh battery pack of the Mitsubishi i-Miev , so just like filling two cars with different sizes of gas tank , expect the larger capacity pack to take longer to refill , even on the ultra - fast charging station .
Basic math would indicate it is quite feasible to expect a 0 - 50 % recharge time of a Leaf - sized battery pack to take between five and six minutes at a similar charge rate .
While fast charge stations will not require anywhere near the expanses of land battery swap stations like those being tested by Better Place need in order to store and charge the huge number of batteries the system requires , consideration will have to be given to the massive high - voltage power lines needed to power a charger capable of recharging an EV so quickly .
But for retail locations and gas stations , the 62.5 kW power requirements of each charger should not be impossible to accommodate in all but the remotest of locations .

Over the last two decades , soccer has evolved from strictly sport to , Cashmore said , a division of the entertainment industry .
Players like Beckham , Lionel Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo , Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho are worldwide brands as much as they are soccer stars .
Thus , some jerseys can be more than keepsakes — they can be commodities .
The Brazil jersey worn by Pelé in the 1970 World Cup was sold in 2002 by the family of the Italian player he had traded with for $ 310,000 .
Nigel Spill , a sports memorabilia dealer in Los Angeles , said a game - worn jersey of a player like Messi , the reigning world player of the year , would be comparable to what a Derek Jeter jersey would fetch , easily into five figures .
“ It ’s not an innocent jersey swap anymore , ” Spill said .
Indeed , when Nadir Haroub of Tanzania received what could be a valuable jersey when he traded with the Cameroon star Samuel Eto’o after a World Cup qualifier in 2008 , the Tanzania Football Federation threatened to force Haroub to pay for a replacement jersey because it could not afford one .
Eventually , the federation relented .
When the Los Angeles Galaxy played Barcelona and A. C. Milan in exhibitions last summer , many of the Galaxy ’s younger and less - well - compensated players schemed about trying to get the jerseys of Ronaldinho and Messi .
Similar conversations took place among players on the United States team in South Africa , the American left back Jonathan Bornstein said .
Still , there is an etiquette to the jersey swap .
Typically , players who trade either know each other — perhaps they are club teammates — have battled over the same area of turf or just happen to be near each other when the game ends .
Even those who are eager to snag a particular shirt try to be discreet .
To Bornstein , all the accounting that takes place in shirt swaps also affirms where a player fits in the increasingly global game .
“ There ’s definitely a totem pole of status , ” Bornstein said .
“ It lets you know where you are on the totem pole . ”
A few weeks ago I was explaining how , against all sensible judgement , I was looking forward to M. Night Shyamalan ’s The Last Airbender .
Even though I was n’t a fan of the show ( I do n’t dislike it , I just have n’t watched it ) , the trailers had won me over to the point where I was willing to entertain the idea that The Happening was a fluke and that this once buzz - worthy director was back on track .
Then I actually watched The Last Airbender and everything changed .
Well , “ watched ” is n’t even the right word .
You do n’t simply “ watch ” The Last Airbender , after all ; it ’s so damned lifeless that you exhume its corpse for 103 minutes .
After walking out of my local megaplex - turned - mausoleum , my initial reaction was that Shyamalan ’s latest movie was worthless .
Absolutely worthless .
Utterly devoid of any net - positive contributions to the world .
Now that I ’ve had a few days to think about it , though , I realize it is not a worthless film .
At its core are a handful of fundamental lessons to be learned .
Sure , most of them revolve around why Shyamalan should never be allowed near a camera phone yet alone a movie camera , but they ’re lessons all the same .
1 . Do not trust post - production 3D conversions .
When Clash of the Titans came out , the post - production 3D conversion on it was so gaudy that everyone with two eyeballs declared it to be garbage .
However , even though we all knew it was crap , most of us ( myself included ) wanted to believe Hollywood when they collectively said , “ Hey we know Clash looked like a clumsy pop - up book , but that ’s just because its post - production 3D was rushed and done on the cheap .
[ Insert Upcoming Movie Name Here ] will be totally different !
We do n’t come out for months , so we ’ve got plenty of time to actually do it right ! ”
Well , now we know that is all bull .
The amount of time means nothing ; it ’s never going to make a difference .
If a film was n’t planned for 3D , it ’s 2D can only be exploited so much .
There will inevitably be a ton of scenes that do n’t even look like they have any 3D to them because the original 2D scenes were too shallow to add depth to .
That ’s just the way it is .
Now , that ’s not to say that all post - production 3D films will be as atrocious as Airbender ’s .
If a director plans for 3D ahead of time and shoots the film with a great sense of depth to begin with ( as it looks like Michele Gondry has with The Green Hornet ) , then it could look pretty decent .
If they do n’t , however , it simply wo n’t .
2 . Do not judge an actor by their performance in an M. Night Shyamalan movie .
Technically this was a lesson first learned on The Happening , where actors who have proven their talent in the past walked through the entire film like they had to come in for rehearsals on their day off , but it ’s worth modifying for Airbender .
A lot is being said of how emotionless of a performance Noah Ringer ( who plays Aang in the movie ) gives and that we ’re basically seeing Jake Lloyd all over again , but knowing how bad Shyamalan has become with actors , I ’m not willing to write him off just yet .
Even several of the side characters have proven more talented elsewhere .
Aasif Mandvi , who plays the villainous firebender uncle , is hilarious as a correspondent on the Daily Show ; here he ’s just completely out of his element , a stranger in a strange land .
Yes , pretty much everyone in The Last Airbender is dreadful , but this is a case where I ’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt of having a bad director instead of simply being bad actors .
3 . Fireballs , giant lizards and magical tsunamis can be boring .
For me this is the most surprising lesson learned from The Last Airbender .
It ’s like the old saying : there ’s no such thing as a bad BJ .
Some are certainly going to be better than others , but the ingredients are so basic that even if they ’re not used together exceptionally , it ’s still not actually bad .
At the very least , what I was expecting from Shyamalan was to deliver a cool movie for kids that would have enough well - done fantasy elements to entertain anyone who likes the genre .
I did n’t think it was possible to make battling with fireballs and water tentacles this boring .
Obviously I was wrong .
I do n’t want to crap all over the film ’s special effects because I have n’t seen them in 2D yet ( in 3D they ’re often incomprehensible ) , but even if the tech behind them is top - notch , Shyamalan still does n’t know how to use it .
Fight scenes are often in slow motion without any discernible reason to be in slow motion ; no stylistic flourishes , no slowing of the speed so as to appreciate the finer details .
Even during a few moments where the fight choreography is quite good , Shyamalan often finds a way to cripple his own good luck , either by editing away from the action or by needlessly prolonging the film with the aforementioned slooooow motion .
There comes a point in Airbender where you ’re so bored by these talking exoskeletons ( and my God how they talk ! ) that no amount of digital wizardry can temporarily jolt the mess back to life .
This is something other bad fantasy movies , like this year ’s Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief , are capable of , but the fact that freezing people , setting them on fire , or threatening to crush them with a wall made of water can be this mundane , this …unfantastical … it genuinely shocks me .
But at least now I know for certain that if Shyamalan is the director , everything that can be ruined , will be ruined .

It ’s been 12 years since Jamie Hector landed his first major motion picture job in Spike Lee ’s He Got Game , although most people know the young actor best as the haunting villain Marlo Stansfield on HBO ’s The Wire .
From 2004 - 2006 , Hector portrayed the conniving , power - thirsty drug dealer with such believability that Hollywood took note .
Since The Wire wrapped , Hector had a recurring role on NBC ’s popular show Heroes , and is starring in several upcoming movies including Night Catches Us with Kerry Washington and Anthony Mackie .
When he ’s not earning a paycheck , Hector actively gives back to good causes , mentoring young people age 12 - 21 via his Moving Mountains organization and raising money to help the 2010 Haiti earthquake victims .
UrbLife.com grabbed some time with the busy actor to discuss his upcoming roles , dedication to his community and opinions on what ’s happening in the world right now .
You have a nonprofit working with young people , and you recently had a pretty big event .
What was that about ?
The nonprofit is an organization called Moving Mountains , I started it when I was younger in a theater company called Tomorrow ’s Future .
I wanted to extend the experiences I had from television , film and theater to young ones that never had that experience .
We put that into position to have kids funneled through the organization to meet people in the industry , and know that they ’re still close to home and that they can accomplish whatever they want to .
We had a fundraiser , but we put the ‘ fun ’ in fundraiser with the cast of The Wire and a paintball competition just to bring awareness to the organization .
Also , it ’s to assist with promoting with the organization , a book club and other things we want to provide to the kids if their family members may not be able to .
Now that you ’re in your 30’s and you ’re thinking of life beyond acting , where do you want to see yourself by the time you ’re 40 ?
Being that I ’m still young , my primary thing is focusing on my career and my craft , but at the same time I ’m not gonna wait until I reach a certain level to give back .
I feel like it ’s in the process , and in the eye of the storm , that is the time to start designing and developing everything necessary to pull everybody up with you .
While you ’re moving forward you pull everybody up with you , but my primary focus is the craft because I love it .
If there ’s nothing going on [ in the U.S. ] , you can find me on stage in Africa somewhere doing it .
Later on in life I could possibly see myself doing the same thing , but you never know how things will turn out .
All of these things have been a blessing , because after The Wire and Heroes there ’s still been a push and a progression .
You ’re Haitian - American , and when the earthquake happened earlier this year you were one of the first people to step up and start raising money to do whatever you could .
Where are you with helping Haiti now ?
Being that it ’s an ongoing situation in Haiti , it ’s never something that you can stop doing .
I was assisting Haiti before that tragedy , and as that came along it was just a part of the process .
I ’m still working with organizations like Karma , I ’ve been working with my church CCC [ Christian Cultural Center ] and we ’ve donated $ 12,000 to Haiti .
More than anything , I plan to go over there .
The last two times I was supposed to go over there to lend a hand I was working , so unfortunately that was impossible .
But my plan is to go over there and make my presence felt , to do what I possibly can on the ground .
My strengths are basically from the position I stand , which is to build awareness and try to get some capital funded down there .
Hopefully I can help things move in the right direction , instead of all that money being down there now and people wondering where it went .
What do you think right now are the biggest needs for Haiti ?
The biggest need right now for Haiti is infrastructure , there are so many necessary components .
It ’s like a pyramid , all of these needs are necessary and we have to start from the bottom up .
Primarily you have to feed the people , but you have to educate the people so that they know how to feed themselves and you have to make sure the politics are taken care of .
Personally , if I can just throw a pebble in the water to make people aware .
Even though President Bush is a different kind of guy , when he said to send money to Haiti I understood it because it was real .
What is your take on the BP oil spill happening right now ?
They need to address that situation , I ’m just trying to figure out how on earth it got this far .
So many things I ’m questioning , it ’s not Obama ’s fault and it ’s not his Katrina .
People are saying this is going to be his Katrina , he addressed it immediately and held the people accountable right away .
I just feel that with the amount of money these people take in , it ’s something that should have been addressed a long time ago .
I think I just read the other day that this might take until the Fall to be addressed .
I do n’t eat meat , and I do n’t want to eat fish with oil in it .
I respect that they put it out there for the public to send their ideas in about what should be done .
That ’s the great thing about social networking , now we ’re all involved in the problem and we have to be proactive .
Whatever I can do , I ’m down for the fight .
What do you have coming up in the future ?
We got Just Another Day with myself and Wood Harris , we went to Orlando and shot that project .
It ’s a fun piece , a Hip Hop film about one artist that ’s already reached his success , and me who ’s trying to climb up the charts , not realizing the other artist ’s trials and tribulations .
All I see is the glitz , glamour , glitter and gold , not understanding the beautiful process that is the journey of making it to that peak where the other artist is .
When I reach it to where he is , I realize he ’s miserable having to make a hot album , hope that the public loves it and that he does n’t go wood .
The struggle he goes through with his record label makes me realize that it ’s still a fight even when you reach that level .
Pretty much a true story about the behind the scenes struggle of a Hip Hop artist …
People think they should just go ahead and get signed , but they do n’t know that Nas was going hard to get signed .
LL Cool J was sending in demos to get signed .
The ugly part of that process is people do n’t realize you gotta put in that legwork that my character put in , and the legwork of the character who was already in position , what he has to do now and what people are telling him is right .
Another one that I ’m proud of is Night Catches Us , that ’s a Black Panther film and it takes place in Germantown , Philadelphia in 1978 .
Kerry Washington , Wendell Pierce , Anthony Mackie and a newcomer that I just did a stage play with as well named Amari [ Cheatom ] , he ’s a great young talent .
My character ’s name is Do Right Miller , a soldier in the Black Panther party in a fight against the FBI .
One guy I felt was a snitch , and when he left , I was n’t gonna make it too easy for him to come back into town .
I felt like it was his fault that there was the demise of The Black Panther party and a best friend of mine was killed , so I made it very uneasy for him to be comfortable .
I let everyone know he was a problem and that it was him that snitched us out .
It ’s a beautiful story .
You ’re working with Wendell Pierce again , who ’s starring in HBO ’s Treme , which some have called The Wire of New Orleans .
Have you been watching Treme , and did you want to try out for it ?
I love it , and to be honest I do n’t think there ’s anything that the creators would do that I would n’t want to work on .
I ’d love to work on all of their projects , just because I love to speak the words that they write and live into the character , they ’re gifted at what they do .
As far as people calling it The Wire of New Orleans , it ’s different , it ’s a tempo .
You have Marcy Projects and most people coming from there have something from Jay - Z , you have Queensbridge where most people have something from Nas .
In Jamaica Queens you ’ll have something from 50 Cent .
They write the project , and just like when they did The Wire , you see the realness and authenticity .
The camerawork is almost like a documentary , where you ’re asking if this is really happening .
That ’s impressive to the audience even though they saw it already [ with The Wire ] , but this time it ’s about jazz in New Orleans .
I love it , the writing is amazing .
Were there any moments in this show that made you want to revisit the Katrina tragedy and see what ’s going on down there ?
When they ’re looking for the young man that was in prison , and they bring Anwan Glover out assuming it was him , that right there speaks to the fact that so many people were missing [ after the storm ] and not even considered .
Reading and hearing about all of the people who were displaced .
I never had an opportunity to go out there , but I heard it ’s still upside down and topsy - turvy .
What else do you have coming up ?
Right now I ’m working on a film [ in Philadelphia ] with Charles S. Dutton called The Gift .
He ’s an amazing talent , I just want to be surrounded by the best of the best .

Magazines are celebrating curves !
As long as they stay within the narrow size requirements .

There are straight - size models and plus - size models , and then there are the models who fit the straight - size measurements but are just a little more curvy and busty .
They just are n't waif kind of straight - size , and are therefore used by magazines and labels to gain some cred for being inclusive .
The straight - size - but - with - boobs models walked the Fall runways for Prada and Louis Vuitton , and Prada 's influence is so vast that you could credit the brand for the industry 's obsession with blonde , doe - eyed waifs in the Sasha Pivovarova mold .
But why is n't the influence holding any power now , and here in the U.S. ?
Since the Fall shows ended , European publications such as French Elle and Italian Vanity Fair have cast in editorials plus-size Amy Lemons and Crystal Renn , respectively .
But when American magazines talk about " plus- size " women , the publications benefit more than the actual plus - size models themselves .
They can throw around words and headlines that make them look inclusive , but when it comes down to who they actually choose to feature and the images they present , the plus - size models are n't getting work ; the " bigger " straight - size ones are .
American Vogue wrote about straight - BUT - WITH - BOOBS
Lara Stone 's struggle in the industry and used straight - BUT - WITH - BOOBS Doutzen Kroes for a swimwear story , and straight - but - LOOK !-BOOBS !
Miranda Kerr was featured in the recent V spread entitled " A Woman in Full . "

Prada used Kerr in their Fall campaign .
V dedicated an issue to size — my problems with it were best articulated by Laia at Geometric Sleep — and promised to start using plus - size models regularly , but the only one they 've hired since is Crystal Renn , and she got only one photo .
Glamour put Renn on its cover wearing a bathing suit , though there were a number of problems with the context .
Renn also walked for Chanel 's resort collection — let 's hope she 's kept for seasons people actually care about , and that she does n't become the plus - size model among brands and magazines , meaning , the only one ever used .
I 'd like to see plus - size models allowed to actually wear clothes more often ; otherwise you 're not changing the idea that high fashion is exclusive to skinny women .
Do n't continually point out that they 're different , with a few condescending headlines about how , do n't worry , curvy women can be beautiful too !!
If you want to be accepting of different body types , just include the different body types without having to justify it with a special headline , repeatedly making sure that we see how celebratory of body diversity you are for not using a 15 year - old Twiggy replica .
You do n't need to ease the consumers into anything , giving us time to get used to seeing thicker girls .
We 're ready !
I knew that there was no right way to tell my family that I was transgendered - just that some ways were more wrong than others .
( Dressing as Marilyn Monroe and bursting from a cake at a birthday was the first I discounted . )
To find the least wrong way , I had to rack my memory for any clues , however minor , however old , as to how my family might react - and try to anticipate them .
I 'd come out as ' gay ' to them aged 18 , when someone who'd been at school with me called to say he'd heard " a horrible rumour " that the girl over the road had seen me wearing a dress ( imagine ! ) .
My parents were aware that I wore makeup around college , but I knew that I could n't pass off dressing at home as youthful rebellion : panicking , I decided to tell them something before someone else did .
I naively presumed that ' gay ' would cover any sexual or gender difference in my parents ' minds : after a couple of tough conversations , things had carried on as before .
But I came to think ( without any real evidence ) that they were n't fully aware of my gender issues , believing that they 'd dismissed my sixth - form expression as a phase .
For years I avoided the subject because I could n't find the right word : cross - dresser sounded too innocuous ( like writing to say I 'd taken up the ukulele ) , transvestite too sexual , and transgender too vague - it would invite further questions rather than clarify who I was .
Coming to define as transsexual meant I 'd have to come out again .
This would be much harder , as my stock line of " I 'm still the same person " would n't work so well : in time I 'd have a different body , a different voice , and a name different to the one they 'd given me .
I discussed it extensively with friends , as well as checking the Transsexual Road Map 's page on coming out to parents .
A letter seemed best : I handwrote three pages , starting with the present and then explaining my past in the context of my gender issues .
Then , I figured , they could digest it and respond when they felt ready .
Trembling , I posted it : there was no going back .
I spent the following days contemplating their response .
I expected neither ecstasy nor excommunication , but could not guess where between those extremes it would fall .
I knew that their expectations for me would be challenged - and most likely exchanged for anxieties .
Would they think it was their ' fault ' ?
Fear for my future ?
Or be ashamed of me ?
Days later , I received an email from my father , explaining that although they were struggling to comprehend my decision , time and understanding would enable us to continue to be part of each other 's lives .
They visited me in Brighton and we had a long , difficult conversation where we discussed all their fears at length : I might regret it ( a risk I was no longer unwilling to take ) ; I might not ' pass ' ( not my primary concern ) ; I might get beaten up ( I 'd developed strategies against that in Crawley and Manchester ) .
Eventually , it seemed best to try to talk about something else .
" Who am I going to talk to about football ? " asked my mother .
" Me ! " I replied .
She was by no means the only person to think of this first .
One friend 's second question was , " Will you still support Norwich ? "
To which I said , " No , Ipswich . "
Perhaps this was because they 'd absorbed some stereotypical ideas about trans women becoming Stepford - esque when living as female .
I was surprised that they 'd applied this to me - but I was more surprised that on coming out , friends and family might initially see my transition as some sort of ' death ' .
Carrying on our relationships as normal soon proved that all that was ' dying ' was my masculine façade .
Fine : as long as your loved ones can accept that conforming to the expectations around your assigned gender was a ' façade ' and carry on ' as normal ' - or at least try .
Support services for families of transsexual people exist , but remain underfunded and underpublicised : Depend offers information and online discussion forums ; the Beaumont Society , originally a support group primarily for heterosexual transvestites and their wives , provides opportunities for trans people and relatives to meet ; and Mermaids runs an information line for gender - variant children and their families .
None of these , though , are particularly prominent , and I 'm sure that my parents were n't the only ones who did n't know where to find them , turning instead to television documentaries - which often overplay the ' pathetic ' in ' sympathetic ' , or reinforce stereotypes and prejudices handed down through generations as transgenderism became visible during the last century .
Attending the Clare Project for sessions with a gender - specialist counsellor , I saw firsthand how the internalisation of these prejudices affected people - people transitioning in their fifties or sixties because they 'd felt too afraid to do so in their youth , in floods of tears because their wives might become estranged , their children ( or grandchildren ) might disown them , or their elderly parents might die without accepting them .
One friend of mine was barred from her mother 's funeral , long after coming out to her family .
I 'm sure she was not the first , and wo n't be the last , to suffer such rejection .
I 'm fortunate enough to be able to negotiate a new ' normality ' with my parents : I 've asserted my new identity more slowly than with my friends , allowing them time to adjust , and share the news with other relatives , who - having less invested in my gender and public image - have been accepting .
For my parents , my ' becoming a woman ' has not realised their worst fears ( embodied by those Daily Mail columns and cartoons ) : ' time and understanding ' from both sides have indeed allowed us to remain part of each other 's lives , thanks to our willingness to respect and share each other 's concerns .
I hope that with each generation , more families are able to do the same .

Fuck the Republican Party How to Win the War They 're Waging on Us
I get it :
There are some hot Republicans out there .
I 've undressed a few of 'em with my own eyes .
I 've been to the Republican National Convention .
Twice .
And , yes , there 's nothing like a good hate / pity / mercy fuck now and then .
But self - respecting queers should not be fucking card - carrying Republicans .
Oh , you can attempt to rationalize a same - sex encounter with a card - carrying member of the GOP any which way you want —
" Someone has to fuck some sense into Aaron Schock ... " — but unless you 're taking one for the team , there 's simply no excuse .
( Taking one for the team = sticking it in / to a high - profile , anti-gay GOP closet case you intend to out . )
Remember when Mike Jones fucked Ted Haggard ?
That was taking one for the team — but only because he was smart enough to save Haggard 's voice mails .
When the men who fucked various Republican douchebags were interviewed in the documentary Outrage , they were taking one for the team — but only because they stepped forward to out the scumbags they 'd fucked .
When you fuck a hypocrite like Larry Craig in a men's restroom and keep your mouth shut , you 're not taking one for the team .
You 're protecting a lying , cheating , aging piece of shit .
Here are a few things burning up the interwebs as I sit down to write this :
In an interview with the New Yorker , " GOP presidential hopeful " and Fox News yakker Mike Huckabee cites the " the ick factor " as justification for a constitutional ban on same - sex marriage .
( Ever been to Arkansas ?
If " ick " disqualifies people for marriage , well , they can stop issuing marriage licenses in Arkansas . )
Bloggers are picking apart the Texas GOP platform , which calls for the arrest and prosecution of any public official who performs a gay wedding and calls for jailing sodomites .
( One GOP elected official in Texas says that prison is too good for us — too much " fun " to be had — so he 's advocating for the death penalty . )
And GOP Bible - humpers are still crapping their pants about President Obama 's Father 's Day proclamation , which acknowledged gay dads along with straight dads and single dads .
( Including — oooooh — gay dads who 've admitted to having had a couple of three - ways . )
And that 's on a single day .
As the weeks , months , and next few years go by , we can count on the GOP to oppose employment protections for gays and lesbians , to block federal recognition of same - sex relationships , and — oh look , there 's John McCain leading the opposition in the Senate to the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell . "
( That would be the same John McCain who condemned " agents of intolerance " on the right in 2000 .
Now he 's taking his cut . )
And every last name being floated for the party 's nomination in 2012 — Sarah Palin , Rick Santorum , Mike Huckabee , Mitt Romney — aggressively opposes any manifestation of gay civil equality .
Yeah , yeah :
The current president , a stand - up guy on so many other issues , clearly is n't willing to lead — or risk political capital — on gay issues .
Dan Choi , an Arabic linguist who was discharged from the military a year ago after coming out on The Rachel Maddow Show , did n't chain himself to the White House fence in March ( along with another outed military officer ) and then again in April ( along with five other veterans ) because the pace of progress on our gay issues has been so dizzyingly swift .
The Democrats are like an unreliable , sometimes maddening friend — but a friend who still manages to come through now and then .
The GOP , on the other hand , is an implacable mortal enemy .
And we do n't sleep with the enemy .
But if someone does get a chance to fuck some sense into Aaron Schock , video that encounter , please .
H ere 's how to really fuck the GOP : Keep coming out .
According to the results of a CBS News poll released earlier this month , 77 percent of all Americans now know someone who is gay or lesbian — up from 42 percent in 1992 — while 84 percent of Americans under the age of 30 know someone who is gay or lesbian .
And 60 percent of all Americans say they have a " close friend , work colleague , or relative " who is gay or lesbian .
It 's not a coincidence that wide majorities of Americans now support allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces — including majorities of independents and conservatives .
Two - thirds of Americans are in favor of granting gay and lesbian couples all the same rights and responsibilities of marriage , even if there is n't majority support for marriage equality .
More than half of all Americans support workplace protections for gays and lesbians .
And the numbers are going to keep trending our way , so long as we keep coming out .
So keep coming out , fucking around , dating and falling in love , marrying ( if we 're the marrying kind ) , and having a kid or two ( if we 're the parenting kind ) .
We do n't wait for Mike Huckabee to get over the " ick . "
( And , hey , parent or not , have a three - way or two — helps to keep that spark alive . )
The more of us who are out to friends and family , the smaller the electoral return on the GOP 's gay - bashing investment .
They are playing politics with our lives — angling for votes from an ever - dwindling number of hateful , terrified , increasingly elderly homophobic voters .
We can help to marginalize the GOP politically , and thereby help to thwart not just their anti-gay agenda , but their anti-environment agenda , their anti-health - care agenda , their anti-choice agenda , their anti-green - energy agenda , their anti-middle - class agenda , their anti-worker agenda , their anti-immigrant agenda , and their anti-science agenda , just by being out .
If you are young and still figuring this shit out and are a little intimidated by the Republican point of view , afraid of the Jesus freaks , the haters , and the rednecks , and maybe even your family , come out of the closet anyway .
' Tis the season .
If you are not so young and you 're still in the closet , Jesus fucking Christ , what are you waiting for ?
Religious ?
That 's actually a choice , you know , and you can choose a religion that embraces imaginary superfriends and gay love , too .
Fuck sending a check to the Human Rights Campaign or marching in a Pride parade or hanging a rainbow wind sock on your porch : Coming out is the single most important thing you can do to advance the cause of gay civil equality .
Period .
So get out there and be honest about who you are , where you are , and who you love .
Because when you do that —
" Hey , Grandma , there 's something I need to tell you ... " — you leave the extreme right with fewer and fewer suckers willing to buy the hate - spiked snake oil they 're selling .
You wanna fuck the Republicans ?
Come out and keep coming out .
But do n't fuck Republicans .
They can go fuck themselves .
A supposed customer bolted with a $ 20,000 diamond from a jewelry store in the Cherry Creek Shopping Center Tuesday afternoon , Denver police said today .

Nick Clegg 's plan to reform the UK's electoral system was tonight caught in a pincer movement between Conservative backbenchers and elements of the Labour party , who both want to change the date of the referendum and potentially derail it .
The executive of the Tory 1922 backbench committee and the shadow justice secretary , Jack Straw , are laying plans to amend the legislation setting up a referendum on 5 May .
Under Clegg 's scheme , voters will be asked whether they want to maintain the first - past - the - post system or abolish it in favour of the alternative vote in which candidates are ranked in order of preference .
The Liberal Democrats ' opponents started to lay down the battle lines today after the Guardian revealed that Clegg would announce , on Tuesday , that a referendum will be held on 5 May .
The deputy prime minister wants to hold the vote on that date to maximise turnout as voters will be going to the polls in the local elections in England and the elections to the devolved bodies .
Downing Street confirmed that David Cameron would campaign for a no vote .
Under the coalition agreement with the Lib Dems , the prime minister pledged the Tories would support legislation enabling a referendum .
But he and his party would be free to campaign for a no vote .
Tory MPs have been told by Downing Street that even if the referendum is passed , a general election would not be held under AV until a boundary review is held to decide on the new constituencies .
" That is designed to stop the Lib Dems walking out of the coalition the day after a yes vote and triggering a general election , " one Conservative said .
The executive of the 1922 committee is making elaborate plans to disrupt the referendum .
Bernard Jenkin , the former frontbencher who has been appointed to negotiate with ministers , said Tories were duty bound to support the enabling legislation .
But he warned that backbenchers would be prepared to table rebel amendments if ministers did not give ground on the date and raise the threshold to make it more difficult to win a yes .
" I am astonished to hear that they are thinking of putting this referendum on the same date as the elections in the Scottish and Welsh parliament , " he said yesterday .
Jenkin told the Guardian he would demand a high threshold , possibly modelled on the system used for the Scottish devolution referendum in 1979 .
A majority of voters ( 51.6 % ) supported a Scottish parliament but the referendum was annulled because the rules required a yes from at least 40 % of the overall electorate .
Straw said he would support a referendum on AV because Labour pledged to hold one in its general election manifesto .
But he told Radio 4's The World at One : " There is an issue about the date .
We have got to think about this . "
Straw also criticised Clegg 's plans to announce at the same time that the Commons would be shrunk by 10 % to ensure that parliamentary constituencies are of equal size .
This was a key Tory manifesto pledge .
" What would be wholly wrong and quite unprincipled was for the Conservatives with , astonishingly , Liberal Democrat support to use this legislation to slip in these proposed changes which they say are just about equalising boundaries , " Straw said .
Clegg will be hoping for more support from the next Labour leader .
Ed Miliband , one of the frontunners , said he would campaign for a yes vote on AV " whenever the referendum takes place " .
Many states are confronting the problem as part of a broader effort to keep so - called drugged drivers , including those under the influence of marijuana and other illegal drugs , off the road .
“ We have a pretty clear message in this country that you do n’t drink and drive , ” said R. Gil Kerlikowske , President Obama ’s top drug policy adviser , who wants to reduce drugged - driving accidents by 10 percent over the next five years .
“ We need very much to have a similar message when it comes to drugs . ”
There is no reliable data on how many drivers are impaired by prescription drugs , but law enforcement officials say the problem is growing so quickly that states are putting hundreds of police officers through special training to spot signs of drug impairment and clamoring for better technology to detect it .
Even the prevalence of drug - impaired driving is unknown , since many states combine the arrest data with that for drunken driving .
Mr. Kerlikowske points to a 2007 survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which screened 5,900 nighttime drivers around the country and found that 16.3 percent tested positive for legal or illegal drugs .
The tests could not determine which drivers were impaired by drugs , but Mr. Kerlikowske said the results suggested a problem that had “ flown below the radar ” for too long .
“ You do n’t want to scare people , ” he said , “ but you certainly want to make them aware of the dangerousness .
You can be as deadly behind the wheel with prescription drugs as you can with over - the - limit alcohol , and you are responsible for your own actions . ”
In interviews , law enforcement officials around the country said anyone who drives while taking prescription drugs is at risk of arrest , not only those who drive recklessly .
In one recent case near Bangor , Me. , a pickup truck on a rural road was not swerving , speeding or otherwise hinting that its driver was impaired .
A police officer stopped the truck because of its noisy muffler , then saw that the driver ’s eyes were bloodshot and his speech slurred .
NHL rejects Ilya Kovalchuk contract with New Jersey Devils | All Things Avs
Here ’s what one high - level NHL person told me me tonight about this development : " Much ado about nothing …it ’s a slap on the wrist , nothing more .
NJ and Kovy have 5 days to restructure .
They will move some dollars around , shave 2 years and League will approve .
The NHL accepted Hossa , Luongo and Pronger … Precedent has already been set .
No way to put the genie back in the bottle now . "
No , no , no and no .
Read the CBA .
Or read my post that quotes the relevant bits :
11.6 Rejection of SPCs and / or Offer Sheets ; Subsequent Challenge and / or De- Registration of SPCs ( a) Rejection of SPCs and / or Offer Sheets .
In the case of an SPC [...] that is filed and rejected by the League , the following rules and procedures shall apply ... [ more at " Kovalchuk Day 20 -- We 're BAAACK ! " ]
See that part in bold ?
That means that , once the league has rejected the SPC , the outlined procedure must be followed .
That procedure ( follow the link above for the details ) is , simply , the NHLPA decides whether or not to protest .
If they do n't , the SPC is voided and the case goes back to Bettman to issue what he deems to be the appropriate penalties , he minimum is a $ 1 MM fine and cap hit .
If the NHLPA decides to protest , it goes to an arbitrator and there is a ruling within 48 hours .
If the ruling upholds the league 's rejection , then the case goes back to Bettman to issue the appropriate penalties , as before .
At no point is there an opportunity for New Jersey and Kovy to " restructure " in order to avoid the arbiter 's ruling .
" The rules and procedures shall [ must ] apply . "
Check out my previous post -- Something Really Bad ( for New Jersey ) That No One is Talking About -- for a more detailed discussion .
And as far as " the precedent has been set " vis-a- vis Pronger , Hossa , etc. , I suggest you consider the following clause of the CBA :
26.10 Investigations .
( d) There shall be no limitation of time barring the investigation of a Circumvention by the Commissioner .
In other words , Bettman can investigate any of those contracts and declare them to be circumventions also .
The " genie " can absolutely be put back in the bottle .
Now , I 'm about to say something that I in no way believe will ever transpire , but I 'm mentioning it only because I find the fact of it fascinating .
But , underline : I do n't think this is going to happen or that there is even a remote chance of it happening .
Bettman has it within his authority to investigate Hossa 's contract and rule it to be " de - registered " as a circumvention .
If an arbiter were to uphold that , one of Bettman 's penalties , which he can apply at his sole descretion , is to cause the circumventing club ( Chicago ) to forfeit any and all games influenced by the circumvention ( i.e. Hossa ) .
Which means Bettman could conceivably declare that Chicago 's record last season is hereby 0 - 82 - 0 .
Since there would be , in the wake of such madness , no way to determine a Cup winner for that season , I would have to assume he would stop short of this " remedy . "
Though it 's funny to imagine Bettman getting drunk and calling Bowman in the middle of the night issuing a threat along those lines .
But he likes Chicago , so he would n't do that .
Which people are bound to point out , if the Kovalchuk rejection is in fact upheld .
Oh , this is going to get ugly .
( CNN ) -- North Korea said it will launch a military strike against propaganda loudspeakers set up by South Korea along their heavily fortified border , state media reported Saturday .
North Korean armed forces " would blow up with sighting shots loudspeakers and all other means for a psychological warfare in case the group of traitors resumes the psychological warfare against ( North Korea ) in the areas along the front , " the Korean Central News Agency reported .
The propaganda loudspeakers are a recent addition to the demilitarized zone that separates the two nations .
They were established after the March 26 sinking of a South Korean warship , which the South blames on North Korea .
The reclusive Communist state pulled out of nuclear talks in April 2009 to protest the United Nations ' condemnation over its nuclear test and missile launches .
The communist nation has accused Washington of violating its sovereignty by singling it out and reporting it to the United Nations Security Council .
North and South Korea have been bitterly divided since the 1950 - 53 war between them ended without a peace treaty .
Chicago Sanitary Canals , anything but sanitary
A story by Dan Egan in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on July 6 , 2010 pulls together threads of sewage , drinking water , commerce , ecosystem deterioration , politics , health , geography , and Asian carp to create a picture of how big a mess we humans are capable of making for ourselves .
Source : Wikimedia
To say a mess might be an understatement .
It begins with Chicago ’s decision in 1900 to reverse the flow of the Chicago River so that it flowed not into Lake Michigan , but inland toward the Mississippi river basin .
To accomplish this , they created a system of canals and locks .
Why did they do it ?
So that their open sewers would n’t flow directly into their drinking water supply .
There is a reason they are called the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canals .
The article explains , which I had n’t known despite spending significant time in the Windy City , that Chicago ’s sewage treatment system discharges only lightly treated fecal matter into the canals and river .
The city drew water from Lake Michigan to create enough flow in the canals to keep the disgusting sludge moving away from the city , like a great flushing toilet tank .
Egan says , “ Chicago has a rare distinction among major American cities :
It does not employ a disinfection stage at its three main sewage treatment plants .
The result is a river and canal system running so thick with fecal coliform that signs along the banks warn that the contents below are not suitable for ‘ any human body contact . ' ”
Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , Looking east from Pulaski Road , Chicago , IL :

As if that were n’t a big enough mess to contemplate , those are the canals that are allowing the Asian Carp to migrate from the Mississippi toward the Great Lakes , as I discussed in a previous blog post .
The dire pollution used to be an effective barrier to the invasive species , but as Chicago has begun to make an effort to treat its sewage more thoroughly ( though still not disinfect it ) , fish , native and foreign , have been moving back into the canal waters .
To replace the sewage barrier , in recent months they have been desperately dumping poison into the water , killing everything in an attempt to keep the Asian Carp out .
Egan says , “ The poisoning is part of a $ 78 million federal emergency plan to buy the Great Lakes some more time .
It includes three electric fish barriers in the canal and research into beating back the invaders with bubbles , lights and even noise . ”
The Mississippi and Great Lakes are two separate hydrological systems , which have evolved in isolation to each other , so the canals can allow not only the Asian invasive fish into the lakes , but also native ones that simply were not meant to cohabit in that ecosystem .
States bordering on the Great Lakes are clamoring , and suing , to get Illinois to close the canals and locks permanently , cutting off the artificial connection between these two great basins .
But how then would Chicago dispose of its effluent ?
And another question , what would it mean for the shipping industry that depends on navigating through the Great Lakes and into the American heartland via those canals ?
Lockport Lock :
And if Chicago does n’t figure out another way to dispose of its sewage , what will the city drink ?
They have been limited by the Supreme Court to taking 2.1 billion gallons of water per day from the lake – which must be split between consumption and the Big Flush .
Egan quotes Josh Ellis , from the nonprofit Metropolitan Planning Council , “ Over the next 100 years Chicago will be at a disadvantage in terms of water supply , ” says Ellis .
“ And I think that ’s the real reason to build a separation – it ’s about the water . ”
A very big mess indeed , and one that will require a lot of ingenuity and money to fix .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Ford Motor Co F.N is counting on a leaner and greener makeover of its Explorer to find new buyers for a once hot - selling sport utility vehicle that powered the automaker 's profits a decade ago .
The Ford Explorer America concept vehicle is shown during the press preview at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , January 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mike Cassese
At the peak of the SUV boom in 2000 , Ford sold 445,000 Explorers in the United States , powering an earnings juggernaut that helped to finance an expansion into luxury brands such as Jaguar , Land Rover and Volvo .
Explorer sales averaged 412,000 per year from 1995 through 2003 , but tumbled as consumers turned away from heavier truck - based SUVs in favor of better - handling and lighter “ crossover ” utility vehicles built on car frames .
U.S. sales of the Explorer dropped by more than a third in 2009 to just over 52,000 .
Once a cash cow for Ford , the Explorer is now outsold by new entrants like the Chevrolet Traverse , a 3 - year - old crossover from General Motors Co GM.UL that offers segment - leading fuel economy .
Ford managers say they recognized that they had a problem when they set out to redesign the Explorer .
“ Right now six out of 10 who own an Explorer defect to another brand , ” said Amy Marentic , Ford ’s car , crossover and SUV marketing manager .
“ We want to switch that around and keep all of those customers like we used to in the early to mid-1990s . ”
Customers are migrating from the Explorer because “ the product is n’t fresh , ” she said .
“ They are looking for a modern up - to - date vehicle with better fuel economy . ”
The new Explorer , set for production in the fourth quarter , is underpinned by a modified version of the car platform used for the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS .
The vehicle will be built at the same assembly plant in Chicago as those sedans .
Ford expects an improved ride , sharper handling and at least a 25 percent improvement in fuel economy over the Explorer ’s current 14 miles per gallon in city driving and 20 mpg on highways .
Some of that improved efficiency will come from better standard engines , an optional turbocharged engine , new six - speed transmissions and better aerodynamics .
The vehicle will retain many of the capabilities of a traditional SUV , with three rows of seats for up to seven adults , and the ability to tow a 19 - foot boat .
LOTS OF CHOICE , LOTS OF COMPETITION
The new Explorer , which Ford began to unveil this week in pictures posted on Facebook and briefings for reporters and analysts , will hit a crowded part of the U.S. auto market .
Since 2000 , the number of utility vehicles in the U.S. market has doubled to 100 , including small to large sport utility vehicles and crossovers .
The Explorer will compete against the Honda Pilot , Toyota Highlander , Jeep Grand Cherokee , Chevy Traverse and GMC Acadia .
“ We are recognizing the realities for a need for a product that is mid-size and where there are more competitors in the marketplace , ” Ford U.S. sales analyst George Pipas said .
Ford , which expects a solid profit this year after avoiding the government - supported bankruptcies that engulfed rivals GM and Chrysler last year , does not expect the Explorer to deliver the kinds of sales it had in its peak years .
Analysts said Ford will count the redesigned Explorer as a success if it reverses the trend of owners switching out of the Ford brand for rival vehicles .
“ The Explorer is a very important launch for them , ” Autoconomy.com analyst Erich Merkle said .
Ford is investing $ 400 million to support Explorer production at its Chicago assembly plant and a nearby stamping plant .
It is adding a second shift of 1,200 workers at the assembly plant to build the Explorer .
Ford has not announced the pricing on the new Explorer .
Starting prices range from $ 29,280 to $ 36,280 on the current version .
We know of only three species of pre-historic mammals that managed to cross the Atlantic ocean between Africa and South - America .
One of them was the now extinct Ucayalipithecus monkey about 35 million years ago .
The other species of “ immigrant ” mammals were New World Monkeys , flat - nosed primates that are found in south and central America today .
The third was a caviomorph , the ancestor of creatures like the capybara .
How they managed to survive the cross -over has long been a topic of heated discussion but it is now presumed that these animals made the journey on floating islands of vegetation that broke off from coastlines .
Some of these island rafts were relatively big and may have included shrubs and small fruit trees that provided the intercontinental travellers with the means to survive .
According to Erik Seiffert , professor of clinical integrative anatomical sciences at Keck School of Medicine : “ It would have been extremely difficult , though very small animals the size of Ucayalipithecus would be at an advantage over larger mammals in such a situation , because they would have needed less of the food and water that their raft of vegetation could have provided .
This is presumably why most of these overwater dispersal events that we know of in the fossil record involve very small animals ”
The image is a still from the acclaimed Werner Herzog film “ Aguirre , the Wrath of God ” , which tells the tale about a 16th century search for El Dorado in the Peruvian Jungle .
In the surreal final scene of the movie its main character Aguirre , played by Klaus Kinski , finds himself on a raft overrun by small monkeys .
It becomes clear that at least this time not Aguirre , but the small shall inherit the Earth .
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Microsoft Corp. needs to do better in the market for tablet computers that Apple Inc. has found success in with the iPad .
" We 've got to make things happen " with Windows on such devices , Mr. Ballmer said at a conference for investors on the company 's Redmond , Wash . , campus .
" We 're in the process of doing that right now . "
Mr. Ballmer said Microsoft is working closely with hardware partners to improve the quality of tablet devices that run Microsoft 's Windows 7 operating system .
The software giant , which currently has four retail stores , is also planning to open three more , he said
Tablet or slate devices — thin , keyboard - free computers with touchscreens — running Windows 7 have n't caught on yet , as computer makers struggle to create products with the responsiveness and ease of use of the iPad .
Apple has done an " interesting job " with the iPad , Mr. Ballmer said , adding " they 've certainly sold more than I 'd like them to sell . "
Antennagate Bottom Line
What is not in dispute : the iPhone 4 antenna has a weak spot in the lower - left corner of the frame , marked by the black line in the frame .
When covered by your hand , this antenna suffers from attenuation .
This is much like other smartphones .
Further , because the antenna is external , the iPhone 4 can suffer from a different kind of “ holding it wrong ” signal loss : bridging the gap on the lower left corner of the antenna with your skin .
This conductive bridging issue is either ( a ) a critical design flaw that never should have been released , and renders the iPhone 4 a dud product ; or , ( b ) a minor problem resulting from a reasonable design trade - off , different but no worse , in practice , than the “ regular ” signal attenuation seen in most smartphones , including the iPhone 3GS , and weak spot or no , it ’s no reason not to buy one .
In short , ( a ) implies the iPhone 4 antenna is a design that Apple should regret ; ( b ) implies it is not .
Apple , obviously , says it ’s ( b ) .
They backed this up on Friday with three pieces of “ hard data ” :
Only 0.55 percent of iPhone 4 owners have called AppleCare to report problems with reception .
The return rate to AT&T stores for the iPhone 4 is 1.7 percent , compared to 6.0 percent for the iPhone 3GS during its first month on the market .
( According to Jobs , even the 3GS ’s 6.0 percent return rate is considered good for a smartphone . )
According to AT&T ’s data , the iPhone 4 indeed drops more calls than the 3GS , but the difference is less than one call per hundred .
Are there some iPhone 4 users for whom this problem is significant ?
Yes .
Will the free cases and offer of a full refund suffice ?
It seems so .
In terms of practical real - world effect , the worst you can say about it is that it tends to drop about one more call per hundred than the 3GS .
Now , you can argue that that ’s a euphemistic way of presenting the call - drop statistic .
Farhad Manjoo , in his coverage of Antennagate for Slate ( headline : “ Here ’s Your Free Case , Jerk ” ) , writes :
While Jobs did admit this fact in his press conference , he mangled the stats to make the iPhone 4 ’s dropped call increase look minor .
“ The iPhone 4 drops less than one additional call per 100 than the 3GS , ” he said .
As Jobs sees it , that ’s not a big rise in dropped calls .
Yet that ’s not an obvious conclusion .
Last year , an AT&T spokesman told me that AT&T ’s average iPhone dropped - call rate is 1 percent — in other words , the old iPhone dropped one call out of 100 .
If the iPhone 4 drops nearly one additional call out of 100 , that could be close to a 2 percent dropped - call rate — or double the dropped - call rate of the old iPhone .
That sounds a lot more serious , does n’t it ?
Jobs stated during the event that , for competitive reasons , AT&T would not allow Apple to reveal the absolute dropped call rate — only the delta between the dropped call rate of the 3GS and 4 .
I think it ’s safe to say most people would consider a number of , say , 5 percent to be shockingly high , even with AT&T ’s reputation .
And at the other end , I ’d have a hard time believing that the 3GS ’s dropped call rate was significantly lower than 1 percent .
So the increase in dropped calls for the iPhone 4 must range between twice as many to 1.2 times as many .
Here ’s an academic paper by M.V. Simkin and J. Olness ( PDF , via this thread on Hacker News ) which estimates the mean industry - wide dropped call rate to be 2.4 percent — all phones on all carriers .
The paper was published in 2002 , however , so it ’s impossible to say how applicable it is to the industry - wide dropped call rate in 2010 .
But it sets a reasonable baseline — a baseline that suggests a “ less than 1 per hundred ” increase in dropped calls is , though disappointing , not particularly alarming .
[ Update , 21 July 2010 : According to slide 11 of this PDF presentation from AT&T back in January , their network - wide dropped call rate for 3G was 0.91 percent . ]
I have a theory , by the way , for why Jobs sounded a tad annoyed — that is , a tad more annoyed than his already annoyed tone throughout the entire event — when announcing Apple ’s offer of free cases for all iPhone 4 owners through September 30 .
I ’ve seen many argue that the existence of Apple ’s bumpers is an indication that Apple knew all along that the iPhone 4 had reception problems that were alleviated by a case ( e.g. Jean - Louis Gassée yesterday ) .
I think it ’s simpler than that , and requires no less cynicism to believe .
After revealing that the iPhone 4 has a slightly higher dropped called rate than the 3GS , Jobs said :
“ Even less than one is too much for us .
We ’re trying to find out why .
We want to drive this lower than the 3GS .
But this does put it in perspective .
So , I have my own pet theory on this , which we have no proof of , but I ’ll give it to you anyway .
When the iPhone 3GS came out , we did not change the design from the iPhone 3 , and there was a healthy market of cases for the iPhone 3G that fit the 3GS perfectly because the design did n’t change .
And in our stores , 80 percent of the iPhone 3GS users walked out with a case .
i Phone 4 has a radically new design ; none of the old cases fit .
Since we did n’t show it to anybody , none of the new cases are ready , and we ca n’t make enough of our bumper cases .
And so in our stores , about 20 percent of the people are going out with a case .
And I think that has something to do with this disparity . ”
So for the 3GS , when cases were in plentiful supply at the debut , 80 percent of iPhone buyers at Apple stores walked out with a case .
I think Apple wanted in on that market .
And because the 4 needs different cases than the 3G / 3GS , Apple had the iPhone 4 case market all to itself for a few weeks , and mostly to itself for a few months .
At $ 29 a pop retail , I do n’t think it ’s a stretch to think that Apple saw this as a $ 100 million opportunity — say , 5 million bumpers at $ 20 profit apiece .
They could have made money with their own cases a year ago with the 3GS , but nowhere near as much as they could have now , as the only case in town that fits the iPhone 4 .
Put in context , the fancy secret antenna testing lab Apple revealed Friday cost , said Jobs , about $ 100 million .
Now , Apple ’s a multi-billion dollar company .
A few hours ago they released quarterly results showing them making over a billion dollars in profit per month .
So $ 100 million is n’t that big a deal .
But the way you get to be a billion dollar company is by having a nose for opportunities .
$ 100 million is $ 100 million .
So if you want to know why Jobs sounded annoyed when he said ( around the 25:25 mark of the video feed ) , “ Why do n’t you just give everybody a case ?
OK .
Great .
Let ’s give everybody a case , ” well , I think you can explain why he sounds peeved by reading that quote as , “ Why do n’t you just give away $ 100 million ?
OK .
Great .
Let ’s give away $ 100 million . ”
Anyway , bottom line on the iPhone 4 antenna : it has a weak spot but there ’s no evidence that it ’s a significant , let alone catastrophic , problem in practice .
It ’s telling that the criticism surrounding this issue has shifted , quickly , from speculation about a technical defect in the iPhone 4 hardware to criticism over the tone of Apple ’s response to it .

U.S. President Barack Obama told Channel 2 News on Wednesday that he believed Israel would not try to surprise the U.S. with a unilateral attack on Iran .
In an interview aired Thursday evening , Obama was asked whether he was concerned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would try to attack Iran without clearing the move with the U.S. , to which the president replied " I think the relationship between Israel and the U.S. is sufficiently strong that neither of us try to surprise each other , but we try to coordinate on issues of mutual concern . "

Obama spoke to Channel 2's Yonit Levy one day after what he described as an " excellent " meeting with Netanyahu at the White House .
The two leaders met alone for about 90 minutes Tuesday evening , during which time they discussed the peace process with the Palestinians , the contested Iranian nuclear program , and the strategic understandings between their two countries on Tehran 's efforts to achieve nuclear capabilities .
Netanyahu promised Obama during their meeting that Israel would undertake confidence - building measures toward the Palestinian Authority in the coming days and weeks .
These steps are likely to include the transfer of responsibility over more parts of the West Bank over to PA security forces .
During the interview Wednesday , when confronted with the anxiety that some Israelis feel toward him , Obama said that " some of it may just be the fact that my middle name is Hussein , and that creates suspicion . "
" Ironically , I 've got a Chief of Staff named Rahm Israel Emmanuel .
My top political advisor is somebody who is a descendent of Holocaust survivors .
My closeness to the Jewish American community was probably what propelled me to the U.S. Senate , " Obama said .
" I think that sometimes , particularly in the Middle East , there 's the feeling of the friend of my enemy must be my enemy , and the truth of the matter is that my outreach to the Muslim community is designed precisely to reduce the antagonism and the dangers posed by a hostile Muslim world to Israel and to the West , " Obama went on to say .
Obama added that he believed a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians could be achieved within his current term .
" I think [ Netanyahu ] understands we 've got a fairly narrow window of opportunity
We probably wont have a better opportunity than we have right now .
And that has to be seized .
Its going to be difficult . "
The American President entirely sidestepped the question of whether the U.S. would pressure Israel to extend a current 10 - month moratorium on construction in West Bank settlements , failing to give a clear answer .
The moratorium is set to expire in September , and Netanyahu has announced that he would not extend the timeframe .
The U.S. , however , views continued Israeli settlement construction as a serious obstacle to peace efforts .
When asked whether he thought Netanyahu was the right man to strike a peace deal with the Palestinians , the U.S. President said that " I think Prime Minister Netanyahu may be very well positioned to bring this about , " adding that Israel will have to overcome many hurdles in order to affect the change required to " secure Israel for another 60 years "
In a separate interview with another Israeli media outlet , Obama proclaimed that he was not " blindly optimistic " regarding the chances of a Middle East peace agreement .
Israel is right to be skeptical about the peace process , he said in another yet - to - be- aired interview that was taped on Wednesday .
He noted during the interview that many people thought the founding of Israel was impossible , so its very existence should be " a great source of hope . "
Meanwhile on Wednesday , Netanyahu told U.S. Jewish leaders that direct Palestinian - Israeli talks would begin " very soon " , but warned that they would be " very , very tough . "
Netanyahu told his cabinet earlier this week before flying to Washington that the time had come for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to prepare to meet directly with the Israelis , as it was the only way to advance peace .
Israelis and Palestinians have been holding indirect talks mediated by Obama 's special envoy to the Middle East , George Mitchell .
Aides to Obama sounded a hopeful tone regarding the negotiations last week , telling reporters that the shuttle diplomacy between the two sides had paid off and the gaps have narrowed .
At a meeting with representatives of Jewish organizations at the Plaza Hotel late Wednesday , Netanyahu discussed the efforts to promote Middle East peace .
" This is going to be a very , very tough negotiation , " he said , adding " the sooner the better . "
" Direct negotiations must begin right away , and we think that they will , " he said .
Description :
FIELD
The subject matter herein relates to implementation of bit - fields in computer software .
More specifically , the subject matter herein relates to a set of bit - field macros that can be used to implement compiler - independent bit -fields .
BACKGROUND
Sometimes programmers desire to subdivide a single “ machine word ” into multiple variables , each with a unique label , so that the subdivisions can be referenced like any other variable .
The subdivisions of the machine word are commonly called “ bit- fields . ”
When the subdivided machine word is a memory space in system memory , or RAM , the compiler alone determines how the machine word is subdivided .
However , when the subdivided machine word refers to hardware , such as a register in an integrated circuit ( IC ) , it is the hardware design that determines the bit - field subdivision .
Thus , the compiler 's method of bit - field subdivision must match the hardware 's method .
Otherwise , software access to the hardware will read or write incorrect data .
In some programming languages , such as C or C++ , the method of bit - field subdivision is not standardized .
In other words , each compiler vendor may implement bit - field subdivision in a different manner .
Thus , using the actual bit - field technique of the programming language to read from or write to hardware ( e.g. the registers in the IC ) is unreliable and not portable between compilers from different vendors .
In the C programming language , bit - fields can only be applied to elements of a structure type , an example of which is shown in FIG .
1 . In this example , a structure named “ abc ” 100 is defined to have three elements , or bit- fields 102 , 104 and 106 : a one - bit unsigned integer “ a ” 102 , a two - bit unsigned integer “ b ” 104 and an eight - bit unsigned integer “ c ” 106 .
Writing to and reading from the bit- fields is done using a conventional structure member operator , as shown in FIG .
2 . For example , a write operation 108 writes an integer “ value ” to the bit - field b of the structure abc .
A read operation 110 reads the contents of the bit - field b of the structure abc into an integer variable “ readvalue . ”
The bits in the machine word that get assigned to each bit - field is dependent on the implementation of the compiler software that compiles the program into machine readable format .
One compiler , for example , may assign the bit- fields “ a ” 102 , “ b ” 104 and “ c ” 106 from the least significant bit to the most significant bit , as illustrated by a machine word 112 shown in FIG .
3 . Another compiler , however , may assign the bit- fields “ a ” 102′ , “ b ” 104 ′ and “ c ” 106 ′ in the opposite order , as shown by another machine word 114 .
For physical bits or registers in the IC ( not shown ) , however , the bits must correspond to the bit- fields 102 , 104 and 106 .
Therefore , use of the compiler that assigns the bit- fields 102 , 104 and 106 in the wrong order can cause errors in the operation of the IC when performing the write and read operations 108 and 110 ( FIG . 2 ) .
Typical work - arounds to this potential problem do not use actual bit -fields .
Instead , they typically define “ mask ” and “ shift ” values for “ pseudo ” bit - fields of an unsigned integer variable .
The pseudo bit - fields are isolated within the variable using AND , OR and SHIFT logical operators .
An example that implements the bit- fields 102–106 ( FIGS .
1 and 3 ) in the machine word 112 ( FIG .
3 ) as “ pseudo ” bit - fields in an unsigned integer variable “ abc ” 116 is shown in FIG .
4 . “ Define ” statements 118 , 120 and 122 define the “ mask ” values for the pseudo bit - fields a , b and c within the unsigned integer abc 116 .
The one - bit pseudo bit - field “ a ” occupies the bit-0 position in the machine word 112 , so the mask value is 0001 ( hex ) .
The two - bit pseudo bit - field “ b ” occupies the bit - 1 to bit - 2 position in the machine word 112 , so the mask value is 0006 ( hex ) , as shown .
The eight - bit pseudo bit - field “ c ” occupies the bit - 3 to bit - 10 position in the machine word 112 , so the mask value is 07f8 ( hex ) , as shown .
“ Define ” statements 124 , 126 and 128 define the “ shift ” values for the pseudo bit - fields a , b and c.
Since the pseudo bit - field “ a ” corresponds to the first bit ( bit - 0 ) of the machine word 112 ( FIG .
3 ) , pseudo bit - field “ a ” requires no shift value , i.e. the shift value is 0 , as shown in define statement 124 .
Since the pseudo bit - field “ b ” starts after the first bit , pseudo bit - field “ b ” requires a shift value of 1 , as shown in define statement 126 .
Since the pseudo bit - field “ c ” starts after the first three bits , pseudo bit - field “ c ” requires a shift value of 3 , as shown in define statement 128 .
A write operation 130 , corresponding to the write operation 108 ( FIG . 2 ) , for writing a “ value ” into the pseudo bit - field “ b ” of the unsigned integer abc is shown in FIG .
5 . Likewise , a read operation 132 , corresponding to the read operation 110 ( FIG. 2 ) , for reading the current contents of the pseudo bit - field “ b ” into a variable “ readvalue ” is also shown .
An exemplary performance of the write operation 130 ( FIG .
5 ) is illustrated by lines 134–144 in FIG .
6 . The write operation 130 performs as a conventional “ read - modify - write ” operation .
The current contents ( line 134 , all Y's denote retained values , 0 or 1 ) of the unsigned integer abc are read from the IC ( not shown ) and ANDed with the inverse of the “ mask ” value ( line 136 ) for the pseudo bit - field “ b ” in order to zero - out the pseudo bit - field “ b ” ( line 138 ) .
The “ value ” ( line 140 , e.g. 3 , or 11 binary ) is left - shifted by one bit ( line 142 ) according to the “ shift ” value defined in define statement 126 ( FIG .
4 ) and ORed with the zeroed - out unsigned integer abc ( line 138 ) to insert the “ value ” into the pseudo bit - field “ b ” ( line 144 ) .
The modified unsigned integer abc is written to the IC with only the pseudo bit - field “ b ” modified .
The pseudo bit - field technique requires the programmer to determine the “ mask ” and “ shift ” values , which is a time consuming and error prone process , especially when there may be hundreds of bit - fields , as is common in IC 's today .
Additionally , the resulting code is difficult to read and write .
Writing the code is not intuitive to the programmer , so the technique is prone to coding errors .
It is with respect to these and other background considerations that the subject matter herein has evolved .
SUMMARY
In various embodiments claimed and described herein , the subject matter described herein involves a bit - field technique ( e.g. a “ pseudo ” bit - field technique ) using a variable that is effectively subdivided into bit - fields .
Bit - field definition numbers are associated with each bit - field of the variable .
The bit - field definition numbers define positions of end bits ( e.g. left / right , upper / lower , etc. ) of the bit- fields within the variable .
Macros may use the bit - field definition numbers to extract a number for each of the end bits of the bit- fields and automatically generate “ mask ” and “ shift ” values therefrom .
The generated mask and shift values may be used to isolate the bit-fields within the variable , such as when performing additional macros for reading from or writing to the bit-fields .
Since the technique does not use “ actual ” bit - fields , the compiler - dependent problems are avoided .
Additionally , since the technique uses macros to automatically generate the mask and shift values , many programmer errors related to determining the mask and shift values are avoided .
Furthermore , inputs to the macros mimic the code used to form actual bit - fields , so the technique is intuitively understandable by programmers familiar with actual bit - field usage , thereby further avoiding many additional programmer errors .
A more complete appreciation of the present disclosure and its scope , and the manner in which it achieves the above noted improvements , can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments taken in connection with the accompanying drawings , which are briefly summarized below , and the appended claims .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
A bit-field , according to the subject matter herein , is defined ( i.e. implemented ) by a bit - field definition number “ BFDN , ” as shown in a format for a conventional “ define ” statement 200 shown in FIG .
7 . The bit - field definition number BFDN is an unsigned ( denoted by the “ u ” ) integer value assigned to a given bit - field , “ < name of bit - field > , ” the < name of bit - field > being an “ alias ” for the BFDN .
The bit - field definition number BFDN is formed , as shown in FIG .
8 , by concatenating together numbers that denote the positions of end bits ( e.g. left / right , upper / lower , etc. ) 202 and 204 of the bit - field within a structure variable , or integer , corresponding to a machine word , such as for communicating between software and hardware ( not shown ) in an IC ( integrated circuit ) , such as a microprocessor , ( not shown ) .
The define statement 200 ( FIG .
7 ) is used to set forth aliases ( e.g. “ a , ” “ b ” and “ c ” ) 206 , 208 and 210 for bit - fields of a structure 212 ( or an unsigned integer variable or other appropriate data type ) of a given name ( e.g. “ abc ” ) , as illustrated in a structure declaration shown in FIG .
9 . The only member of the structure “ abc ” is an unsigned long data type with a name of “ field . ”
The structure “ abc ” 212 effectively forms the machine word 112 ( FIG .
3 ) having the bit- fields corresponding to BFDN aliases “ a ” 102 , “ b ” 104 and “ c ” 106 ( FIG .
3 ) within however many bits ( e.g. 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , etc. ) with which the hardware ( not shown ) and software operates .
The bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) for the BFDN alias “ a ” 206 associated with the structure “ abc ” 212 is defined as 0000u , meaning that the BFDN alias “ a ” 206 is an alias for the unsigned integer value 0000 .
Thus , the first end bit ( e.g. left , upper , etc. ) of the bit- field “ a ” 102 ( FIG .
3 ) that corresponds to the BFDN alias “ a ” 206 is at bit 0 , and the second end bit ( e.g. right , lower , etc. ) of the bit - field “ a ” 102 is also at bit 0 .
In other words , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias “ a ” 206 for the bit - field “ a ” 102 defines a one - bit field at position 0 in the structure “ abc ” 212 .
The bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) for the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 associated with the structure “ abc ” 212 is defined as 0201u , meaning that the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 is an alias for the unsigned integer value 0201 .
Thus , the first end bit ( e.g. left , upper , etc. ) of the bit- field “ b ” 104 ( FIG .
3 ) that corresponds to the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 is at bit 2 , and the second end bit ( e.g. right , lower , etc. ) of the bit - field “ b ” 104 is at bit 1 .
In other words , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias “ b ” 208 for the bit - field “ b ” 104 defines a two - bit field between bits 1 and 2 , inclusive , in the structure “ abc ” 212 .
The bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) for the BFDN alias “ c ” 210 associated with the structure “ abc ” 212 is defined as 1003u , meaning that the BFDN alias “ c ” 210 is an alias for the unsigned integer value 1003 .
Thus , the first end bit ( e.g. left , upper , etc. ) of the bit- field “ c ” 106 ( FIG .
3 ) that corresponds to the BFDN alias “ c ” 210 is at bit 10 , and the second end bit ( e.g. right , lower , etc. ) of the bit- field “ c ” 106 is at bit 3 .
In other words , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias “ c ” 210 for the bit - field “ c ” 106 defines an eight - bit field between bits 10 and 3 , inclusive , in the structure “ abc ” 212 .
An alternative structure 214 of a given name “ cba , ” illustrating how the order of the bit- fields may be intentionally assigned in reverse order , is shown in FIG .
10 .
The structure “ cba ” 214 effectively forms the machine word 114 ( FIG .
3 ) having the bit- fields “ a ” 102′ , “ b ” 104 ′ and “ c ” 106′ ( FIG . 3 ) .
The bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) for a BFDN alias “ a ” 216 associated with the structure “ cba ” 214 is defined as 1010u , meaning that the BFDN alias “ a ” 216 is an alias for the unsigned integer value 1010 .
Thus , the first end bit ( e.g. left , upper , etc. ) of the bit- field “ a ” 102′ ( FIG .
3 ) that corresponds to the BFDN alias “ a ” 216 is at bit 10 , and the second end bit ( e.g. right , lower , etc. ) of the bit- field “ a ” 102 ′ is also at bit 10 .
In other words , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias “ a ” 216 for the bit - field “ a ” 102 ′ defines a one - bit field at bit 10 , in the structure “ cba ” 214 .
The bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) for the BFDN alias “ b ” 218 associated with the structure “ cba ” 214 is defined as 908u , meaning that the BFDN alias “ b ” 218 is an alias for the unsigned integer value 908 .
Thus , the first end bit ( e.g. left , upper , etc. ) of the bit- field “ b ” 104′ ( FIG .
3 ) that corresponds to the BFDN alias “ b ” 218 is at bit 9 , and the second end bit ( e.g. right , lower , etc. ) of the bit- field “ b ” 104 ′ is at bit 8 .
In other words , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias “ b ” 218 for the bit - field “ b ” 104 ′ defines a two - bit field between bits 8 and 9 , inclusive , in the structure “ cba ” 214 .
The bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) for the BFDN alias “ c ” 220 associated with the structure “ cba ” 214 is defined as 700u , meaning that the BFDN alias “ c ” 220 is an alias for the unsigned integer value 700 .
Thus , the first end bit ( e.g. left , upper , etc. ) of the bit- field “ c ” 106′ ( FIG .
3 ) that corresponds to the BFDN alias “ c ” 220 is at bit 7 , and the second end bit ( e.g. right , lower , etc. ) of the bit- field “ c ” 106 ′ is at bit 0 .
In other words , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias “ c ” 220 for the bit- field “ c ” 106 ′ defines an eight - bit field between bits 7 and 0 , inclusive , in the structure “ cba ” 214 .
As shown in FIG .
11 , exemplary macros 222 and 224 ( WRITE — BITFIELD and READ — BITFIELD , defined below ) , or other appropriate programming code techniques , may be called in order to write to and read from any one of the bit-fields ( e.g. the bit- field “ b ” 104 , FIG .
3 ) in the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” 212 , FIG . 9 ) .
The WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 , for example , uses as parameters the name of the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” 212 ) , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias ( e.g. “ b ” 208 , FIG .
9 ) for the target bit - field , and the “ value ” to be written to the target bit - field .
The order of these parameters ( “ abc , ” “ b ” and “ value ” ) in the WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 is the same as the designations required for the write operation 108 ( FIG .
2 ) used with conventional bit - fields , as described above .
Therefore , a programmer familiar with the usage of the write operation 108 will intuitively grasp the usage of the WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 .
The READ — BITFIELD macro 224 , likewise , uses as parameters the name of the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” 212 ) and the bit - field definition number BFDN alias ( e.g. “ b ” 208 , FIG .
9 ) for the target bit - field , and supplies the current value of the target bit - field to a variable “ readvalue . ”
The order of the variable “ readvalue ” and the parameters ( “ abc ” and “ b ” ) for the READ — BITFIELD macro 224 is the same as the designations required for the read operation 110 ( FIG .
2 ) used with conventional bit - fields , as described above .
Therefore , as with the WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 , a programmer familiar with the usage of the read operation 110 will intuitively grasp the usage of the READ — BITFIELD macro 224 .
Lines of programming code 226 , 228 , 230 , 232 and 234 , shown in FIG .
12 , illustrate exemplary usage of the structure “ abc ” 212 ( FIG .
9 ) and the bit - field definition numbers BFDN's ( FIGS . 7 and 8 ) corresponding to the bit-fields “ a ” 102 , “ b ” 104 and “ c ” 106 ( FIG .
3 ) for implementing bit- fields with the WRITE — BITFIELD and READ — BITFIELD macros 222 and 224 ( FIG. 11 ) .
For example , the end bits ( e.g. left / right , upper / lower , etc. ) 202 and 204 ( FIG .
8 ) are extracted from the bit - field definition number BFDN ( via the BFDN alias ) by a LEFTBIT macro defined in line 226 and a RIGHTBIT macro defined in line 228 .
The LEFTBIT macro ( line 226 ) uses the bit- field definition number BFDN as a parameter and performs a conventional “ divide operation ” on the bit - field definition number BFDN by 100 .
The divide operation does not return any “ remainder ” from the division .
Therefore , in the case of the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 , the value defined in FIG .
9 is 0201 , so the divide operation discards the remainder of 01 and returns only the value 02 .
Likewise , the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) uses the bit - field definition number BFDN as a parameter , but performs a conventional remainder operation on the bit- field definition number BFDN divided by 100 .
The remainder operation returns only the remainder from the division .
Therefore , in the case of the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 , the remainder operation discards the value of 02 and returns only the remainder of 01 .
Using the LEFTBIT macro ( line 226 ) and the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) , a “ mask ” is generated of the desired bit - field in the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” 212 , FIG .
9 ) by a FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) .
The FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) uses the bit - field definition number BFDN alias as an input parameter .
The FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) uses the LEFTBIT and RIGHTBIT macros ( lines 226 and 228 ) to extract the end bits of the desired bit - field and forms a “ shift value ” from the difference thereof .
The shift value is applied to an initial mask value having bits containing all logical 1's , except for one logical 0 in the right - most bit ( e.g. fffe ) to left shift the bits of the initial mask value , until the mask value has logical 0's in a field as wide as the desired bit - field .
The initial mask value preferably has the same number of bits as the desired structure ( e.g. “ abc ” 212 , FIG . 9 ) .
The mask value is then inverted , so that it has logical 1's in the field as wide as the desired bit - field .
The mask value is then left shifted by the amount of the right bit , as extracted by the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) , to place the field of logical 1's in the mask value in the same position as the desired bit - field in the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) .
The mask thus generated is used to isolate the desired bit - field for the WRITE — BITFIELD and READ — BITFIELD macros 222 and 224 ( FIG. 11 ) .
Using the FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) and the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) , the READ — BITFIELD macro ( line 232 ; and 224 , FIG . 11 ) extracts the current value of the desired bit - field from the structure ( e.g. “ abc , ” FIG . 9 ) .
The READ — BITFIELD macro ( line 232 ) uses as input parameters an “ address ” ( i.e. the name ) of the desired structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) and the bit - field definition number BFDN alias corresponding to the desired bit - field within the structure .
The FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) is used to generate a mask for the given bit - field definition number BFDN .
The current value of the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) defined by the “ address ” parameter is read from the hardware ( not shown ) , and the mask is logically ANDed with the current value , thereby zeroing - out the bits of the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) that are not part of the desired bit - field .
The ANDed result is right shifted by the amount of the right - bit 204 ( FIG .
8 ) extracted by the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) to form the desired bit - field value .
The value thus extracted may be placed into the variable “ readvalue ” ( FIG. 11 ) .
Using the FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) and the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) , the WRITE — BITFIELD macro ( line 234 ; and 222 , FIG. 11 ) inserts a “ value ” into the desired bit - field of the structure ( e.g. “ abc , ” FIG . 9 ) .
The WRITE — BITFIELD macro ( line 234 ) uses as input parameters the “ address ” ( i.e. the name ) of the desired structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) , the bit - field definition number BFDN alias corresponding to the desired bit - field within the structure and the “ value ” to be inserted into the desired bit - field .
The FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) is used to generate a mask for the given bit - field definition number BFDN .
The current value of the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) defined by the “ address ” parameter is read from the hardware ( not shown ) , and the mask is inverted and logically ANDed with the current value , thereby zeroing - out the bits of the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) that are part of the desired bit - field .
The “ value ” to be inserted into the desired bit - field is then left shifted by the amount of the right bit as extracted from the bit - field definition number BFDN by the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 ) , so that the relevant bits in the “ value ” are positioned the same as the desired bit - field in the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) .
To ensure that the number of bits in the “ value ” do not exceed the number of bits in the bit- field , the shifted “ value ” is ANDed with the mask generated by the FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) .
The shifted “ value ” is then logically ORed with the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) having the zeroed - out bits of the desired bit - field .
The result is then placed back into the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” ) defined by the “ address ” parameter and thereby written back into the hardware ( not shown ) .
An exemplary performance of the WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 ( FIG . 11 , see also line 234 , FIG. 12 ) comparable to the exemplary performance of the write operation 130 ( FIG .
5 , illustrated in FIG .
6 ) is shown in FIG .
13 . Data resulting at each step of the WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 ( line 234 ) is shown in lines 236–266 for the exemplary “ value ” to be written to the bit- field “ b ” 104 ( FIG .
3 ) in the structure “ abc ” ( FIG . 9 ) .
The current value of the structure “ abc ” 212 ( FIG .
9 ) as determined by the “ address ” provided to the WRITE — BITFIELD macro 222 ( FIG . 11 , see also line 234 , FIG. 12 ) is retrieved from the hardware ( not shown ) at line 236 .
The Y's denote retained values for the bits of the current value of the structure “ abc ” 212 , similar to the contents ( line 134 , FIG .
6 ) of the unsigned integer abc ( FIG .
6 ) described above .
The value of the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 ( FIG .
9 ) associated with the structure “ abc ” 212 is 0201 , the bit - field definition number BFDN for the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 ( FIG .
3 ) in the structure “ abc ” 212 , as shown in line 238 ( see also FIG . 9 ) .
The “ value ” to be written to the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 in this example is selected to be “ 3 , ” or 0000000000000011 ( binary ) , as shown at line 240 .
When the LEFTBIT macro ( line 226 , FIG. 12 ) is used ( e.g. by the FIELDMASK macro , line 230 , FIG .
12 ) and supplied the BFDN value 0201 ( via the BFDN alias “ b ” 208 , FIG .
9 ) , the left bit “ 02 ” is extracted , as shown at line 242 .
When the RIGHTBIT macro ( line 228 , FIG . 12 ) is used ( e.g. by the FIELDMASK macro , line 230 , or the WRITE — BITFIELD macro , line 234 , FIG .
12 ) and supplied the BFDN value 0201 , the right bit “ 01 ” is extracted , as shown at line 244 .
When the FIELDMASK macro ( line230 , FIG. 12 ) is used ( e.g. by the WRITE — BITFIELD macro , line 234 , FIG .
12 ) and supplied the BFDN value 0201 , as shown at line 246 , the FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) proceeds as shown in lines 248 –254 .
The difference between the left bit “ 02 ” and the right bit “ 01 ” is “ 1 ” ( line 248 ) .
The “ 1 ” is used to left shift the initial mask value of “ fffe ” ( line 250 ) , so that there are 0's in the two right - most bits of the mask value .
The two 0 - bits are the width of the desired bit - field .
The left shifted mask value is inverted ( line 252 ) , so that there are 1's only in the two right - most bits of the mask value .
The inverted mask value is left shifted by the value of the right bit “ 01 ” to place the two 1 - bits at the location of the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 ( FIG .
3 ) in the structure “ abc ” 212 ( FIG .
9 ) , thereby forming the mask of the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 ( line 254 ) .
The WRITE — BITFIELD macro ( line 234 , FIG. 12 ) is supplied ( line 256 ) the “ address ” of the structure “ abc ” 212 ( FIG. 9 ) , the BFDN value ( via the alias “ b ” 208 , FIG .
9 ) for the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 ( FIG .
3 ) in the structure “ abc ” 212 , and the “ value ” ( e.g. “ 3 ” ) to be written to the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 .
The WRITE — BITFIELD macro ( line 234 ) uses the FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 , FIG . 12 ) to obtain the mask for the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 and inverts the mask at line 258 , similar to the inverse of the “ MASK — b ” value ( line 136 , FIG .
6 ) described above .
The current value of the structure “ abc ” 212 is retrieved and ANDed with the inverted mask at line 260 , similar to the line 138 ( FIG .
6 ) described above , to zero - out the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 in the structure “ abc ” 212 .
The “ value ” of “ 3 ” ( 0000000000000011 , binary ) is left shifted by the value of the right bit “ 01 ” , as shown in line 262 , to place the relevant 2 - bit portion of the “ value ” in the same location as the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 , similar to the line 142 ( FIG .
6 ) described above .
The shifted “ value ” is ANDed with the mask , as generated by the FIELDMASK macro ( line 230 ) , to ensure that the number of bits in the shifted “ value ” do not exceed the number of bits in the bit- field “ b ” 104 , as shown in line 264 .
The shifted “ value ” ( line 264 ) is ORed with the structure “ abc ” 212 having the zeroed - out bits ( line 260 ) to place the “ value ” in the desired bit - field “ b ” 104 in the structure “ abc ” 212 , which is written to the hardware “ address ” of the structure “ abc ” 212 , as shown in line 266 , similar to the line 144 ( FIG .
6 ) described above .
In this manner , the “ value ” is written to the desired bit - field using additional steps ( over those shown in the prior art above ) in the WRITE — BITFIELD macro ( line 234 , FIG . 12 ) that automatically generate the mask and shift values , with the advantage of reducing the likelihood of programmer error .
Likewise , the READ — BITFIELD macro ( line 232 , FIG . 12 ) has the same advantage .
The WRITE — BITFIELD and the READ — BITFIELD macros use inputs that almost mimic the form , or order , of actual bit - field usage in the programming language , thereby capitalizing on programmer familiarity with actual bit - field usage to further reduce the likelihood of programmer error .
One of the inputs is the bit - field definition number BFDN ( FIG .
8 ) , which is a simple concatenation of the left - bit and right - bit numbers for the bit- field .
Thus , instead of having to calculate mask and shift values , the programmer only has to know the range of the bit- fields within the structure ( e.g. “ abc ” 212 , FIG.
9 , and “ cba ” 214 , FIG. 10 ) in order to program with the macros .
Presently preferred embodiments of the subject matter herein and its improvements have been described with a degree of particularity .
This description has been made by way of preferred example .
It should be understood that the scope of the claimed subject matter is defined by the following claims , and should not be unnecessarily limited by the detailed description of the preferred embodiments set forth above .

Last night , new Laker Ron Artest had both the game of his life and the post - game press conference of his life .
Watch and be entertained .
Right - wing U.S. shock jock Michael Savage is still Britain ’s least wanted man .
That ’s the word from London , where a new coalition government led by Prime Minister David Cameron has decided to continue preventing the conservative radio host and author from entering the country , over comments the prior government felt were violent and threatening .
His name appears on a list of 16 individuals the government considers to be a threat to public safety .

Others banned from entering the island nation include Nazi sympathizers , a grand wizard in the Ku Klux Klan , “ God hates fags ” preacher Fred Phelps and an array of radical Muslims .
In a recent interview with right - wing conspiracy site World Net Daily , Savage claims his ban was due to U.S. - based watchdog group Media Matters , which has for years taken snippets of Savage ’s offensive and many times inaccurate commentaries and made them readily available online .
The site also focuses heavily on mainstream television news outlets and conservative media figures like radio host Rush Limbaugh , Fox News personalities Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity and blogger Michelle Malkin .
Speaking to WND , Savage called his battle to visit England “ one straight year of legal hell ” .
He further told the conservative - leaning Washington Times newspaper that the British are merely “ pandering ” to Muslims by banning him .
Savage has long been a fierce critic of Muslims , calling them Nazis and terrorists and insisting that women wearing burqas do it because they want to kill white people .
Speaking of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2006 , Savage actually suggested that Islam is a “ bloodthirsty religion ” with followers who should be wiped out by U.S. forces .
He further called a Muslim prayer leader , otherwise known as an Imam , “ another code word for trouble - making bum who should have been thrown out of the country . ”
The British contend that such pronouncements qualify as “ unacceptable behavior ” that seeks to “ provoke others to serious criminal acts ” by “ fostering hatred which might lead to inter- community violence . ”

A prime example of the “ behavior ” which appears to have so tweaked the British would be the clip that got Savage fired from MSNBC in 2003 .
Just weeks into his contract , Savage told a gay caller to “ get AIDS and die , ” then called him a “ pig ” and a “ sausage ” who did not matter at all .
His terse commentary was completely unprovoked and studio hands off - camera could be heard howling at the host ’s remarks .
The network immediately released Savage from his contract .

As Esquire explained in 2009 :
In the years since , as Savage called Jimmy Carter “ an anti-Semitic bastard , ” accused Hillary Clinton of hating white people , beckoned for the deportation of Muslims , and written books with titles like Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder and The Death of the White Male , he has expanded his show to 400 radio stations and eight million listeners , growing along with Levin and Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham and all the other right - wing radio haters .
Say what you will about Michael Moore , but there is no one or nothing even remotely comparable to this man or his antics on the left .

Savage has since joked that he may go to Ireland and broadcast his show into Briton , just to irk officials .
He ’s also published a book titled “ Banned in Britain : Beating the Liberal Blacklist , ” and badgered Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to petition for his access to the U.S. ally .
Still , it would seem a far cry , asking for help from a woman so frequently targeted in hateful rhetoric carried by one ’s own program and literature .
Aattorneys for Savage insist he has never explicitly provoked listeners or readers to commit violent acts .
Furthermore , his campaign to be readmitted to Britain is even backed by the Council on American - Islamic Relations , which Savage himself sued for using his excerpts in leading a boycott against him .

Whether the Brits will undergo a change of heart remains to be seen .
Updated from an original version .
Breast cancer is a common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in women .
Breast self - examination ( examination of the breasts by the individual ) or clinical breast examination ( examination of the breasts by a doctor or a nurse ) have been promoted for many years as screening methods to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage , in order to decrease the risk of dying from breast cancer .
This review searched for well - designed trials that assessed these methods and found two large population - based studies involving 388,535 women who compared breast self - examination with no intervention .
The review of data from these trials did not find a beneficial effect of screening in terms of improvement in breast cancer mortality .
The trials showed that women who were randomised to breast self - examination were almost twice as likely to undergo a biopsy of the breast , with 3406 biopsies performed in the screening group compared to 1856 biopsies in the control group .
The only large population - based trial of clinical breast examination combined with breast self - examination that was identified was discontinued .
This was because of poor compliance with follow up and no conclusions can be drawn from the study .
Some women will continue with breast self - examination or will wish to be taught the technique .
We suggest that the lack of supporting evidence from the two major studies should be discussed with these women to enable them to make an informed decision .
Women should , however , be aware of any breast changes .
It is possible that increased breast awareness may have contributed to the decrease in mortality from breast cancer that has been noted in some countries .
Women should , therefore , be encouraged to seek medical advice if they detect any change in their breasts that may be breast cancer .
JK Galbraith , a giant of 20th century economics , said the purpose of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable .
This week 's inflation numbers bear out his maxim .
This week , the horoscope was at least as good a guide as the economic modelling of the pundits .
Markets were expecting a rise of 1 per cent in the June quarter ; that was the average and median forecast of the financial market economists paid to pick these things .
The lowest prediction of the pundits was a rise of 0.8 per cent .
In fact , the official headline rate came in just 0.6 per cent and the underlying rate even lower , at 0.5 per cent .
Now the market economists usually get it wrong , but in the catalogue of failed forecasts , that 's right up there .
And one of the market pundits says it 's not unusual to be wrong .
" The dirty little secret of economists , is that very few people are very good a forecasting anything that matters , " said Rory Robertson , the interest rate strategist at Macquarie Bank , pulling no punches .
" Everyone knows in their heart of hearts that the future is unknowable and that fact makes forecasting inherently unreliable , " he added .
None more so than the prognosticator at Merrill Lynch who tipped a 1.2 per cent surge in the inflation rate ; he would have been better off consulting the heavenly bodies .
Not much harmony and understanding on the campaign trail , but its hard to see the surprisingly soft inflation reading as anything but good news for Labor .
It spares it the political pain suffered by the Howard government in the lead - up to the 2007 poll - an interest rate rise , in the middle of the campaign .
Because one forecast can now be made with absolute confidence : the Reserve Bank will not lift the cash rate when its board meets next week .
" This was a remarkably low number , " said Westpac 's chief economist Bill Evans , who was forecasting a rate rise next week prior to the inflation numbers .
" The core number which the Reserve Bank relies on for its policy decisions printed 0.5 [ per cent ] ; our forecast was 0.9 [ per cent ] .
I think 0.9 would have delivered a rate hike ; on 0.5 we can absolutely be confident that there 'll be no change in rates next week . "
Despite the forecasting failures , Rory Robertson says that , for the pundits , the inflation figure was a good outcome .
" Economists wanted a big one where a rate hike was sure , or a little one where rate hike was not happening .
A 0.8 would have been a nightmare because many of us would have spent the next week umming and ahing about whether there would be or would n't be a rate hike , " he explained .
" With a 0.5 on the Reserve Bank 's best measure of core inflation , there 's no rate hike next week .
In fact it looks like the Reserve Bank will be on hold for the next three months at least , and I 'm guessing the Reserve Bank will be on hold at 4.5 per cent into 2011 . "
The numbers will be no surprise to Gerry Harvey at Harvey Norman , or the bosses of Woolies and Coles .
They reckon there 's a price war underway to get customers in the door and spending .
The inflation reading also confirms that the interest rate rises delivered so far by the Reserve Bank and the retail banks are biting and that despite the low unemployment rate , parts of the economy are still in pain .
" The household sector right now is dealing with the biggest uplift in mortgage rates in at least two decades in that the shift in mortgage rates of 1.6 percentage points , to about 6.75 per cent , is in fact the sharpest lift in mortgage rates in two decades , " Rory Robertson explained .
" So I think it 's increasingly clear that that is having the desired dampening effect on the household demand where basically consumption growth is sluggish , home building , local government building approvals have peaked .
" It 's clear that the up trend in home prices has completely stalled .
Also it 's clear , and you can see that in the prices day to day , that the tourism sector in Australia is on its knees .
We know the economy is strong on average but much of the strength is via the resources sector .
Lots of other parts of the economy are sluggish at best "
And you do n't need any powers of divination to see that .
1+1=2
Order
Principia Mathematica ( through section 56 )
from Powell 's Principia Mathematica is famous for taking a thousand pages to prove that 1+1=2 .
Of course , it proves a lot of other stuff , too .
If they had wanted to prove only that 1+1=2 , it would probably have taken only half as much space .
Principia Mathematica is an odd book , worth looking into from a historical point of view as well as a mathematical one .
It was written around 1910 , and mathematical logic was still then in its infancy , fresh from the transformation worked on it by Peano and Frege .
The notation is somewhat obscure , because mathematical notation has evolved substantially since then .
And many of the simple techniques that we now take for granted are absent .
Like a poorly - written computer program , a lot of Principia Mathematica 's bulk is repeated code , separate sections that say essentially the same things , because the authors have n't yet learned the techniques that would allow the sections to be combined into one .
For example , section ∗ 22 , " Calculus of Classes " , begins by defining the subset relation ( ∗22.01 ) , and the operations of set union and set intersection ( ∗22.02 and .03 ) , the complement of a set ( ∗22.04 ) , and the difference of two sets ( ∗22.05 ) .
It then proves the commutativity and associativity of set union and set intersection ( ∗22.51 , .52 , .57 , and .7 ) , various properties like !!\alpha\cap \alpha = \alpha !! ( ∗ 22.5 ) and the like , working up to theorems like ∗ 22.92 : !!\alpha\subset \beta \rightarrow \alpha\cup ( \beta - \alpha ) !!.
Section ∗ 23 is " Calculus of Relations " and begins in almost exactly the same way , defining the subrelation relation ( ∗23.01 ) , and the operations of relational union and intersection ( ∗23.02 and .03 ) , the complement of a relation ( ∗23.04 ) , and the difference of two relations ( ∗23.05 ) .
It later proves the commutativity and associativity of relational union and intersection ( ∗23.51 , .52 , .57 , and .7 ) , various properties like !!\alpha\dot \cap\alpha = \alpha !! ( ∗ 22.5 ) and the like , working up to theorems like ∗ 23.92 : !!\alpha\dot \subset \beta \rightarrow \alpha\dot\cup ( \beta \ dot- \alpha ) !!.
The section ∗ 24 is about the existence of sets , the null set !!\ Lambda !! , the universal set !!{\rm V} !! , their properties , and so on , and then section ∗ 24 is duplicated in ∗ 25 in a series of theorems about the existence of relations , the null relation !!\ dot \Lambda !! , the universal relation !!\ dot {\rm V} !! , their properties , and so on .
That is how Whitehead and Russell did it in 1910 .
How would we do it today ?
A relation from S to T is defined as a subset of S × T and is therefore a set .
Union , intersection , difference , and the other operations are precisely the same for relations as they are for sets , because relations are sets .
All the theorems about unions and intersections of relations , like , just go away , because we already proved them for sets and relations are sets .
The null relation is is the null set .
The universal relation is the universal set .
A huge amount of other machinery goes away in 2006 , because of the unification of relations and sets .
Principia Mathematica needs a special notation and a special definition for the result of restricting a relation to those pairs whose first element is a member of a particular set S , or whose second element is a member of S , or both of whose elements are members of S ; in 2006 we would just use the ordinary set intersection operation and talk about R ∩ ( S×B ) or whatever .
Whitehead and Russell could n't do this in 1910 because a crucial piece of machinery was missing : the ordered pair .
In 1910 nobody knew how to build an ordered pair out of just logic and sets .
In 2006 ( or even 1956 ) , we would define the ordered pair < a , b > as the set {{a} , {a , b}} .
Then we would show as a theorem that < a , b> = < c , d > if and only if a=c and b=d , using properties of sets .
Then we would define A×B as the set of all p such that p = < a , b> ∧ a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B .
Then we would define a relation on the sets A and B as a subset of A×B .
Then we would get all of ∗ 23 and ∗ 25 and a lot of ∗33 and ∗35 and ∗ 36 for free , and probably a lot of other stuff too .
( By the way , the {{a} , {a , b}} thing was invented by Kuratowski .
It is usually attributed to Norbert Wiener , but Wiener 's idea , although similar , was actually more complicated . )
There are no ordered pairs in Principia Mathematica , except implicitly .
There are barely even any sets .
Whitehead and Russell want to base everything on logic .
For Whitehead and Russell , the fundamental notion is the " propositional function " , which is a function φ whose output is a truth value .
For each such function , there is a corresponding set , which they denote by !! \hat x\phi( x ) !! , the set of all x such that φ ( x ) is true .
For Whitehead and Russell , a relation is implied by a propositional function of two variables , analogous to the way that a set is implied by a propositional function of one variable .
In 2006 , we dispense with " functions of two variables " , and just talk about functions whose ( single ) argument is an ordered pair ; a relation then becomes the set of all ordered pairs for which a function is true .
Russell is supposed to have said that the discovery of the Sheffer stroke ( a single logical operator from which all the other logical operators can be built ) was a tremendous advance , and would change everything .
This seems strange to us now , because the discovery of the Sheffer stroke seems so simple , and it really does n't change anything important .
You just need to append a note to the beginning of chapter 1 that says that ∼p and p∨q are abbreviations for p|p and p|p.|.q|q , respectively , prove the five fundamental axioms , and leave everything else the same .
But Russell might with some justice have said the same thing about the discovery that ordered pairs can be interpreted as sets , a simple discovery that truly would have transformed the Principia Mathematica into quite a different work .
Anyway , with that background in place , we can discuss the Principia Mathematica proof of 1+1=2 .
This occurs quite late in Principia Mathematica , in section ∗ 102 .
My abridged version only goes to ∗ 56 , but that is far enough to get to the important precursor theorem , ∗ 54.43 , scanned below :
The notation can be overwhelming , so let 's focus just on the statement of the theorem , ignore everything else , even the helpful remark at the bottom :
This is the theorem that is being proved ; what follows is the proof .
Now I should explain the notation , which has changed somewhat since 1910 .
First off , Principia Mathematica uses Peano's " dots " notation to disambiguate precedence , where we now use parentheses instead .
The dot notation takes some getting used to , but has some distinct advantages over the parentheses .
The idea is just that you indicate grouping by putting in dots , so that ( 1+2 ) ×( 3+4 ) ×( 5+6 ) is written as 1+2.×.3+4.×. 5+6 .
The middle sub - formula is between a pair of dots .
The ( 1+2 ) sub -formula is between a pair of dots also , but the dot on the left end is superfluous , and we omit it ; similarly , the sub - formula ( 5+6 ) is delimited by a dot on the left and by the end of the formula on the right .
What if you need to nest parentheses ?
Then you use more dots .
A double dot ( :) is like a single dot , but stronger .
For example , we write ( ( 1+2 ) ×3 ) + 4 as 1+2 . × 3 : + 4 , and the double dot isolates the entire 1+2 .
× 3 expression into a single sub -formula to which the +4 applies .
Sometimes you need more levels of precedence , and then you use triple dots (. : and :. ) and quadruple ( : : ) .
This formula , as you see , has double and triple dots .
Translating the dots into standard parenthesis notation , we have $ $ \ast54.43 .
\vdash ( ( \alpha , \ beta \in 1 ) \supset ( ( \alpha\cap \beta = \ Lambda ) \equiv ( \alpha\cup\beta \ in 2 ) ) ) $ $ .
This is rather more cluttered - looking than the version with the dots , and in complicated formulas you can have trouble figuring out which parentheses match with which .
With the dots , it 's always easy .
So I think it 's a bit unfortunate that this convention has fallen out of use .
The !!
\vdash !!
symbol has not changed ; it means that the formula to which it applies is asserted to be true .
!!\supset !! is logical implication , and !!\equiv !! is logical equivalence .
Λ is the empty set , which we write nowadays as ∅. ∩ ∪ and ∈ have their modern meanings : ∩ and ∪ are the set intersection and the union operators , and x∈y means that x is an element of set y .
The remaining points are semantic .
α and β are sets .
1 denotes the set of all sets that have exactly one element .
That is , it 's the set { c : there exists a such that c = { a } } .
Theorems about 1 include , for example : that Λ∉1 ( ∗52.21 ) ,
that if α∈1 then there is some x such that α = { x } ( ∗ 52.1 ) , and
such that α = { } ( ∗52.1 ) , and that {x} ∈1 ( ∗52.22 ) .
2 is similarly the set of all sets that have exactly two elements .
An important theorem about 2 is ∗ 54.3 , which says $ $ \ast54.3 .
\vdash 2 = \hat \alpha\{ ( \exists x ) \> .\> x\in\alpha \> . \> \alpha - \iota`x \in 1 \} . $ $ In Principia Mathematica notation , {x} , the set that contains x and nothing else , is written ι‘x , so this theorem says that 2 is identical with the set of all α such that α has some element x , which , when removed from α , leaves a 1 - element set .
So here is theorem ∗ 54.43 again :
It asserts that if sets α and β each have exactly one element , then they are disjoint ( that is , have no elements in common ) if and only if their union has exactly two elements .
The proof , which appears in the scan above following the word " Dem . " ( short for " demonstration " ) goes like this : " Theorem ∗ 54.26 implies that if α = {x} and β = {y} , then α∪β has 2 elements if and only if x is different from y . "
" By theorem ∗ 51.231 , this last bit ( x is different from y ) is true if and only if {x} and {y} are disjoint . "
" By ∗ 13.12 , this last bit ( {x} and {y} are disjoint ) is true if and only if α and β themselves are disjoint . "
The partial conclusion at this point , which is labeled ( 1 ) , is that if α = {x} and β = {y} , then α∪β ∈ 2 if and only if α∩β = Λ .
The proof continues : " Conclusion ( 1 ) , with theorems ∗ 11.11 and ∗ 11.35 , implies that if there exists x and y so that α is {x} and β is {y} , then α∪β ∈ 2 if and only if α and β are disjoint . "
This conclusion is labeled ( 2 ) .
Finally , conclusion ( 2 ) , together with theorems ∗ 11.54 and ∗ 52.1 , implies the theorem we were trying to prove .
Maybe the thing to notice here is how very small the steps are .
∗ 54.26 , on which this theorem heavily depends , is almost the same ; it asserts that {x}∪{y} ∈ 2 if and only if x≠y .
∗ 54.26 , in turn , depends on ∗ 54.101 , which says that α has 2 elements if and only if there exist x and y , not the same , such that α = {x} ∪ {y} .
∗ 54.101 is just a tiny bit different from the definition of 2 .
Theorem ∗ 51.231 says that {x} and {y} are disjoint if and only if x and y are different .
∗ 52.1 is a basic property of 1 ; we saw it before .
The other theorems cited in the demonstration are very tiny technical matters .
∗ 11.54 says that you can take an assertion that two things exist and separate it into two assertions , each one asserting that one of the things exists .
∗ 11.11 is even slimmer : it says that if φ( x , y ) is always true , then you can attach a universal quantifier , and assert that φ( x , y ) is true for all x and y.
∗ 13.12 concerns the substitution of equals for equals : if x and y are the same , then x possesses a property ψ if and only if y does too .
I have n't seen the later parts of Principia Mathematica , because my copy stops after section ∗ 56 , and the arithmetic stuff is much later .
But this theorem clearly has the sense of 1+1=2 in it , and the later theorem ( ∗110.643 ) that actually asserts 1+1=2 depends strongly on this one .
Although I am not completely sure what is going to happen later on ( I 've wasted far too much time on this already to put in more time to get the full version from the library ) I can make an educated guess .
Principia Mathematica is going to define the number 17 as being the set of all 17 - element sets , and similarly for every other number ; the use of the symbol 2 to represent the set of all 2 - element sets prefigures this .
These sets - of - all - sets - of - a- certain - size will then be identified as the " cardinal numbers " .
The Principia Mathematica will define the sum of cardinal numbers p and q something like this : take a representative set a from p ; a has p elements .
Take a representative set b from q ; b has q elements .
Let c = a∪b .
If c is a member of some cardinal number r , and if a and b are disjoint , then the sum of p and q is r .
With this definition , you can prove the usual desirable properties of addition , such as x +
0 = x , x + y = y + x , and 1 + 1 = 2 .
In particular , 1+1=2 follows directly from theorem ∗ 54.43 ; it 's just what we want , because to calculate 1+1 , we must find two disjoint representatives of 1 , and take their union ; ∗ 54.43 asserts that the union must be an element of 2 , regardless of which representatives we choose , so that 1+1=2 .
Post scriptum : Peter Norvig says that the circumflex in the Principia Mathematica notation is the ultimate source of the use of the word lambda to denote an anonymous function in the Lisp and Python programming languages .
I am sure you know that these languages get " lambda " from the use of the Greek letter λ by Alonzo Church to represent function abstraction in his " λ- calculus " :
In Lisp , ( lambda ( u ) B ) is a function that takes an argument u and returns the value of B ; in the λ- calculus , λu. B is a function that takes an argument u and returns the value of B. Norvig says that Church was originally planning to write the function λu .
B as û.B , but his printer could not do circumflex accents .
So he considered moving the circumflex to the left and using a capital lambda instead : Λu.B .
The capital Λ looked too much like logical and ∧ , which was confusing , so he used lowercase lambda λ instead .
Post post scriptum : Everyone always says " Russell and Whitehead " .
Google results for " Russell and Whitehead " outnumber those for " Whitehead and Russell " by two to one , for example .
Why ?
The cover and the title page say " Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell , F.R.S. " .
How and when did Whitehead lose out on top billing ?
