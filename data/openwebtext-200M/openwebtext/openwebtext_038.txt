Was Bob Woodward Slam - Dunked ?
By Robert Parry
July 7 , 2006 O ne of the most memorable behind - the - scenes accounts of pre-Iraq War decision - making was Bob Woodwards story of an Oval Office meeting on Dec. 21 , 2002 , when George W. Bush and his top advisers reviewed the CIAs case against Saddam Hussein for supposedly hiding weapons of mass destruction .
Using flip charts , deputy CIA director John McLaughlin presented the evidence while President Bush watched impatiently .
When McLaughlin finished , Bush reportedly remarked ,  Nice try and added  Ive been told all this intelligence about having WMD and this is the best weve got ? 
According to Woodwards account , CIA director George Tenet then rose from a couch , threw his arms into the air and exclaimed ,  It s a slam - dunk case ! 
When Bush pressed   George , how sure are you ?  the CIA director supposedly threw his arms up again and declared ,  Dont worry , its a slam dunk ! 
According to Woodward , Bush then cautioned Tenet several times ,  Make sure no one stretches to make our case . 
Almost a year later , in an exclusive interview with Woodward on Dec. 11 , 2003  after the U.S. invasion of Iraq had come up empty in the search for caches of WMD  Bush confided to Woodward that Tenets assurance had been very important in the presidential decision to go to war .
When the slam - dunk story appeared in Woodwards 2004 book , Plan of Attack , it immediately made Tenet the butt of endless jokes and portrayed Bush as the skeptical leader who wanted the truth but was misled by his subordinates .
While some Bush critics immediately questioned Woodwards version of events , the Washington Post star reporter carried tremendous weight among his mainstream journalistic colleagues who enshrined Woodwards inside story as the new conventional wisdom .
However , in the two years since publication of Plan of Attack , other evidence has emerged suggesting that Woodward was acting less as an objective journalist than as a stenographer taking down the preferred history of Bushs inner circle .
The legendary hero of the Watergate scandal may have been the one who was slam - dunked .
Conflicting Account A contrary version of that Oval Office meeting appears in Ron Suskinds The One Percent Doctrine , which drew heavily from U.S. intelligence officials much as Woodwards book relied on senior White House officials .
According to Suskind , the two CIA officials  Tenet and McLaughlin  have very different recollections of the Dec. 21 , 2002 , meeting .
They remember it more as a marketing meeting  about how to present the WMD case , not a review of the quality of the underlying intelligence .
Both Tenet and McLaughlin say they dont even recall Tenet exclaiming the words slam dunk ,  although Tenet wont dispute the version from Bush and his top aides , Suskind wrote .
 McLaughlin said he never remembered Tenet saying slam dunk ,  Suskind wrote .
 He doesnt recall Tenet ever , in any context , jumping up and waving his arms .
The Presidents question , McLaughlin recalled , was whether we could craft a better pitch than this  a PR meeting  it certainly wasnt about the nature of the evidence .
While its certainly true that each side in this dispute has reason for slanting the story one way or another 
Bush wants to avoid the historic judgment that he willfully lied the nation into a war and Tenet knows that his legacy will always be captured in those two words  the preponderance of evidence now tilts against Woodwards version .
For instance , in 2005 , leaked British documents revealed Bush  in 2002 and early 2003  to be eagerly pushing U.S. intelligence agencies toward hyping and twisting the evidence to build the strongest possible case against Saddam Husseins regime .
According to one of those documents , the infamous Downing Street Memo , dated July 23 , 2002 , British Prime Minister Tony Blair had already secretly agreed to Bushs plan for invading Iraq  nearly a half year before the slam - dunk meeting .
In the Downing Street meeting  between Blair and his top national security advisers  Richard Dearlove , chief of the British intelligence agency MI6 , described his trip to Washington in July 2002 to discuss Iraq with Bushs national security officials .
 Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy ,  Dearlove said .
The memo added ,  It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action , even if the timing was not yet decided .
But the case was thin .
Saddam was not threatening his neighbours , and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya , North Korea or Iran . 
Rather than the reluctant warrior , as portrayed in Woodwards book , Bush appears to be hell - bent for war , according to the contemporaneous record which is now public .
War Provocation Another leaked British document recounted an Oval Office meeting between Bush and Blair on Jan. 31 , 2003  a little more than a month after the slam - dunk meeting .
Bush again was scheming to find excuses for invading Iraq , even as he was publicly telling the American people that he viewed war as a last resort . 
Bush expressed hope that he still might be able to provoke the Iraqis into some violent act that would serve as a pretext for invading , according to minutes written by Blairs top foreign policy aide David Manning .
Bush suggested painting a U.S. plane in United Nations blue and flying it over Iraq with the goal of drawing Iraqi fire , the minutes said .
 The U.S. was thinking of flying U - 2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq , painted in U.N. colours ,  according to the minutes .
 If Saddam fired on them , he would be in breach . 
Regardless of whether any casus belli could be provoked , Bush already had penciled in 
March 10 , 2003 , as the start of the U.S. bombing of Iraq , according to the memo .
 Our diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning ,  Manning wrote .
According to the British memo , Bush and Blair acknowledged that the U.N. inspectors then scouring Iraq had found no WMD and were unlikely to find any in the coming weeks , but that wouldnt get in the way of the U.S. - led invasion .
[ NYT , March 27 , 2006 ] Spin & Lies Bushs tendency to lie and spin also continued in the months after the invasion .
For instance , by summer 2003 , Bush had begun revising the pre-war history to make his invasion seem more justified , by claiming that Hussein had rejected a U.N. demand that inspectors be allowed into Iraq .
Though the record was clear that the inspectors had returned to Iraq by November 2002 and only left in March 2003 because Bush had decided to invade , Bush began insisting that Hussein had barred the inspectors , thus provoking war .
 We gave him a chance to allow the inspectors in , and he wouldnt let them in .
And , therefore , after a reasonable request , we decided to remove him from power ,  Bush said on July 14 , 2003 , less than four months after the invasion .
In the following months and years , Bush repeated this claim dozens of times in slightly varied forms .
It became part of his litany for arguing that it was Hussein who chose war .
Despite Bushs record of deception , Woodward still treated Bush in Plan of Attack as a credible figure who was concerned about the evidence and went to war only after an ironclad assurance from his intelligence chief .
It is , of course , possible that elements of both Woodwards account and Suskinds version are accurate .
As former deputy CIA director McLaughlin is quoted as saying in Suskinds book , the context of the slam - dunk discussion was more about P.R. presentation than whether the underlying intelligence was sound .
Since the Downing Street Memo and other documents make clear that Bush had made his judgment to invade Iraq much earlier , it makes sense that the Oval Office meeting might have been like an advertising agencys presentation to a prospective client , with the client shaking his head and telling the ad men to punch up the content .
McLaughlins flip charts were like a rough cut that needed a lot more work .
Though that interpretation of events would fit with the known facts , it would reflect badly on both Bush and Tenet , since the CIA director would seem to have crossed a bright line in trading in his duties to provide objective information for a job selling the case for war to the American people .
But that line was one that Tenet crossed again several weeks later when he agreed to sit behind Secretary of State Colin Powell during his misleading presentation to the United Nations Security Council on Feb.
5 , 2003 .
Powells speech could be viewed as a more polished version of McLaughlins flip - chart performance in the Oval Office .
In other words , Bushs dissatisfaction as expressed on Dec. 21 , 2002 , could have been the impetus to spice up the content by the time Powell spoke to the U.N. several weeks later .
If that was the case , Tenets supposed assurance that the sales pitch would be a slam dunk would turn out to be true .
Virtually across the board , the major U.S. news media hailed Powells presentation as compelling and convincing .
The next day , the Washington Posts Op - Ed page was a solid wall of praise for Powell and his WMD case .
Today , however , from the perspective of three - plus years of war  and tens of thousands of dead  it appears that Bob Woodward and the U.S. press corps were not the only ones who got slam - dunked . 

What ’s going now in Afghanistan is not for the first time .
27 years ago Russian army entered Afghanistan to help the Afghani president protect his power against the Islamic forces terrorizing the country .
Russian army stayed there 9 years and 1 months .
It was opposed by troops lead by Usama Bin Laden who was that time officially sponsored by USA , in order to prevent a victory of USSR there and not allowing Soviet Union to establish there another regime supported by communists .
During these 9 years more than 14,000 Russian soldiers were killed , half thousand people were captured by the opposing Afghani forces .
Practically all of them were forced to turn into Islam .
And more than 50,000 Russian soldiers were wounded there and 10,000 of them continued their life as disabled as a result of the war .
But what can be most interesting is that just a few months after the Soviet troops left Afghanistan the radical Islamic movement took over the country again and was just becoming stronger and stronger until the USA troops came into a play .
Now , when USA military presence is not high there it has been heard that only center of the country is being controlled by “ democratically chosen president ” , all the distant regions are again under the rule of radical Islamists .
So probably there is no way on turning this country to Western system of good and bad .
On these photos you can see Russian soldiers together with Afghani ones , and some scenes from everyday life in 1983 .
Special uniform hats were used in Afghanistan for Soviet soldiers .
Photos are from Alexandr Prokopchuk , they were made by his father Nikolai who was shot dead in Januar , 1984 in Afghanistan , half year later after he made these photos .
HANGZHOU , China – Yahoo had to comply with a demand by Chinese authorities to provide information about a personal e-mail of a journalist who was later convicted under state secrecy laws and sentenced to 10 years in prison , the company 's co-founder Jerry Yang said Saturday .
Yang , responding to questions during an internet forum in this eastern Chinese resort city , said he could not discuss the details of the case involving Shi Tao , a former writer for the financial publication Contemporary Business News .
Overseas - based human rights groups disclosed days earlier that Yahoo Holdings ( Hong Kong ) , part of Yahoo 's global network , provided e-mail account information that helped lead to Shi 's conviction .
Yahoo earlier defended its move , saying it was obliged to comply with Chinese laws and regulations .
The demand for the information was a " legal order " and Yahoo gets such requests from law enforcement agencies all the time , and not just in China , Yang told the forum .
But he added , " I can not talk about the details of this case . "
Other Chinese journalists have faced similar charges of violating vague security laws as communist leaders struggle to maintain control of information in the burgeoning internet era .
Despite government information - sharing requirements and other restrictions , Yahoo and its major rivals have been expanding their presence in mainland China in hopes of reaching more of the country 's fast - growing population of Internet users , which now number more than 100 million .
Yahoo paid $ 1 billion for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba.com , host of the Hangzhou conference , last month .
New York - based Human Rights in China and the Paris - based international media watchdog Reporters Without Borders sent an open letter addressed to former U.S. President Bill Clinton , who was a keynote speaker at the internet forum , urging him to bring up Shi 's case during his visit to China .
But Clinton only alluded to the risks faced by internet users targeted by the authorities for whatever reason .
" The internet , no matter what political system a country has , and our political system is different from yours , the internet is having significant political and social consequences and they cannot be erased , " he said .
" The political system 's limits on freedom of speech ... have not seemed to have any adverse consequences on e-commerce , " he said .
" It 's something you 'll all have to watch and see your way through , " he said .
According to Reporters Without Borders , court papers show that Yahoo Holdings ( Hong Kong ) gave Chinese investigators information that helped them trace a personal Yahoo e-mail to Shi 's computer .
It says Shi was convicted for sending notes on a government circular spelling out restrictions on the media in his e-mail .
He was seized in November at his home in the northwestern province of Shanxi .
The case is the latest instance in which a prominent high - tech company has faced accusations of cooperating with Chinese authorities to gain favor in a country that 's expected to become an Internet gold mine .
Sunnyvale , California , company Yahoo and two of its biggest rivals , Google and Microsoft 's MSN , previously have come under attack for censoring online news sites and blogs featuring content that China 's communist government wants to suppress .
ok i bought a $ 3,000 item on ebay a laptop , i never recieved it , i paypaled him the money , and he transfered those funds to his bank account , and then withrdrew it .
He then informed me that on the day he was going to ship it out , his car was robbed , and everything ( including the laptop and $ 3,000 cash ) was stolen .
he lives clear across the country from me , and i know i can get a charge back to my credit card , but is this guy going to get away with it ?
i mean its not like paypal or ebay can charge his account , as he withdrew the funds .
im sure the feds wont do anything for only 3 grand , and the local police on both ends what could they do ?
can i EVER get revenge on a fraudulent ebay seller ?
In 2003 a young soldier died in Iraq , but there was a mystery .
Alyssa Peterson was a local Flagstaff girl who was one of our first war fatalities .
Alyssa was also best friend to the daughter of one of my friends .
We talked about what could have happened .
She was shot with a service rifle .
Was it murder or suicide ?
What happened ?
Well finally someone searched for an answer .
Army specialist Alyssa Peterson was an Arabic speaking interrogator assigned to the prison at the Tal - afar airbase in far northwestern Iraq near the Syrian border .... Peterson objected to the interrogation techniques used on prisoners .
She refused to participate after only two nights working in the unit known as the cage .
Army spokespersons for her unit have refused to describe the interrogation techniques Alyssa objected to .
They say all records of those techniques have now been destroyed .
God , I hate these people .
So what happened to her ?
The Value of Health and Longevity " A single percent reduction in mortality from cancer or heart disease would be worth nearly $ 500 billion to current and future Americans . "
During the twentieth century , life expectancy at birth for a representative American increased by roughly thirty years .
In 1900 , nearly 18 percent of males born in the United States died before their first birthday - today , it is n't until age 62 that cumulative mortality reaches that level .
This remarkable increase in longevity reflects progress against a variety of afflictions and diseases , driving reductions in mortality at all ages .
It illustrates a substantial , but unmeasured , increase in social welfare attributable to improvements in health .
Rising longevity , and health improvements more generally , are aspects of economic progress .
Valuation of these gains is important for two reasons .
First , traditional measures of economic growth and welfare , based on national income accounts , make no attempt to account for this source of rising living standards .
Therefore , they underestimate improvements in well - being .
Second , public expenditures account for a large portion of both medical research and the provision of medical care .
Efficient decisions require a framework for measuring the value of treatment and of research - based medical progress .
In The Value of Health and Longevity ( NBER Working Paper No. 11405 ) , authors Kevin Murphy and Robert Topel develop and apply an economic framework for valuing improvements in health and longevity , based on individuals ' willingness to pay .
They then use that framework to estimate the economic gains from declining mortality in the United States over the twentieth century , and to value the prospective gains that could be obtained from further progress against major diseases .
Murphy and Topel find that reductions in mortality from 1970 to 2000 had an economic value to the 2000 U.S. population of about $ 3.2 trillion per year .
Over the longer term , the cumulative longevity gains during the twentieth century were worth about $ 1.3 million per person .
Valued at the date they occurred , the production of longevity - related " health capital " would raise estimates of per capita output in the United States from 10 to 50 percent , depending on the time period in question .
The authors distinguish between two types of health improvements - those that extend life by reducing mortality and those that raise the quality of life .
Life extension is valued because the utility from goods and leisure accrues over a longer period , and improvements in the quality of life raise the utility from given amounts of goods and leisure .
This study provides a framework for calculating the economic value of a life - year , the value of remaining life , and changes in these values when health improves .
Based on a lifecycle model of consumption and survival , the authors show that the social value of improvements in health is greater : 1 ) the larger is the population ; 2 ) the higher are average lifetime incomes ; 3 ) the greater is the existing level of health ; and 4 ) the closer are the ages of the population to the age of onset of disease .
These factors point to an increasing valuation of health improvements over the past several decades and into the future .
As the U.S. population grows , as lifetime incomes grow , as health levels improve , and as the baby boom generation approaches the primary ages of disease - related death , the social value of improvements in health will continue to rise .
The authors also find that improvements in health tend to be complementary .
For example , improvements in life expectancy ( from any source ) raise willingness to pay for further health improvements by increasing the value of remaining life .
This means that advances against one disease , say heart disease , raise the value of progress against other age - related ailments , such as cancer , or Alzheimer's .
This is of significant empirical relevance , as it implies that the well - documented historical progress against heart disease , for which mortality has fallen by roughly 30 percent since 1970 , has increased the value of further progress against other afflictions .
The authors find that reductions in mortality since 1970 have raised the value of further health progress by about 18 percent .
Prospectively , even modest progress against mortality - causing diseases , such as cancer and heart disease , would have enormous social value .
A single percent reduction in mortality from cancer or heart disease would be worth nearly $ 500 billion to current and future Americans .
These estimates ignore the value of health advances to individuals in other countries , so they likely understate the aggregate social value of possible innovations .
They also ignore corresponding improvements in the quality of life -- which evidence suggests may be even more valuable than gains in longevity -- and for these reasons as well they are likely to be conservative .
The authors show that these values will increase in the future because of economic growth and , more interestingly , because health itself continues to improve .
Large as they are , these values may be offset by the costs of developing and implementing improvements in health .
Current public and private spending on health - related research is a tiny fraction of what is available , but such investments may not be worthwhile if the costs of implementing new technologies are large .
An analysis of the social value of improvements in health is a first step toward evaluating the social returns to medical research and health - augmenting innovations .
Improvements in health and longevity are partially determined by society 's stock of medical knowledge , for which basic medical research is a key input .
The United States invests over $ 50 billion annually in medical research , about 40 percent of which is federally funded , accounting for 25 percent of government research and development outlays .
The $ 27 billion federal expenditure for health - related research in FY 2003 represented a real - dollar doubling over 1993 outlays .
The authors suggest that the returns to basic research may be quite large , so that substantially greater expenditures may be worthwhile .
Using the authors ' estimate that a single percent reduction in cancer mortality would be worth about $ 500 billion , then a " war on cancer " that would spend an additional $ 100 billion on cancer research and treatment would be worthwhile if it h as a 1 - in - 5 chance of reducing mortality by one percent .
The authors caution that social transfer programs and other third - party methods of financing health care can distort both utilization decisions and research , with the result that some health improvements are socially inefficient .

" He was actually bitten by the head down , the shark swallowed his head , '' Mr Luobikis said .
Taking a second bite , the white pointer clenched its jaws around his torso , tearing deep lacerations in either side of his body .
Against the odds , Mr Nerhus , a well - known local diver of more than five years ' experience , managed to free himself from the shark 's jaws , and was pulled back aboard the boat by his son .
Two other young divers in a nearby boat rendered immediate first aid and one radioed his father , who was flying overhead in a spotter plane , to call for emergency help .
He was flown to Wollongong Hospital instead of the closer Canberra Hospital because the Snowy Hydro Rescue Helicopter carrying the man must fly low to ground .
" He was diving so we have to fly low to the ground , and there are mountains on the way to Canberra , '' Snowy Hydro spokeswoman Debbie Lowry said .
" When you dive you have got to a minimum of two hours adjusting ... it 's decompression .
The oxygen in your lungs need time to readjust or you get the bends . ''
She said the diver had told the helicopter crew that he had managed to get free after the shark bit down on him , then poked the animal in the eye .
The helicopter also had to stop and refuel in Merimbula because the rescue crew had been on their way to another job before getting the emergency call .
Mr Luobikis , 53 , said it was a miracle his friend had lived to tell the tale .
" Eric is a tough boy , he 's super fit , '' he said .
" But I would say that would test anyone 's resolve , being a fish lunch . ''
" He 'd have a better chance of winning the lotto ( than surviving that attack ) , and I think he would have rather done that . ''
There had been a rash of white pointer sightings in recent weeks thanks to unusually cold waters off Eden , but such an attack was unheard of , Mr Luobikis said .
" I have been a professional diver in Eden for 36 years and I 'm not aware of any white pointer attacks in that time , '' he said .
Rough conditions had deterred many divers from venturing out this morning , Mr Luobikis said .

In the second of a three - part series , BBC Diplomatic correspondent James Robbins assesses their prospects during visits to the commercial capitals , Mumbai and Shanghai .
The moment you arrive in China , the country shouts progress .
India cannot compete with China 's bulk , standard steel production
China 's one - party state is out to prove a point : " We 're overtaking the rest of the world . "
India , too , is on a dash for growth and riches , but it does n't always look that way .
Travelling into this other vast city can be exasperatingly slow .
The roads into Mumbai are among the worst in any major world city .
Powerful tale
Democracy has not delivered the transport , the infrastructure which India so desperately needs .
It is true that things are changing , but too slowly .
But how does it look to those creating the new wealth ?
In Shanghai , I met Billy Wang in the workshop where he and his staff turn out hand - made shoes .
The business tells a powerful tale .
Billy Wang 's business is growing fast
The business is expanding very fast - like almost all Chinese manufacturing - and Mr Wang certainly does n't question China 's rigid political system which helps make him rich .
" According to the Chinese way of thinking , the political system is decisive .
Everything else comes second to this , " he said .
And that is true when you see the big picture of China , too .
At Shanghai 's international port , it is largely one - way traffic .
China does n't buy much overseas - so most containers arrive in the country empty - but they go out crammed full of exports .
China is manufacturing in fantastic quantities , and selling hard .
The world has good reason to worry about the growing trade imbalance .
Risk - takers
China 's achievement is simply staggering .
Single - minded one - party government making clear decisions has delivered unprecedented wealth to an expanding middle class , and rising incomes for most of China 's people , even if millions are still trapped in rural poverty .
But in India , I found that young risk - takers opening new businesses are not dismayed , even if they are very aware of the fierce competition from neighbouring China .
Tarun Thadani is undeterred by competition from China
Tarun insists India can beat China by combining cheap labour with design skills .
" We never copy anything directly , " he said .
" The key is consistent new development .
We spend so much time trying to make new styles .
Originality is the key . "
So what about the big picture of India ?
I found that stress on skills drives heavy industry too .
Outside Mumbai , at Mukand Steel , they know they cannot compete with China 's bulk , standard steel production .
Instead , they make only high - value specialist steels , meeting Europe 's most exacting standards and specifications .
This is an area of heavy industry where the Indians are convinced they have a huge edge over China - even if it is something of a niche market and will never deliver enough jobs to satisfy India 's hunger for rapidly increased employment in manufacturing .
The only certainty is that both countries will go on racing each other and overtake most of the outside world .
India has a vibrant , free press , and a very vibrant cinema , both Bollywood films and the whole range of international movies .
It all raises the question : Could India 's democracy prove an eventual winner against China 's lack of political freedoms ?
For Billy Wang the Shanghai shoemaker , despite China 's population - freedom is heavily restricted .
Dizzying change
Most , not all , international films get an airing .
But newspapers , TV and radio , and the internet are all strictly controlled .
Any dissent is punished harshly but if a growing middle class in China demands freedom to match its rising wealth , then China could hit very real trouble .
So where are Billy and Tarun heading ?
Both their cities are rising at a dizzying rate .
But I am clear that India lags far behind for now , at least .
Democracy , the need for public consent , just is n't delivering change so quickly .
But then in China , with no need for consent , the risks of major political upset seem much greater .
The only certainty is that both countries will go on racing each other and overtake most of the outside world .

By any other name : Epic is not the hero Apptown needs
Someone needs to stand up to Apple , but the Macalope does n't think that Epic is the ideal white knight .
NOTE : If all you want to do is install a project distributed as an .egg file , head straight to the Easy Install page .
EasyInstall makes installing Python code as easy as typing easy_install SomeProjectName .
You do n't need to read this page unless you want to know more about how eggs themselves work .
They 're a great format for distributing extensions or plugins to extensible applications and frameworks ( such as Trac , which uses eggs for plugins as of 0.9b1 ) , because the egg runtime provides simple APIs to locate eggs and find their advertised entry points ( similar to Eclipse 's " extension point " concept ) .
They allow applications or libraries to specify the needed version of a library , so that you can e.g. require ( " Twisted - Internet > = 2.0 " ) before doing an import twisted .
internet .
They allow " namespace packages " ( packages that just contain other packages ) to be split into separate distributions ( e.g. zope . * , twisted .* , peak .* packages can be distributed as separate eggs , unlike normal packages which must always be placed under the same parent directory .
This allows what are now huge monolithic packages to be distributed as separate components . )
.egg files are a " zero installation " format for a Python package ; no build or install step is required , just put them on PYTHONPATH or sys.path and use them ( may require the runtime installed if C extensions or data files are used )
Python eggs can be used with Python 2.3 and up , and can be built using the setuptools package ( see the Python Subversion sandbox for source code , or the EasyInstall page for current installation instructions ) .
The easiest way to install and use Python eggs is to use the " Easy Install " Python package manager , which will find , download , build , and install eggs for you ; all you do is tell it the name ( and optionally , version ) of the Python project ( s ) you want to use .
Python eggs are a way of bundling additional information with a Python project , that allows the project 's dependencies to be checked and satisfied at runtime , as well as allowing projects to provide plugins for other projects .
There are several binary formats that embody eggs , but the most common is ' .egg ' zipfile format , because it 's a convenient one for distributing projects .
All of the formats support including package - specific data , project - wide metadata , C extensions , and Python code .
If you have a pure - Python .egg file that does n't use any in - package data files , and you do n't mind manually placing it on sys.path or PYTHONPATH , you can use the egg without installing setuptools .
For eggs containing C extensions , however , or those that need access to non-Python data files contained in the egg , you 'll need the pkg_resources module from setuptools installed .
For installation instructions , see the EasyInstall page .
In addition to providing runtime support for using eggs containing C extensions or data files , the pkg_resources module also provides an API for automatically locating eggs and their dependencies and adding them to sys. path at runtime .
( See the API documentation and setuptools documentation for details . )
With this support , you can install and keep multiple versions of the same package on your system , with the right version automatically being selected at runtime .
Plus , if an egg has a dependency that can't be met , the runtime will raise a DistributionNotFound error that says what package and version is needed .
By the way , in case you 're wondering how you can tell a " pure " ( all - Python ) egg from one with C extensions , the difference is that eggs containing C extensions will have their target platform 's name at the end of the filename , just before the .egg .
" Pure " eggs are ( in principle ) platform - indepenent , and have no platform name .
If you 're using the pkg_resources runtime to find eggs for you , it will ignore any eggs that it can tell are not usable on your platform or Python version .
If you 're not using the runtime , you 'll have to make sure that you use only compatible eggs .
Once you have the runtime installed , you need to get your desired egg (s ) on to sys.path .
You can do this manually , by placing them in the PYTHONPATH environment variable , or you can add them directly to sys. path in code .
This approach does n't scale well , however , because as you need additional eggs , you 'll be managing a longer and longer PYTHONPATH or sys. path by hand .
Not only that , but you 'll have to manually keep track of all the eggs needed by the eggs you 're using !
Luckily , there is a better way to do it .

FBI Abuses of the USA Patriot Act
Since the Patriot Act was passed , administration officials have repeatedly assured the public and Congress that there have not been improper uses of that law .
As recently as April 27 , 2005 , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testified that “ there has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse . ”
However :
Documents obtained by EPIC from the FBI describe thirteen cases of possible misconduct in intelligence investigations .
The case numbering suggests that there were at least 153 investigations of misconduct at the FBI in 2003 alone .
These documents reveal that the Intelligence Oversight Board has investigated many instances of alleged abuse , and perhaps most critically , may not have disclosed these facts to the Congressional oversight committees charged with evaluating the Patriot Act .
According to The Washington Post
In one case , FBI agents kept an unidentified target under surveillance for at least five years — including more than 15 months without notifying Justice Department lawyers after the subject had moved from New York to Detroit .
An FBI investigation concluded that the delay was a violation of Justice guidelines and prevented the department “ from exercising its responsibility for oversight and approval of an ongoing foreign counterintelligence investigation of a U.S. person . ”
In other cases , agents obtained e-mails after a warrant expired , seized bank records without proper authority and conducted an improper “ unconsented physical search , ” according to the documents .
Although heavily censored , the documents provide a rare glimpse into the world of domestic spying , which is governed by a secret court and overseen by a presidential board that does not publicize its deliberations .
The records are also emerging as the House and Senate battle over whether to put new restrictions on the controversial USA Patriot Act , which made it easier for the government to conduct secret searches and surveillance but has come under attack from civil liberties groups .
EPIC received these documents under FOIA , and has written to the Senate Judiciary Committee to urge hearings on the matter , and has recommended that the Attorney General be required to report to Congress when the Intelligence Oversight Board receives allegations of unlawful intelligence investigations .
This week marks the four - year anniversary of the enactment of the Patriot Act .
Does anyone feel safer because of it ?

Mel Gibson was arrested by the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department in Malibu , Calif . early this morning for suspicion of DUI .
Bail was set at $ 5,000 .
He was pulled over for speeding in his 2006 Lexus as he was heading eastbound on the Pacific Coast Highway and a Breathalyzer test was administered .
The arrest report lists the time of arrest as 2:36 AM and the time booked as 4:06 AM .
Gibson was released at 9:45 a.m .
A spokesman for the Los Angeles Country Sheriff 's Department told TMZ , " Mel Gibson was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence .
He was released later this morning .
The investigation was still ongoing , just like it would be with any other person . "
A rep for Gibson tells TMZ they are " checking into " the matter .
Doctors in the U.S. have discovered that the brain of a man so severely damaged in a car accident that he was left in a barely conscious state , has healed itself and he is now conscious and communicating with those around him .
The groundbreaking recovery has encouraged speculation that the brain is capable of repairing itself .
Terry Wallis was involved in a car accident in 1984 which left him in what doctors call a " minimally conscious state " - somewhere between being awake and being in a vegetative state .
Dr. Nicholas Schiff of Weill Medical College of Cornell University and his team believe a very slow process took place in which Wallis ' brain grew new connections to heal its injured parts .
Twenty years ago Wallis suffered severe brain injuries , but was able to survive though unable to move or speak ; he was able to respond with head - nodding and eye contact .
Two years ago Wallis emerged from the 19 - year stupor and has regained speech and movement and it appears that his brain spontaneously rewired itself , growing tiny new nerve connections to replace the ones sheared apart in a car crash and one day he just " woke up . "
Dr. Nicholas Schiff at Weill Cornell Medical College says over a three - day period , Wallis went from saying his first couple of words to recovery of fluent speech and they say his case is truly remarkable .
Dr. Schiff and colleagues found the case so intriguing that they carried out a study to examine exactly how Wallis had recovered .
By using cutting - edge imaging technology which uses color coding to show areas of growth and activity , they studied Wallis ' brain over an 18 month period and found that new growth of fibers had taken place which seemed to restore function and speech , personality and even a limited ability to move returned .
Experts say the discovery is astonishing and unexpected .
It is apparently very difficult to measure consciousness and even a patient who does n't speak , respond to voices , or move their head when spoken to might still have some level of awareness .
The public however need to be aware that there are important distinctions between being in a coma and being in minimally conscious or vegetative states .
While the term " coma " is loosely used to describe any unresponsive state , in clinical terms it occurs early in brain injury .
It is the stage in which a person is unresponsive and the eyes remain closed ; once the eyes are open , it is no longer a coma .
That is when doctors must determine whether the patient has passed into a minimally conscious state or a vegetative state .
Schiff says in a vegetative state , patients show no evidence of any response to their environment , and may only have some reflex changes when they 're pressed with very intense stimuli and have periods when the eyes open and the eyes close .
Schiff and his colleagues admit they are unsure what caused Wallis to wake up in the first place , but pictures of his brain captured since then offer unequivocal proof that his brain is somehow mending itself .
Although the ultimate goal is to eventually be able to predict which patients have the best chance of recovering consciousness , experts warn that this research is very preliminary and stress that the brain is the most complicated organ , and trauma is the most complicated injury .
The study is published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation .

Soldier ’s Story
An Iraq vet say it ’s hard to “ stay the course ” when nobody knows what that means
By Kory Turnbow
Captain , Bravo Company , 116 Engineers Battalion , Idaho National Guard
I ’ve been asked by numerous friends and acquaintances since my return home in December of last year what I think of the War on Terror , or the War in Iraq .
I get the impression that they are typically looking for a sound - bite reply , like I can somehow sum up the situation as a “ win ” or “ lose ” like the talking heads on the Fox News Channel .
I believe Afghanistan will go down in history as a successful U.S. military campaign and Iraq will likely go down as a modern - day Vietnam .
People think I ’m crazy when I say this .
After all , as one friend pointed out , “ What ’s the difference between them ?
Are n’t they both Islamic countries ? ”
To start with , yes , they are both Islamic countries .
However , in Afghanistan — a tribal society to be sure — they more or less have one national identity .
Iraq remains divided among three fault lines — Sunni Arab , Shiite Arab , and Kurdi ( who do n’t see themselves as Arabs at all ) .
It is among these fault lines that we see the Iraqi civil war erupting today in the form of gangs of executioners roaming the streets looking for members of the other religious sects to kill en masse .
And there has yet to be a national leader from Iraq with the strength , vision , and perhaps most importantly , charisma , to arise and unify his country .
It did n’t have to be this way — and as I recall witnessing and participating in the unfolding events , the U.S. missed several opportunities to get Iraq right .
One was during questioning of Gen. Eric Shinseki in the pre-2003 invasion planning process .
When asked [ by Congress ] about how many troops would be needed to invade Iraq , his best military - educated answer was “ several hundred thousand , ” to which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz replied “ wildly off the mark . ”
But history has since shown that Gen. Shinseki was not way off the mark ; he was right on , much to the chagrin of those who wanted to fight this war on the cheap .
With more troops on the ground , there would have been more troops for security of munitions depots during the invasion — which has come home to roost in the form of looted depots that have led to large numbers of IEDs [ Improvised Explosive Devices ] today — and to prevent the power vacuum which led to hardliners from all sides gaining power in just about all communities within Iraq .
Another misstep was L. Paul Bremer ’s decision as leader of the Coalition Provisional Authority to disband the Iraqi Army and Police forces and rebuild them from scratch .
This led to putting a bunch of Iraqis trained ( albeit poorly ) in the use of weapons and explosives out of work .
I ’m not sure what Mr. Bremer hoped to accomplish by this , because in my experience working with the Iraqi Army [ IA ] and Police [ IP ] at their lowest level , I never met a single person with undying loyalty to Saddam Hussein .
Besides , because they were the most qualified , they were the ones who got hired back in recruiting drives months later to take their old billets with the IA and IP .
The problem with all this was not just the inconvenience , but the huge quantities of dollars spent in firing and then rehiring these people .
And what many of these people did in the meantime was build and plant IEDs .
Several of them found that they made more money in the IED business than they did in the IA / IP business , and never looked back .
v v v
As a soldier , what gives me the most cause for concern in Iraq was the fact that I never knew who my enemy was .
Even the people sniping at us from a distance , launching mortars and rockets , or putting bombs on the side of the road did n’t usually have an axe to grind with us , nor were they fighting as Jihadists for some perceived noble cause .
In fact , most of the people doing these things were just ordinary citizens looking for a few extra dinar to pad their paychecks .
As I found out the hard way after being struck by an IED shortly after my arrival in - country , Islamic hardliners from countries like Iran and Jordan would infiltrate Iraq and have the Imams announce after the Friday sermon that they were willing to pay $ 100 - $ 300 for every IED accompanied by a photo or video of the explosion going off on a U.S. or Iraqi Security Forces convoy .
Since the average Iraqi family took home about $ 150 a month , it did n’t take very much to convince the average person to plant an IED or two each month for a little extra pocket money .
Adding to this concern is the relative frustration incurred by trying to stop the bombers .
It was n’t like you had a window of opportunity to catch a guy in the middle of the night with a full bomb , initiation device , and shovel emplacing the thing on the side of the road .
We would have caught them with our unmanned aerial vehicles had it been that easy .
The civilian tactic was to get a group of three or four together to emplace the bomb , and then split the profits .
The typical operation might look like this :
The first guy goes out with a shovel while tending his herd of sheep along the side of the road .
He digs the hole for the IED at the appointed place .
If he is ever stopped by a U.S. patrol , all we have on him is a shovel , which he carries ostensibly for the purpose of burying his waste ( which is what the hole on the side of the road was for , he says , if he is ever asked about it ) .
Since we can only detain a person for 24 to 72 hours without the civilian equivalent of probable cause — and do n’t even think about prosecuting him , it just wo n’t happen — there is no point in detaining him .
The second guy goes out that night with the same flock of sheep , only he is carrying an old artillery shell ( or perhaps three ) in the back of a donkey cart .
If he is stopped by a patrol , he immediately gets excited to tell the Americans about his wonderful find , and could they please take these shells from him ?
He found them by the side of the road , and wants to make his community safer by giving them to the Americans .
Again , no probable cause for detention , as only the U.S. patrol on the ground knows the score .
No one , U.S. or Iraqi , will prosecute this guy because there is an illusion that he is some kind of hero , just trying to clean up his community .
And since that is what we want , this guy will go away free .
If he makes it to the hole ( which he will ) , he just tosses the shells into the hole and continues about his business .
The third guy will go out with initiators / blasting caps the way the second guy took out the shells .
He keeps the same plausible deniability as the second guy , except for the hook - up time when he is on top of the IED .
If you are going to catch someone , this is going to be your best opportunity , because he has to spend the most time on target ( plus you get the IED for evidence ) .
In practice , he wo n’t get caught , because we just do n’t have enough troop density to watch the sheer amount of roadway that exists in Iraq .
The last guy will come by that night and hide in the bushes with the initiator ( a cell phone , garage door opener , or anything else that transmits an electrical impulse ) and a video camera .
When the patrol passes that he wants to hit , he detonates the shells and has his video .
Ironically enough , the bombers typically do n’t care if they hurt anyone in the convoy ; they just want the video to look good for the Imam when they go to collect their money .
My other big cause for concern at my level was never , and I repeat never , receiving a coherent mission or intent statement for Operation Iraqi Freedom .
According to all the doctrine that I had been taught beginning in ROTC and continuing throughout my military career , a soldier needs two things to be able to do his job effectively .
The first is a mission statement .
This should be a short statement consisting of who , what , when , where , and perhaps most importantly , why we are doing what we are doing .
The second thing is the commander ’s intent .
Essentially , this boils down to what the commander would like to see happen , and tells us his intended result .
This helps clear the fog of war ; lower - level commanders and soldiers can make decisions that will help further the commander ’s intent , even if the mission becomes unworkable .
Every mission and intent statement I ever saw on this deployment was a huge Power Point slide dissertation written by someone with too much time on his hands .
Not one meant anything to me as a commander , and I always tried to create a clear , concise mission statement for my troops during the various operations I sent them on .
I do n’t fault my commanders , nor the Division Commanders , or even the Theater Commanders .
I believe that this problem went all the way to the top , with perhaps our Commander in Chief making it the clearest : “ Stay the Course . ”
In hindsight , perhaps that ’s what those Power Point slides were supposed to mean after all — nothing .
v v v
During my stay in Iraq , I began to hate the words “ Stay the Course . ”
After months ( or perhaps a year ) of searching for what we were really doing in Iraq , I finally heard what I was looking for from Brigadier Gen.
Alan Gayhart , the 116th Brigade Combat Team Commander .
It was late July 2005 , as I recall , and he was addressing his Brigade Officer Corps as part of an officer development program : “ So long as the Iraqi Civil War does n’t start here , on our watch , we will have been successful in our job . ”
My months of searching were at an end .
It was at that point that I began to question why we were even running missions at the pace we were running them to begin with .
After all , the patrols had become nothing more than moving targets .
They rarely captured any insurgents , and when they did , they were released back on the streets again within days , with $ 5 cash in their pockets for every day they spent detained — provided by the U.S. for the inconvenience of being detained .
If the real reason we were there was to prevent civil war in Northern Iraq , as well as beef up the Iraqi Security Forces , we could have done that with patrols that provided security for our bases instead of patrolling the entire country .
No one side in a potential civil war was going to be the one to start a rumble with a huge U.S. armored force stationed on the FOB [ forward operating base ] .
Our patrols and cordons and searches rarely yielded anything substantial in the fight against the so - called insurgency , and served to create a great expense for the U.S. in the form of lost lives and equipment .
Perhaps the biggest impact of all the additional patrols was to alienate the populace and provide a target for those who would plant IEDs for profit .
And not too many routine patrols ever captured a bad guy .
To that end , I ’m not sure our efforts bore fruit .
v v v
Based on my experience in Iraq , the present strategy of withdrawing our troops as the Iraqi Army and Police are able to stand up is not going to be effective .
This is because the Iraqi Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) and Ministry of Interior ( MoI ) are horribly corrupt and not adept at managing their resources .
It is quite often that an employee or minister will embezzle funds ( provided by the U.S. ) that would otherwise be used for paying employees or buying equipment for the security forces .
Another favorite trick is to divert money to the minister ’s own city , instead of spending it in other areas that might require the funds more , due to an insurgent buildup in that area .
But the corruption does n’t stop there ; it goes down to the provincial and local levels in much the same manner .
Perhaps the worst is at the local level , where the local Sheik will attempt to ( and be generally successful at ) installing commanders into his local IA barracks or IP station who suit his political affiliation at that time .
This leaves the Iraqi troops on the ground with no other resource than their U.S. advisors to keep them functional and apolitical .
This was a constant frustration with me , because I sent up countless requisitions for property , only to be told that the items “ were in route , ” or “ everyone is in the same boat you are . ”
I had stations that were authorized by the CPA to have 16 police cars that only had three or four .
When the Iraqi Police went on patrol , they looked like Keystone Cops , shoved sometimes five , six or seven into a vehicle .
I do n’t even have to describe to you what happens when one of these packed vehicles gets hit with an IED .
I was also required to stand up for IA commanders and IP chiefs who would n’t join a political party when that political party attempted to replace him with a loyal party member by using their contacts at the MoD or MoI .
Operationally , the brave Iraqis I had the privilege of working with were very strong when we were with them as advisors .
They were strong when we were n’t with them as well , but they did n’t perform as many missions when we were n’t there .
I think it just got easier for them to stay in their barracks or stations when we were n’t there , rather than take a chance at getting hit by IEDs or gunfire .
The monthly salary we paid them was competitive , but not always worth the risk .
The corruption at the highest levels , as well as a lack of determination at the lowest levels , combines , in my opinion , to create a not very positive outlook for the security situation in Iraq .
I believe that as much as the State Department is trying to do to salvage the Iraqi government , perhaps they should have disbanded the MoD and MoI instead of firing the entire Iraqi Security Forces [ ISF ] .
Perhaps they still should .
I was in Iraq for a year , and I did n’t see anything improve as far as resourcing the ISF .
I did see on the news that the deputy Interior minister had fled to Jordan after misappropriating several million dollars of ministry funds .
My gut tells me that when we finally decide to leave Iraq , that the ISF will deteriorate rapidly and will cease to be a functional entity .
v v v
My friends also ask me about what I think about bringing democracy to the Middle East .
My reply before I left in the summer of 2004 was that this mission was going to bring about a permanent change in the Middle East , and that history would look back on it in a light similar to the fall of the Berlin Wall in ‘ 89 .
Today , I ’m not so optimistic .
I had occasion over the course of my deployment to witness the first round of free elections and the ratification of the Iraqi Constitution .
Both of these should have been historic events .
In America , the fundamental concept of democracy is one vote for every citizen .
In Iraq ( and potentially in the greater Middle East ) , the concept is that one Imam , Sheik or Mukthar ( village headsman ) controls the vote of every person in his sphere of influence .
This leads to some of the nastiest politics of all , because it does n’t just require greasing a few skids to get something done — there has to be a slice of pie for every little leader who can influence a body of people to vote in a certain direction .
And since the average Iraqi can’t read , getting your message down to the people without going through this leadership is almost impossible ( although it could be done via TV , since there was a satellite dish on top of every house and mud hut in our sector by the time I left ) .
In short , getting anything done is an incredibly expensive proposition .
The best illustration of this is the village of Rashad during the Iraqi Constitution ratification .
Of the 9,500 votes cast , 9,470 were against the new constitution .
Turns out that just days before the vote , the local Sheik and Imam proclaimed that the Constitution did n’t provide enough protection for the Sunni Arabs , and that it should be voted against .
The numbers say it all regarding what kind of sway these local honchos have over the public .
Of the 30 who voted for the Constitution in that community , my hunch is that a number of those were from people who did n’t know how to read or otherwise misinterpreted the directions because they were in the back of the mosque on that Friday and could n’t understand the Imam .
v v v
My friends have been asking lately how I am , and what I ’m going to do now .
I can tell you that this war came at a large personal cost for many of us .
Out of my company , we had one KIA , numerous WIA ( with four serious enough to have to be evac’ed to the rear ) — and probably half of the married soldiers that went with us filed for divorce soon after their return .
While I thank God for what safety we enjoyed while we were in the Gulf , my marriage was among those destroyed during my absence .
I originally left the active component Army in 2002 to go to law school , and got called back up again in 2004 for this deployment .
I ’m presently two - thirds of the way through law school , and will graduate in May 2007 .
This was n’t the easiest track through law school , but it appears that I ’ve persevered through the worst of it .
I used to have a strong moral compass that pointed my way through life and highlighted the way I needed to go .
These days , the morals are still there , but the direction does n’t seem to be as strong .
In short , I do n’t know where I will be in two years , nor do I have a long - range plan .
I have come to better understand the words “ one day at a time . ”
Correction Appended
Bowing to changes in technology and pressure from taxpayers and phone companies , the Treasury Department said yesterday that it would scrap the 108 - year - old federal excise tax on long - distance phone calls .
The move will bring consumers and businesses about $ 15 billion in refunds on next year 's tax returns .
The decision , which applies to cellphones and Internet phone services and some landlines , follows a series of court reversals for the government .
Large businesses had successfully sued the Internal Revenue Service to recoup the taxes they paid .
Phone companies also wanted the tax abolished to relieve them of having to collect it .
Originally a luxury tax to help pay for the Spanish - American War , the 3 percent surcharge was calculated based on the length of the call and the distance of the connection .
But as unlimited long - distance calling plans became commonplace , and the tax was applied to a flat monthly fee , some taxpayers argued that the tax no longer applied to them because the duration and distance of a call were irrelevant .
Though the tax will still be imposed on local phone service , the government will reimburse three years ' worth of taxes on long - distance calls , including any plans that combine local and long - distance calling .
Consumers , who pay about 40 percent of the taxes collected , typically pay about $ 18 a year in excise taxes if they have a long - distance service and a cellphone .
If you send URLs to contacts using your e-mail program , you may have an issue where the receiving client breaks really long URLs .
For instance , if you were trying to send a URL for a site like this one :
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BI5KV0/ ref=amb_link_4263902_/002-5510588-1062447
You might find that your recipients are unable to click on the link in their e-mail program .
That ’s because many e-mail programs will do what I did above — break really long “ words ” ( for that ’s all a URL is to them ) into multiple rows .
Typically when this happens , only part of the URL will show up as a clickable link .
When this happens , your recipients will get a “ page not found ” message when they try to load the URL — because the browser will only receive that portion of the URL that showed as clickable .
So how do you avoid this problem ?
There are a few alternatives , depending on your personal preferences .
( Note that there are other ways to do this from your browser , but this is a tip about using your e-mail application , not your browser . )
Apple ’s Mail app
If you use OS X ’s built - in Mail program , and you send e-mail in rich text format , the easiest solution is to use the Edit ->
Add Hyperlink menu item .
First copy the long URL from your browser to your clipboard .
Next , open a new e-mail message , and make sure it ’s in Rich Text format ( Format -> Make Rich Text ) .
When you reach the spot in your e-mail where you ’d like to use the URL , type in a short phrase describing the URL instead —
March of the Penguins , for instance , for the above Amazon link .
Now select that phrase and choose Edit ->
Add Hyperlink and then choose Edit -> Paste ( Command - V ) .
When you click OK , you ’ll see your phrase has been underlined , indicating that you ’ve created a clickable hyperlink :
The plain text method
If , like me , you try to stay away from rich text e-mails , the simple thing to do is to surround your URL with angle brackets , like this :
< http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BI5KV0/ref=amb_link_4263902_/002-5510588-1062447>
URLs enclosed in angle brackets should still be clickable — even if the e-mail client inserts a line break for formatting purposes .
How come ?
Because back in 1998 , the Network Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) wrote this document , which describes a generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs , of which URLs are a specific form ) .
In the document , the working group describes how URIs enclosed in angle brackets should be parsed when the use of white space ( such as line breaks ) is required for formatting purposes .
Any e-mail client that follows these guidelines should display a clickable link , even if the line is wrapped .
Unfortunately , you may still find some e-mail programs that break URLs within angle brackets .
If that ’s the case , and you ’re hard set against sending rich text e-mails , you ’ll probably need the next option .
Recode the URL
To prevent line wrap , the final option is to use a website to convert that long messy URL into a short one .
TinyURL is probably the best known of these , though there are many others .
Load the TinyURL website in your browser of choice , paste your long URL into the input box , and click the Make TinyURL button .
Again using the above link , the TinyURL version is simply http://tinyurl.com/27ghfn, which will fit without wrapping in nearly any context .
For those who may not trust TinyURLs , as they ca n’t see the link ’s true destination , you can send them a Preview TinyURL instead :
http://preview.tinyurl.com/27ghfn
This will take the reader to a page showing the full URL along with a clickable link to that page .
Those are the three methods I ’m most familiar with for encoding long URLs in e-mails , but I ’m sure there are probably more .
If you have a different solution , please share !
Thing changes
For about three years , I had one of the best place a Python developer could dream of in France : one of the most Python - friendly company out there ( Nuxeo ) , that was promoting the language everytime it was possible .
In this context , even though you ’ve told so , you do n’t feel how Python is small compared to Java in the business area .
You just do n’t want to hear about it because you develop great software , and feel happy with Python .
But time are changing , and when your company decides to drop Python for Java for the main language , a lot of things goes through one developer ’s head .
First of all , I felt like back in college , where people were laughing at me and my redhat box , because everybody was under Windows and thaught Linux was a piece of crap .
I felt like I was pushed into some kind of minority .
Weird feeling .
Secondly , I felt a little bitter because I understood , while all arguments of such a switch are quite understandable , that it ’s mostly a problem of money , because Python can do what Java does .
If I would ’ve been a billionnaire 10 years ago , Python would be the standard nowadays , and all arguments could be flipped ; ) .
But the reality is here now , Java is the main stream language in OSS .
Java and its related technologies are interesting , but I still look at them like I look at Ruby : what are their strengths ?
How Python can learn of them ?
This is a pragmatic Pythoneer habit .
Last but not least , with all the evangelism I ’ve been doing these past years , in english or in french through my book or the AFPY user group , I still want to promote Python and be part of its community .
But how ?
This blog will throw ideas about marketing Python
All the talks about my company switch makes me feel like marketing Python is urgent , so it grows in companies , schools , etc .
Looking at how Ruby does its marketing is quite interesting , but this language is still too young to be able to differenciate the reality from the buzz effect yet .
Looking at how Linux did , and still does its marketing , is more interesting because you know what worked and what did n’t .
So this blog will focus on a few things that could be done .
And this first post focuses on Python Certification .
Important notice : i have digged to find some infos on this topic , but if I missed something that is beeing done , please forgive me and comment this post .
A Python Certification
Linux certifications , brought for example by Dan York and the LPI , have became great tools to promote Linux in business .
The benefits are quite simple :
Certification centers promote Linux and pay big money in advertisment to attract students
The LPI is a non-profit organization and can therefore create a standard in certification , that is followed by everyone
The students became in their own Linux evangelists , and there ’s a crowd of students out there that are just waiting to know the truth 😉
Companies can rely on it to hire
Developers can obtain it to get recognized
So what about Python ?
Take the last chapter I wrote , change “ Linux ” by “ Python ” , and “ LPI ” by “ PSF ” and you get the idea .
I really believe the Python Software Foundation should create a Python certification .
That ’s probably what we are going to dig on our side at AFPY and maybe come up with some proposition at the PSF .
And you , readers ?
what are your opinion about it ?
I ’d love to hear it .
Next time I ’ll talk about the Python Program Certification , which is basically the same idea but applies to software standardisation and quality , and about cheesecake , which is a great idea .
PlayStation 3 price - $ 500 ?
Analysts , developers say they expect Sony 's new console to break new price barriers .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) �
While there was little doubt the Xbox 360 was going to be a hit in the just completed holiday season , no one was real sure how consumers would react to the $ 399 price tag .
Despite the $ 100 bump over the launch price of the original Xbox , few seemed to mind .
Now , with Sony 's PlayStation 3 looming , it appears another price threshold may be crossed before the year is out .
Sony 's PlayStation 3 is expected to release later this year .

Sony has n't commented on specific pricing figures , though Ken Kutaragi , president of Sony Consumer Entertainment , reportedly told attendees of a 2005 corporate meeting " it 'll be expensive . "
Analysts and many video game developers , though , suspect the system may debut with a price tag reaching nearly $ 500 .
" [ Sony ] could now consider launching its PlayStation 3 at a price range of $ 399 to $ 499 , with the $ 499 price point more likely , " said American Technology Research 's P.J. McNealy in a note to clients Monday .
Sony , as you might guess , did n't have much to say about McNealy 's theory .
" We have n't made an official announcement about pricing yet , " said Ryan Bowling , PR manager for Sony .
" At this point , that 's all speculation . "
The strongest argument behind the $ 499 price point is the PS3's inclusion of a Blu - Ray drive .
This bleeding edge technology will give Sony ( Research ) significant bragging rights , but it comes at a cost .
Pioneer last week at the Consumer Electronics Show unveiled a standalone Blu - Ray player for $ 1,800 .
Obviously , Pioneer 's earning some profit there � and Sony will almost certainly subsidize the cost of the drives , but you 're still looking at an expensive bit of hardware .
The PS3 will also feature other pricey items , such as a hard drive , the Cell processor and a new graphics chip from nVidia ( Research ) .
Developers , for the most part , say they , too , are expecting the PS3 to be more expensive than the Xbox 360's highest price package .
Sony , they said , has been sending mixed messages to the gaming world , but several developers I spoke with ( under the condition of anonymity ) said their studios were expecting the system to launch at $ 499 .
There was n't universal consensus , though .
Some predicted the price would be closer to $ 450 , others said they would n't be surprised if it was as high as $ 600 .
$ 700 was mentioned by a couple of developers , though even they said the number seemed unreasonable .
And one game maker felt Sony would try to stay in line with Microsoft , offering the PS3 for just $ 399 .
None of the developers , by the way , echoed my hypothetical theory that Sony might be pulling a head - fake on Microsoft with the high price warnings , though a couple did bring up the months of speculation leading up to the PSP 's launch .
Analysts , journalists and even publishers were wildly grasping for a solid clue about the launch price of the handheld device .
( Atari 's CEO even publicly proclaimed he expected the PSP to sell for $ 500 . )
Sony , while this went on , smiled enigmatically and did nothing to dissuade anyone that the device would be $ 300 or more .
It launched at $ 249 , still incredibly expensive by handheld standards , but lower than some consumers were expecting .
We 're seeing much the same thing with the PS3 .
After an onslaught of information last May , the company has n't released any information of substance .
Even at CES , the device was an essential no - show .
( A hardware design was there to be gawked at and a video loop of potential gameplay footage , but no new information was announced . )
There 's one other possibility about the PS3 that few people have discussed : Dual - pricing strategies .
It 's frustrating from a consumer standpoint , but Microsoft proved it can work � at least in the U.S. Whether Sony 's willing to risk fragmenting the market by offering both " bare bones " and " bells and whistles " versions of the PS3 is another matter .
For one thing , it would look as if Sony were following Microsoft 's ( Research ) lead � a vision the market leader does not want to convey .
Offering a PS3 with reduced features would also chip away at the company 's stance that the system is much more than a video game machine .
Whatever Sony decides , we should start to get some sort of clarification in the next few months � almost certainly by E3 in May .
One thing 's for sure , though :
For saying a whole lot of nothing , Sony has somehow managed to keep everybody talking about its product .
Is HD - DVD Microsoft 's folly ?

An economics professor from California who was arrested because a flight attendant thought she looked like a terrorist has been awarded $ 27.5 m ( £ 15.7 m ) .
In a victory for critics of racial profiling , a jury in El Paso , Texas , ordered Southwest Airlines to pay damages to Samantha Carrington for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution after she was bundled off a flight and arrested because flight attendants found her appearance suspicious .
Ms Carrington , who is of Iranian origin , had been returning to Los Angeles from Houston , where her mother was being treated for cancer , in 2003 when flight attendants had her arrested during a scheduled stop in El Paso .
In court documents , three attendants accused Ms Carrington of grabbing them and of threatening to go into the cockpit unless they called the pilot .
Ms Carrington maintains that she complained only about poor in - flight service .
Criminal charges were never filed after an FBI officer assigned to investigate said he did not believe the flight attendants ' version .
Southwest denied its attendants acted improperly .
But later , its president wrote to apologise for the " heinous " incident , offering tickets in compensation .
Ms Carrington said she felt vindicated by the verdict but has been unable to clear her name from terror watchlists .
Southwest said it would appeal .
A simple but groundbreaking experiment performed more than 70 years ago finally has been explained by scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
The solution sheds new light on fluid turbulence -- the last major unsolved problem in classical physics .
" Turbulence is the jittery , swirling behavior of a gas or liquid when flowing next to a wall or around an obstacle , " said Gustavo Gioia , a professor of theoretical and applied mechanics at Illinois .
" Although most of the flows that surround us in everyday life are turbulent flows over rough walls , these flows have remained one of the least understood phenomena of classical physics . "
In 1933 , Johann Nikuradse carefully measured the friction a fluid experiences as it is forced through a pipe at varying speeds .
Nikuradse found that the friction gets smaller as the speed gets larger , but then surprisingly increases at high speeds before attaining a constant value .
This mysterious behavior , which must be taken into account by engineers in applications ranging from airplanes to oil pipelines , has now been explained .
In a paper to appear in the Feb. 3 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters , Gioia and graduate student Pinaki Chakraborty show how this behavior arises from fundamental properties of the way in which energy is distributed among the swirling eddies that populate a turbulent flow .
" As a result of our theoretical explanation , engineers can now calculate the friction force found along rough walls , rather than rely upon a chart or table based on the Nikuradse data , " Chakraborty said .
In related work , to appear in the same issue of Physical Review Letters , Illinois physics professor Nigel Goldenfeld shows how the behavior implies that the turbulent state is not random , but contains subtle statistical correlations that are similar to those known to exist at phase transitions , such as the onset of magnetism in crystals .
" These findings suggest a new tack for theorists trying to understand turbulence , " Goldenfeld said .
" The roughness of the pipe walls is important and affects the flow in ways previously overlooked . "
The researchers hope that as a result of these discoveries , the approaches that solved the problem of phase transitions will now find a new application in providing a fundamental understanding of turbulence .

The final Enigma code is taxing the network of computers
Thousands of users around the world have joined the M4 Project , using spare computing power to crack the codes .
The messages were encoded using the German Enigma machine , and outfoxed wartime experts at Bletchley Park .
Project leaders have already failed to crack the last remaining message , but insist it can be broken .
The three messages were unearthed by amateur historian Ralph Erskine , who submitted them to a cryptology journal in 1995 as a challenge for codebreakers .
Last crack
They were sent in 1942 , during a period when the Allies were unable to crack German codes because of the introduction of a new code book and a more complex version of the Enigma machine .

Nazi codes cracked online
Stephan Krah , a German enthusiast , wrote the M4 Project software - named after the M4 Enigma machine used to encode the messages - in an effort to unravel the codes ' mystery .
The first code was cracked on 20 February , and was confirmed as a message from the commander of a German U - boat , Kapitanleutenant Hartwig Looks .
The second resolved code was less dramatic than the first , which detailed the aftermath of a clash with an Allied vessel .
The newly - deciphered code is little more than a status report and a confirmation of position .

Confirming the break on the M4 Project website , Stefan Krah said efforts would now shift back to the last message , actually the first of the three original submissions .
Previous efforts to crack the code exhausted the combinations available on German army and three - ring Enigma machines , but did not try all combinations relevant to the complex four - ring Enigma used to encode the messages .
Joel Reymont * recently joined lisp - hug and initiated a discussion about compiler performance and optimization .
It 's been interesting ; I particularly liked Marc Battyani 's followup .
Joel :
I 'm pitting LW 5.0 on Mac Intel against ACL 8.0 in a final round of pre-purchase checks .
I have some heavy - duty floating - point computations .
The C function looks like this : double digamm a( double x ) { double p ; x=x+6 ; p=1/( x*x ) ; p=((( 0.004166666666667*p-0.003968253986254 ) *p+ 0.008333333333333 ) *p-0.083333333333333 ) * p ; p=p+log(x ) - 0.5/x-1/( x - 1 ) - 1/( x - 2 ) -1/( x - 3 ) -1/( x - 4 ) - 1/( x - 5 ) - 1/( x - 6 ) ; return p ; } GCC generates about 200 assembler instructions for the code above .

Marc :
Disclaimer :
It 's probably cheating ( but after all the target computer is not specified ) and the compiler in written in LW so let 's say it 's relevant here . ;-)
I 'm currently working on a the design of a VHPC system and I 've written a C to VHDL compiler to transfor this kind of stuff in hardware to put in FPGAs .
So I fed this function into this compiler and you can see the result here : www.fractalconcept.com/digamma.pdf
( BTW ouput is easily recognizable as cl-typesetting + cl - pdf ;-)
With this I get a fully pipelined design running at 300MHz so it will take 3.3 ms for the computation .
Assuming I can fit 6 of these into my system and split the data , I can compute this in 550µs .
Who said Lisp is slow ? :)
Marc sent me a note of clarification : " BTW you should put somewhere that 550µs is the time required for 1000000 computations so it 's 550 ps for one ! ;-) "

Mike DeWine likes working together with George Bush .
It all hangs on five tight Senate races — which means negative ads , and lots of them .
Mis-leading , meaningful , desperate , or despicable — they 're on your TV , messing with your mind .
To get a glimpse at those states where the battle is being fought the hardest , we scoured the party campaign sites ( and sometimes YouTube ) , compiling this list of the five nastiest Senate campaign ads of 2006 — so far .
This according to retired Navy commander Jennifer Brooks .
Retired Commander Kathleen Murray adds that , " The unnecessary abuse and hazing received by me and my fellow women midshipmen " were contributed to by the demeaning philosophy of Democrat Senate candidate Jim Webb .
They 're citing an article he wrote a whopping 27 years ago ( page 277 of " Washingtonian Magazine " ) saying a military dorm with 4,000 males and 300 females " is a horny woman 's dream . "
( Oh , and 14 years ago , he also called a midshipman " thunder thighs , " according to the attack site Webb against women .)
Of course , in the 70s the public debated whether the all - male military should be open to women at all , and " I do n't think it was wrong to participate in the debate at that time , " Webb tells .
Or tries to .
In the Republican Senate Committee 's ad , he only gets to say , " I do n't think it was wrong ... " before the ad switches to different footage — of Tim Russert incredulously repeating the idea that " being in a naval academy is a horny woman 's dream .
" Webb ultimately countered with some tough ads of own , showing support from a ( female ) retired Brigadier General , a ( female ) Coast Guard officer and a ( female ) 1984 Naval academy student who says " Jim Webb broke down barriers .
He changed things as Naval Secretary .
" That 's the implicit message in a political ad which attacked Tennessee Senate candidate Harold Ford .
( It has since been removed from YouTube . )
In a tight ( and crucial ) Senate race , Democrat challenger Ford had run an effective ad emphasizing his connection to " values " voters by walking down the aisle of a church .
" Here I learned the difference between right and wrong , " he states earnestly .
" And now Mr. Corker [ his Republican opponent ] is doing wrong . "
Corker 's sins include spending millions " telling untruths " about his Republican opponents in the primary , " both of them good men , " says Ford sympathetically .
" And now me ! " " What kind of man parties with Playboy playmates in lingerie , " counters the latest NSRC product , " and then films political ads from a church pew ? "
It 's an allusion to Playboy 's 2005 Super Bowl party , which Ford attended .
The National Republican Senate Committee first seized on the party eight months ago , and Ford recently struck back with an ad mocking Republican Corker 's wealth in aparody .
It cites Corker 's 30 - room mansion , 6 SUVs , and $ 200 million net worth , finally arguing that he 'd accepted three pay raises for himself , " yet nothing for police and firefighters !
"
The race is neck - and - neck , according to recent polls , which means ad consultants will continue scrambling for the hottest buttons they can push .
Oh sure , Missouri Senate candidate Claire McCaskillshe's tough on methamphetamines .
But everything she says " depends on your area code ...
She just tells you what you want to hear .
" So does this mean she 's inof methamphetamines ?
Well , no .
The ad does n't cite her position on the illegal drug .
But she lived in a city thatillegal drugs — lots of 'em !
( Kansas City was " the meth capital of America , " according to a four - year - oldarticle cited by the ad . )
And at that time , Claire McCaskille was a prosecutor for the county !
See ?!
That charge has since been removed from the online version of the Republican National Senate Committee 's ad .
Its other two supposed McCaskill flip - flops were 1 . ) gun control , which she was either for or against , and 2 . ) she missed paying her property taxes , yet had the gall to talk about things like " integrity " in her campaign .
The logic can be a little strained — but we 're sure Republican Jim Talent appreciates the effort .
Emotional music lauds the 9/11 firefighters who fought Montana 's forest fires .
Except , they were doing " a piss - poor job " according to evil Republican Senator Conrad Burns .
While pointing at one , he said , " he has n't done a god - damned thing , " according to the ad .
Burns ' dirty words were re-broadcast into Montana homes , after a Democrat Senate Campaign Committee disclaimer that : " The following contains language by Conrad Burns , unsuitable for Montana .
" Using his own words against him , Burns ' opponent , newcomer John Tester , seems to have gotten the upper - hand with Montana 's conservative voters .
But it 's not like the Republican candidate did n't try .
" Feller comes in fer a trim on his flat - top , " says a barber in one of Burns ' ads , " because he 's running fer U.S. Senate .
Guess he does n't want anyone to know he opposes a gay marriage ban , thinks flag burning is all right , and supports higher taxes !
" Apparently , the ad- makers thought all Montanans are rural hicks who only trust their barber .
But ultimately no amount of barber - speak could keep Tester from opening a lead on the incumbent that will likely cost him his Senate seat .
" Here 's a tip , " ran the counter - ad .
" The man attacking Jon Tester is an actor .
A fake , sent by Senator Burns ' Washington friends ... "
Tester later pointed out to thethat hesupport gay marriage or flag - burning , but opposes addressing the issues with constitutional amendments .
Finally an op -ed in theeven tracked down Mr. Tester 's real barber , who said the ads were phony cheap shots .
Then added , " I thought there was a war going on in Iraq , for crying out loud .
" Mike DeWine is the incumbent Republican Senator in Ohio .
( He 's also incredibly short . )
And he used the innocuous phrase " we all have to work together : Democrats , Republicans , " in his ads .
Suddenly the picture freezes , in a new ad from the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee .
" Senator DeWine HAS worked together , " it tells us , " voting 92 % of the time with President Bush . "
" The more we work together , the happier we 'll be , " a chorus of children sings , as subtitles flash over a picture of smiling Michael DeWine with his arm around President Bush .
With President Bush 's popularity ratings stuck in the high 30s , this may ultimately be the most negative campaign ad of all .
Think you know of better ones ?
Leave them in the comments !
Welcome to Kstinovo , population one .
Antonina Makarova , 78 , spends her days watching news and soap operas in her peeling wooden dacha , the only inhabited structure in two lanes of sagging cottages that once were a village .
Her nearest neighbor , 80 - year - old Maria Belkova , lives in adjacent Sosnovitsy , population two .
But she ca n’t hear anymore , and all in all , Makarova finds the television better company .
“ All the houses here were filled with people .
There was a cheese factory .
But now everyone else has died .
God has taken care of them , and he ’s still making me suffer , ” Makarova said .
“ Even the thieves have disappeared . ”
The Tver region , along the upper reaches of the Volga River 130 miles north of Moscow , is dotted with more than 1,400 villages such as Kstinovo labeled nezhiloye -- depopulated .
Since 1989 , the number of people here has shrunk by about 250,000 to about 1.4 million , with deaths outnumbering births more than 2 to 1 .

The Tver region is far from unusual in this country .
Russia is rapidly losing population .
Its people are succumbing to one of the world ’s fastest - growing AIDS epidemics , resurgent tuberculosis , rampant cardiovascular disease , alcohol and drug abuse , smoking , suicide and the lethal effects of unchecked industrial pollution .
In addition , abortions outpaced births last year by more than 100,000 .
An estimated 10 million Russians of reproductive age are sterile because of botched abortions or poor health .
The public healthcare system is collapsing .
And many parents in more prosperous urban areas say they can’t afford homes large enough for the number of children they ’d like to have .
The former Soviet Union , with almost 300 million people , was the world ’s third - most populous country , behind China and India .
Slightly more than half of its citizens lived in Russia .
The country has lost the equivalent of a city of 700,000 people every year since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , only partially offset by an influx of people from other former Soviet republics .

A country that sprawls across one - eighth of the globe is now home to 142 million people .
The losses have been disproportionately male .
At the height of its power , the Soviet Union ’s people lived almost as long as Americans .
But now , the average Russian man can expect to live about 59 years , 16 years less than an American man and 14 less than a Russian woman .
Sergei Mironov , chairman of the upper house of Russia ’s parliament , said last year that if the trend did n’t change , the population would fall to 52 million by 2080 .
“ There will no longer be a great Russia , ” he said .
“ It will be torn apart piece by piece , and finally cease to exist . ”
Advertisement
That may be an overstatement , but there are serious questions about whether Russia will be able to hold on to its lands along the border with China or field an army , let alone a workforce to support the ill and the elderly .
The government , flush with revenue from record prices for the country ’s oil exports , has started to respond .
President Vladimir V. Putin this year pledged payments of $ 111 a month to mothers who elected to have a second child , plus a nest egg of $ 9,260 to be used for education , a mortgage or pensions .
He also called for renewed efforts to attract ethnic Russians still living in the former Soviet republics .
“ Russia has a huge territory , the largest territory in the world , ” Putin said .
“ If the situation remains unchanged , there will simply be no one to protect it . ”

The economic earthquake of Russia ’s transition from communism to capitalism plunged tens of millions into poverty overnight and changed the value systems upon which many had planned their lives .
A small minority , mostly in urban centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg , were able to exploit the absence of rules in the chaotic 1990s to become fabulously wealthy .
But such a profound social transition , coming at the end of a century of war , revolution and ruthless social experimentation , condemned a great many more to a deep malaise .
Those who lost out have proved susceptible to drinking , smoking and other habits that killed millions of Russians even in the best of times .
In more extreme cases , they kill themselves .
The suicide rate jumped nearly 50 % during the 1990s ; half a million people killed themselves from 1995 through 2003 .
Russians fling themselves from balconies , slash their wrists or simply walk out in the snow on a bitter night .
Advertisement
Russia ’s suicide rate , at about 36 per 100,000 people , is second only to that of Lithuania , according to the Serbsky National Research Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry .
In some remote areas of Russia , the rate exceeds 100 per 100,000 .
Nikolai Zavada , a 21 - year - old musician who goes by the name Serial Self - Killer , posted a song on www.mysuicide.ru, a well - known website that was later shut down because of public pressure :
I ’m going out .
And it does n’t matter whether it ’s up or down .

Or who ’s holding your hand , an angel or otherwise ....
The cold has worn me out .
“ People have a lack of hope , ” Zavada said in an interview .
“ That all their efforts are in vain .
And also , they have a feeling of eternal emptiness . ”
Russia ’s transformation from a society that guaranteed employment means that millions of people , especially in the provinces , “ have become surplus ; they do not have a place in the current economy , ” said Andrei Demin , president of the Russian Public Health Assn. , a nongovernmental advocacy group .

“ They do not protest openly .
They protest inside , ” he said .
“ And the most extreme form of protest is just dying . ”
Others tried to adapt , and still failed .
Birthrates declined , not only because couples such as those elsewhere in Europe elected to have fewer children , but because they could n’t afford to have large families .
Roman Kiptenko , 35 , has a family , his health and two university degrees , but his life is turning out far differently than he had imagined .
The national parks institute where he worked disintegrated in the Soviet collapse .
He now works as a technical director in a friend ’s advertising company in Moscow .
But the firm is small and its future uncertain .
His wife was laid off last spring from her job as a dental office manager .
Kiptenko has begun to realize that they might never do better than the $ 330 - a- month apartment -- a cramped living room adjoining a tiny kitchen -- where they live with their 10 - year - old daughter .
Kiptenko and his wife sleep on a pullout sofa .
Their daughter ’s bed in the corner seats guests by day , her toys stacked neatly to one side .
Clothing is stacked in cupboards next to Kiptenko ’s computer .

“ At first , situations would come up when my wife would talk about wanting another child , ” he said .
“ But gradually , she stopped raising those questions . ”
Alexei Chaika , another Moscow resident , blamed the heart attack he suffered at 27 on stress from his job as a transportation manager for a construction company .
Recovering at a clinic in the capital , he said he had worked every day until 11 p.m. , and every weekend for months on end , all for a salary of $ 525 a month .
“ At work , the tension is very high , and you have to quarrel with people , ” he said .
“ Somebody hits me on the back of my head ; I hit someone lower than me ; he hits somebody else . ”
Although the problems are surfacing in the post - Soviet period , some argue that their cause can be found in communism ’s willful destruction of generations of the country ’s most capable and adaptable people .

“ Seventy - five years of Bolshevik life in this country led to the formation of a tribe of people which was cultivated to listen to orders , and fulfill them , ” said Alexander Gorelik , a St. Petersburg physician .
Stalinism , he said , aimed for “ the planned and gradual physical destruction of the most moral , the most creative group of the population . ”
“ There is such a thing as a will for life .
And the whole trouble is that the Russian public in general , and especially the male population , has a big deficiency in this area . ”
Vyacheslav Pushkarev , a Russian Orthodox priest who oversees several congregations in Siberian villages now too small to have a full - time cleric , said the Soviet system destroyed bodies and spirits in equal proportion .
“ We are left with this infection in us , this sickness of degradation in everything around us because we were all part of it , ” he said .
“ We ’re living in a huge bowl here , and we ’re all getting boiled together . ”

Drowning in Alcohol
Many a Russian village that once might have been the subject of an idyllic painting of ruddy - cheeked peasants leading tired horses through the fields are now part of a twilight world of illness , drunkenness and stunning lethargy .
Moscow has the second - largest concentration of billionaires in the world .
But one - fifth of all Russians live on less than $ 38 a month , many of them in the countryside .
The collapse of collective farming and the failure to replace it with viable private agriculture has left thousands of villages in limbo , their residents living on minuscule government stipends , odd jobs , kitchen gardens -- and vodka .
There is a long history of alcohol abuse in Russia .
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tried to tackle the problem 20 years ago by limiting the production and distribution of liquor .
Male life expectancy increased three years .
Advertisement
But consumption levels shot back up as soon as the controls were eased .
The average Russian drinks five gallons of pure alcohol a year , causing an estimated 900,000 deaths over the last decade from acute alcohol poisoning , fights and accidents , according to figures released by Tatyana Yakovleva , head of the Russian parliament ’s healthcare committee .
Others suffer permanent brain damage or liver damage from homemade alcohol .
“ People drink , and they drink a lot , and they drink for a long time , because they ca n’t help but drink , ” said Yuliya Kovgan , 25 , her voice trembling as she struggled to sit without falling over in a potato field on the edge of Ryazanovshchina , a Siberian village northeast of Irkutsk .
She was surrounded by a few dozen seed potatoes , an empty shot glass , a bottle of industrial - grade alcohol and her reeling brother , an unemployed roofer .
Standing to the side in an old housecoat was Larisa Berezhnaya , her 53 - year - old mother , tapping a grimy foot and affecting a disdainful air ; it became apparent that she was drunk too .
“ This is our life ; we call it normal .
We plant potatoes , we dig them out , and that ’s it , ” Berezhnaya shrugged .
“ There ’s nothing for people here . ”
Advertisement
A few decades ago , Ryazanovshchina was a collective farm center with thriving livestock operations and about twice its current population .
Men would go into the forests to fell timber all summer and the women would celebrate their homecoming with samovars of tea in the street .
But without the support of the Soviet state , one by one the farms failed .
Last winter , villagers say , someone burned down a neighbor ’s hay shed when she would n’t give a bottle on credit .
In a nearby town , a drunk grandmother threw a crying infant out the window of her fifth - floor apartment .
Pushkarev , the regional archpriest , confided that the church in nearby Tikhonovka was not functioning because “ the priest is on a drunken rampage . ”
Olga Kolotygina , 36 , one of several women who have assumed leadership of the Ryazanovshchina town council , estimates that no more than half a dozen men among the village ’s 160 people are sober and “ trying to improve their lives . ”
Much more typical is the filthy two - room shack at the end of a street where Lyudmila Borisova , 16 , is looking after her three younger siblings .
Her mother moved to the next town with her boyfriend , leaving the children behind .
Advertisement
While Borisova earns money by tending cattle in a pasture outside town , her siblings wander the village gathering handouts .
They retire each night to a pair of bare mattresses .
Borisova says she does n’t blame her mother for leaving , and she ’ll do the same when she can .
“ There ’s nothing good here , ” she said .
AIDS Strikes the Young
It has been five years since Svetlana Glukhova was diagnosed as HIV - positive , but she says she still has no idea whether she needs drug therapy .
Doctors at the only AIDS center in her city do not have the necessary laboratory equipment to decide that .
Advertisement
She does know that even when she took her first AIDS test , the sores on the fingers she once used to inject heroin already were failing to heal .
The United Nations says Russia has more people infected with HIV than any other country in Europe , due in part to “ extraordinarily large numbers of young people who inject drugs . ”
But the disease has spread widely through the population , and more than half of all new cases result from heterosexual intercourse .
Officially , more than 300,000 Russians are infected with HIV or have AIDS , but the U.N. says the number could easily be much higher .
The problem is not as serious as Africa’s .
The difference , experts say , is that African birthrates are high enough to replace those who die .
Not so in Russia .
Advertisement
Compounding the problem , the prevalence of AIDS among young people threatens to add to the population decline by killing them before they can bring a new generation into the world .
Murray Feshbach of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington , one of the world ’s leading experts on Russian health and demographics , said in a study that 80 % of Russian AIDS patients are younger than 30 .
In the West , it ’s nearly the reverse : 70 % are older than 30 .
That means 5 million to 10 million Russian teenagers could contract the disease within a few years , federal health officials say .
The Russian Military Medical Commission has recorded a twenty - fivefold increase in the number of HIV - positive military conscripts in the last five years , Feshbach said .
“ Even optimistically , you ’re looking at 250,000 deaths a year from AIDS alone in 2020 , and pessimistically , we ’re talking about 650,000 a year , ” Feshbach said .
Advertisement
Deaths among adults between the ages of 25 and 49 would be particularly devastating , he said .
The Russian government pledged in 1995 to provide free AIDS treatment .
But more than a decade later , only about 5,000 people are getting antiretroviral drug therapy .
Putin announced a twentyfold increase in funding this year , providing $ 120 million for the treatment of perhaps 15,000 AIDS patients .
A coalition of nongovernmental organizations known as the Global Fund is allocating another $ 120 million to treat as many as 50,000 additional patients through 2010 .
Advertisement
But the World Health Organization said in June that shortages in AIDS drugs had developed in several regions , apparently resulting in interruptions in treatment and possibly some deaths .
Akrom A. Eltom , the agency ’s AIDS program leader in Moscow , said patients who had been coaxed with great difficulty into a healthcare system that strongly stigmatized them might not return , endangering their health and encouraging the development of drug - resistant strains of the disease .
Glukhova said AIDS patients in the city of Tula , the arms manufacturing center 112 miles southwest of Moscow where she lives , would be ostracized if they went public .
She said she would n’t dare talk to Russian news media without covering her face .
“ If I uncover my face , I will be eaten alive at the bus stop tomorrow , ” she said in an interview .
“ I will lose my job , without any doubt . ”

Glukhova headed a support network of fellow HIV patients in Tula until international funds ran out in 2004 .
She said doctors told her they estimated that 1,000 people in Tula -- population 600,000 -- needed drug therapy for AIDS , but only 10 were getting it -- and only partial treatment at that .
“ When I asked the doctors in the AIDS center about this therapy , they just shrugged their shoulders .
Because when I told them I heard there are three drugs you ’re supposed to take , they had a notion of what I was talking about , but they do n’t have access to it .
The maximum they can offer you is just one drug , ” Glukhova said .
Sitting in a dimly lighted cafe that doubles as a dance hall on Saturday nights , Glukhova wiped away tears and said she was watching her friends slowly die .
“ One person I know , he was trying to stifle all his pangs by injecting and injecting himself with drugs .
He could n’t even get up from his bed anymore , but he continued to call his friends and ask for more drugs , ” she said .
Advertisement
“ When I said to him , ‘ Let me take you to the hospital , let me try to get something for you , ’ he waved me away .
“ Some people have such moments of despair that they just do n’t have the guts to struggle for their life anymore . ”

The Woz
Today I met with Y Combinator about getting funding for CouchDb .
I 'm sure you want to know , how did it go ?
Well , 15 minutes simply is n't enough time to explain this stuff , and I do n't know that I was able to explain any of what makes this technology compelling .
They asked a lot of what seemed like rapid fire questions and I felt I did n't answer any of them terribly well .
But one highlight was when Paul Graham turned to me and said I was a Steve Wozniak and that I need a Steve Jobs .
Cool .
Being a " Wozniak " is quite a compliment just about anytime .
Except when doing demos and selling your project , in which case you * really * want to be Jobs .
So how did it go ?
What am I a mind reader ?
Come back tomorrow I 'll know more .
Update :
Just got off the phone with Paul Graham .
They passed .
Paul made the point once more that I 'm the Woz and I need a Steve Jobs .
He 's wrong of course , but not that he could possibly know it from that meeting .
This was my very first funding application , and on the plus side it hammered home what I need to focus on : Presentation and presence .
With a project this big I cannot focus on the technical aspects when pitching to money folks , even if they are technical .
I have to be both grandiose and believable , infectious with enthusiasm without appearing infectious with disease if you know what I mean .

A group of researchers in Sweden have completed a successful trial this week , launching a 12,000 cubic meter weather balloon at an altitude of 24 kilometers .
The balloon transmitted a steady data link at a transmission speed of 11 Mbps .
This test is the latest in a series of efforts to prove that transmitting broadband Internet via lighter - than - air craft is not only technically feasible but economically practical .
Ultimately , the goal is to launch balloons that can transmit at speeds that are much higher .
Dr. David Grace , the projects ' lead scientific officer , explained :
Proving the ability to operate a high data rate link from a moving stratospheric balloon is a critical step in moving towards the longer term aim of providing data rates of 120 Mbps .
The team that launched this balloon consists of 14 different partners worldwide , including the research wing of British Telecom .
The radio link equipment was designed by engineers at the University of York in the UK .
The effort is being partly funded by the European Union ( EU ) .
Is there really a need for transmission of broadband Internet by a fleet of balloons ?
The idea conjures up visions of a retro-futuristic world , a kind of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow , where giant swaths of airships plow the skies in pursuit of Gwenneth Paltrow .
But the idea has some practical merit .
Wired connections are n't always available , and if they are , they can often be limited by the bandwidth of existing telephone cables .
While many high - speed fiber - optic cables were laid down in the heady days of the dot com boom , they still reach only a fraction of the people who might want to use them .
Satellite transmission , while fast and available over a large geographic area , has other issues .
Satellites are extremely expensive to launch , and suffer from latency issues due to the speed of light .
Anyone who has ever placed a transatlantic call over a geosynchronous satellite will have experienced the frustrating lag that disrupts the flow of conversation and can wreak havoc with online gaming .
Stratospheric balloons , on the other hand , cost less than a tenth the amount for the launch and communication infrastructure compared to satellites .
They suffer none of the latency problems associated with satellites .
Also , one airship could conceivably support more than a thousand times as many users as a satellite .
Alan Gobbi , the marketing manager of the York Electronic Centre explained some possible applications for the technology :
One business model could be an alternative to wired access in suburban areas where costs of roll out are high .
It could be offered on high - speed trains and in remote areas .
The next trial of the technology is scheduled for Japan , sometime next year .
Theo Schlossnagle is a principal at OmniTI Computer Consulting , working in the areas of scalable internet architectures , database replication , and e-mail infrastructure .
This talk was on converting a really large ( over 3 terabytes , largest table is 1.8 billion rows ) data warehouse database from Oracle 8 i to PostgreSQL .
The reason for the conversion was to save in licensing costs .
They wanted to move their Oracle licenses over from the data warehouse DB to use them on the online transaction processing ( OLTP ) system .
The reason for choosing Postgres over MySQL was that Postgres has a much longer history with the kind of advanced features he needed .
They needed ( and were able to hack PostgreSQL to get ) the following features :
1. Data partitioning ( spreading tables over multiple drives )
2. Large selects ( 50 - million - row return sets , over 100 GB of data )
2. Incremental COMMITs for really , really long queries
3. Replication
The bottom line was that with some patience and creating thinking , they were able to migrate a really humongous database to PostgreSQL from Oracle , and ended up saving themselves $ 500,000 USD in licensing costs .
A pretty good chunk of change .
Theo has put his slides up here .
The cause of muscle fatigue during intense exercise is linked directly to the muscle ’s reliance on anaerobic metabolism for force production , according to a new study by researchers at Rice and Harvard universities .
Published in the November issue of the American Journal of Physiology – Regulatory , Integrative and Comparative Physiology , the study implicates the reliance on anaerobic energy release as a key factor in the onset of muscle fatigue and impaired exercise performance .
While the mechanism of how anaerobic pathways might impair force production remains under active investigation , the new results suggest that the mechanisms of muscular fatigue in the body are probably similar to the mechanisms being discovered in laboratory research on cell and tissue samples .
The researchers had six males perform 15 all - out sprints on a stationary cycle at varying pedal forces , which meant varying muscle - force requirements .
Besides conventional cycling , the researchers also had the study participants perform similar all - out sprints with only one leg while the unused leg rested on an adjacent stool .
Although this approach may seem unorthodox , the Rice - Harvard group knew from previous work that the metabolic pathways providing the chemical energy necessary for contraction would differ appreciably during the one - and two - legged conditions , said principal investigator Peter Weyand , assistant professor in kinesiology at Rice .
During exercise , muscles continuously break down and resynthesize the chemical ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) , which serves as the immediate source of energy for muscle contractions .
During less vigorous muscular activity , essentially all of the ATP needed for muscular contraction can be provided via aerobic pathways that utilize oxygen delivered via the bloodstream .
The aerobic pathways allow moderate levels of force to be generated without fatigue for prolonged periods , but can only support modest levels of muscular activity , due to the upper limits on how rapidly blood and oxygen can be supplied to the working muscles by the heart .
Consequently , during more vigorous exercise , such as sprinting or lifting heavy loads or weights , the aerobic provision of ATP is supplemented by anaerobic pathways that do not rely on oxygen delivery .
While the anaerobic pathways provide ATP very rapidly , their capacity is finite and must be replenished after each bout .
The researchers knew that the rates of oxygen delivery , aerobic metabolism and the amount of “ aerobic ” muscle force generated would be much greater in the active leg under the one - legged condition simply because the heart and circulation can provide relatively more blood and oxygen when only one limb is active .
Thus , the researchers were confident that a much greater fraction of the muscle force required would be provided via chemical energy that came from aerobic pathways for all of the one - legged versus the two - legged sprint trials .
The cyclists were asked to pedal stationary cycles for a series of sprints at the rate of 100 revolutions per minute , continuing an all - out effort until they could no longer maintain this speed for at least five seconds .
The researchers simultaneously measured the forces the subjects applied to the pedals , the amount of oxygen they inhaled and the electrical activity of the thigh muscles used to apply pedal force .
Electrodes were attached to the skin of the thigh to measure electrical activity in the leg muscles .

Weyand and colleagues found that the electrical activity of the leg muscles increased throughout each workout .
Such increases are common during fatiguing contractions as individual muscle fibers develop less force over time .
“ Under these conditions , the exercise can be continued only if the individual activates new , unfatigued muscle to augment the impaired force from the muscle fibers originally activated , ” Weyand said .
“ The increase in electrical signals from the active muscles can be used to indirectly assess the amount of fatigue the muscles are experiencing . ”
As the researchers had hypothesized , the subjects had much higher peak rates of aerobic metabolism and pedal forces per leg when they used just one leg .
During both the one - and two - legged sprints performed at pedal forces greater than those that could be supported via the aerobic pathways , the researchers observed progressive increases in electrical activity in the thigh muscles .
“ This indicates that new muscle fibers were being recruited throughout each sprint trial to provide the muscle force necessary to maintain a constant pedal force required by the sprint , ” Weyand said .
Due to the lesser pedal forces supported via the aerobic pathways during two - legged cycling , the onset of compensatory muscle recruitment occurred at lower thresholds of pedal and muscle force in this mode .
Similarly , at equivalent pedal forces , the rates of increase in compensatory electrical activity in the muscles were greater during two - legged than one - legged sprint cycling .
“ We attribute these between - mode differences in the rates at which muscles become fatigued and additional muscle is recruited to the greater reliance on anaerobic pathways of ATP resynthesis for force production during two - legged cycling versus one - legged cycling , ” Weyand said .
“ Although scientists have observed similar fatiguing patterns of electrical activity in people holding heavy objects , performing calisthenics and fine - motor tasks , muscular force decrements had not been shown previously to be so closely linked to the anaerobic pathways of ATP resynthesis , ” he said .
Weyand suggested that the study raises the possibility that relying on the anaerobic pathways for chemical energy might be intrinsically fatiguing .
“ Experts focusing on locomotion and whole - body activities have attributed performance limitations during running , cycling , swimming and other athletic activities that involve many muscles simultaneously to the maximum rates at which ATP can be resynthesized from all pathways and not to an impaired ability of skeletal muscles to produce force during contraction , ” he said .
“ Although bicep curls might not induce huffing , puffing and the same level of discomfort incurred by an all - out sprint , your muscles might not know the difference . ”
Weyand ’s coauthors on the paper are Matthew Bundle , formerly a Rice research fellow in the Department of Kinesiology and now an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming ; and Carrie Ernst , Matthew Bellizzi and Seth Wright , all at Harvard .
The study was funded by the U.S. Army Medical and Materiel Command , the National Institutes of Health and the National Research Council .
The accumulation of genetic damage in our cells is a major contributor to how we age , according to a study being published today in the journal Nature by an international group of researchers .
The study found that mice completely lacking a critical gene for repairing damaged DNA grow old rapidly and have physical , genetic and hormonal profiles very similar to mice that grow old naturally .
Furthermore , the premature aging symptoms of the mice led to the discovery of a new type of human progeria , a rare inherited disease in which affected individuals age rapidly and die prematurely .
" These progeroid mice , even though they do not live very long , have remarkably similar characteristics to normal old mice , from their physical symptoms , to their metabolic and hormonal changes and pathology , right down to the level of similar changes in gene expression , " said corresponding author Jan Hoeijmakers , Ph.D. , head of the department of genetics at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam , Netherlands .
" This provides strong evidence that failure to repair DNA damage promotes aging — a finding that was not entirely unexpected since DNA damage was already known to cause cancer .
However , it shows how important it is to repair damage that is constantly inflicted upon our genes , even through the simple act of breathing . "
The study found that a key similarity between the progeria - like , or progeroid , mice and naturally old mice is the suppression of genes that control metabolic pathways promoting growth , including those controlled by growth hormone .
How growth hormone pathways are suppressed is not known , but this response appears to have evolved to protect against stress caused by DNA damage or the wear - and - tear of normal living .
The authors speculate that this stress response allows each of us to live as long and as healthy a life as possible despite the accumulation of genetic damage as we age .
Findings from this study help to reconcile two conflicting hypotheses currently favored in the field of aging research about why we get old , according to the authors .
The first is that our lifespan and how well we age is determined by the genes inherited from our parents .
The second is that lifespan and fitness in old age is determined by how much damage we incur over our lifetime .
" Our study suggests that both of these hypotheses are correct .
Damage , including DNA damage , drives the functional decline we all experience as we age .
But how we respond to that damage is determined genetically , in particular by genes that regulate the growth hormone and insulin pathways , " said Laura Niedernhofer , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of molecular genetics and biochemistry , University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , and first author of the study .
How the researchers came to study the relationship between DNA damage and aging began almost serendipitously in the late 1990s while Dr. Niedernhofer was a post - doctoral fellow in Dr. Hoeijmakers ’ laboratory at Erasmus Medical Center , a well - known European center for medical genetics , including the diagnosis of people with unusual sensitivity to sunlight .
A German physician had contacted the center about a 15 - year old Afghan boy who was highly sensitive to the sun and had other debilitating symptoms including weight loss , muscle wasting , hearing loss , visual impairment , anemia , hypertension and kidney failure .
The boy ’s family had immigrated to Germany to seek better medical treatment for his condition .
Extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation from sunlight is a hallmark of diseases caused by defective DNA repair — an important mechanism by which skin and other cell types normally cut out , or excise , damage to their DNA caused by UV light .
Defects in one DNA repair mechanism , nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) , causes xeroderma pigmentosum , a rare disease in which people have a 2,000 - fold increased risk of skin cancer from sun exposure .
When the investigators obtained cells from the boy and tested them for NER activity , they found almost none .
Further analysis of the boy ’s DNA revealed a mutation in a gene known as XPF , which codes for part of a key enzyme required for the removal of DNA damage .
The XPF portion of the enzyme harbors the DNA - cutting activity ; whereas a second portion , known as ERCC1 , is essential for the enzyme to bind to the damaged DNA .
Mutations in either XPF or ERCC1 lead to reduced activity of this key DNA repair enzyme .
" We were completely surprised by the finding that the patient had a mutation in XPF , because mutations in this gene typically cause xeroderma pigmentosum , which is a disease characterized primarily by skin and other cancers rather than accelerated aging , " said Dr. Hoeijmakers .
" This patient , therefore , has a unique disease , which we named XPF - ERCC1 , or XFE - progeroid syndrome . "
To understand why this XPF mutation caused accelerated aging , the investigators compared the expression pattern of all of the genes ( approximately 30,000 ) in the liver of 15 - day - old mice that had been generated in the laboratory to harbor a defect in their XPF - ERCC1 enzyme and that had symptoms of rapidly accelerated aging to the genes expressed by normal mice of the same age .
This comparison revealed a profound suppression of genes in several important metabolic pathways in the progeroid mice .
Most notably , the progeroid mice had a profoundly suppressed somatotroph ( growth hormone ) axis — a key pathway involved in the promotion of growth and development — compared to normal mice .
The investigators also found low levels of growth hormones in the progeroid mice and ruled out the possibility that this suppression was due to problems with their hypothalamus or pituitary glands , which regulate growth hormone secretion .
Furthermore , they demonstrated that if normal adult mice were exposed to a drug that causes DNA damage , such as a cancer chemotherapy agent , the growth hormone axis was similarly suppressed .
In other words , DNA damage somehow triggered hormonal changes that halted growth , while also boosting maintenance and repair .
Because growth hormone levels go down as we get older , contributing to loss of muscle mass and bone density , the investigators systematically compared the gene expression pattern of their progeroid mice to normal old mice to look for other similarities .
What they found was a striking similarity pattern between the progeroid and normal - aged mice in several key pathways .
Indeed , for genes that influence the growth hormone pathway , there was a greater than 95 percent correlation in changes in gene expression between the DNA repair - deficient mice and old mice .
And , remarkably , there was a near 90 percent correlation between all other pathways affected in the progeroid mice and the older mice .
" Because there were such high correlations between these pathways in progeroid and normal older mice , we are quite confident that DNA damage plays a significant role in promoting the aging process .
The bottom line is that avoiding or reducing DNA damage caused by sources such as sunlight and cigarette smoke , as well as by our own metabolism , also could delay aging , " explained Dr. Niedernhofer .

The panel dismissed the idea , notably advanced last year by Lawrence H. Summers , then the president of Harvard , that the relative dearth of women in the upper ranks of science might be the result of “ innate ” intellectual deficiencies , particularly in mathematics .
If there are any cognitive differences , the report says , they are small and irrelevant .
In any event , the much - studied gender gap in math performance has all but disappeared as more and more girls enroll in demanding classes .
Even among very high achievers , the gap is narrowing , the panelists said .
A spokesman for Mr. Summers said he was out of the country and could not be reached for comment .
Nor is the problem a lack of women in the academic pipeline , the report says .
Though women leave science and engineering more often than men “ at every educational transition ” from high school through college professorships , the number of women studying science and engineering has sharply increased at all levels .
For 30 years , the report says , women have earned at least 30 percent of the nation ’s doctorates in social and behavioral sciences , and at least 20 percent of the doctorates in life sciences .
Yet they appear among full professors in those fields at less than half those levels .
Women from minorities are “ virtually absent , ” it adds .
The report also dismissed other commonly held beliefs — that women are uncompetitive or less productive , that they take too much time off for their families , and so on .
Their real problems , it says , are unconscious but pervasive bias , “ arbitrary and subjective ” evaluation processes , and a work environment in which “ anyone lacking the work and family support traditionally provided by a ‘ wife ’ is at a serious disadvantage . ”

The Fountain explores the roles of science and spirituality in understanding life .
A movie out this week in the United States seeks to explore mankind 's persistent struggle against death , through a triple - stranded plot in three different eras .
In The Fountain , Hugh Jackman plays a sixteenth - century conquistador searching for the fountain of youth ; a twenty - first - century neurologist who 's researching brain tumors because his wife has one ; and a beatific astronaut in the future , who flies through nebulas in a more spiritual pursuit of the meaning of life .
Bold and beautiful : but what does it have to say about the roles of science and spirituality in understanding life and death ?
Warner Bros. Pictures
While the film is only loosely about science , the story 's writers both have an interest in scientific issues : one holds a PhD. Emma Marris talks to co-writer Ari Handel and co-writer / director Darren Aronofsky ( also director of Requiem for a Dream and Pi ) .
Ari Handel :
What 's your background in science ?
I got a PhD in neurobiology at New York University .
I had always been torn between science and humanities .
I was very interested in science writing and science education .
I originally went to graduate school with the idea that I would be a better communicator of science if I really saw what was inside the world of science .
Were you a sort of scientific advisor for this film ?
Yes .
My role was — or one of my roles — was to be the voice of science and the voice of research and of academic accuracy , wherever that was appropriate .
With the lab science and the stuff that took place in the hospital , that was something I was watching over and researching , and even some of the spaceship design issues .
One of the things I learned , because I was naïve to the filmmaking process when I started , is how much of it is an illusion .
It 's all made up , so you have to control the entire universe that you are showing , and make sure it at least has some kind of internal consistency .
One could think that the film rejects science as a way to understand life and death .
Was that the intended message ?
I would say that the film is sort of neutral about science .
If anything , it says that — and this applies to the conquistador character , the scientist character and the character in outer space — the attempt to understand , control and manipulate everything in your environment may be ineffectual .
These characters are trying to control life , and that letting go a little bit and ceding some of that control may be a better way to go .
Science brings us lots of insight about life and death , but like anything it is not absolute .
What 's your general take on science in the movies ?
When you see scientists in the movies they are often either megalomaniac mad scientist creatures , or a little bit unhinged , or they are bastions of rationalism who always do the right thing and keep their cool .
In my experience scientists are human .
What I 'd like to see is scientists as people , because science has operated within society , so people should see it as it is : as people trying to do their best .
Darren Aronofsky :
What 's your background in science ?
My dad taught geology in public school in Brooklyn .
So I guess you are always fascinated by what your pop does .
When I was in high school I was in a program called The School for Field Studies .
It sends mostly college kids and some high - school kids into ecologically sensitive areas to do scientific research .
So in 1986 I went with them to Kenya , and I studied water strategies in ungulates [ hoofed animals ] , and then in 1987 I went with them to Prince William Sound , Alaska , and studied thermoregulation in harbour seals .
And so , that background was always there for me , even though I did n't study science in college .
How do you feel about putting science into films ?
When we did Pi , it was a really strange character to have as a lead in a film , a mathematician .
There really were n't that many films out there doing it .
I think it has changed a little bit , because I think in many ways the geeks and the nerds have won .
The richest people in the world — Bill Gates and Paul Allen — are scientists .
It has definitely changed the profile of what it means to be a scientist .
Does The Fountain support a rejection of science as a way to understand death ?
ADVERTISEMENT
I am not sure science needs to be rejected .
I think the point of the film is that western medicine and western science has done remarkable things as far as life extension over the last couple of centuries .
But culturally , we kind of have a collective amnesia that mortality is actually part of our humanity .
There is no way to escape death .
In fact , if there was a way to escape death , perhaps we should n't even partake in that .
All the ' spirituality ' in this film might put off some scientists .
What do you say to them ?
Science and spirituality do not contradict each other .
The real message of the film is just recycling .
We are all part of a fountain of matter and energy that has been passed down from the Big Bang .

Whitfield Diffie trägt heute noch die gleiche unkonventionelle Haartracht wie Mitte der 70er - Jahre , als er an der Stanford Universität gemeinsam mit Martin Hellman die Basis für Public - Key - Verschlüsselung legte : eine lange Mähne und einen Bart , der bei manchen Erinnerungen an den Wildwest - Helden Buffalo Bill weckt .
Diffie , bald 60 Jahre alt , ist Mit -Namensgeber für eine der wichtigsten Verschlüsselungsmethoden .
Der Diffie - Hellman -Algorithmus , veröffentlicht 1976 , war ein Wendepunkt :
Er ermöglichte Privatpersonen zum ersten Mal die Verschlüsselung und Authentifizierung elektronischer Nachrichten – und das jenseits der Kontrolle der US - Spionagebehörde National Security Agency .
Wie der gleichzeitig entwickelte RSA - Algorithmus ( benannt nach den Initialen dreier MIT - Wissenschaftler ) wurde Diffie - Hellman ein Grundstein der modernen Kryptographie .
Diffie arbeitet seit 1991 als Chief Security Officer bei Sun Microsystems in Kalifornien und hat sich als Fürsprecher der Krypto - Rechte privater und kommerzieller Nutzer einen Namen gemacht .
TR : Herr Diffie , als Sie anfingen , sich für Verschüsselungstechnik zu interessieren , trieb Sie die Sorge um den Schutz der Privatsphäre an .
Hat sich Ihre Sicht der Dinge seit den 60er - Jahren geändert ?
Whitfield Diffie : Der Schutz der Privatsphäre war nicht der wichtigste Faktor in meinem Denken – sondern der Wunsch nach einer freien Gesellschaft .
Damals sah ich eine
Welt der elektronischen Kommunikation entstehen – und dazu war Technik nötig , um weiterhin private Gespräche führen zu können , vor allem mit politischem Inhalt .
Nach 30 Jahren in dieser Branche habe nicht nur ich dazugelernt .
Inzwischen haben die Politiker gemerkt , dass das Thema die ganze Gesellschaft angeht und die nötigen Ressourcen ihre Fähigkeiten übersteigen .
TR : Wir leben heute mit dem „ Krieg gegen den Terror “ , dem Patriot Act und anderen Gesetzen und Vorschriften , die die Privatsphäre einschränken und immer mehr Abhörmöglichkeiten für den Staat schaffen .
Machen Sie sich Sorgen ?
Whitfield Diffie : Noch weiß niemand , was Schutz der Privatsphäre in unserer neuen
Welt bedeutet .
Informationen – auch persönliche Daten – machen schneller als je zuvor die Runde .
Wenn man das Napoleonische Zeitalter betrachtet , als Beglaubigungsschreiben und Reisepässe aufkamen , sieht man , wie Reisen plötzlich zu einem normalen Vorgang für die Bevölkerung wurde .
Wir stehen genauso am Anfang einer neuen Epoche , in der Individuen noch leichter auf Entdeckungsreise gehen , sich austauschen und engagieren können .
Zugleich sorgt die Technik dafür , dass man das alles nicht mehr anonym tun kann .
Ich halte es allerdings für eine gefährliche Idee , bestimmte Arten von Schutz der Privatsphäre von vornherein zu verneinen .
In den 90er - Jahren wollte die Regierung der Bevölkerung das grundsätzliche Recht absprechen , alles technisch Mögliche zu tun , um ihre Kommunikation zu schützen .
Haben
Sie je mit der Spionageagentur NSA zusammengearbeitet ?
Whitfield Diffie : Ich habe mich oft mit ihnen unterhalten , und ich schwinge nicht ohne Grund öffentliche Nachrufreden auf ehemalige NSA - Mitarbeiter .
Die Krypto-Gemeinde und mein Arbeitgeber Sun Microsystems haben im Lauf der Jahre stetigen Kontakt in unterschiedlichen Graden der Herzlichkeit mit den wichtigsten Regierungsstellen gehalten : mit dem Verteidigungsministerium , dem Justizministerium , dem Handelsministerium und der NSA .
Selbst wenn man sich streitet , muss man miteinander sprechen .
TR : Was ist aus der radikal freisinnigen
Welt der Cypherpunks geworden , die Verschlüsselung als politische Waffe benutzen wollten ?
Whitfield Diffie : Diese Bewegung litt meiner Meinung nach schon immer unter exzessivem Enthusiasmus .
Ihr wichtigstes Mittel zum Zweck war digitales Geld , aber das erwies sich als technisch extrem schwer zu realisieren .
Die Cypherpunks trieb die Vision einer freieren Gesellschaft an , die entstehen würde , wenn man Informationen mit Kryptographie schützt .
Ich weiß nicht , inwiefern ich hier mit nachträglicher Weisheit spreche , aber ich habe nie an diese Vision geglaubt .
Damit meine ich das Ausmaß , in dem Krypto angewendet werden müsste , um die Gesellschaft zu verändern .
Unterm Strich kann man heute dank größerem Informationsfluss mehr über das Treiben einer Regierung herausfinden .
TR : Worum werden die nächsten großen Sicherheitsdebatten entbrennen ?
Whitfield Diffie :
Im kommerziellen Bereich steht uns eine große Schlacht bevor :
Was gut ist für die Unternehmenssicherheit , schränkt die legitimen Rechte der privaten Nutzer ein .
Wir werden gerade Zeugen , wie ein Segment der Informationsindustrie – nämlich die Anbieter von Inhalten – versucht , sich die totale Kontrolle über das Gedächtnis der Gesellschaft anzueignen .
Bislang haben sie sehr erfolgreich das Konzept des Urheberschutzes zu einem permanenten Eigentumsrecht an Informationen ausgeweitet .
Die US - Verfassung propagiert demgegenüber , dass die Gesellschaft geistiges Eigentum schützen sollte , um künftige Kreativität zu stimulieren , anstatt Investitionen abzusichern .
TR : Und diese Stimulation ist durch technische Neuerungen wie Kopierschutz für DVDs gefährdet ?
Whitfield Diffie : Die Leute , die gern drakonische Kontrolle über Informationen und Unterhaltung ausüben würden , drohen damit , nur dann Inhalte anzubieten , wenn sie entsprechend abgesichert sind .
Damit riskieren wir , den Tatendrang von innovativen Geschäftsleuten und Künstlern bereits im Keim zu ersticken .
Wenn sich in der DVD - Debatte die Anbieter durchsetzen , hieße das :
Wir können alle möglichen Sorten von Informationen nur noch ansehen , anstatt sie wie heute zu kaufen und zu behalten .
Es ist gut vorstellbar , dass wir sie in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft nur noch mieten können .
Das ist ein Informationsfeudalismus mit zwei Klassen : wenige Inhaltseigner und ein Meer von Nutzern .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Levi Strauss & Co. 's main
Web site has quietly stopped offering Google Inc. 's Checkout online payment feature , marking yet another hiccup for the new Google feature introduced in late June .
The San Francisco - based clothier has n't completely abandoned Checkout .
It 's still available on the Web site for Dockers , one of the company 's other properties .
But the decision to yank Checkout from www.levi.com raises more questions about how well Checkout works , and whether it 's resonating with merchants .
The answers to these questions are key to whether Checkout can emerge as a serious competitor to eBay Inc.'s EBAY , - 2.17 % ubiquitous PayPal online payment feature .
" Payments is a hard thing to do , " said Amanda Pires , a spokeswoman for eBay 's PayPal division .
" We 've been doing it for eight years and have 5,000 people working on it . "
The Checkout feature was pulled from www.levi.com just a few days after Levi Strauss & Co. encountered a " particular issue " with it , said Steve Davis , senior vice president of partners for GSI Commerce , Inc. , the King of Prussia , Penn . - based firm that Levi Strauss & Co. used to integrate Checkout .
To date , Levi Strauss & Co. has yet to commit to re-introducing Checkout to levi.com .
But " we 're confident ( they ) will revisit it , " Davis said .
Davis said GSI 's relationship with Levi Strauss & Co. precludes him from providing additional details .
It 's likely the firm will revisit Checkout after Google releases an updated version of feature , due out in the next few weeks .
The update addresses concerns merchants have raised about how Checkout orders are sometimes delayed for days by an overly - cautious procedure for rooting out fraud , according to some update details revealed on a Web site Google provides for Google Checkout merchants .
Levi Strauss & Co. 's decision is the latest in a series of issues Google 's GOOG , +0.12 % had to deal with since it introduced Checkout .
For example , there are a growing number of consumer complaints about delays in how long Checkout takes to process orders .
Also , on July 6 , eBay announced that Checkout did n't meet certain of its criteria .
As a result , Checkout was n't approved for use as an eBay payment option .
The more recent Levi.com development is particularly stinging .
The San Francisco - based clothier was among the highest profile of the original 100 partners that signed up to use Checkout , which was launched amid much fanfare , and was heralded as the next great competitor to PayPal
Representatives for Google and Levi Strauss & Co. did n't comment for this story about the decision by the clothier to remove Checkout .
As to the complaints surfacing about delays due to fraud screening , a Google spokeswoman said there are brief delays for just a small percentage of transactions , and " for a majority of our transactions , there is little impact . "

Gregory Heller DefectiveByDesign Campaign Manager :
So without further ado I turn it over to Peter Brown the Executive Director of the Free Software Foundation
Peter Brown :
Thanks , Gregory .
And welcome , everybody .
On June 23rd , the Defective by Design campaign organized a phone - in targeting the executives at the Recording Industry Association of America ( the RIAA ) and similar trade organizations in Europe and Canada .
We did this to allow our supporters to express their frustration with Big Media 's attempt to force DRM into our technology and onto our society .
Through the action we became aware of the work of Ray Beckman and his excellent blog ' Recording Industry vs the People ' .
Ray practices law in New York state and is the lead attorney there in the fight against the RIAA lawsuits .
From speaking to Ray about the campaign I came to realize that we are in fact fighting the same battle but just on two seperate fronts .
That battle is the battle of consumer control .
DRM is simply an attempt to win this battle with technology restrictions , and the other is an attempt to win the battle through intimidation and lawsuits , that they also hope will allow them to rewrite copyright law .
It 's very important that we realize what 's going on in these lawsuits and that we realize that in fact there 's no real financial support going on .
The RIAA has really been allowed to run amok here and we need to take some action .
So let me introduce Ray Beckman to you and let 's find out what 's happening with these lawsuits , how they 're connected to DRM , and what we can do to help .
Ray , why do n't you spill the beans on what 's going on ?
Ray Beckerman :
For almost three years , the RIAA has been conducting a reign of terror and they have actually tripped across what is possibly their most effective device which is bringing lawsuits against defenseless people .
You have a multi-billion dollar cartel sueing unemployed people , disabled people , housewives , single mothers , home healthcare aids , all kinds of people who have no resources whatsoever to withstand these litigations .
And due to the adversary system of justice the RIAA will be successful in rewriting copyright law , if the world at large , and the technological community in particular , do n't fight back and help these people fighting these fights .
Every time you learn of one of those rare instances in the 19000 litigations in which one person has fought back , it means that there 's a lawyer out there who 's either working for free or getting a nominal fee for his work and you will notice that you will never see a big law firm in that category .
For one thing , the big law firms are like any big corporation : they need to make a profit .
That 's what their primary purpose is .
And they would be interested in representing the RIAA , not the poor people that the RIAA is sueing .
Now these cases raise very important legal issues relating to privacy , and not just music , but technology .
The way this campaign begins is with an investigation that is not an investigation at all .
The sophisticated audience to which I am speaking will realize how bogus it actually is .
They have an investigator pretend to be a user of KAZAA or one of the other similar file - sharing networks .
He finds a shared files folder that has a goodly number of copyrighted songs in it .
He has no idea whether those song files were obtained legally , whether though payed downloads , or through making personal copies from one 's own CD for backup purposes , or whether anything illegal was ever done with those files , whether anyone ever copied one .
And what he does : he takes a screen shot of this shared files folders ( He of course does not see the folders , he merely sees the text in the metadata ) and decides that this is a big shared file folder .
Then through some secret process which he will not share with us and has tried to conceal from the courts , he then associates it with a dynamic ip address .
And then , after he has what he believes is the correct dynamic ip address , for the date and time at which he made that screen shot , he then brings a proceeding to get the name and address of the subscriber who paid for the internet access , which of course would tell us nothing .
But once he gets that information he then sues the person .
The way he gets the information is through a one - sided lawsuit against a host of John Doe's .
Usually the people who are named as defendants in these cases , live in cities hundreds of thousands of miles away from where the lawsuit is pending , and they only find out about it after an order has already been entered directing the turn over of information .
They usually receive only just a few days ' notice and are told that unless they can hire a lawyer in that far off city and that lawyer can make a motion to quash the subpoena and vacate the order , that their information will be turned over .
And of course at that point they do n't even know that there 's a lawsuit .
Most of them do not even know that they have been sued .
They do n't have copies of the court papers , they do n't have copies of the application for the order .
They have absolutely no way to resist .
A couple of people have been alert enough to alert the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others , and so we 've managed to bring a few cases in which we 've attacked this initial John Doe process .
But the judges , who are anything but digital natives , have no understanding of it , have given us very short shrift , have n't listened to anything that we 've had to say .
There was a case in 2004 where an elderly judge was told by a lawyer in his brief from the RIAA that from the metadata and the hash you could tell that these were illegally copied files , which was of course nonsense .
But the judge actually referred to that in his decision as to why he was upholding the subpoena .
Once they get the name and address of the victim , they then basically seek to extort a settlement of either $ 3750 or $ 4250 .
If the victim calls them up and tells them that they 've never even done any file sharing of any kind , that they have no idea what it 's about , that they 're completely innocent , the RIAA does n't care and then it commences a federal lawsuit .
Now , defending a federal lawsuit is an extremely costly process .
If you get into the merits of the case to prove that you 're innocent , you 've already lost because under any scenario you 're talking tens of thousands of dollars at least in legal expenses in order to defend such a case .
Now there are some very important cases going on .
In my office we 've tried to attack process early on .
We 're the only firm that lately has made motions to vacate the John Doe cases .
Once the name and address is known and they sue a person in their name , they still have this extremely vague complaint which tells you nothing because they know nothing .
They say the defendant downloaded , distributed and / or made available for distribution certain song files .
But they have no evidence of any downloading , they have no evidence of any distributing .
And at most they can say that someone who might somehow be associated with the ip address might have made some files available .
But they certainly do n't know that the defendant did .
All they know that the defendant did was to write out a check for internet access .
Now , we 've tried to point out in our John Doe cases that the technical underpinning of the investigation is meaningless , that the metadata does n't tell you anything , that it can be scrubbed , that it can be changed , that any real pirate would never leave the metadata of the thing he had perloined .
And the IP address makes no sense because any real pirate would be using someone else 's internet access account .
The metadata tells you nohting , the hashmarks do not conclusively establish anything .
Even seeing the shared files folder does n't tell you which computer it resided on because all of these networks use one form or another of a hierarchy of computers ( those with fast broadband connections and those with slow broadband connections , so you have the nodes and super nodes or whatever terminology they use ) .
So that when you see the shared files , all you 're seeing is metadata from one computer or from a group of computers that are connected to one node , but the judges have no clue .
They actually wo n't even let me talk about it .
One of the three motions had no oral argument .
And the two that had an oral argument , the judges would not let me speak and kept cutting me off .
Now , there 's a case called Electro vs.
Barker which has become very important .
This is a nursing student who was sued in her name .
We made a motion to dismiss the complaint because does n't specify any acts or dates or times of copyright infringement as the law normally requires .
We 've made several arguments like that before this motion and the RIAA put in an argument which basically fudged it .
However , in this case they basically decided to go for the gold and they made a bold argument claiming that merely making files available on the internet is in and of itself a copyright infringement .
It was a shocking argument because if it were accepted it would probably shut down the entire internet .
As a result of that bold argument , certain organizations came in putting in an amicus curiae brief to support Miss Barker 's motion to dismiss .
In reaction to that the Motion Picture Association and the United States Government put in briefs supporting the RIAA trying to ...
Well , the Motion Picture Association directly supported that extreme argument .
The US government did n't quite go that far but it tried to support the RIAA by attacking another argument that had been made by the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Meanwhile , Miss Barker is a nursing student .
She has no money .
She lives in the housing projects , and she has to have lawyers reviewing all these briefs , writing briefs for her etc .
Now , this case is pending and the judge may call for oral argument or he may render a decision .
But if our motion to dismiss is granted and sustained on appeal it would mean the end of the RIAA juggernaut against innocent people not known to have committed a copyright infringement .
And yet we 've received no support of any kind from anywhere , and Miss Barker has no resources to defend this case .
In the case UMG vs. Lindor where the defendant Lindor is a home health aid who 's never used a computer .
She 's never used a computer , she 's never owned a computer , she 's never even turned on a computer .
The only connection she has had to a computer is that she has on occasion dusted near the parts which she believes are a computer .
And yet she is being sued as an online distributor in peer to peer file sharing .
This is a case started by her so we were not able to ( we stepped in in the middle ) so we 're not able to attack the complaint , but we 're seeking information on the cartel - like behavior of the RIAA and we 're in all kinds of discovery disputes .
The RIAA is trying to conceal information about how it conducts its " investigation " to conceal the information on how the different companies work together to run this campaign to destroy competition in digital music .
All these discovery disputes ...
There have been depositions and now they 're calling ...
They 've already deposed her and her son , they now want to depose various other relatives and her daughter .
And meanwhile they 've stonwalled every discovery request we 've made .
And unless the world comes together and helps these defenseless people the RIAA is going to win all these battles one way or another and they 're going to rewrite the copyright law .
end .

How to be a Successful Evil Overlord
Being an Evil Overlord seems to be a good career choice .
It pays well , there are all sorts of perks and you can set your own hours .
However every Evil Overlord
I 've read about in books or seen in movies invariably gets overthrown and destroyed in the end .
I 've noticed that no matter whether they are barbarian lords , deranged wizards , mad scientists , or alien invaders , they always seem to make the same basic mistakes every single time .
With that in mind , allow me to present ...
The Top 100 Things I 'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord
Poor health meant Gen Pinochet never faced trial over rights abuses
The main monument , for which plans have been put to parliament for approval , would be in the capital , Santiago .
BBC correspondents say the government is unlikely to pass the bill .
Thousands died during Gen Pinochet 's 17 - year rule and he was accused of rights abuses .
But his supporters believe he put Chile on to a path of strong economic growth .
According to the bill presented by politician Ivan Moreira and others , the principal monument to Gen Pinochet would be built outside Chile 's presidential palace , La Moneda .
It would stand in the same square as a monument to Salvador Allende , the elected president overthrown in Gen Pinochet 's 1973 coup .
The other two monuments proposed would be in the northern city of Iquique and in Gen Pinochet 's birthplace , Valparaiso .
Protests
Mr Moreira , a Pinochet loyalist , told reporters that if Mr Allende had a monument to him , then so should Gen Pinochet .
Gen Pinochet 's death generated conflicting emotions in Chile
He said Gen Pinochet , who died on 10 December aged 91 , had saved Chile from Marxism and was a major figure in the country 's history .
As many as 60,000 people are estimated to have filed past his open coffin before his military funeral a week ago .
But at the same time , several thousand anti-Pinochet protesters took part in demonstrations outside the presidential palace .
On Monday , a local council in the Las Condes district of Santiago - where Gen Pinochet lived while in power - approved a proposal for a street , square or public space to be named after him .
Chile 's President Michelle Bachelet , who leads the governing centre - left coalition , currently lives in Las Condes .
More than 3,000 people were killed or " disappeared " during Gen Pinochet 's rule .
Nixie Clock Gallery
A collection of nixie clocks , based both on my design and many others .
If you 've come to this page from a web search or link and do n't have a clue what a nixie tube is , Go here for more info !
If you have built a nixie clock , send me a picture !
Also check out Westdave 's huge nixie clock collection .
Tom McNally 's page .
and Claus - Dieter Urbach 's site .
Also see Guy Marsden 's electronic art page .
Want to buy a nixie clock ?
try Cosmodog wps Cathode Corner for ready - made ones or kits .
Note : I get a lot of submissions for this page .
Sometimes I 'm too busy to deal with them so they go in a pile for a while to be looked at later .
Now that so many people are making clocks ,
Only particularly well - made or unusual ones get added here .
From David Saunders - uses neon ring counters , no ICs !
Youtube video From Michael Barile From Nick Romano :
The basis for this was the Z570M - 1 - V1 nixie clock kit designed by Frank Bemelman .
I purchased the kit from Frank Techniek , substituted 1/2 " glass beads for the tube standoffs .
This looks better and greatly increased the luminescence off the center blue LED .
All screws , switch components , standoffs etc of the case are hand made .
The glass dome is made from a small light bulb with the brass base cut off .
The clock is set by the push button to the left and will keep time without power for more than a week using a super cap for backup .
From Laurence Wilkins From David Teale ( USA ? )
From Rolf Dubbeld ( The Netherlands ) From Dieter Laues ( Germany ) : Hello
Mike , inspired from your famous nixie clock gallery , I build a nixieclock for myself , called " RTC1 " , the " Real Tube Clock No.1 " .
The housing of the clock has the design of a very big tube - maybe the biggest tube in the world .
And the Nixies are tubes in the tube ...
Inside the round " socket " there is the main - transformer .
The tube - contacts are fixed in a transparent acryl - plate .
The electronic - parts are divided into 3 round pcbs : in the bottom the microcontroller with voltage - regulator , in the middle the nixies with her driver ( 74141 ) , and on the top the high - voltage - generator .
From Dean Mansfield ( UK ) From John Smout ( UK ) : I used some half silvered glass in front and a mirror on the back to give an infinity effect .
This looks great when you move past the clock and see the parallax on the receding reflections .
Better in real life - it 's hard to photo .
I put the tubes on clear pedestals and these each have a neon inside that flicks across each second .
From Steve Brown ( UK )
The basis for this was the Cyclox II single - digit IN - 18 clock designed by Laurence Wilkins .
I bought a kit from Laurence with the original mahogany base ( pictures also attached ) and designed a new aluminium base for it , and added the spring - piston support rods .
99 % of the credit must go to Laurence - his original Cyclox is a beautifully conceived and designed piece of kit .
From René van den Endenafter ( Holland ) : having seen your website , I decided to build my own Nixie clock .
It has 12 nixie tubes and one dekatron .
Since I already had experience with the Intel 8048 microcontroller from the Philips Videopac game computer ( from 1980 ) , I 've used this microcontroller for my clock .
To display the time , I 've used the beautiful ZM 1040 tubes .
Features : subtle tick sound every second , cuckoo sound every hour , two buttons at the back to set the clock , a switch at the back to turn off the high voltage , dekatron is used during setting to indicate which digits are being set , nixie tube test mode , 1 Hz and 10 Hz pulse outputs .
Automatic features : fully automatic switch to and from daylight saving time , automatic adjustment of the number of days of February during a leap year , automatic brightness control with photo - diode ( manual setting also possible ) , automatic calculation of the day of the week ( 7 neon bulbs ) , automatic switch off of the sound effects during the night .
From Jouhn Carpenter ( USA ) : I built it to look like candles using Russian IN - 14 tubes .
I used Honda PCV valve grommets to hold tubes in place .
It flashes Hours , then Minutes , and then pauses using chip by Ivan Siy. From Joseph Strelchuk ( USA ) :
The clock is made using Burroughs B -5092 tubes , the housing is made from solid red oak .
From Leigh Aitken ( Australia ) This clock is CNC machined out of solid redgum on our home - made CNC router .
It uses 4 IN8 - 2 Russian nixie tubes and generates the high voltage onboard using a switch mode converter .
The bottom plate is machined from brass plate .
More information is available at www.cnccreations.com.au.
From Colin Arrowsmith Constructed in industrial Bakelite pulse clock cases , with 60 neon lamps around the periphery , displaying seconds .
These are multiplexed , using 22 NPN and 6 PNP transistors , in groups of 6 x 10 seconds which are fed from the outputs of the seconds and 10s of seconds 4017 dividers .
From Morris Odell ( Melbourne , Australia ) :
Here are some pics of my electromechanical nixie clock .
The timebase uses two vacuum tubes , a dekatron and a thyratron to pulse a relay at 1 Hz , derived from the 50 hz mains frequency .
This steps the uniselectors which control six ZM1040 nixies .
A blue LED flashes with each " kerchunk " to remind us of what will happen if someone touches the high voltage terminal :-)
From Matt Cass ( Australia ) : I did not use any integrated circuits in the design .
I designed it myself from shift registers , it has 171 transistors and 110 silicon diodes .
It keeps good time on 50 cycles mains 24 hours clock and is easy to set .
Ronald Dekker , Henk , Jacco , Eugene ( Holland )
From Markus Siegenthaler and Niklaus Burren ( Switzerland )
We are students at the University of Applied Sciences HTI in Burgdorf . in Switzerland .
This term we had to design an electrical device in a project work .
We decided to build a radio controlled clock ( from DCF77 Atomic - Clock Frankfurt / Germany ) .
But we wanted to have a special display for our clock .
So we choose the Russian nixie - tube IN - 18 .
We implemented the tube supply with a step up converter ( MC34063 ) which converts a 12V DC voltage to a 160V DC voltage .
So you can use a normal ac adapter ( 12V DC , 1A ) to supply our clock .
The radio controlled clock is realized with the PIC microcontroller PIC16F877 from Microchip .
The clock shows the time and the date , when you press the date button .
It is also possible to set the clock manually for the case that you have no radio contact .
For the chassis we used perspex and wood of a nut - tree .
From Jeff Thomas
" I used part of your pcb as the heart of a clock that I made six copies of as gifts to my relatives .
I had a herd of NL - 84X type nixies , but they would n't mount directly to your pcb design .
I sawed off the driver and tube portions of the board , and fabbed a bunch of replacement driver pcb's that included sockets for seconds output .
That pcb is connected to your design via a simple header and some ribbon cable to support the seconds output .
The base is walnut , and the cover is made of five leaded crystal panels glued together with a special UV curing glass adhesive . "
From Gerrit Gerritsen and Wim Wevers . ( Switzerland )
The nixies used are Siemens ZM1040 , from an old milling machine .
The clock is connected to the Frankfurt Radio Time Signal .
Behind the round lens you can see the " caesium source " lighting up bluish ..
Because there was plenty memory available we can show : hours and minutes .
seconds , year , software version , software issue date , time signal decoding
And there was still memory left so we can also show pi up to 18000 decimals .
You choose with the bakelite selector switches .
Old voltmeter indicates kW and shows seconds ...
The wood is cherry wood .
From Robin Oudhaarlem ( Holland )
Here is a picture of a nixie clock I build about ten years ago .
As applies for most nowadays nixie clocks , this one has a microprocessor inside too .
I used a 8051 without battery backed up RTC .
The old Matsushita CD72 nixies are from an old desktop calculator .
From Tim O'Brien ( New Zealand )
The heart is an Atmel 161 processor with RTC .
Drive is non-multiplexed switching of half wave rectified mains .
The nixies are of unknown type , possibly computer origin .
Glass only envelope with 17 pin base , dual anodes .
1.25 " dia .
Colon is two 5 mm dia .
neons .
Case is Perspex .
Clock functions are 12 /24 hour clock and stop watch ( minutes and seconds ) .
Inspired by IEEE Spectrum article .
From Katsushi Matsubayashi ( Japan ) .
The nixie tube I used is NEC LD - 955A .
My nixie clock is controlled by H8 microcomputer .
H8 CPU receives clock data from GPS receiver , namely SONY IPS - 5000 ; therefore , my clock is always correct .
In addition , by pushing push switches , my nixie clock can show date , longitude , latitude , altitude , speed , bearing and the number of satellite that GPS receiver is using for calculation .
From Tom Struzik ( USA )
I wanted to keep with the ' old future ' look .
clock body is an old Seth Thomas that I found on e-bay for $ 30 ! , innards replaced with microprocessor and circuit to drive the nixie tubes .
It also 's got an electronic chime simulating the original ringer in the clock actually a voice recorder chip with 60 seconds of sound recording into which I recorded chime sounds I found on the web .
sounds like the real thing .
With the microprocessor control the clock can be configured to display 12 / 24 hr time , date / time , time only , and the chime can be programmed to only play during certain hours so as to not wake up the whole house .
From Steven Rougier ( UK ) I used STC GNP - 7 nixie tubes .
The case is made from hardwood moulding with mitred corners and a sheet of clear acrylic for the front panel and takes advantage of the low - profile transformerless design .
From Bill Richards ( USA ) I designed this clock to bring together the wonderful old nixies and today 's surface mount components .
The cathodes of the four Philips ZM1040 nixie tubes are driven by MPSA42 transistors each connected to an output of a PIC16F871 .
Power is provided by a 12 volt dc wall transformer .
The tube high voltage is derived from the 12 volts using the MAX1771 circuit by Chris Barron ( thanks Chris ! ) .
The base , machined from aluminum , is 3 " x 7 " x 0.67 " and has a clear plastic cover over the pc board .
Electromechanical time / date nixie clock from Geoff Tomlin ( UK ) , built in 1969 .
The only semiconductors used are diodes !
Time is counted by a synchronous motor and series of gears , operating rotary switches .
Day is counted by a uniselector driving a diode matrix decoder for the day nixies .
Month is counted by a uniselector driving the month wheel , and another uniselector is used to determine the number of days in the month .
A modified impulse counter is used for the year .
12/24 hour display selectable via rotary switch top - left .
Left picture - Top view .
Time gears on left , diode matrix deciders on brown tagboards centre .
Days - in - month decoding uniselector bottom centre .
Right picture - Bottom view : From top - left : Month uniselector and display wheel , Centre : Synchronous motor and gearbox ( white circle ) , to the right ofg this is the minutes rotary switch , with the 10 mins switch above it , and 24 - way hours switch to the right .
Year counter is top - right .
From Jeff
Thomas
I had an idea to build a nixie project as small as I possibly could ; using standardized components .
The final design was so small , I was able to enclose it in an injection - molded transparent case ; complete with a wrist band !
The outside case dimensions are 2.75 " L x 1.5 " W x 1.13 " H Standard surface mount CMOS counter logic , and HV driver transistors are copied from your Nixie Clock design .
The reference is divided from a 32 khz crystal .
Nixie tube drive of 240v is generated by a trigger coil running from a 1.5v AA battery .
Pushing a button in front of the colon indicator illuminates the nixies .
Two lithium coin cells power the logic section .
From Ryan Kerr ( USA ) :
I completed a clock based on your schematic , and it has kept perfect time since .
I bought the four Hivac XN11 tubes on e-bay from Nic Wilsher and used 220 K resistors .
That 's bigger than your reco of 100 K ( for US 120VAC ) , but I could n't see any visual difference and hopefully it'll make the tubes last longer .
I used bi-color red / green leds for the flashing colon ( so instead of on / off I have red / green ) .
The dispenser part still works , but it can't hold as many M&Ms because I had to run all the wires through the candy holding section .
The circuit board is mounted to the back and covered by a plastic tupperware dish .
The two time - set buttons are on the side of the Lay - Z - Boy chair .
From Gerhard Scholz ( Germany ) :
The housing is nickel plated steel ( originally designed for transformers for light systems ) .
The Nixies are ZM 1210 .
The electronic part was derived from the suggestions at your web site .
It was a little bit tricky to get the complete electronic into the vaulted housing .
It ended up in 5 PCB´s ( power supply , switches for setting , nixies , driver stage and the clock itself ) .
Three of the PCB´s are stacked to use the limited space and to bring the Nixies in place .
The stacked PCB´s are connected with inline connectors , so every module can be easily changed for future improvements .
From Roel Klijzing ( Holland ) From Guido Mennen ( Holland ) : I came across some plexiglass tube and I just had to build a nixieclock in it .
The first idea was to use topview nixie tubes and build the whole clock inside the tube but I could n't get it to fit .
So I used ZM1000 E nixies from Telefunken .
I think it 's a replacement tube for ZM1000 nixies , the tube is placed on a piece of printed circuit board which has pins soldered onto it which match the pinout of the ZM1000 .
The digits are larger then the ZM1000 .
the original markings are removed but there are some left on the nixie ( in blue ink ) but not enough to identify the original tube .
From Darren Coe ( UK ) I used your circuit a a base but used a plug top 9v transformer and a small 3 va for step up .
I also used a 32 khz xtal for a timebase .
A wet cap keeps it running for 10 mins without mains .
The nixies came out of a fluke DVM got from work .
The neon BC bulb used for seconds came out of an electric fence machine many years ago .
From Jürgen ( Germany ) From Guido Mennen ( Holland ) From Chris Barron ( UK )
I created this clock for a friend who had just got a new PC .
The tubes are B5991's and the display is dual - rail multiplexed ( 2 tubes on at a time ) .
They mount straight into D - Sub pins fitted into drilled holes in the mahogany front panel .
Controlled by a PIC16F84 and anode switching is by 3 TLP627 optoisolators .
All power comes from the PC's 12V supply and a MAX771 circuit provides the HV .
The battery backup system is made up of 4 AA size rechargeable nicads which keeps the timekeeping side of things working when the PC is switched off .
New version using different coloured LEDs behind each tube , which are
PWM'd at varying rates to create a different and smoothly changing coloured backlight .
These LED 's do a good job of lighting the base of side viewed tubes as well .
From Gerald Talmage ( USA ) :
Nixie clock built into empty ordinary household light bulbs
If you look at the unit hours bulb the number that is displayed is a ' 8 ' it 's hard to see due to the color of the bulb which was a dark green party bulb , this has since been corrected by using a lighter blue bulb .
From Laszlo Gaspar ( UK )
This clock uses the flat top National NL - 5440A tubes , controlled by a PIC16F84A microcontroller via CD4017 counters and the usual MPSA42 driver transistors .
The timebase is derived from a 32.768 kHz crystal .
The high voltage for the display tubes is generated by a boost regulator , based on an MC34063 PWM controller .
From Bob Tavener , the case is Ferrero Rocher chocolate box sprayed on the inside
From Tatsuya Takimoto ( Japan ) Robert G. Schaffrath ( N2JTX ) B-7971
Nixie clock that I built back in 1979 when I was a senior in High School .
The circuit is based on a schematic that had been provided by the surplus parts vendor along with the three stock exchange ticker display cards that the tubes and sockets came from .
The ticker card also had some high voltage switching transistors that were used in the construction of the clock .
The clock uses a National Semiconductor MM5311 clock chip and uses the 60 Hz line frequency as its time base .
Unfortunately , the original circuit was a very poor transformerless design and blew several capacitors , resistors and Zener diodes during its initial test run ( it was spectacular ! ) .
I wound up making my own design changes , including adding a transformer , and it has worked fine ever since .
Over the years , I have replaced some parts with newer smaller components but it still uses the original clock chip and high voltage transistors that came from the stock exchange display card .
Back in 1979 , I was a cash strapped student and did not have the money to purchase the best parts except for a rather hard to find 160V / 10 W
Zener diode that I obtained surplus .
I designed the PC board and wooden stand myself .
I currently have eight spare brand new B -7971 tubes that I purchased 15 years ago .
However , after almost 20 years of continuous operation ( the clock took a break when I was away at college ) , the original tubes are still working fine .
From : Simon Kainz
I just finished my 1st Nixie clock .
I used 4 Rodan Elfin MG - 17 F which are 7 segment display tubes .
They are about 4 cm tall , the digits display themselfes are about 1,8 cm .
The whole thing is powered by an 8051 running at 4 Mhz .
I also planned to use a receiver to sync the clock to atomic time , but there is not enough space inside the case and also the power supply is generating too much noise ...

From Antti Panula ( Finland ) :
With Mike 's instructions I managed to build my own clock .
The Burroughs B - 5560 tubes are assembled to a separate adapter board , because they are mounted " upside down " .
These tubes were removed from an old HP counter .
The second indicators are two orange glow lamps and are perfect match to the tubes ' glow .
The clock 's dimensions are 100x100x50 mm .
From Bert van Rijn ( Holland ) , using large Z586 M tubes From Hannes Nordmann ( Germany ) From Julio Vilarrubi ( Spain )
From Rob Cameron ( UK )
The clock is synchronised to the 60 kHz MSF transmission from Rugby .
The MSF receiver is a ready built module made by Galleon Systems and outputs raw MSF data .
This is decoded by a PIC16F870 microcontroller running at 3.2768MHz .
This clock frequency allows the PIC to keep time in the absence of the MSF signal .
The 28 pin PIC feeds six 74141 nixie drivers directly , with no multiplexing ( to reduce RFI ) .
The clock runs from a 12V AC power adapter , which is stepped up to provide an isolated 200V DC supply for the Hivac XN3 nixies .
The clock is housed in a Vero case 180 x 120 x 60 mm with a neutral density filter at the front .
There is a switch on the back panel allowing the display of hh : mm:ss or dd : mm:yy .
From Russell Lait This has six National NL6422/5991 tubes .
It is built into a modified cherry wood picture frame from Habitat .
I replaced the glass with clear acrylic , sprayed black on the back .
From Jeff Kowalski
The clock circuitry is a simple hard - wired design deriving the time base from line power , fed through TTL counters .
Burroughs top- reading Nixies are driven using 7441's .
Power circuitry is point - to - point ; the logic board is wire - wrapped .
The enclosure is pear wood with brushed and mirrored aluminum plate .
The 12 - hour clock operates in two modes : " run " and " set " , with an accompanying clock - rate - adjustment useful for rapidly advancing the counters to the correct time .
From Hans Summers , using large Z856 nixies .
I built a base for the clock from pine wood glued together .
The seconds , minutes and hours digit pairs are built in separate sections each screwed to wood supports .
I put red felt on the feet ( similar to snooker table material ) .
I obtained glass sheets for the cabinet from a local glass shop and glued them with silicone glass adhesive ( this is VERY messy ) .
The front panel is bezelled .
I did n't use a PCB , I built in my customary construction style on plain matrix board .
Like you , to set the time I used reed switches mounted in front of the digit pairs for fast forward , slow forward and seconds freeze .
In the wooden base are two flat - headed screws which a small bar magnet sticks to ready for use when needed .
Fron Chris Barron
It uses a pic16 f84 to provide the clock generation signal and register loading for each tube .
Its multiplexed and only uses 2 other chips , a 74ls138
and a 74141 , as well as 12 MPSA - 42 transistors .
It has a switchable 12 / 24 hour display , switchable ' on the run ' , has lead digit blanking in 12 hr mode and performs a left to right sweep - fadeout for the last 6 seconds of every hour .
There was just enough memory left on the chip to write a little lottery number generator too .
From Notker Christoffel ( Germany ) From Marco Hirter ( Switzerland ) From Stefan Westermann ( Germany ) From Gary Bleads ( UK ) ( above )
After some time considering various nixie clock designs , I decided it would be fun to experiment with my own .
I decided I wanted 6 - digits ( the nixies look more interesting if they are moving forwards and back every second ) , and I needed an alarm so I could use it as my bedroom clock .
To reduce the number of components , I decided to use a PIC16F84 microcontroler for all the timing and alarm .
The power supply uses a 3VA 2x18 v mini - torroid transformer , with one winding for the 5 volt logic power supply , and both windings in series , feeding a capacitor / diode voltage tripler to give 190V DC at 10 mA .
The timing is by the PIC counting cycles of the 50 Hz mains .
It has a serial output to 6 x CD4094B 8 - bit shift registers , which drive the segments of the Nixies tubes via 45 MPSA42 high - voltage transistors .
The microprocessor also provides the " bells and whistles " - in this case a gentle tick sound , quarter - hourly chimes ( automatically disabled at night ) , and a daily alarm ( I 'm still experimenting with different alarm sounds - at the moment it sends my ham - radio callsign in Morse code ) From Phil Downen ( USA ) I used an Intel 8751 microcontroller with assembly language internal workings .
I was lucky enough to find old Signetics BCD decoder / driver chips ( N8T01B ) to drive the Nixie Tubes ; 1 for each digit .
The Nixie Tubes themselves are " National Electronics Inc. NL840s " which I found at a garage sale in middle Missouri .
The grid on each tube is driven to +170 volts DC , which is conveniently derived from our North American line voltage ( 120 VAC - 170 peak ) via a full - wave rectifier circuit and filter cap .
Each N8T01B ( six total ) decodes a 4 - bit number from the 8751 parallel port and converts it into a 0~9 digit selection .
This selection takes place via a grounded open collector output ( 1 of 10 ) which are wired to the 10 wire numerals within a tube .
This is a non-multiplexed design .
The time base is derived from our 60 Hz line frequency and serves a 1
Hz interrupt to the microcontroller which increments the time count .
This is very reliable over the long haul since many of the clocks in the US use synchronous 60 Hz motors and rely upon the power companies maintaining proper count of the cycles , again over the long haul .
From Peter H. Wendt ( Germany )
The most odd thing I ''d done and just finished yesterday ( except for building an appropriate case ) is a " Nixiefied " 1979 radio alarmclock .
After fiddling around with the Nixies I found the LED 7 - segments a bit too boring ....
Now it got 4 Hivac GR10M / U 15 mm top viewed Nixies , using four 27C256 Eproms I 'd abused for that purpose .

These pics are of a clock that still works that I built in early 1970 !.
That was when the TTL IC 's were about $ 10 ea . !
I used a NASA surplus 2.048000
Mhz oscillator and it's precision power supply and divided it to 1 hz ( with taps at 10 khz , 100hz and 4 hz and a hold switch to set it .
I calibrated it with an old Beckman counter , whose time base I beat to WWV and it was off about 2 sec / month .
I tweaked it and over the next 10 months got it to less than 1 sec per month error with WWV time .
I used Nicads to back up the PS .
It was a very fun project !
I recently checked the osc. with my HP5328A high stability counter and they agreed to more than 9 places !

I have build two of these nixie clocks , one for my brother and one for myself .
I was surprised when I found out from this site that other people have also build nixie clocks and that the design of Peter van der Jagt 's is lookalike .
The heart of my clock is FPGA from Altera and type of nixies are CD81 from Hitachi .

The clock design is fairly simple - a microcontroller talking to a handful of serial -> parallel shift registers which drive MPSA42 transistors for the Dekatron guides and 74141's for the Nixies .
The time base is supplied by a 1 Mhz oscillator divided down to 100 Hz with 4017s .
The switches allow for 12 /24 hour operation , daylight savings time and setting both the time and a time correction delta to be applied every 1000 minutes to compensate for crystal error .
I 've also got battery backup in there .

From Michael Stevenson ( UK ) From Matt Fitz - Gibbon ( UK ) From Mark Cumpstey ( UK ) From Kurt Vogel From Robert Hansen
The tubes are Z568M ; 50 mm ( 1.97 " ) digits .
A Microchip PIC16C84 keeps the time , using the power line as a timing reference .
It sends BCD data out to a series of shift registers ( 74HC595 ) , which in turn send their parallel output to the 7441 decoder / drivers ' inputs .
I thought about a multiplex arrangement , but in that mode , these tubes would require more current than a 7441 could handle :
The tubes are running on 3 mA , four tubes multiplexed would require about 12 mA , but the 7441 has a maximum of 7 mA .
The sets of transistors ( MPSA42 and MPSA92 ) switch the plate supply to each tube ( also controlled by ' HC595 outputs ) , to facilitate leading - zero blanking of the hours count .
Also , when setting the time , they flash the digit being adjusted ; essentially a cursor .

Steve Friedl 's Unixwiz.net Tech Tips An Illustrated Guide to Cryptographic Hashes
With the recent news of weaknesses in some common security algorithms ( MD4 , MD5 , SHA - 0 ) , many are wondering exactly what these things are :
They form the underpinning of much of our electronic infrastructure , and in this Guide we 'll try to give an overview of what they are and how to understand them in the context of the recent developments .
But note : though we 're fairly strong on security issues , we are not crypto experts .
We 've done our best to assemble ( digest ? ) the best available information into this Guide , but we welcome being pointed to the errors of our ways .
What is a cryptographic hash ?
A " hash " ( also called a " digest " , and informally a " checksum " ) is a kind of " signature " for a stream of data that represents the contents .
The closest real - life analog we can think is " a tamper - evident seal on a software package " : if you open the box ( change the file ) , it 's detected .
Let 's first see some examples of hashes at work .
Many Unix and Linux systems provide the md5sum program , which reads a stream of data and produces a fixed , 128 - bit number that summarizes that stream using the popular " MD5 " method .
Here , the " streams of data " are " files " ( two of which we see directly , plus one that 's too large to display ) .
$ cat smallfile
This is a very small file with a few characters $ cat bigfile
This is a larger file that contains more characters .
This demonstrates that no matter how big the input stream is , the generated hash is the same size ( but of course , not the same value ) .
If two files have a different hash , they surely contain different data .
$ ls -l empty - file smallfile bigfile linux - kernel - rw - rw - r-- 1 steve steve 0 2004-08-20 08:58 empty - file - rw-rw-r-- 1 steve steve 48 2004-08-20 08:48 smallfile -rw-rw-r-- 1 steve steve 260 2004-08-20 08:48 bigfile -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1122363 2003-02-27 07:12 linux - kernel $ md5 sum empty - file smallfile bigfile linux - kernel d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e empty - file 75cdbfeb70a06d42210938da88c42991 smallfile 6e0b7a1676ec0279139b3f39bd65e41a bigfile c74c812e4d2839fa9acf0aa0c915e022 linux - kernel
This shows that all input streams yield hashes of the same length , and to experiment , try changing just one character of a small test file .
You 'll find that even very small changes to the input yields sweeping changes in the value of the hash , and this is known as the avalanche effect .
The avalanche effect can be best seen by hashing two files with nearly identical content .
We 've changed the first character of a file from T to t , and when looking at the binary values for these ASCII characters , we see that they differ by just one bit :
T -> 0x54 -> 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 t -> 0x74 -> 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0
This single bit of change in the input produces a very large change in the output :
$ cat file1 T his is a very small file with a few characters $ cat file2 t his is a very small file with a few characters $ md5 sum file ?
75cdbfeb70a06d42210938da88c42991 file1 6fbe37f1eea0f802bd792ea885cd03e2 file2
Expanding the hex to binary ( in 32 - bit chunks to avoid really long lines ) , we can see that our one bit of input change produced 50 different output bits , about 39 % :
First 32 bits 0111 0101 1100 1101 1011 1111 1110 1011 75cdbfeb file1 0110 1111 1011 1110 0011 0111 1111 0001 6 fbe37f1 file2 ...X X.X. .XXX .. XX X ... X... ...X X.X. 13 bits different Second 32 bits 0111 0000 1010 0000 0110 1101 0100 0010 70a06d42 file1 1110 1110 1010 0000 1111 1000 0000 0010 eea0f802 file2 X..X XXX . .... .... X..X .X.X .X.. .... 10 bits different Third 32 bits 0010 0001 0000 1001 0011 1000 1101 1010 210938 da file1 1011 1101 0111 1001 0010 1110 1010 1000 bd792ea8 file2 X..X XX .. .XXX .... ... X .XX. .XXX ..X. 14 bits different Fourth 32 bits 1000 1000 1100 0100 0010 1001 1001 0001 88c42991 file1 1000 0101 1100 1101 0000 0011 1110 0010 85cd03e2 file2 .... XX .X .... X..X ..X. X.X. .XXX .. XX 13 bits different
But even though the value of the hash changes , its size does not .
Hashes are " digests " , not " encryption "
This is a common confusion , especially because all these words are in the category of " cryptography " , but it 's important to understand the difference .
Encryption transforms data from a cleartext to ciphertext and back ( given the right keys ) , and the two texts should roughly correspond to each other in size : big cleartext yields big ciphertext , and so on .
" Encryption " is a two - way operation .
Hashes , on the other hand , compile a stream of data into a small digest ( a summarized form : think " Reader 's Digest " ) , and it 's strictly a one way operation .
All hashes of the same type - this example shows the " MD5 " variety - have the same size no matter how big the inputs are :
" Encryption " is an obvious target for attack ( e.g. , " try to read the encrypted text without the key " ) , but even the one - way nature of hashes admits of more subtle attacks .
We 'll cover them shortly , but first we must see for what purposes hashes are commonly used .
We 'll note here that though hashes and digests are often informally called " checksums " , they really are n't .
True checksums , such as a Cyclic Redundancy Check are designed to catch data - transmission errors and not deliberate attempts at tampering with data .
Aside of the small output space ( usually 32 bits ) , they are not designed with the same properties in mind .
We wo n't mention true checksums again .
How are hashes used ?
There are quite a few uses for hashes , and we 'll mention them here so we have something to build on when we try to subvert them for evil purposes , and to see the ramifications of the recent developments .
Verifying file integrity
The most obvious use is " verifying file integrity " .
If you have just downloaded a large piece of software from a website , how do you know that you 've received it correctly and that it has not been tampered with ?
One way is to download the file again and compare the bits : if the bits are the same , you 're probably ok , but if they 're different , which ones are the right bits ?
Finding out means yet another download with compare , and this gets very tedious very quickly .
Instead , if the website publishes the hash values of its download bundles , you can check it yourself .
For instance , the ProFTPD project ( an excellent open source FTP server ) publishes their hashes :
Now it 's just a matter of running the md5sum command on the file you downloaded and comparing it with the published values .
Important !
When considering hash values , close does not count !
If the hashes being compared differ in any way , even by just a single bit , the data being digested is not the same !
There is no equivalent of " roundoff error " or " almost " in cryptographic hashes .
Hashing passwords
A second example that 's very common - but less obvious - is the hashing of access passwords , and we 'll reiterate that " hashing is not encryption " .
It 's a bad idea for computer systems to store passwords in cleartext ( in their original form ) , because if the bad guy can somehow get to where they 're stored , he gets all the passwords .
Knowing how many people foolishly use one password at multiple sites , getting a stash from one system may give access to others .
A more secure way is to store a hash of the password , rather than the password itself .
Since these hashes are not reversible , there is no way to find out for sure " what password produced this hash ? " - and the so consequence of a compromise is much lower .
Now we have squirreled away the password into a safe place , but since this is a one - way function , how will we know that some future user at a login prompt gives us the same password ?
The answer is simple : we take the proposed password -- in cleartext -- run it through the same hash function , and see whether this result matches the hash we 've saved in the password store .
If they match , the user must have known the proper password , so access is granted , but if the hashes are not identical , access is denied .
Note - in practice there is usually an additional wrinkle to hashed passwords : the introduction of what 's known as a salt .
This is a random bit of text added to the cleartext passwords before running through the hash function , and in the examples above , the salt is between the $ signs .
This step improves the security of the stored hash , but we 're not going to elaborate on this step in this document .
Digitally Signed Documents
This is quite a bit more complicated , and we 're going to gloss over the details of this subject , covering only enough to show the role of cryptographic hashes .
David Youd has written an excellent Introduction to Digital Signatures that covers this in much more detail .
Loosely speaking , " signing " a document electronically is the digital equivalent of placing an autograph on paper , and our discussion revolves around how the signature is represented .
How does one know that this digital signature applies to this document ?
The answer : one signs ( encrypts with one 's private key ) the hash of the document , the result of which is a digital signature .
The process is shown here :
At some later date , we can prove that you signed the document by decrypting the signature with your public key , which yields the hash , and showing that the document 's hash matches the signed one .
We 'll see later how a weakness in the hash function could lead to shenanigans .
But what about collisions ?
The thoughtful reader may wonder how this could work : if it 's possible to uniquely represent every possible stream of data in 128 bits - that 's 16 bytes -- then why would one ever need a file larger than that ?
If this is n't the case , then it seems obvious that many input streams are available that can produce any given hash .
When different chunks of data produce the same hash value , this is known as a collision , and it follows from the previous paragraph that they inherently must exist :
If so , this seems to undermine the whole premise of cryptographic hashes until one learns that for industrial - strength hashes like MD5 , nobody has found a collision yet ( well , almost nobody , but we 're getting to that ) .
This astonishing fact is due to the astonishingly large number of possible hashes available : a 128 - bit hash can have 3.4 x 1038 possible values , which is :
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible hashes
If the hash algorithm is properly designed and distributes the hashes uniformly over the output space , " finding a hash collision " by random guessing is exceedingly unlikely ( it 's more likely that a million people will correctly guess all the California Lottery numbers every day for a billion trillion years ) .
Other hashes have even more bits : the SHA - 1 algorithm generates 160 bits , whose output space is four billions times larger than that produced by MD5 's 128 bits .
What 's inside a cryptographic hash ?
The first answer is " it depends on the kind of hash " , but the second answer usually starts with " a lot of math " .
A colloquial explanation is that all the bits are poured into a pot and stirred briskly , and this is about as technical we care to delve into here .
There are plenty of resources that show the internal workings of a hash algorithm , almost all of which involve lots of shifting and rotating through multiple " rounds " .
A good explanation for the SHA - 1 algorithm ( a popular one ) can be found at Wikipedia by clicking on this image :
Illustration courtesy Wikipedia
Fig. 8 - One iteration within the SHA - 1 compression function .
A , B , C , D and E are 32 - bit words of the state ;
F is a nonlinear function that varies ;
<<< denotes left circular shift .
K t is a constant .
Though we 're not going to elaborate on the internals , it does seem appropriate to mention some of the popular hash algorithms :
MD4 ( 128 bits , obsolete )
MD5 ( 128 bits )
RIPEMD -160 ( 160 bits )
SHA - 1 ( 160 bits )
SHA - 256 , SHA - 384 , and SHA - 512 ( longer versions of SHA - 1 , with slightly different designs )
Each has its own advantages in terms of performance , several variations of collision resistance , how well its security has been studied professionally , and so on .
" Picking a good hash algorithm " is beyond the scope of this Tech Tip .
" Collision resistance " in more detail
As we 've mentioned several times , " collisions " play a central role in the usefulness of a cryptographic hash , mainly in the sense that the easier it is to find a collision , the less useful the hash is .
Some algorithms are better than others at avoiding collisions , and this is measured by three related attributes .
Collision Resistance measures how difficult it is to pick two inputs that produce the same hash value .
We manufacture both of the inputs in an attempt to coax the same hash value from each , and we do n't care what the particular hash value generated is ( just that they both match ) .
Exploiting weak collision resistance :
If we are able to create two inputs that generate the same hash , digital signature become suspect .
In our example above , the document signed was " a promise to pay " , and being able to substitute one signed document for another would certainly lead to havoc :
As an aside , it 's been recommended to always make a cosmetic change to any document you sign : if the person giving you the document secretly has a hash - equivalent pair , your small change - even a byte or two - will render the " other " file useless .
Preimage Resistance measures how difficult it is to concoct an input which hashes to a particular value .
Exploiting weak preimage resistance :
If we are able to " work backwards " from a hash and create some text that produces the same hash , we can use this to beat hashed passwords .
We wo n't ever know the actual input data that was used , but that does n't matter .
Looking at the flow for validating against hashed passwords , all that matters is that the hashes match , not the passwords , so if we can find any other text that produces the stored hash , we 'll be granted access .
" Collisions " mean " more than one password will be accepted " .
Second Preimage Resistance measures how difficult it is to concoct an input which hashes to the same value that some other given input hashes to .
This seems like a somewhat easier case of the previous item : the goal is to produce a new input that generates the given hash , but this time we know the original text that created it .
We 're not entirely clear just how much help this extra knowledge is .
Exploiting second weak preimage resistance :
As with preimage resistance , we want to fool somebody into authenticating our data as genuine , and we'd most likely use this when trying to introduce a corrupted software distribution .
Earlier we saw that ProFTPD ( and many other organizations ) publishes software and matching md5 checksums , and if we are able to maliciously modify the source code but nevertheless keep the same checksum , downloaders around the globe will accept our badware as genuine .
So what 's the big news ?
Some very bright researchers in China presented a paper , Collisions for Hash Functions MD4 , MD5 , HAVAL - 128 and RIPEMD , at the Crypto 2004 conference in August 2004 , and it 's shaken up the security world considerably .
This was some outstanding cryptography research .
They have found ways to reliably generate collisions in four hash functions much faster than brute - force time , and in one case ( MD4 , which is admittedly obsolete ) , with a hand calculation .
This has been a stunning development .
These are all of the " we control both inputs " type - the first of our three kinds of collisions - and it holds the most promise in the compromise of digital signatures where the bad guy can create two contradictory documents and pull a switcheroo later .
We 've heard there are already tools emerging that can reliably generate collision - pairs in " reasonable " amounts of CPU time , and with just a bit of searching found one example for MD5 :
This can be checked with this small perl program that was posted on Edward Felton 's weblog by Greg Buchholz ( origin unknown ) :
#!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict ; my $ v1=<< END_V1 ; d1 31 dd 02 c5 e6 ee c4 69 3d 9a 06 98 af f9 5 c 2f ca b5 87 12 46 7e ab 40 04 58 3e b8 fb 7f 89 55 ad 34 06 09 f4 b3 02 83 e4 88 83 25 71 41 5a 08 51 25 e8 f7 cd c9 9f d9 1d bd f2 80 37 3c 5 b d8 82 3e 31 56 34 8f 5 b ae 6d ac d4 36 c9 19 c6 dd 53 e2 b4 87 da 03 fd 02 39 63 06 d2 48 cd a0 e9 9f 33 42 0f 57 7e e8 ce 54 b6 70 80 a8 0d 1e c6 98 21 bc b6 a8 83 93 96 f9 65 2 b 6 f f7 2a 70 END_V1 my $ v2=<<END_V2 ; d1 31 dd 02 c5 e6 ee c4 69 3d 9a 06 98 af f9 5 c 2f ca b5 07 12 46 7e ab 40 04 58 3e b8 fb 7f 89 55 ad 34 06 09 f4 b3 02 83 e4 88 83 25 f1 41 5a 08 51 25 e8 f7 cd c9 9f d9 1d bd 72 80 37 3c 5 b d8 82 3e 31 56 34 8f 5 b ae 6d ac d4 36 c9 19 c6 dd 53 e2 34 87 da 03 fd 02 39 63 06 d2 48 cd a0 e9 9f 33 42 0f 57 7e e8 ce 54 b6 70 80 28 0d 1e c6 98 21 bc b6 a8 83 93 96 f9 65 ab 6 f f7 2a 70 END_V2 my $ p=join ( " " , map { chr ( hex ( $_ ) ) } split /\s+/ , $ v1 ) ; my $ q=join ( " " , map { chr ( hex ( $_ ) ) } split /\s+/ , $ v2 ) ; print `echo -n \'$ p\ '|md5sum` ; print `echo -n \'$ q\'|md5sum` ;
There is also a buzz about weaknesses in the SHA - 0 and SHA - 1 algorithms , but this is much more preliminary .
A researcher has managed to find a collision in SHA - 0 , which is not in such widespread use , and another has found a collision in " reduced SHA - 1 " .
A " reduced " algorithm typically eliminates some steps in the hashing process ( 40 rounds rather than 80 ) , and even though finding a collision in what amounts to 1 / 2 of SHA - 1 does n't have any immediate impact , it 's like a neon sign to the researchers saying " look here " .
There is no evidence that preimage resistance or second preimage resistance are at risk in any of the algorithms ( e.g. , if you have an existing hash , find an input that produces that hash ) , but many of the cryptorati believe that blood is in the water and the sharks are on their way .
Once a weakness in an algorithm has been identified - even if it 's theoretical or only on a reduced version - it's often the start of the whole thing unraveling .
What does this mean ?
In the short term , this will have only a limited impact on computer security .
The bad guys can't suddenly start tampering with software that can fool published checksums , and they can't suddenly start cracking hashed passwords .
Previously - signed digital signatures are just as secure as they were before , because one can't retroactively generate new documents to sign with your matched pair of inputs .
What it does mean , though , is that we 've got to start migrating to better hash functions .
Even though SHA - 1 has long been thought to be secure , NIST ( the National Institute of Standards and Technology ) has a standard for even longer hash functions which are named for the number of bits in their output : SHA - 224 , SHA - 256 , SHA - 384 , and SHA - 512 .
Five hundred twelve bits of hash holds 1.34 x 10154 possible values , which is far , far more than the number of hydrogen atoms in the universe [ ref ] .
This is likely to be safe from brute - force attacks for quite a while .
Other voices
As we conclude this Tech Tip , we remind the reader that we are not crypto experts , and have merely collected information from far and wide in a manner that we believe covers the topic with clarity and fidelity .
But we could be wrong , and in the case of predicting the future , probably are .
Those wishing the authoritative word on this are encouraged to legendary security expert Bruce Schneier , who has written an analysis that appeared in Computerworld :
Opinion : Cryptanalysis of MD5 and SHA : Time for a new standard
Crypto researchers report weaknesses in common hash functions
As his was an opinion piece and not a Tech Tip , he has n't covered the background , but his big - picture analysis are certainly much more likely to be correct than ours .
We also recommend Bruce 's monumental work Applied Cryptography , which has been the gold standard of crypto texts for some time .
We refer to this constantly when researching security issues and cannot recommend this book highly enough .
Professor Edward Felten wrote about this in his Freedom to Tinker weblog , and his is also an authoritative voice on the subject .

As they say , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
I ’ve gathered 10 cases of ultimate flattery in autos here , where the industrial design of one is blatantly copied onto another .
Here you go , the showdown of the look - alike cars ( and a bus ) :
1. Daewoo Matiz vs Chery QQ
This one was so extreme , some parts of one car fit into the other ( e.g. door panel , bonnet etc ) .
2. Vauxhall Frontera vs Landwind
3. Honda CRV vs Laibao SRV
Check out the semi-Audi front logo too !
4. Mercedes C vs Geely Merrie 300
The Geely was shown in an auto exhibition .
I do n’t think it was eventually produced looking like this though .
5. Neoplan Starliner vs Zonda A9
6. Rolls - Royce Phantom vs Hongqi HQD
7. Smart vs er. Chinese Smart
8. Toyota Prado vs Dadi Shuttle
9. Nissan XTrail vs Greatwall Sing
10 . BMW 7 vs BYD F6
For this , the copying is not so drastic except the lights , but it does get brownie points for imitating the badge as well .
11 . Bonus ! Toyota Logo vs Geely Logo
Toyota sued and won though .
The SUN Microsystems logo is a wonderful example of symmetry and order .
It was a brilliant observation that the letters u and n while arranged adjacent to each other look a lot like the letter S in a perpendicular direction .
Spectacular .
The above logo is for an editing studio .
I like the way the logo attempts to convey what they do .
The above are two magazines from the Readers Digest stable .
Again , the attempt to communicate what it is about quite figuratively through the logo catches my attention .
liked this logo of a hair stylist for the cheeky humour it brings to the ( dressing ) table .
This was a logo created for a puzzle game called Cluenatic .
This game involves unravelling four clues .
The logo has the letters C , L , U and E arranged as a maze .
and from a distance , the logo looks like a key .
This logo is too good .
For the name Eight , they have used a font in which each letter is a minor adaptation of the number 8 .
Eighty - 20 is a small consulting company which does sophisticated financial modeling , as well as some solid database work .
All their work is highly quantitative and relies on some serious computational power , and the logo is meant to convey it .
People first guess that 20 % of the squares are darkened , but that turns out to be false after counting them .
The trick is to view the dark squares as 1's and the light squares as 0's .
Then the top line reads 1010000 and the bottom line reads 0010100 , which represent 80 and 20 in binary .
Kinda like the surreal green screen of The Matrix , they want us to read stuff in binary This was a logo designed in - house for some internal event at IBM .
I like that they are quite relaxed about the logo , unlike certain other companies who do not like the logo to be tampered with in any way even for internal promotions .
You might think the arrow does nothing here .
But it says that amazon.com has everything from a to z and it also represents the smile brought to the customer 's face .
Wow , that is quite deep .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) has a mission : “ Save lives , prevent injuries , reduce vehicle - related crashes . ”
NHTSA also commits itself to “ providing the most accurate and complete information available to its customers , the American traveling public . ”
While NHTSA ’s progress towards its stated goals is ( and always will be ) a matter of debate , the agency has failed us .
They ’ve failed to tell the truth about ABS .
Modern ABS consists of a computer ( CPU ) , four speed sensors ( one on each wheel ) and hydraulic valves ( attached to the brake circuit ) .
When the CPU senses that one or more of the wheels are turning significantly more slowly than the others , it decreases the pressure on the braking circuit .
If the wheel or wheels then turn too fast ( freed from braking ) , the force is reapplied , creating a pulsing sensation through the brake pedal .
When Bosch ’s Antiblockiersystem appeared on the US automotive scene in the late ‘ 70 ’s , safety advocates hailed electronically assisted braking as a life - saving technology that would reduce the number and severity of accidents .
Tests under controlled conditions seemed to support the contention .
NHTSA and the insurance industry quickly embraced and promoted the technology .
Thanks ( in part ) to insurance industry discounts , almost every passenger vehicle now sold in America is fitted with ABS .
NHTSA ’s web site proclaims “ … an antilock brake system ( ABS ) is a safe and effective braking system .
ABS allows the driver to maintain directional stability , control over steering , and in some situations , to reduce stopping distances during emergency braking situation , particularly on wet and slippery road surfaces . ”
The real - world evidence does n’t support their claims .
Researchers have compared accident and fatality rates for vehicles with and without ABS .
Other studies have examined the driving records of ABS and non-ABS equipped taxi drivers in Munich and Oslo .
The accident and fatality data shows that ABS exacerbates the severity of accidents in certain situations .
The taxi study proved that drivers tend to take greater risks in cars equipped with ABS ( although the difference in collision rates was not significant ) .
In short , ABS may do more harm than good .
More specifically , the studies show that ABS has no real - world effect on dry - surface braking , ABS - equipped vehicles take longer to stop on ice than non-ABS vehicles , ABS - equipped vehicles are more prone to roll - over accidents than non-ABS vehicles , ABS - equipped vehicles are involved more often in single car fatal accidents than non-ABS vehicles , and drivers of ABS - equipped vehicles tend to drive faster and apply their brakes later than non-ABS drivers .
The AAA Foundation for Traffic safety has determined that improper driver steering in an ABS - equipped vehicle can send it veering out of control .
In their tests , jerking the wheel ( as if trying to steer around an obstacle ) in a 35 mph panic stop sent ABS - equipped cars careening across two lane widths .
( Without the ABS , the car skidded in a straight line . )
This behavior may account for the higher roll - over rates for ABS - equipped vehicles .
Other research revealed that many drivers do n’t use ABS properly ; they pump the pedal as they would regular brakes .
NHTSA , the insurance industry , manufacturers and engineers are all well aware of ABS ’ shortcomings .
In 1994 , Dr. Charles J. Kahane published a paper for NHTSA entitled “ Preliminary Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Antilock Brake Systems for Passenger Cars . "
Kahane reported that “ All types of run - off - road crashes – rollovers , side impacts with fixed objects and frontal impacts with fixed objects – increased significantly with ABS .
Nonfatal run-off - road crashes increased by an estimated 19 percent , and fatal crashes by 28 percent . ”
Kahane also concluded that “ Rollovers and side impacts with fixed objects … had the highest increases with ABS .
Nonfatal crashes increased by 28 percent , and fatal crashes by 40 percent . ”
In 1996 , the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety published a news release titled “ Antilock Brakes Do n’t Reduce Fatal Crashes ; People in Cars With Antilocks at Greater Risks - But Unclear Why . ”
In 1998 , Leonard Evans of General Motors ’ Global R&D Operations checked NHTSA ’s ABS crash data and concluded “ it is unlikely that on dry roads ABS can materially reduce risk ” and , more shockingly , “ ABS is associated with a 44 % increase in rollover risk . ”
In 1999 , the Society of Automotive Engineers reported that “ ABS was found to be associated with a 51 percent increase in fatal rollover crashes on dry roads .
For fatal side impact crashes , ABS produced a 69 percent increase for unfavorable road conditions , and a 61 percent increase for favorable road conditions . ”
The average cost of an ABS system is $ 240 .
Multiply that figure by millions of vehicles , add the number of lives lost and the injuries suffered because of ABS ' ill effects , and the true cost of this potentially lethal braking systems is evident .
At the very least , NHSTA should launch an immediate investigation into the advisability of fitting SUV ’s with ABS .
Meanwhile , you ’ve been warned : ABS can kill .
Who Killed Gopher ?
An Extensible Murder Mystery
By Rohit Khare // December 23 , 1998
As best our forensics team can reconstruct , a serial killer first surfaced in the beginning of 1991 , born of an academic 's midnight hack gone awry .
NeXTstep users , you see -- precisely the kind of object - oriented revolutionaries that would think they could get away with inventing a brand new protocol for a mature Internet .
The first victim was the campus phonebook : it dismembered the whole corpus into tiny bits of `hypertext ' , left hanging together by search strings alone .
Here we see its modus operandi : not content to slice information into neat lists or trees , it left behind completely unstructured graphs littered with redirects hither and yon across the Internet to co-conspirators ' servers .
Hegemonic fantasies drove it to assimilate more and more multimedia formats at each node .
Crude at first , shoveling any old file through an 8 - bit clean channel , it grew more explicit until it could label text , images , audio , even compound documents .
By now , it can even masquerade behind several renderings , negotiating whatever face -- or language ! -- pleases the victim .
As a protocol , it was a blunt weapon : aim a socket at the target , send a one - line demand , and slurp down the response until the connection died .
The crazy way it grew from there is proof itself that the killer dropped out of Application Layer Protocol design school at an early age it shows no understanding of the basics of TCP , botching handshakes , slow - start , server - sends - first - byte , even tripping over the Nagle timer .
Instead , in a stroke of streetwise punk genius , it stayed ' simple ' enough that any two - bit Telnet client could take a hit .
And what an addictive product it was !
Workgroupies were seduced by the ease of installing new servers and authoring new content -- and pushing free software helped the lock - in cycle along .
The killer preyed on individual users ' self - esteem by promising instant fame * , in the form of a backlink from the master list of servers .
* Anyone have firm attribution for the famous quote , " On the Internet , everyone will be famous for 15 people " ?
Soon , it was assimilating more than bags of bits : it was a gateway drug to harder services .
Scripts , database lookups , even long - established news , file , and email access transactions were reduced to mere documents in a menu .
The address sent in the ' demand ' grew into a miniature RPC .
All the while , with every new user , every new server , every nugget of information it wrested from ' legacy ' protocols , the killer bled off a little more of the Internet 's bandwidth -- getting away with murder with every handshake !
Such profligacy is no idle threat : for a while , the killer was the largest share of application packet traffic on the national NSFNET backbone .
Or was that the victim ?
Did the killer come knocking on port 70 or port 80 ?
From boombox.micro.umn.edu or info.cern.ch ?
Bearing the imprimatur of campus administrators or physicists ?
Are we hunting gophers or spiders ?
Dial ' H ' For Murder
In fact , the profile in Table 1 fits both suspects to a ' T ' .
In the early '90s , an interesting drama played out between two contenders for the first integrated , interactive internet information retrieval protocols -- neither of which , arguably , had any technical reason to exist .
That 's not to say the systems were n't inevitable : everyone suspected there 'd have to be an easier way to use the Internet in the '90s than UNIX shell experience .
That encompasses innovations in user interface , authoring formats , and above all , resource identification .
It does not , however , motivate the original editions of the Gopher and HyperText Transfer Protocols .
They were painfully trivial hacks that did nothing FTP did n't already handle .
So here begins our mysterious tale : why either protocol ever rose to prominence in the first place ; and how the fratricidial drama eventually played out .
Understanding how HTTP killed gopher may lead us to the forces which may , in turn , topple HTTP .
Science proves a blind alley , though .
Their fates were decided not on technical merits , but on economic and psychological advantages .
The ' Postellian ' school of protocol design focused on engineering ' right ' solutions for core applications ( batch file transfer , interactive terminals , mail and news relays ) anchored in unique transport layer adaptations ( slow - start , Nagle timers , and routing as respective examples ) .
Our two specimens are ' post - Postel ' , in their details and in their adoption dynamics .
They are stateless ; they do n't have ( Gopher ) or dilute ( HTTP ) the theory of reply codes ; they scale poorly , imperiling the health of the Internet ; and they are ' luxuries ' for publishing discretionary information , not Host Requirements which must be compiled into every node .
Burrowing into Gopher
While the Web was arguably invented a few months before Gopher , the latter was the first to garner public notice .
By the fall of 1994 , RFC 1689 's census of information retrieval tools estimated there were 4,800 Gophers , and 1,200 anonymous FTP archives , but only 600 Webs .
Early and " explosive " adoption had a lot to do with Gopher 's " fiercely simple " design , and hence its wide availabilty on a number of students '
( DOS , Windows , Mac , NeXT ) and campus IS departments ' ( UNIXes , VMS , VM / CMS , MVS ) platforms .
It was designed by the microcomputer support folks at the University of Minnesota for a teletext - like Campus - Wide Information System ( CWIS ) .
The original prototype was a multicolumn tree - browser pioneered for the NeXTstep file browser .
Each scrolling column had a list of titles ; clicking on an entry would either display that file in the pane below , or load the child directory listing in the column to the right .
Naturally , the messages on the wire follow directly : open a connection to the target server on port 70 ; send a one - line ' selector ' string ; get back either the file itself , or a list of further selector lines , each prefixed by a character indicating the type of file it points to .
Table 2 lists the rudimentary type system Gopher shipped with , illustrating on one hand its ambitions to assimilate new media types and on the other what a thin skein it was around protocol - and platform - specific data formats .
The flip side of ' thin skein ' is ' ease of implementation ' , though .
In effect , Gopher was a ( very ! ) poor man 's version of FTP , sans authentication , navigation , authoring , or bulk / restartable transfers .
It only used TCP as a half - duplex fopen ( ) call .
It just happened that some of the " files " it transferred were menus , in a Gopher - specific , tab - delimited , US - ASCII format .
So a Gopher server did little more than read files out of a specified directory tree ; and clients could be hacked out of spare Telnet client code .
A little further up the evolutionary tree , servers allowed scripts and other programs to be served as well .
Rather than copying a file back across the socket , it connected it to some process 's output .
Similarly , multiprotocol clients could recognize a non-Gopher selector and switch to another language ( as for phonebook queries ) .
" Gateways exist to seamlessly access a variety of non-Gopher services such as ftp , WAIS , USENET news , Archie , Z39.50 ( 1992 rev ) , X.500 directories , Sybase and Oracle SQL servers , etc . "
The base protocol did n't leverage TCP well , though .
For example , TCP 's three - way handshake ends with a packet from the server to the client -- so even when the client opens the connection , the server can send data first for free .
Gopher did not have a server - hello message , and thus no version number to key upgrades off of .
To signal the end of a particular transmission , Gopher borrowed the SMTP / NNTP convention of < CR >< LF >.< CR >< LF >.
This only worked for its own menu format , though -- as soon as an actual file was transferred , TCP FIN had to be used as the EOF .
This left lots of socket buffers in the FIN_WAIT state at the server side , just like the Web .
At the same time , the Gopher Team was planning to scale to Internet - wide use .
They did plan for redundant backup servers : a '+' line was an alternate for the selector on the previous line .
They maintained a master list of publically - accessible servers , which was in turn indexed regularly by Veronica ( Very Easy Rodent - Oriented Net - wide Index to Computerized Archives , by analogy to the Archie FTP server index ) .
In the long - run , though , no one ever plastered Gopher selectors on shirts and lunch trucks and golf tees ...
Spinning the Web
" The key insight I credit Tim Berners - Lee with , is the URL : the idea that there 's a Uniform Resource Locator that says I can point at any bit of information on the Internet . " -- some obscure Web scholar in Stephen Segaller 's new book Nerds 2.01 : A Brief History of the Internet
If anything , Tim 's original Web manifesto was even more ambitious than Gopher's .
Its hook for assimilating " the entire universe of network - accessible information " was the URI , which is able to subsume entire namespaces as merely one more scheme ( telnet : , mail : , and so on ) .
URIs reduced operational instructions on how to access a resource to a declarative address .
For example , contrast the one - line ftp : URL with the MIME message / external - body part for FTP access -- logins , passwords , alternate sites , alternate directories , alternate formats .
As RFC 1630 intended " URIs may , if necessary , be passed using pen and ink . "
But while URIs were the innovative essence of the Web , the other two legs of the triad were less steady .
HTML is merely a markup language which makes it natural to embed URIs as hyperlinks .
URIs could just as well have been popularized as a pointer format within Rich Text Format , PostScript , LaTeX , or any other language .
HTTP is merely a lookup protocol which makes it natural to resolve http : URLs or gateway to other schemes .
URIs could just as well have been popularized as a naming interface to existing clients for FTP , Gopher , News , etc .
Somehow , though , HTTP / 0.9 took root .
It is a famously ' simple ' protocol , arguably even less useful than Gopher .
Here is its entire grammar :
Simple - Request = " GET " SP Request - URI CRLF
Simple - Response = [ Entity - Body ]
That 's right : it only supported one method , GET , and required a new TCP connection for every transaction .
Even the 1.0 edition , which eventually added authentication and navigation and simultaneous transfers of several files for a single " page " , had no excuse to be born when FTP was on the shelf .
Except that HTTP had broken authentication , nonstandard conventions for navigating directories and welcome / index / home pages , and ran spectacularly afoul of slow - start for each of its typically - small file transfers .
If HTTP /0.9 was really shipped for no better reason than that programming separate FTP - Control and FTP - Data channels seemed too hard , why did it survive ?
Many of the earliest " web " sites were , in fact , just ftp : URLs .
The saving grace was 1.0's new metadata headers .
It augmented the one - line request with additional fields for authentication , arguments modifying the method , and information about the user - agent 's preferred languages and formats .
The entity bodies it returned were prefixed by MIME Content - Types , last - modified dates , base - URI , and more .
This information , finally , was what took HTTP beyond the realm of file transfer to hypertext transfer .
The headers are how HTTP 's adoption cycle diverged from Gopher's .
Both servers were simple to install and author content for -- there was even a hybrid gn server which could vend files over both port 70 and 80 .
There were kudos for new sites , in the form of the Web Virtual Library project at CERN , and later W3C , and early search engines like Brian Pinkerton 's NeXTstep DigitalLibrarian - derived WebCrawler .
The client was the defining wedge .
Graphical web browsers leveraged rich HTML text with MIME media type headers to display graphical images , to launch helper applications , and present multilingual content .
Extensibility : the fingerprint of a killer
The straw that broke the Gopher 's back was n't even a feature of HTTP per se .
The synergy of HTML and HTTP in the graphical browser began with FORM s , through refresh META tags , up through scripting and applet OBJECT s.
While one protocol stayed lean , the other opened up so much headroom that it grew into a beast so complex even today 's base 1.1 specification takes 160 + pages .
An avalanche of new headers modified GET to only retrieve the full entity if - modified - since an existing copy , or only a specified byte - range ; enhanced security with keyed - digest passwords ; even reverse - engineered state back into HTTP using ' cookies . '
HTTP reply codes were added for payments , for cache validation , for upgrading to new protocols .
Entirely new functionality could be grafted on HTTP using new methods .
WebDAV added LOCK and PUT ; collections which allowed MOVE and COPY on entire swaths of URLspace ; and even went beyond new headers to encoded additional parameters in XML .
Conversely , HTTP was borrowed wholesale for new protocols for printing ( IPP ) , multiparty call setup ( SIP ) , and event notification ( RVP ) .
Politically , any server or client could inaugurate a new method ; third - parties could even thread themselves into the proxy chain and filter messages in transit .
Proxies exist to add public annotations ( Crit - Link Mediator ) , anonymize access ( Lucent Personal Web Assistant ) , convert file formats ( ProxiNet for PalmIIIs ) , language translation ( AltaVista 's Babel Fish can be so hacked ) , and content filtering ( PICS ) .
Decentralized extensiblity was key to HTTP 's adoption .
Rather than waiting for the IETF standards process to revise a canonical table of one - letter content codes , for example , MIME headers could deploy new content - types on the spot .
At the same time , uncontrolled divergence reduces the value of the Web platform as the probability of compatible extensions matching up declines .
New versions of HTTP would appear to be one solution , but there is little political will to empanel a standing working group to review a grab - bag of extensions for 1.2 , 1.3 , ... 39.7 and so on .
What is neccessary ?
Some hook for identifying extensions , the level of support required , and which parts of URLspace are so extended .
W3C has been promoting such mechanisms for years -- three calendar years ! -- to better " Lead the [ Controlled ] Evolution of the World Wide Web . "
At first , the motivating scenarios were complex economic and social negotiations ( payments , content selection , privacy , cryptographic algorithms , &c ) .
Early revisions of PEP advertised preference lists of alternative extensions , applied in pipelined sequence .
PEP could also transport metadata about which extensions applied to other resources and required orders .
Though PEP remained a W3C experiment , the basic ideas of 1 ) packaging an entire extension -- methods , headers , encodings and all -- behind a single name and 2 ) indicating clearly if an extensions was required or optional for 3 ) the next hop or end - to - end were reincarnated as the Mandatory proposal .
The current draft defines four header fields enumerating the URIs of the extensions which apply ( Man : and Opt : for client and server ; C - Man : and C - Opt : for the next hop ) .
To interoperate with the installed base , any request with mandatory extensions prefixes the method name with ' M - ' , which forces 1.0 and 1.1 servers to fail with " 501 Not Implemented . "
Transport : the Achilles ' heel
By April 1995 , Web usage passed Gopher 's share as well as every other Internet application protocol as a fraction of NSFnet backbone usage .
Even patching its bandwidth leaks with 1.1's persistent connections can't mask HTTP 's inefficient waste of Internet resources .
Its content base has grown so immense that caching alone can't reduce bandwidth demand by a significant margin for the average user or ISP .
Former strengths have now become liabilities : full ' English ' headers , stateless transactions , full enumeration of client capabilities once critical for debugging now inflate request packets while progressive rendering of composite web pages places a premium on simultaneous downloads ( aggravating the share of packets wasted on handshakes and delayed by slow - start ) .
Individually , these phenomena have appeared in application protocols before -- and were nipped in the bud by active involvement by transport protocol folks , or coevolved with TCP .
When Telnet generated a packet per keystroke , even on links where you could type faster than the ACKs returned , the Nagle timer throttled TCP down to batching keystrokes into a single packet per round - trip .
When file transfers immediately swamped LANs , slow - start eased up to limit congestion .
So when HTTP presents its demand for many small transfers in parallel immediately , there are solutions on the shelf .
Some vendors are already marketing " accelerators " which rely on matched encoders at server and client , like Sitara 's SpeedServer .
Unfortunately , these approaches are n't backward compatible with HTTP as - is -- nor as simple to code .
W3 C's HTTP -NG ( Next Generation ) project sees it as a three - layer problem : message transport , remote invocation , and " The Classic Web Application " ( TCWA ) .
At the bottom , they propose a multiplexing protocol which combines all the traffic destined for a single web server into a single TCP connection .
This allows the conversations regarding individual transfers to be diced up independently : an intelligent server might respond with the first few critical bytes of all the images in the first packet .
A fully specified W3 Mux layer still needs to address flow control ( gating the relative priority of the subchannels without starving them ) , simultaneous open ( which TCP does allow ) , and lots of interoperability testing .
The middle layer ' compresses ' the data to be transferred by marshalling arguments in native data types rather than English .
So numbers would be sent as integers ; dates as binary fields ; and strings as reusable tokens .
The tip of their proposal ( reaching into the cloudy heights of improbability , some critics might say ) is reengineering the Web as a distributed object system , modeled as operations on data structures rather than documents .
Building the Perfect Beast
Having slain Gopher ( and a host of other competitors ) , the Web appears to be expanding in all directions today .
Just as the SMTP state machine defined a style or protocol design for a generation , every new application these days seems to ape HTTP 's state - less style -- if only to piggyback a free ride through firewalls at port 80 .
The Internet Architecture Board is on the verge of issuing guidelines to rein in this tendency .
First , the HTTP port should be reserved for protocols which manipulate the kind of information already in web servers .
WebDAV is OK , since it extends documents ; IPP would not , since it uses POST as a barn door for its printing procedure calls .
Second , HTTP should not be referenced by - copy .
Lots of other efforts want to ' borrow ' a few headers for authentication or navigation and end up copying text into other specs , raising the scepter of divergent versions .
Third , HTTP is not a valid precedent for MIME users -- it plays fast and loose with certain rules which enable absolute interoperablity through mail gateways .
HTTP allows bare < CR > and < LF > as well as inventing a new Content - Encoding : process .
The IAB guidelines are a reminder that HTTP still occupies a limited niche in the space of possible Transfer Protocols .
True , its message format can encode any MIME entity , even live data streams -- but only from the server to the client .
True , its address format can point at anything -- but even then it can't encode whether the resource is expected to be secured , paid for , or otherwise reprocessed .
And it is most certainly restricted to one - to - one , synchronous , request - response ( client - pull ) interaction .
All the various hacks to ' push ' data to groups of subscribers are , well , hacks : automatic polling , shared caches , and " we will mail your response within two working days " .
The moral , then , for would - be sucessors to HTTP is to pick another niche and follow the network effects .
Internet - scale event notification , for example , requires true push and subscriber management .
Current efforts to shove presence information through HTTP may succeed , but any larger shift to event - based integration could catalyze a new , symmetric protocol which allows servers to initiate connections back to clients .
Simply compressing existing HTTP traffic without adding new functionality faces a powerful entrenched competitor .
Adding programmability , whether betting on HTTP - NG or the Mandatory scheme , is an attempt to harness network effects between all the communities that have been angling to extend HTTP to their application .
Yet , the rewards for cooperation are spread thin : only the server which simultaneously supports HTTP , WebDAV , and Internet Printing Protocol would gain from a common syntax for those extensions .
And now we are left back where we started : the mystery of protocol adoption .
Reuse , extensiblity , simplicity are all tricks to reduce the cost of implementing a new protocol -- but that does n't mean the market as a whole will make the most efficient decision .
If you 're a Gopher , it may just bury you :-)

We can do irony for you wholesale : Philip K Dick 's head is missing .
Not the head the late science fiction writer was buried with , but part of an automaton that sat in a living room set interactively conversing with visitors .
Before the loss , there were thoughts that the head might help promote the current movie A Scanner Darkly , based on Dick 's 1977 novel .
No such luck .
When last seen , the head was bagged face - down in a chunk of foam and placed in an overhead bin on an America West flight home to Las Vegas , after being demonstrated at Google .
Its creator , David Hanson , was so fried from overwork and overtravel he left the plane without it .
Do lost robot heads dream of Isaac Asimov ?
" I have a lot of dreams , but I cannot remember them all , " the PKDbot says in a video clip on co-creator Andrew Olney 's website ( http://tinyurl.com/okbvh).
The head looks remarkably lifelike ( except for the electronics visible at the back of its head ) , but its voice , while retaining qualities of Dick 's own voice , has unmistakably synthesised rhythm and tone .
Copyright violation
The author behind Bladerunner ( 1982 ) , Total Recall ( 1990 ) , Minority Report ( 2002 ) and Paycheck ( 2003 ) was a logical subject for a " robotic portrait . "
He loved to play with reality and existentially challenged robots , and even in the 1950s was so prescient that the mainstream is still catching up .
In A Scanner Darkly - the novel and film - the federal anti-drug counter - counter - surveillance is so recursive that the hero is assigned to spy on himself .
Olney 's basic strategy for creating the brain was that sketched in Dick 's 1972 novel , We Can Build You , in which a couple of failing electronic organ salesmen in Boise , Idaho , build a simulacrum of Edwin M Stanton , Abraham Lincoln 's Secretary of War .
The Stanton can not only talk and respond , but learn , adapting quickly to life in 1981 .
It even ponders setting up its own law practice , especially after they create a second simulacrum , of Lincoln himself .
Olney had approximately 20 of Dick 's novels scanned in , along with interviews , speeches and details about Dick 's life .
The resulting mass of text was formatted and fed to algorithms for latent semantic analysis , a mathematical technique that makes it possible to index , retrieve , and extract meaning from natural language .
Most software he used is open source .
The robot 's sound comes through a speaker in its chest ( there was n't room in the head ) , and the face lip - synchs .
" It 's like a kind of [ ventriloquist 's ] dummy , " says Olney .
" It 's the computer or laptop brain [ wired to the robot ] that 's really smart . "
A copy of that brain survives on Olney 's laptop .
Technically speaking , scanning in the novels was a violation of copyright .
Olney says they did n't exactly have the Dick estate 's permission , but " we very much wanted their goodwill " , and he felt the PKD bot was " fair use " .
He notes that they made no profit from the project .
The problem of intellectual property rights is one of the few aspects of modern life ( other than the vastly changed role of women ) that Dick did n't foresee .
Is an automaton a portrait ?
Or is it a copy ?
A derivative work ?
Or perhaps a recording ?
In the mid-1990s , a chain of bars operated by Host International copied the setting of the TV series Cheers and included animatronic figures ( " Hank " and " Bob " ) evoking Cliff , the postman ( played in the series by actor John Ratzenberger ) , and the portly barfly , Norm ( George Wendt ) .
Witnesses say the robots resembled stuffed dolls that moved a bit and traded pre-recorded jokes .
Paramount , which owned the series , granted the bars - and characters - a licence as " derivative works " , taking the view that it owned all rights .
Ratzenberger and Wendt did n't ; they sued Host for unfair competition and violating their " right of publicity " .
The precedent : Wheel of Fortune vowel seller Vanna White had sued Samsung for running full - page magazine ads featuring a picture of a White - alike robot ( tinyurl.com/goy8 m ) .
White won $ 403,000 and a judgement that California 's right of publicity was not limited to name , likeness , voice , or signature .
In the contest between US federal copyright law and California state law , Wendt and Ratzenberger won .
Judge Alex Kozinski wrote eloquent dissents in both cases , arguing that instead of preventing the " evisceration " of White 's rights ( as White 's side argued ) , the court was " creating a new and much broader property right " .
In the UK , says Lilian Edwards , professor of internet law at the University of Southampton and part of a project to create a database of personality law , no such personality or publicity right exists .
In some circumstances a live person might be able to sue for defamation if the representation was " lowering his reputation in the eyes of right - minded people " .
But not a dead one .
Nonetheless , California sets the pace in this area .
Creativity and compassion
But the PKD bot can't infringe any rights anywhere , because it remains headless .
It bugs Olney that the loss has overshadowed their technical and artistic achievement .
The PKDbot was far less sophisticated than the robots Dick imagined in his work - for example , the android in The Electric Ant , who believes he is human until hospital doctors tell him otherwise .
( Inside his chest he finds moving reels of punched paper tape ; when he reconfigures the holes , reality shifts . )
But it was certainly more automatous than John Edward Yancy , the beloved , fake , mind - controlling planetary guru used to create a peaceful totalitarian society in The Mold of Yancy ( 1955 ) .
Yancy rolls on " confident , amiable , undisturbed " until it freezes , fresh out of programmed words and gestures .
Strategically placed microphones meant the PKDbot could hear questions ; responses came after a computational delay of varying length depending on the complexity of the question .
Cameras , sensors and machine vision meant it could look you in the eye and even recognise a few friends and Wired editors .
" We tried to make it move the way Dick did in the movie we had , and also tried to make the voice a reasonable match , " Olney says .
" If you take all those things and bring them together , you 've taken the idea of a portrait and pushed it into several dimensions you do n't normally see . "
He believes the way the two brought the portrait together represented a big advance over other automata , which he describes as mostly pneumatic , not very portable , and limited in what they can say .
" Really , this robot was wide open .
You might not get the response you wanted , but it was a representation of Philip K Dick . "
In the video clip , the PKD bot seems as uncertain of its reality as any of Dick 's characters .
If it is asked , " When were you born ? " then it answers alternately , " I was activated ... " and " Phil was born ... "
Both versions lead to December 16 , 1928 , in Chicago , Dick 's date and city of birth .
The Stanton 's creators wanted to mass - market simulacra to teach , take care of children , and re-enact the US civil war ( with the purpose of ending all other wars ) .
But Seattle - based Sam K Barrows - America 's youngest , richest billionaire , who makes his money speculating on extraterrestrial land - wants to buy up the technology so he can make his colonies less lonely .
Today , in Japan , robot makers hope robots can care for the elderly .
At first thought , automata ought to be more acceptable as entertainment than as carers .
And yet ,
Olney says that at shows where the PKD bot was set up : " A lot of people would come up and hold the robot's hand , though they were n't really invited to do that .
It was very interesting to me that by making it look very human and respond as humanly as we could , it could evoke that kind of response .
It says something about human psychology . "
Plus , if you 're holding its hands , you know it can't reprogram its inner reality tapes and wink you out of existence .

A dangerous criminal being chased by 21 police officers through a busy town centre was halted in his tracks by three middle - aged women who used their Christmas shopping bags as weapons .
The man had been on the run for six days after an arrest warrant was issued by magistrates in Cheltenham in connection with possessing an offensive weapon and assaulting three policemen .
He was spotted by officers in Worcester town centre last Friday but fled when they approached him .
For six minutes , as more and more of their colleagues joined the chase , he weaved in and out of the narrow streets and over a bridge .
But he had not counted on the three middle - aged women , who managed to do what 21 officers had not .
Realising what was going on , the first barred his way on the pavement as he sprinted onto the bridge , forcing him to run into the road .
The second ran into the road and started hitting him with her bags , tussling with him and slowing him down .
The third then joined in and challenged him , forcing him across the road and into the arms of a waiting van driver , who held him until police caught up and arrested him .
Yesterday a spokesman for West Mercia police said that the three women did not know each other and appealed for them to come forward .
He said : " They were walking over the bridge some distance apart when they each realised , in the space of a few seconds , that a man was being pursued and was heading straight for them along the pavement .
" They had very little time to make up their minds what to do and react .
Almost acting in unison , they each responded in exactly the same way - they tried to apprehend the man , not knowing whether he was armed or could have injured them .
" Although we have concerns for the consequences of their actions , we fully endorse them and applaud their courage .
We want to thank the courageous trio . "

Humorous Beat : Actual Funny Police Stories
Surprising Data On Christian Dating
It is the stuff of nightmares and , until now , Hollywood thrillers .
A huge asteroid is on a catastrophic collision course with Earth and mankind is poised to go the way of the dinosaurs .
To save the day , Nasa now plans to go where only Bruce Willis has gone before .
The US space agency is drawing up plans to land an astronaut on an asteroid hurtling through space at more than 30,000 mph .
It wants to know whether humans could master techniques needed to deflect such a doomsday object when it is eventually identified .
The proposals are at an early stage , and a spacecraft needed just to send an astronaut that far into space exists only on the drawing board , but they are deadly serious .
A smallish asteroid called Apophis has already been identified as a possible threat to Earth in 2036 .
Chris McKay of the Nasa Johnson Space Centre in Houston told the website Space.com : " There 's a lot of public resonance with the notion that Nasa ought to be doing something about killer asteroids ... to be able to send serious equipment to an asteroid .
" The public wants us to have mastered the problem of dealing with asteroids .
So being able to have astronauts go out there and sort of poke one with a stick would be scientifically valuable as well as demonstrate human capabilities . "
A 1bn tonne asteroid just 1 km across striking the Earth at a 45 degree angle could generate the equivalent of a 50,000 megatonne thermonuclear explosion .
Attempting to break it up with an atomic warhead might only generate thousands of smaller objects on a similar course , which could have time to reform .
Scientists agree the best approach , given enough warning , would be to gently nudge the object into a safer orbit .
" A human mission to a near Earth asteroid would be scientifically worthwhile , " Dr McKay said .
" There could be testing of various approaches .
We do n't know enough about asteroids right now to know the best strategy for mitigation . "
Matt Genge , a space researcher at Imperial College , London , has calculated that something with the mass , acceleration and thrust of a small car could push an asteroid weighing a billion tonnes out of the path of Earth in just 75 days .
Gianmarco Radice , an asteroid expert at Glasgow University , said the best approach would be to land a device to dig into the object .
" You could place something on the surface to eject material that would push the asteroid in the other direction . "
Mirrors , lights and even paint could change the way the object absorbed light and heat enough to shift its direction over 20 years or so .
With less notice , mankind could be forced to take more drastic measures , such as setting off a massive explosion on or near the object to change its course .
In 2005 , Nasa 's Deep Impact mission tested a different technique when it placed an object into the path of a comet .
Dr Radice said robots could do the job just as well , doing away with the need for a risky and expensive manned mission .
Last year Japan showed with its Hayabusa probe that a remote spacecraft can land on an asteroid .
But with manned missions to the moon and possibly Mars on its to - do list again , Nasa is keen to extend the reach of its astronauts .
Dan Durda , a senior research scientist in the Department of Space Studies at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado said an asteroid landing mission would be a good way test the new Constellation programme spacecraft , the Apollo - style planned replacements for the space shuttle with which Nasa hopes to return to the moon .
He told Space.com : " A very natural , early extension of the exploration capabilities of this new vehicle 's architecture would be a " quick - dash " near - Earth asteroid rendezvous mission . "
Tom Jones , a former shuttle astronaut , said : " After a lunar visit , we face a long interval in Earth - Moon space while we build up experience and technology for a Mars mission .
An asteroid mission could take us immediately into deep space , sustaining programme momentum , adding public excitement and reducing the risk of a later Mars mission . "
Europe has its own efforts to tackle asteroids .
Its planned Don Quijote mission will launch two robot spacecraft , one to tilt at a harmless passing space rock , and a second to film the collision and watch for any deviation in the asteroid 's path .
' Not if , but when ...'
Hits and near misses
At Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , in California , scientists monitor all " potentially hazardous asteroids " that might one day end up on a collision course with Earth .
So far they number 831 .
The next close - ish shave - at a mere 17 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth - will be asteroid 2004QD14 on November 29 .
The Earth has a long history of asteroid strikes .
Thirty five million years ago , a 5 km - wide asteroid ploughed into what is now Chesapeake Bay , in the US , leaving an 80 km crater .
In 1908 , an asteroid devastated swaths of Siberia when it exploded mid-air with the force of 1,000 Hiroshimas .
The theory that the dinosaurs were wiped out by a huge asteroid striking Mexico 65 m years ago is controversial since scientists uncovered rocks from the crater predating the extinction of the dinosaurs by 300,000 years .
A near miss , when asteroid QW7 came within 4 m km of Earth in September 2000 , led Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik to declare : " It 's not a case of if we will be hit , it is a question of when .
Each of us is 750 times more likely to be killed by an asteroid than to win this weekend 's lottery . "
In January 2002 , the former science minister , David Sainsbury , announced the government 's response to the threat from hurtling asteroids : a new information centre based in Leicester .

“ HE WOULD FIRE THE NEXT PERSON THAT SAID THAT ” …. Today , via Orin Kerr , comes a remarkable interview with Brigadier General Mark Scheid , chief of the Logistics War Plans Division after 9/11 , and one of the people with primary responsibility for war planning .
Shortly after the invasion of Afghanistan , he says , Donald Rumsfeld told his team to start planning for war in Iraq , but not to bother planning for a long stay :
“ The secretary of defense continued to push on us … that everything we write in our plan has to be the idea that we are going to go in , we ’re going to take out the regime , and then we ’re going to leave , ” Scheid said .
“ We wo n’t stay . ”
Scheid said the planners continued to try “ to write what was called Phase 4 , ” or the piece of the plan that included post - invasion operations like occupation .
Even if the troops did n’t stay , “ at least we have to plan for it , ” Scheid said .
“ I remember the secretary of defense saying that he would fire the next person that said that , ” Scheid said .
“ We would not do planning for Phase 4 operations , which would require all those additional troops that people talk about today .
“ He said we will not do that because the American public will not back us if they think we are going over there for a long war . ” ….
” In his own mind he thought we could go in and fight and take out the regime and come out .
But a lot of us planners were having a real hard time with it because we were also thinking we ca n’t do this .
Once you tear up a country you have to stay and rebuild it .
It was very challenging . ”
In a way , this is old news .
As much as it beggars the imagination , there ’s been plenty of evidence all along that Bush never took the idea of rebuilding Iraq seriously .
The plan was to remove Saddam from power , claim victory , and get out .
However , this is the clearest evidence I ’ve seen yet .
The guy who was actually in charge of logistics has now directly confirmed that Rumsfeld not only did n’t intend to rebuild Iraq in any serious way , but threatened to fire anyone who wasted time on the idea .
Needless to say , he would n’t have done this unless it reflected the wishes of the president .
And this also means that all of Bush ’s talk about democracy was nothing but hot air .
If you ’re serious about planting democracy after a war , you do n’t plan to simply topple a government and then leave .
So : the lack of postwar planning was n’t merely the result of incompetence .
It was deliberate policy .
There was never any intention of rebuilding Iraq and there was never any intention of wasting time on democracy promotion .
That was merely a post hoc explanation after we failed to find the promised WMD .
Either that or BG Scheid is lying .
This is an astounding interview , all the more so for the apparently resigned tone that Scheid brings to it .
It belongs on the front page of the New York Times , not the Hampton Roads Daily Press .
POSTSCRIPT : An alternative explanation , based on Rumsfeld ’s admonition that “ the American public will not back us if they think we are going over there for a long war , ” is that Rumsfeld and Bush were planning to stay but simply lied about it in order to build support for the war .
However , based on the rest of the interview with Scheid , as well as the other evidence that there was no plan to stay and rebuild in any serious way , that explanation seems unlikely .
The bulk of the evidence continues to suggest that democracy and rebuilding were simply not on Bush ’s radar .
Sexual Perversion in Rumsfeld 's Pentagon Scott Horton
This week Capt . James
Yee ’s book concerning his experiences in Guantánamo will hit America ’s bookstores .
This morning ’s Sunday Times ( London ) offers a fascinating set of excerpts from Yee ’s work .
Money quote :
“ It was my turn to be humiliated every time I was taken to have a shower .
Naked , I had to run my hands through my hair to show that I was not concealing a weapon in it .
Then mouth open , tongue up , down , nothing inside .
Right arm up , nothing in my armpit .
Left arm up .
Lift the right testicle , nothing hidden .
Lift the left .
Turn around , bend over , spread your buttocks , knowing a camera was displaying my naked image as male and female guards watched .
“ It did n’t matter that I was an army captain , a graduate of West Point , the elite US military academy .
It did n’t matter that my religious beliefs prohibited me from being fully naked in front of strangers .
It did n’t matter that I had n’t been charged with a crime .
It did n’t matter that my wife and daughter had no idea where I was .
And it certainly did n’t matter that I was a loyal American citizen and , above all , innocent . ”
When all the baseless suspicions against
Yee were disproved , the Pentagon turned to its favored technique to punish him .
He was accused of improper sexual conduct .
In American society today , these words generally relate to conduct that is abusive – unauthorized sexual contact .
Not in Donald Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon : there they relate to consensual sexual relations between a man and a woman .
The consistent factor is that one of the sexual partners has made it on to the Pentagon ’s black list for one reason or another .
The Rumsfeld Pentagon has developed destruction of the character of those who get in its way to an art form .
Those viewed as troublesome become the target of a special investigation .
Wiretaps are applied to their telephones and their emails are read .
An evidentiary case is built and humiliating leaks to the press occur .
Let ’s stop for a moment and ask : when the persons in question are two- , three - and four - star generals , at what level must this be authorized ?
In fact , the targets have included two - , three - and four - star generals , and the authority or impetus for such action has almost certainly come from the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
The charges brought have tended to fall into two baskets : charges of petty dereliction and sexual misconduct .
In the former case , we have seen charges that officers kept classified documents on their laptop computers – when the documents turned out not to be classified ; and we have seen charges of petty errors and oversights in contract administration .
( Conversely , serious cases of contract misadministration involving billions of dollars and Halliburton are resolved by persecuting the whistleblower . )
But the favored technique clearly lies in bringing charges of improper sexual conduct , invariably involving consensual sexual relations .
These charges are easily brought .
The number of eunuchs and sexual abstainers among the uniformed military is low and sociological research has long shown that the vast majority of the population has sexual relations outside of wedlock at some point .
That means that these charges can be brought against virtually anyone .
If the rules were enforced uniformly and aggressively , we would not be able to maintain a volunteer army .
But the current highly selective application may achieve the same result .
Two important bar organizations have already looked at the situation and concluded that the application of sexual misconduct rules by the uniformed services suggests highly uneven application .
Both urged reforms .
The Pentagon refuses to budge .
The tool is too powerful , and too readily abused .
Therein lies its attraction .
In addition to the case of Capt Yee , developed in his current book , consider these :
- Maj Gen Thomas J Fiscus , Judge Advocate General of the Air Force – known to have criticized rules on treatment of detainees – accused of sexual misconduct
- Lt Gen John Riggs – questioned the level of troop commitments to the Iraq campaign – accused of sexual misconduct and technical contract infractions
- Gen Kevin Byrnes – responsible for incorporating changes in doctrine on interrogation and treatment of detainees , rumored to have had reservations about changes hammered through by Rumsfeld – accused of sexual misconduct
Each of these cases suggests highly irregular investigative and disciplinary process which sharply discredits the Pentagon and the military justice system .
Press reports also demonstrate a remarkably incurious media that frequently plays into the Pentagon 's smear tactics by failing to fathom the currents under the press releases .
The Pentagon is aided in this process by the coerced silence of the accused , usually eager to salvage something of his pension and benefits .
A good example is the Washington Post article reporting on the punishment of General Fiscus .
An unnamed Pentagon source is quoted as saying , with obvious malice , that Fiscus can expect to be disbarred as a consequence of their action .
When I raised the matter with a bar ethics committee chair , I was told this : " If we began disbarring lawyers because of consensual sexual relations , we would rapidly run out of members . "
To really understand what ’s going on , these cases and the extreme sexual priggishness they reflect must be juxtaposed against a decision – taken at or near the top of the chain of command and crammed down on investigators – to jettison prior military doctrine requiring humane treatment of detainees .
In introducing new , inhumane practices , the Pentagon leadership embraced sexual humiliation tactics with particular relish .
An examination of published accounts of the twelve internal Army investigations discloses the following admittedly inhumane practices :
- enforced nudity , including suggestive poses and stacking of bodies ;
- allusions to and threats of improper sexual conduct ;
- improper and unauthorized touching , including touching of genitalia ;
- probes involving light sticks and other tools ( which may come close to constituting rape by instrumentality under state statutes ) ;
- use of ( fake ) menstrual blood ;
- sexual blackmail ;
- distribution and use of sexually explicit materials ;
- suggestions that detainees are homosexual or have otherwise engaged in sexual conduct inconsistent with Muslim religious values ; and
- having an interrogator deliver “ lap dances ” to detainees .
These practices clearly violate legal rules and traditional US military doctrine on the treatment of detainees .
They also degrade the US service personnel who are required to apply them .
But consider the swing between the disgrace and ruin of highly valued career officers for consensual sexual relations and the officially sanctioned , grossly abusive sexual misconduct described above .
It demonstrates a plasticity in moral values , that can only be called breathtaking .
How are we to bridge this chasm ?
The most appealing explanation lies in the motives of those driving this ostensibly schizophrenic conduct .
Plainly , they view sexual morals as something to be manipulated for the accomplishment of political objectives .
Hence , lewd and offensive sexual conduct can be deliberately used as a tactic against detainees .
On the other hand , officers who earn the leadership ’s ire will be humiliated and disgraced using innuendo of sexual misconduct as a tactic .
The cynicism and immorality of this mindset is staggering .
It reflects a wholesale repudiation of traditional military values .
One can well question the efficacy of sexual humiliation practices as tools for interrogation and intelligence gathering .
However , no one can question their highly inflammatory effect in the War on Terror : they tarnish America 's reputation and put our soldiers at risk .
And they may well claim another victim .
Experts are already noting that at Rumsfeld 's current burn rate , the volunteer army cannot be sustained much longer .
Rumsfeld 's cynical sexual policies are destroying military morale and discipline and hastening the volunteer army 's demise .

Rival groups of monks wielding crowbars and sledgehammers clashed Wednesday over control of a 1,000 - year - old monastery in a community regarded as the cradle of Orthodox Christianity , police said .
Seven monks were injured and transported by boat to receive treatment .
They were released after several hours , police said .
No one was arrested but three monks were banned from re-entering the Orthodox sanctuary of Mount Athos , located on a self - governing peninsula in northern Greece .
Esphigmenou monastery is the scene of a long - running dispute between Orthodox Church authorities and rebel monks who occupy the facility .
Both Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I , leader of the Orthodox Christian church , and Greece 's highest administrative court have ordered their eviction , but the monks have refused to budge .
The rebel monks vehemently oppose efforts to improve relations between the Orthodox Church and the Vatican .
The fighting Wednesday broke out between the rebel monks and a group of legally recognized monks who were outside .
The outsiders attempted to force their way into the monastery 's offices in Karyes , the administrative center of the monastic community , to begin construction of a new building .
Occupying monks attacked those outside with crowbars and fire extinguishers .
Esphigmenou 's rebel abbot , Methodius , said his monks had been provoked .
" We were attacked and had to respond , " he said .
" They should be ashamed to call themselves men of the cloth . "
In October , a court in the nearby city of Thessaloniki handed down two - year suspended sentences against nine monks and former monastery members for illegally occupying Esphigmenou 's offices .

It was only a matter of time before the Republican bloggers found a new myth to counter this report , CIA Learned in ’02 That Bin Laden Had No Iraq Ties , Report Says ( link fixed )
The CIA learned in late September 2002 from a high - level member of Saddam Hussein ’s inner circle that Iraq had no past or present contact with Osama bin Laden and that the Iraqi leader considered bin Laden an enemy of the Baghdad regime , according to a recent Senate Intelligence Committee report .
Although President Bush and other senior administration officials were at that time regularly linking Hussein to al - Qaeda , the CIA ’s highly sensitive intelligence supporting the contrary view was apparently not passed on to the White House or senior Bush policymakers .
So like drowning rats on a spongecake canoe conservatives bloggers have lashed themselves to this thin gruel from that pinnacle of journalism the New York Sun , Iraqi Official Testifies to Links Between Saddam and Al Qaeda
A deputy prime minister of Iraq yesterday offered a sharp contradiction of the conventional wisdom here that Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq and Al Qaeda had no connection before the 2003 war , flatly contradicting a recent report from the Senate ’s intelligence committee .
snip
A Kurdish politician who took his high school exams from inside a Baathist prison , Mr. Salih said he was the target of the alliance between jihadists , Baathists , and Al Qaeda in 2001 , when a group known as Ansar al - Islam tried to assassinate him .
In 2002 , envoys of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , one of the two Kurdish parties sharing sovereignty over northern Iraq between the two Iraq wars , presented the CIA with evidence that the organization that tried to kill Mr. Salih had been in part funded and directed by Saddam Hussein ’s Republican Guard .
Those words directly contradict a recent report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that declassified a 2005 CIA assessment of Iraq ’s pre-war ties to Al Qaeda and found that none existed .
In an interview after the speech yesterday , Mr. Salih said he was unaware of the CIA assessment .
But he added , “ There were links between Ansar al - Islam and Al Qaeda .
The information at time [ in 2002 ] was quite different .
Now , we could not prove this in a court of law , but this is intelligence . ”
The Senate ’s report declassifies a July 2002 Defense Intelligence Agency study of Ansar al - Islam as a possible link between Saddam ’s Iraq and Al Qaeda that concludes that , even if it can be proven , as Mr. Salih at the time alleged , that the Baathist regime supported the group , “ it will not necessarily implicate the regime in supporting Al Qaeda . ”
The DIA concludes that Ansar al - Islam “ receives assistance ” from Al Qaeda but is not a branch of the terrorist organization .
Who is Barham Salih , the man who says he knows for certain that Saddam had Al Qaeda connections .
He is an engineer who left Kuristan in 1979 after which he lived in London .
One has to wonder how a man that left northern Iraq and could never have had intimate knowledge of the workings of Saddam ’s inner circle knows for a fact that there were links to Al Queda .
He claims that Ansar al - Islam tried to assassinate him which may be true , but Ansar al - Islam was dedicated to fighting the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan of who Salih was a member .
Ansar operated in northern Iraq , an area outside of Saddam ’s control .
Ansar is reported to have had connections to Al Queda , but there is no evidence what so ever that Ansar was supported by Saddam .
That does n’t stop conservative blogger The Jawa Report from trying to make the connection no matter how tenuous , Iraqi Minister : Saddam Was Tied to al Qaeda , September 14 , 2006 , Posted by Dr. Rusty Shackleford at September 14 , 2006 02:19 PM
If you still do n’t believe Saddam supported terrorists , well then you are just ignorant .
If , however , the larger point is that Saddam had no connection to 9/11 , then your point is well taken .
He links to the article and supplies no evidence , then concludes , If you still do n’t believe Saddam supported terrorists , well then you are just ignorant .
Jawa has done a nice little dance here .
A terrorists group was in northern Iraq .
This group had some ties to Al Queda .
Then great leaping logic , Saddam had ties to terrorists .
By this reasoning if you have heroin dealers living on your street then you have connections to drug dealers .
John( Assrocket ) at Time magazine ’s former blog of the year , September 14 , 2006 , Quick , Someone Tell the Intelligence Committee ! , Posted by John at 10:42 AM
This last point is the kind of sophistry that defenders of Saddam are forced to resort to .
There is no doubt that Ansar al Islam was a dangerous terrorist group ; among its activities was the production of ricin to be used in terrorist acts in Europe .
The left ’s conventional defense of Ansar al Islam is that it was located in the northern part of Iraq , and therefore under the presumed dominion of the Kurds .
But so what ?
They were in Iraq , and Saddam not only tolerated but supported them .
The Kurds had no ability to drive them out .
The idea that Saddam is insulated from al Qaeda because Ansar was only supported by al Qaeda , but was not a “ branch ” of al Qaeda , is the kind of silliness liberals engage in on this issue .
Ansar was a terrorist Islamic group , and Saddam both harbored and supported them .
Assrocket does n’t acknowledge that Barham Salih left Iraq in 1979 and might be speaking more as a gossip with a grudge rather then someone knowledgable of the secret political machinations of Saddam ’s regime .
Salih in the article states , “ Now , we could not prove this in a court of law . . ”
Which Assrocket and Jawa conviently ignored .
It probably would n’t matter anyway , Salih has said what they wanted to hear .
As to the , ” Saddam not only tolerated but supported them ” ( them is Ansar ) .
Yet I can find no proof at all that Ansar , a radical and very fundamentalist Islamic organization had any ties or support from Saddam .
This kind of fact checking is exactly the kind of things liberals do .
Its obviously a thorn in Assrocket ’s side .
The facts just do not lend credibility to his claims no matter how hard he beats the drums of far right agiprop .
Assrocket sights Saddam ’s conflict with Iran as one reason he had to be removed , that would be the conflict where Iraq had the full support of Dick Cheney , Ronald Reagan , and Colin Powell .
Another sad attempt by the fringe
Right to somehow justify the fact that more Americans have died in Iraq then died on 9 - 11 .
Odd fact given that the invasion of Iraq was supposed to make the US and the world safer .
Saddam was beyond redemption but ironically the neocons answer to Saddam ’s brutality has been to kill over 60,000 Iraqis and have most of the rest of the population live without basic amenities like electricity and clean water .
For right - wing blogger Macsmind the facts are indeed awful things , so awful that he is pissed , About that Senate Intelligence Report on Saddam and Al Qaeda , Posted by Macranger on Thursday , September 14th , 2006 at 10:51 am .
You know , this is n’t about politics folks , but that ’s what it has become .
Democrats could care less about security or intelligence , they ’re only concern is defeating President Bush in 2006 and 2008 ( even though he is n’t running ) .
It ’s about “ he said , she said , they said ” , but not about the facts and the fact is that if anyone thinks Saddam and Al Qaeda were n’t linked has their head up their ass , it ’s just that simple .
Mac is a believer , he believes , that makes it true and no facts , no evidence will change his mind .
He is the Robert Cardinal Bellarmine of wing - nuttery determined to fight against the Copernican theory to the death .
If you dare to question Mac he ’ll slap you with his ad hominem .
He is correct that it is all about politics , not is what is best for America or humanity .
He sights neocon poster boy Stephen Hayes as more definitive proof of the Saddam - Al - Queda connection , but Steve has some credibility problems , Stephen Hayes : Conservatives ’ favorite authority on “ The Connection ”
The most vigorous critique of Hayes ’s article came from a November 19 , 2003 , Newsweek article titled “ Case Decidedly Not Closed : The Defense Dept. memo allegedly proving a link between Al Qaeda and Saddam does nothing of the sort , ” in which Investigative Correspondents Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball wrote that Hayes ’s article was “ mostly based on unverified claims that were first advanced by some top Bush administration officials more than a year ago — and were largely discounted at the time by the U.S. intelligence community , according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials .
We all get the idea and lets state this strange event in the simplest terms , rather then believe a report by the Republican dominated Senate Intelligence commitee Republican bloggers would rather believe an expatriot Kurd that lived in London for the 24 years before Bush elected to invade Iraq .
It would be nice if conspiracy theories balanced out , the 9 - 11 conspiracy theorists that think it was an inside job canceling out the conspiracy theorists that insist there was a connection between Saddam and Al Queda .
Unfortunately both are like some creeping alien mold that ca n’t be reasoned with .
The following is from the Columbia Journalism Review .
I ’ve left it out of blockquotes in order to make it easier to read .
It is part of a response to reporters of the Los Angeles Times and Knight Ridder to a letter written by neocon darling Ahmad Chalabi of the Iraqi National Congress .
Bold emphasis is mine .
[ Jonathan S. Landay responds : Mr. Chalabi is correct that on April 3 , 2004 , Knight Ridder published a story that quoted anonymous U.S. officials as saying that the Iraqi National Congress supplied the Iraqi defector code - named “ Curveball . ”
He is also right that the Silberman - Robb commission found that the defector was n’t connected to the INC .
He fails to mention , however , that a defector who was provided by the INC and later determined to have been a fabricator was used to corroborate Curveball ’s false claims about Iraqi mobile biological warfare facilities .
Chalabi also neglects to acknowledge that after learning that the Silberman - Robb commission had concluded that the INC had not provided Curveball , Knight Ridder reported that on March 29 , 2005 — two days before the Silberman - Robb report was released .
Further , Chalabi is wrong to assert that in its extensive reporting on pre-war Iraqi intelligence , Knight Ridder portrayed his organization as “ the main source of U.S. intelligence on Saddam . ”
In fact , much of our reporting was about the intense clashes between U.S. officials who wanted to use information provided by the INC and others who were deeply suspicious of INC - supplied information .
Chalabi also claims that the Silberman - Robb commission found that INC - related sources had a minimal impact on the Bush administration ’s pre-war assessments .
This is true only with respect to the formal intelligence assessments the commission was charged with examining .
His assertion sidesteps two equally critical issues :
* The commission did not examine the use of INC - supplied defectors ’ claims by the Bush administration , which also was receiving some materials directly from the INC ’s U.S. - funded Information Gathering Program — unfiltered for accuracy by the Intelligence Community .
In a June 26 , 2002 , letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee staff , the INC itself reported that it was providing information directly to a senior official in the office of the vice president and to another one in the office of the secretary of defense .
* Nor did the commission examine the impact on U.S. and international public opinion of the multitude of media stories alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was training terrorists , stories that were based on interviews with defectors and other information that the INC supplied to print and electronic news media .
The INC ’s own June 26 , 2002 , letter lists 108 stories containing information it fed to journalists during a five - month period beginning in October 2001 .
Much of that information , it later turned out , was exaggerated or fabricated .
* A case in point : When President Bush addressed the United Nations General Assembly on September 12 , 2002 , the White House released a background paper titled “ A Decade of Deception and Defiance ” on Saddam Hussein ’s alleged weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism .
This paper was distributed to foreign governments , members of U.S. and international journalists , and it remains available to the general public on the White House Web site .
The first item in the chapter entitled “ Saddam Hussein ’s Development of Weapons of Mass Destruction ” is a claim by an INC - supplied defector , Adnan Ihsan Saeed al Haideri , a chemical engineer , that he had visited twenty secret nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons sites .
The White House published this claim even though DIA and CIA interrogators nine months earlier had rejected Mr. Saeed as unreliable after he flunked a lie detector test by the CIA in Thailand .
When he was brought back to Iraq by the Iraq Survey Group after the war , Mr. Saeed was unable to identify a single WMD facility .
Mr. Saeed ’s claim was also the focus of the lead story in The New York Times on Dec. 20 , 2001 , and was picked up and reproduced by other media outlets .
* In a chapter entitled “ Saddam Hussein ’s Support for International Terrorism , ” the White House paper claimed that , “ Former Iraqi military officers have described a highly secret terrorist training facility in Iraq known as Salman Pak , where both Iraqis and non-Iraqi Arabs receive training on hijacking planes and trains , planting explosives in cities , sabotage , and assassinations . ”
This allegation came from two INC - supplied defectors , Sabah Khalifa Khodada Alami , a former Iraqi army captain , and Brig .
Gen . Abu Zeinab al Quairy , the purported commander of the training facility .
Both men were rejected as unreliable by U.S. intelligence professionals .
Nevertheless , the White House published their claims .
Their claims , including suggestions that the September 11 hijackers may have been trained at the alleged facility , also appeared in the American and British media .
After the invasion , the only training facility found at Salman Pak was determined by U.S. officials to have been used by Iraqi counter - terrorism units . ]
Bush and his administration are serial fabricators and it is all about the politics of manipulation .
The US Government 's broad subpoena to search engines effectively seeks to mine the data of the internet .
While Google has resisted the subpoena , there may be little they can do to protect our privacy from many prying eyes .
Moreover , the Government subpoena makes Google and other search engines or ISPs the source of first resort for any information about what people 's preferences are , what they like or dislike , what they do and do n't do , what they read and do n't read .
In an effort to protect children from being able to see indecent materials ( technically , materials that are " harmful to minors " ) , Congress passed the Children 's Online Protection Act ( COPA ) .
This act , a response to the US Supreme Court 's rejection of a similar but more restrictive law , the Communications Decency Act , made it unlawful to sell any materials that any court in the United States deemed to be " harmful " to minors anywhere on the internet .
A lawsuit challenging this statute of First Amendment free expression and speech grounds ensued , and the U.S. Court of Appeals essentially told the U.S. government to prove that other means - like web filters , white lists , black lists , and others - that were less restrictive on free speech .
However , this could not achieve the same governmental objectives of protecting children without reducing all of the Internet to pabulum .
To do this , the Department of Justice decided that it had to know virtually everything that virtually everyone was doing online - at least for a representative period of time .
As a result , the government recently subpoenaed records from all of the major ISP 's and search engines .
Not surprisingly , almost all of these companies complied with the subpoenas .
Only Google objected .
As a result of attempting to protect both its trade secrets and the public perception of privacy , Google was rewarded by an immediate drop in its stock price .
The case has much broader implications than the subpoena itself - it raises the continuing question of the ability of the government or others to essentially usurp massive commercial databases .
The immediate problem is that both Google and others may find their efforts to quash such subpoenas thwarted by the courts .
The real problem is not that the records can be subpoenaed - of course they can .
The problem is that these massive databases exist - or more accurately persist - at all .
The Question of COPA
The issue in the COPA litigation is whether it 's better to make it a crime to sell things to your average 4 year old instead of giving parents the ability to filter that stuff out .
The government argues that no filtering technology keeps out all the things that parents might not want their kids to see , and therefore , we have to make sure that nobody can ever sell that kind of stuff without some effective means of verifying that the recipient is not a kid - even to a 17 year old kid with mom or dad 's credit card .
The argument suggests we have to make it a crime because filters are n't 100 per cent effective .
Sure .
And by the way , drugs have been illegal for years .
How is that working out in reducing their use and availability ?
This entire debate would be academic , except for the means the government has decided to employ to attempt to prove its case .
A civil subpoena for , well , the Internet .
What the government subpoenaed from Google , and presumably from all the other search engines was " [ a ] ll URLs that are available to be located through a query on your computer 's search engine as of July 31 , 2005 " and further demanded production of " [ a ] ll queries that have been entered on [ Google 's ] search engine between June 1 , 2005 and July 31 , 2005 , inclusive . "
Although the government ultimately narrowed the scope of the subpoena somewhat after negotiations with Google 's lawyers , both the original and modified requests are startlingly broad in scope and remarkably irrelevant to the underlying litigation .
Privacy and trade secrets
When you get a subpoena from the government , you have relatively few grounds in the law to object .
First , you can assert some kind of privilege - attorney - client , priest - penitent , or doctor - patient ( but not journalist - source so much anymore . )
While doctors , lawyers , clergy and journalists all use the Internet and search engines to find information relevant to research for clients , patients , and the like , a broad subpoena for general information is not likely to significantly impact these privileges .
This does not mean that the privilege does n't apply , or that everything you do online is " public " and therefore entitled to no privilege .
Say a client goes to a lawyer about an arcane area of the law .
The lawyer hops on Google to do research ( with Lexis and Westlaw being too expensive for this solo practitioner ) .
The terms searched for by themselves would reveal the nature of the research , the privileged communications , and the legal strategy .
The fact it occurs in the " public " internet is no more relevant than having opposing counsel following a lawyer in the law library to see what books and pages he or she is reading .
It 's just not kosher .
So Google 's objection to the broad subpoena on privilege grounds is less than fanciful , but hardly compelling .
Another ground for objecting to the production of documents is that compliance would be unreasonable and oppressive .
If the demand for documents is so extensive , and so difficult to amass , the subpoena can be quashed or modified by the court .
There is little doubt that this Google subpoena is broad - probably excessively so .
But Google prides itself on being able to search for and deliver targeted search results for - well , a Google of information in about 3.24 seconds .
In response to Google 's concerns about compliance , a Berkeley statistics professor essentially said it can't be too burdensome because Yahoo ! complied .
Of course , this is much like when my eight year old demands a later bedtime because of the later bedtime of his older brother - particularly when there is no indication in the record that Yahoo !
ever complained or attempted to quash its subpoena .
Moreover , I probably missed the part of my college statistics class where the statistics professor was deemed an expert on the difficulty of compliance with a subpoena .
In fact , the statistics professor also claims to be an expert on the privacy implications of compliance with the subpoena to Google , glibly stating under oath that Google has no legitimate privacy concerns because " [ o ] ther vendors have been able to produce samples of queries with all information that might identify a user removed " .
Hmmm , see what happens when you fall asleep in statistics class ?
You miss that part about the need to protect privacy .
The problem with subpoenaing search engines
So what about Google 's argument about privacy ?
Certainly Government has n't subpoenaed what I personally am searching for .
They state that what they seek to do is to " characterize sites that can be found using search engines and what people see in practice when they use search engines " .
If no specific searches are sought , just trend data , what is the big problem ?
The answer is , plenty .
First of all , there is no reason to believe that any of this is even remotely relevant to the issue in the underlying litigation - whether electronic filters for children work .
Let 's assume that the Google subpoena shows that there is tons of pornography and smut out there and that people are actively looking for it - and actually finding it .
Ooh .
So what ?
This is like trying to determine the effectiveness of the " V chip " by subpoenaing the Neilson or Arbitron aggregate records of popular television shows , and TV Guide 's records of everything broadcast .
While the Government eschews Google 's argument that they are attempting to see " what is out there " on the internet , effectively this is exactly what they are trying to do .
If the statistics show that people are n't using Google to search for porn , Government will simply argue that porn is available on un-indexed sites , and therefore COPA is necessary .
We also do n't know what percentage of the Google users subpoenaed are children , or adults .
Were they using Google 's safe image search ?
Were the sites sought active , and were the URL 's available ?
Was anything delivered to the user ?
Did the user have any filters on the machines that would block delivery of the URL ?
Were those filters configured properly ?
Indeed , while the government agreed to allow Google to produce a random sample of URLs delivered , Google 's counsel correctly pointed out that the Government 's statistician would still need access to the entire database in order to ensure the sample was statistically random .
Moreover , the subpoena makes Google and other search engines or ISPs the source of first resort for any information about what people 's preferences are , what they like or dislike , what they do and do n't do , what they read and do n't read .
I remember years ago finding an article in an obscure medical journal that was relevant to a case I was litigating .
I asked the publisher for a copy of the publication , and he explained that I would have to buy a subscription - for several thousand dollars .
So I reached into my desk drawer and pulled out a subpoena - cheaper by far than actually buying the data .
Copyright , smopyright .
Indeed , having subpoenaed the data , I could now introduce it into the public record at trial - and with today 's electronic filing , even make the entire thing available online .
Subpoenaing the world 's information
One can imagine thousands of cases where aggregate or even specific Google information might be useful to one party or another in litigation .
Did my publisher act in good faith in promoting my book ?
Let 's subpoena Amazon to see how it sold over time and compare it to comparable books .
Did my advertising agency meet its contractual obligations ?
Let 's subpoena Yahoo !
Indeed , as long as a plausible claim can be made not that the information is relevant to the litigation , but that it may lead to the discovery of relevant information , it is subject to subpoena .
As Google 's counsel pointed out , " Google objects to [ the Government 's ] view of [ its ] highly proprietary search database - the primary reason for the company 's success - as a free resource that [ the government ] can access and use , some levels removed , to formulate its own defense . "
In other words Government , if you want this data from Google , buy it .
Now the Government 's statistician has eschewed the need for identifying information .
But as I just noted , without this kind of information , the relevance of the data to the COPA litigation is seriously diminished .
So once they obtain the general information , there is little to stop the government from asking , " oh , and by the way , what else do you know about those Google users ? "
What were their IP addresses ?
What time of day did they perform their searches ( during school hours , or between 3 pm and 8 pm local time ? )
Did the same people search for kids sites ( like Disney or Nickelodeon ) and then search for smut ?
What sites were actually delivered up as a result of these searches ?
What information does Google keep cached ?
Oh , and of course , how does Google collect , store , and collate this information in the first place ?
The last one is a real kicker .
One of Google 's principal objections to the subpoena is that compliance will reveal its trade secrets - what it called its " crown jewels " .
Google argued that it would require Google to disclose the approximate number of URLs in its database , and some details about how it maintains crawled URLs , such as the number of servers , server distribution , and how often Google crawls the worldwide web .
This information , according to Google , would be highly valuable to competitors , or miscreants seeking to do harm .
What Google did n't mention was the fact that , because Google 's competitors have already turned over their versions of this information , even with the protective order in place , it would become public which of the major search engines delivers the most or most accurate results based upon an enormous database in the Government 's hands .
This could hurt Google 's advertising revenues .
Finally , there is the matter of public perception about privacy .
Not actual privacy .
Indeed , Google 's own privacy policy expressly states that Google " may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of Google " .
This means exactly the kind of information that the government has subpoenaed .
Indeed , in its objection to the subpoena , Google argued that compliance would " suggest that Google is willing to reveal information about those who use its services " .
Damn straight .
That 's exactly what Google 's privacy policy says it will do - not revealing directly who is using its services , but revealing information about the aggregate people who do .
The American public has strange attitudes about privacy .
It seems to be OK for Google to collect , store and maintain this massive database , sell it , lease it , or let other companies have access to it , charge advertising revenues based on it , but heaven forbid it should fall in the hands of the Government .
Indeed , the Google privacy policy goes on to ask the rhetorical question , " what protections do I have against intrusions by the Government into my use of Google services ? "
It answers this by saying : " Google does comply with valid legal process , such as search warrants , court orders , or subpoenas seeking personal information .
These same processes apply to all law - abiding companies .
As has always been the case , the primary protections you have against intrusions by the Government are the laws that apply to where you live . "
This is pretty standard fare .
What is different in this case is that Google is actually challenging the validity of a subpoena - a rare event for any company that gets paid little if anything from the people about whom it collects data .
The more general practice is for the Government to send over a copy of a subpoena or search warrant , and the ISP or search company to send over the documents - sometimes not even in that order .
Indeed , there is no requirement that the entity retaining your personal records notify you about the legal process to allow you to challenge it at your own expense - and often the Government requests , demands , or passes a law prohibiting the recipient from ever telling you about it - even if the underlying subpoena is itself invalid .
Indeed , there have been several reported cases where law enforcement officials have created " fake " subpoenas or court orders for ISP information , and even then the courts have held that the information was OK to use , because it did n't belong to the data subject .
The Google subpoena fight is n't really about the anonymous data at issue here today .
It is really about the way the Government can " deputize " unwilling private companies who collect and maintain massive databases to act as their agents in the future .
Want someone 's credit report ?
Do n't subscribe to Experian and subject yourself to the Fair Credit Reporting Act , just whip out a subpoena .
Want to engage in massive warrantless domestic surveillance of e-mail communications ?
Do n't mess with FISA , Title III , ECPA , or even any Presidential inherent authority .
Just pass a law ( like the ones just passed in Europe ) mandating that ISPs and phone companies retain such data , and then subpoena not just one person 's emails , but everyone 's - as long as it is relevant to some issue in some litigation somewhere .
Let 's just create a single massive database of what everyone is doing all the time , and let anyone " dip " into it whenever it is deemed to be relevant to settling some dispute .
It seems Orwell was off by about 22 years .

How to find out what is hot / talked about / popular on the web ?
Digg is a very popular service .
It lets you post a news that will get ranked and published according to the number of “ votes ” digg readers will give .
Another way to give power to internet users and find out easily what is really interesting out of the jungle in the web .
Like all many successful ideas Digg has many sisters and brothers all over the world .
Shoutwire , Commontimes , Threadwatch , Slashdot .
This is for english speaking users .
But you have also Tapemoi , Scoopeo and Fuzz for French , Meneame for Spanish and it is just a question of time before we see before our eyes a russian version as well as a german version .
I have thought a little bit about that system .
I believe it has strong limits due to its own “ rating ” and category system .
Indeed Digg and others can be used by webmasters to promote their own website / blog .
Which can be great as i experienced myself , but can give a biased view of the reality of the web as news submited ( even if relevant and popular ) does not reflect the TRUE popularity of what is talked about in the web and in particular in blogs .
Another limit .
The category system .
Digg is very much technology news oriented and others too .
Categories are fixed and does not let users submit specific or multiple categories either ( eg : culture / books ) .
I also realized that on some systems you can vote without registering ( tapemoi for example ) and therefore it will enable you to vote several times for the same post from different computers or by cancelling cookies .
And even in case of registration you can easily build a network of clickers with your friends …
That s when i discovered BlogsNow .
Behind a very basic and “ empty ” design , there is a very simple and powerful service that basically scans more than 22 millions blogs every 60 seconds and that ranks the 20 most refered URLS mentionned in the blogs .
No voting system , just a pure URL indexing system .
If Digg works on a directory mode , blogsnow works on a search engine mode .
And i would blogsnow more “ objectivity ” .
Interesting to compare at a given time difference of ranking between both systems .
It gives you at any given time the most used URLs and of course the list of blogs mentionning it .
Another way to get a true view of what is talked about in the blogosphere .
4 limits :
no RSS for this service
no categories ( for now )
a limit to 20 most refered URLS .
limit to blogs scanning
However i am ready to bet on further improvements and success of this service as well as copycats to come .
[ update 06/01 ] thanks for all your emails and comments .
I was since this post pointed to Scoopeo , another digg - like , i included above and also to reddit which has a a very interesting approach .
This self - funded company offers another option .
The personnal filter : it will learn what you like and will recommend links that you like .
Interesting also the top menu with easy access to hot ( most buzzed ) , new ( most recent ) , top ( most voted ) and recommended links ) .
Good luck to them .
PS : you can also of course use Technorati “ most search ” words to have a view of what s going on .
But it only refers to search activity and is updated every hour .
You can also use Blogpulse trends which gives graphs by trend topics , but is is more MACRO than MICRO approach .
Johnny Depp is still wearing his pirate teeth - gold and platinum and twinkling - and they look like they belong .
In many ways he was always a pirate - of hearts and souls at least .
He is a one - man subculture , a fairy tale you grew up with .
I have met him several times now .
The more I know him , the more I like him - but the more he seems to both contradict and confirm all the myths about him .
Did he fill the bath with champagne when he was with Kate Moss and have the barman come up and make some cocktails ?
No , but he would like to have done .
Did he chase the paparazzi in a most threatening manner when they tried to snap Vanessa Paradis 's baby tummy ?
Of course he did - anything to protect his girl .
Is it true that this edgy , dark , outsider actor , famed for playing losers , drug addicts , transvestites and various gothically lost souls in indie movies , is now a blockbuster superhero - or at least a super antihero ?
The first film in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy took $ 650 m ( £ 358 m ) at the box office and Depp's Captain Jack was nominated for Oscar gold .
It seems altogether a myth of reinvention - but it 's true .
For the Los Angeles premiere of Dead Man's Chest , there was a red carpet three miles long .
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer , who only ever intends to make blockbusters , says that the trilogy simply could n't have happened without Depp .
Bill Nighy , who rather surreally plays a giant squid pirate , says : " Johnny 's Jack Sparrow is one of those rare performances that has entered the language .
It will survive down the years and I can risk describing it as iconic . "
That 's quite a turnaround because at the onset of the first movie Depp was considered too edgy for Disney .
That is not to say that the man in front of me has gone soft .
He is still a pirate , going his own way , living by his own rules , which includes cancelling all his one - on - one international interviews except for me .
Now do you see why I love him ?
Maybe this is because Johnny would never let down anybody that he actually knew .
Or maybe it was because the last time we met , I gave him a dildo named Johnny .
There was a reason : he had just done The Libertine , playing the sexually omnivorous Earl of Rochester .
" It was a gorgeous gift " he says smiling naughtily .
" A great gift . "
People just want to give things to Johnny , except , of course , Disney , who did n't want to give him the part of Jack in the beginning .
" I took a lot of heat from Disney and the people that write the cheques , but I really did feel strongly that I was heading in the right direction , " he says .
" This was my take on Captain Jack .
This was who I thought he should be . "
Jack Sparrow is both a pirate hero and a pirate villain .
He appeals to little kids and hardened adults in equal measure .
He is charmless and charming , the perfect antidote of louche sexiness against the uptight Will Turner , played by Orlando Bloom .
Originally he said he based the character on a mixture of Pepé Le Pew , the Looney Tunes cartoon skunk , and Rolling Stone Keith Richards , whom he cajoled out of illness to play a pirate relative in the final Pirates film .
Is he going to be his dad ?
" Something like that , " Depp says coyly .
" He has to be a relative - there 's no way around that .
We did get together in a hotel room and dress up as pirates .
He looked beautiful in the clothes and his hair was in dreads .
Gorgeous !
Just gorgeous ! "
He laughs and twinkles .
Despite the " heavy amount of salesmanship involved " , there are aspects of being a pirate that Johnny truly loves .
He is wearing a grey fedora , tousled hair and soulful eyes .
They do n't miss anything and they reveal everything .
He has got a collection of bracelets , one made by his daughter , Lily Rose , another a cross wound round with drawings by his son , Jack .
He has Jack 's name tattooed on his arm and just above it , Jack Sparrow 's pirate crest .
Jack the son came before Jack the pirate .
There is also the famous Wino Forever tattoo , which used to be the famous Winona Forever tattoo .
His love affair with a good Bordeaux outlasted his relationship with the actor .
It is more than 20 years since Depp quit as the cutesy cop in the American television series 21 Jump Street , saying he did n't want to be a novelty boy " stapled to a box of cereal on a one - way collision course bound for the lunch box .
A franchise boy , fucked and plucked with no escape . "
And now , after What 's Eating Gilbert Grape , Edward Scissorhands , Ed Wood , Finding Neverland , Corpse Bride etc , I am the proud owner of a Captain Jack Sparrow doll with detachable bottle of rum .
" Do you have the one that talks ? " he asks excitedly .
" The one that talks speaks lines from the movie - but they did n't ask me to do it .
I do n't quite understand why .
He speaks like me but is not me . "
Now people thinking of him as a product does n't bother him because he knows he 's not one .
He does n't even see his own story as an arc of struggle , success , failure , triumph .
" I was in a cluster of movies that by Hollywood definitions were not successful .
They were flops .
I was considered box - office poison but to me they were all successful and I do n't feel any different about a success or failure .
I do n't know how to explain it , but by some miracle I have always been able to choose my characters for movies .
Being able to get jobs throughout the 90s when , in the language of Hollywood , I was box - office poison should have been hard , yet I was able to do every single film I wanted to do and with every film - maker I wanted to work with .
To me , whether I 'm playing Ed Wood or Fear and Loathing , all these movies have commercial potential .
Pirates could have easily flopped .
It 's always a crap shoot . "
For most of the 90s he was , by his own definition , " who I was before I became me " .
For the most part he pursued dark characters in movies and dark love .
Or at least wrong love .
There were relationships with actors Sherilyn Fenn , Jennifer Grey and Winona Ryder , plus , most mythically , Kate Moss .
" I felt weirdness for many years .
I went through periods where I wasted time and felt awful about stuff .
Just not comfortable in my own skin . "
Drugs for him were never recreational ; they were to anaesthetise .
The seismic shift came not when his friend River Phoenix died of an overdose outside the club that Depp part - owned , the Viper Room in West Hollywood , but with the birth of his daughter , Lily Rose .
Coming from anyone else , this would seem contrived , ridiculous , pretentious .
Coming from him , it seems a simple fact .
" It was not just the greatest thing that ever happened , " he says .
" It 's the only thing that ever happened to me .
I helped give our daughter life and she gave me life . "
Lily Rose is now seven and Jack is four .
There 's very much a sense that Vanessa Paradis was not just the right woman , but she came at the right time .
He was ready for children and she became pregnant three months after they met .
" You have this feeling . . .
I can't really explain it but I had it when I saw Vanessa .
I first saw her across a room , just her back , and it was an instant thought of , oh my God , what 's happening ?
But even then I had no way of knowing how great a person she was and how great a mother she would be . "
I read a rumour that he wanted to take a step back from movie - making so that Paradis could work more .
" There is some truth in that , although they are n't going to let me take a break soon .
I wo n't get much time off for the next couple of years . "
He has coaxed Bruce Robinson , of Withnail And I fame , to direct The Rum Diary , based on a Hunter S Thompson book , and he is producing and starring in Shantaram , an adaptation of Gregory David Roberts ' novel about an Australian heroin addict who escapes prison and becomes a doctor in the slums of India .
Is he worried that Vanessa working will change the dynamic of their relationship ?
" No , " he says , mystified .
" If she wants to work , she certainly can .
She 's been working on her album and I think she 'll tour with that .
As far as movies are concerned , nothing 's come up that she 's interested in .
When we first got together , she was on tour and I was ' tour daddy ' on the road .
For a lot of time it was just me and my daughter .
We 've always been very good about being able to control distance and separation .
When I was doing Pirates in Dominica , I did n't bring them to the location because it was a pain in the ass - three planes - for them to get there .
But you get to the point where you 've been working away for three weeks and you 're just trying to maintain yourself until you see them again .
It was tough , really tough , and I would n't do it for more than three weeks . "
Although he says this very gently you know it 's something he would be unmoveable on .
He 's grounded in his family , not his work , and must relish his present stability .
He was born in Kentuck and grew up in Florida , where his parents - mother a waitress , father a civil engineer - split up when he was 15 .
" I was pretty much ready to leave myself , and did so not long after that .
They had had a prickly relationship for a number of years , so on the one hand it was a relief .
On the other it was a radical change for my mum and she got very ill .
So there was never any time for that kid to feel bad about the parents splitting up because the kid in me had to go straight to the mom to look after her to make sure she was OK .
There was never time for the mourning of the loss of family . "
Perhaps he did his mourning subconsciously .
Perhaps that 's what he means when he says " I was revealed to myself " when he found himself in a family again .
Here 's the contradiction : Johnny Depp seems straightforward but you know he 's complex .
" Well , " he says , " I was given the ' weird ' badge but I think everybody 's weird and that 's the key to it .
We should celebrate our individuality , not be embarrassed or ashamed of it .
We all have idiosyncrasies , tics that are obsessive - compulsive .
People do themselves a great disservice by not allowing themselves to see who they really are because they are afraid . "
Maybe that 's why we all love Johnny - because we 're all weird and he lets us embrace it .
It seems pretty weird that in the meantime we cannot be sure about the urban myths of things that have happened and things that are supposed to have happened .
For instance , I read that he was going to play Michael Hutchence in a movie .
" I have read that and it's not true , " he says .
" Michael was a beautiful person and an interesting guy .
He spoke fluent Chinese .
He was the 007 of rock 'n'roll .
I 'd like him to be remembered in a different way than that INXS TV show where they auditioned to replace him . "
I also read that Kate Moss was going to play opposite him as Paula Yates , I tell him .
He falls back in his chair .
First his eyes are frozen in shock and then he laughs .
" That 's a stretch !
Paula was so different from Kate physically and in every other way .
Wow , somebody really went for it when they wrote that story . "
He jumps up and frisks the room for an ashtray ; he needs to roll a liquorice - paper cigarette to calm him after that one .
The mention of Kate charges the room a little .
He sends his support and his love for her from afar .
" She 's a great girl .
She 's got a great brain on her .
I sent out signals of support to the best of my ability to express the shock of the treatment she got by the press dragging her through the mud like that , " he told me last time we met .
He predicted that she would come back stronger than ever .
He knows her in a deep way but not in a day - to - day way any more .
" I was not good for Kate , " he once told me with a lingering sadness .
One suspects , though , that that is not why they are no longer in touch .
He is hugely loyal , hugely old - fashioned , and I think he just wants to be involved with Vanessa , so much so that even a screen kiss with Keira Knightley for Dead Man's Chest got him twitchy and feeling a little awkward .
Another rumour I had read was that he wanted to move to London , next door to Liam Gallagher .
" Ten or 12 years ago that might have been true .
No disrespect to Liam , but I do n't think he 's the guy I want for my neighbour and I guarantee he would n't want me .
I like London but if I lived there - for an outsider like me it would lose the magic . "
Does he still think of himself as an outsider ?
" I meant ' foreigner ' , but I do n't think I ever felt like an outsider in the way you mean .
I just never felt like an insider .
And I was never really interested in being one . "
You mean you do n't want to throw televisions out of the window any more ?
" Well , as I said , having kids changed that a lot .
It revealed a lot .
But I still have that stuff in me , the hillbilly rage as it's been called .
I may even break a television set here and there ; it just does n't get written about because I 'm not doing it in a hotel .
I basically wrote off all spirits because they get me into trouble , although a good bottle of rum can be pretty spectacular .
But there are endless files in the human body that I can access .
The hillbilly rage is somewhere in there - it 's genetic , it 's part of your conditioning and your upbringing .
Playing these kind of characters in films just gives me the opportunity to relieve myself of this kind of stuff .
Captain Jack does that for me in a weird kind of way .
Its given me the key to fun . "
So for now , Johnny Depp is ready to look elegantly wrecked , sashaying into a further pirate adventure before he hangs up Captain Jack 's cutlass forever .
We hug goodbye and it's a warm and proper hug where I tell him he 's lovely and he squeezes me tighter .
Outside , hundreds of the world 's foreign press are gathered waiting to kill me because of what went on between me and Johnny in the hotel room .
Later again , sitting in the hotel cafe on Wilshire Boulevard , blood - curdling screams suddenly rip into the evening air : " JOHNNY !
JOHNNY ! JOHNNY ! " Some kids have found out that he is inside the hotel .
They 're flailing their arms , legs , everything , just like the thousands who turned up the day before at the premiere , none of whom Johnny wanted to disappoint .
He signed everything , greeted every fan and had to be dragged into the movie .
He wo n't be allowed to let go of Captain Jack quite yet .
Maybe he never will .
When Yadong Wang , a chemist by training , first ventured into nerve regeneration two years ago , he did n't know that his peers would have considered him crazy .
His idea was simple : Because neural circuits use electrical signals often conducted by neurotransmitters ( chemical messengers ) to communicate between the brain and the rest of the body , he could build neurotransmitters into the material used to repair a broken circuit .
The neurotransmitters could coax the neurons in the damaged nerves to regrow and reconnect with their target organ .
Strange though his idea might have seemed to others in his field , Wang , an assistant professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University , discovered that he could integrate dopamine , a type of neurotransmitter , into a polymer to stimulate nerve tissues to send out new connections .
The discovery is the first step toward the eventual goal of implanting the new polymer into patients suffering from neurological disorders to help repair damaged nerves .
The findings were published online the week of Oct. 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
" We showed that you could use a neurotransmitter as a building block of a polymer , " said Wang .
" Once integrated into the polymer , the transmitter can still elicit a specific response from nerve tissues . "
The " designer " polymer was recognized by the neurons when used on a small piece of nerve tissue and stimulated extensive neural growth .
The implanted polymer did n't cause any tissue scarring or nerve degeneration , allowing the nerve to grow in a hostile environment post injury .
When ready for clinical use , the polymer would be implanted at the damaged site to promote nerve regeneration .
As the nerve tissue reforms , the polymer degrades .
Wang 's team found that dopamine 's structure , which contains two hydroxyl groups , is vital for the material 's neuroactivity .
Removing even one group caused a complete loss of the biological activity .
They also determined that dopamine was more effective at differentiating nerve cells than the two most popular materials for culturing nerves -- polylysine and laminin .
This ability means that the material with dopamine may have a better chance to successfully repair damaged nerves .
The success of dopamine has encouraged the team to set its sights on other neurotransmitters .
" Dopamine was a good starting point , but we are looking into other neurotransmitters as well , " Wang said .
The team 's next step is to verify findings that the material stimulates the reformation of synapses in addition to regrowth .
" A successful nerve regeneration will require the nerve to synapse with the target organ , " Wang said .
" Since we 've written this paper , we 've also been able to get the nerves to form extensive synapses , which is a step in the right direction . "

Do you have one of those issues where you argue with yourself ?
Where you just are n't sure what you actually think because there are so many messages and opinions on the topic around you ?
I have more than one like this .
However , there is one topic that has been struggling to the top of my mind recently : vanity and perceived vanity .
Can vanity be a good thing ?
Vanity has historically been truly reviled .
Vanity is number seven of the Seven Deadly Sins .
It 's the doppleganger of number seven on the Seven Holy Virtues list : humility .
There are many moralistic tales of how vanity makes you evil and brings about a spectacular downfall .
Consider the lady who bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth .
Google Borgia +vanity and find plenty .
The Brothers Grimm and Disney got in on the act too .
The Disney message seems to be : the truly beautiful do n't need to be vain .
They are just naturally eye - catchingly gorgeous .
And they are all gorgeous .
Show me the Reubenesque Princess .
Princ…
The gods receive daily guidance from many people .
I have acquaintances who assure me that Yahweh wants them to kill all the Arabs and populate Philistia exclusively with Khazars .
Other friends tell me that Allah instead would prefer that all the Khazars leave Canaan and return to New York , which God instructed them to confiscate from the Amerinds .
Local Southern Baptists regale me with tales of how the Son of God , Yoshua ben - Yosef , turned wine into water at Cana and made Galilee into a dry county .
They consider it their religious duty to conquer the holy oil reserves of Mecca and burn them as sacrifices in their consecrated SUVs .
So the many gods receive many different and conflicting instructions .
Some foolish agnostics have concluded from this that there are no gods .
This is bad reasoning .
There are almost certainly an enormous number of gods .
A pantheon , a surfeit of gods .
But just because someone is a god does n't mean you can take her seriously .
To make sense of all this , let us look at the Linnaean phylogeny of the gods :
Classification Of Gods
1. Technologically Advanced Alien Grad Students ( John Frum , Kosius kodos ) 2 . Simulation Programmers ( Nerdus matrixus ) 3 . Memes ( Deus dawkinsus ) 4 . Transcendent Beings ( Ahura - mazda , Horus , Pallas Athena , Xena , et. al. )
One ( of many ) insoluble problems of theology is differentiating the types .
( Integration is practically impossible without a graphing calculator ) .
There is no way for a mere human mind to tell types 1 , 2 and 4 apart , and many humans are even fooled by type 3 .
Nor is there any way for our limited knowledge and intelligence to determine which , if any , gods are good .
Most of us can't even pick a decent mutual fund , and yet somehow we are expected to see through the complex motivations of transcendent beings on pain of eternal damnation ( only 9 - billion - year damnation for Buddhists .
It 's a much better deal , if you think about it ) .
Well , one commonly advocated solution is indexing .
Simply purchase an equally weighted interest in every supernatural or apparently supernatural being , and make contributions via payroll deduction over time .
The problem with this approach is that you can't determine whether you are purchasing more good or more evil .
The tax and eschatological consequences may be complex , and an infinite amount of record - keeping would be involved .
Before we give up and adopt theo - indexing , let 's look at a few case studies and try to avoid these theo - business errors .
First case study : a Type I case .
Yes , humans have met advanced aliens , not that long ago .
John Frum ( The Advanced Alien )
In the 1600s , New Guinea experienced a wave of UFO sightings .
These Unidentified Floating Objects behaved in supernatural fashion : traveling over the ocean without paddling at impossibly high speeds .
Bigger than any log ever recorded , they were clearly beyond human technology .
Those who ignored the UFO sightings as kava - induced dreams soon regretted it .
Near - humanoid gods from the UFOs soon landed .
They killed those who failed to worship and propitiate them properly , with thunder from great distances .
Then the probings and abductions began .
But some New Guineans learned to coexist with the gods .
They sold them food ( or perhaps unwanted relatives ) for supernatural objects : Cargo .
Cargo allowed you to cut down trees , butcher hogs , dazzle women .
A new religion was born , the Cargo Cult .
They built watch fires and prayed for the return of ' John Frum , ' with Cargo for all the faithful .
John Frum was busy elsewhere for centuries , as is common with gods of various sorts .
Then , in the 1920s , he dropped into the middle of the New Guinea highlands in his trimotor magic flying house .
He paid in Cargo and kina shells for the soft , valueless metal he called ' gold . '
This caused a kina shell inflation , but little theological innovation .
In the 1940s , Cargo Cult prophecy was fulfilled .
Thousands of flying houses dropped bulldozers and US soldiers all over New Guinea .
They revealed the sacred rituals that summon Cargo : first you clear a sacred landing strip .
Then you build a sacred landing beacon fire , and say certain prayers ( into a radio , but this point was largely ungrasped ) .
Then canned food , machine guns , penicillin , and tens of thousands of blood - crazed war gods drop into your world .
It 's more fun than digging taro roots !
The Cargo Cultists maintained their religion long after the departure of US troops , continuing to build the sacred landing strips and beacon fires .
Sadly , they had not actually grasped the true secret of Cargo ( or radio ) .
When they asked missionaries for the secret , the missionaries told them a bunch of Keynesian nonsense about government spending being necessary to prime the economy .
Having been through Keynesianism already with the kina shell debacle , the Cultists became a trifle miffed with missionaries .
What can we learn from Cargo Cultists ?
A lot !
Their gods actually did exist , and had real superpowers .
But worshipping them was a big , big mistake .
The same could be true for us .
Alien grad students could become very bored in their million - year quest to finish their Ph.D. theses .
Could we blame them for using their advanced physics to appear as angels and tell us poor primitives to build the Pyramids , or to go to Canaan and kill all the natives ?
Yes , but we could blame the idiots who believed them even more .
Just because someone has better technology than you , does n't make them nicer ' or easier to fact - check .
An even more extreme version of the advanced - alien problem is when they sneak into your bedroom while you 're sleeping , disconnect your brain and hook it up to a computer .
Now they can sell you any kind of baloney , and there 's no way for you to fact - check it at all .
They could even make you think you 're reading an article about New Guinea natives , and that you find it interesting .
The Programmer
It is obvious that most intelligent beings live in simulations .
Every real universe with intelligent beings generates huge numbers of simulations , for purposes from safety testing to entertainment .
( Our universe is called ' South Park ' by its unsavory audience of gods with poor taste ) .
Thus , the programmers of the simulations appear as gods to the simulated , complete with supernatural powers , bizarre motivations , and occasional glitches .
Reincarnation , miracles , and even passing to the ' real ' world ( or at least a higher - level simulation ) may well be commonplace .
Does this make the programmers morally superior to the simulated ?
Or even , necessarily , smarter ?
Nope .
Memes
Real gods might have a lot of motivations .
But real supernatural beings do n't need money , and they do n't cease to exist if you do n't believe in them .
Memes , on the other hand , need your money and your mind to exist and to reproduce themselves .
So a certain class of memes exist as extremely vicious god-mimics .
Memes follow the same evolutionary rules as viruses ; memes do n't ' care ' about the brains they infect , only about maximizing their own propagation .
But mutualistic memes that confer advantages to their hosts can gain an advantage over self - destructive or random memes .
Successful early mutualistic memes must have included Flint Pressure Flaking and Firemaking .
Today 's equivalent mutualistic technical memes , such as Nuclear Power and Genetic Engineering , are so big that they wo n't fit into a single human brain and can only propagate through archives of books and computers .
But some of the small , early , mutualistic memes are still important ;
Trade , for instance .
Unfortunately , mutualism is only one strategy that a virus or meme can use .
A meme can also attain competitive advantage by destroying other memes and the brains that carry them .
Successful parasitic memes take control of the reward circuits of the host brains , making them ' feel good ' about their aggressive and destructive behaviors .
They also suppress the ability of the host brain to take in new memes , and in extreme cases like ' Islam , ' may ban all other memes entirely .
Modern memes such as Tai Ping , National Socialism , Stalinism , Maoism , Khmer Rouge , etc. have all used parasitic strategies to kill off competing memes ( and millions of their human hosts ) .
These parasitic strategies may even be directly against the survival interests of the parasitic meme itself .
National Socialism used its hosts to attack the hosts of Holy Land , physically destroying all those it claimed to be Holy Land hosts in death camps .
Stalinism destroyed even more human hosts of competing memes in even bigger death camps .
Stalinism also destroyed all copies of the mutualistic meme Darwin Evolution that it could reach , replacing them with the nonfunctional Lysenko Evolution meme .
These internal wars weakened Stalinism and National Socialism against external foes .
Genocidal , parasitic memes have been around for thousands of years .
For example , the Holy Land meme has lived for thousands of years , growing , mutating , and spreading itself with no regard for the lives of its human hosts .
Sometime during the reigns of the Middle Eastern god-kings who ruled through memes , Holy Land infected the tribes known to Egyptian recordkeepers as the Habiru ( ' Hebrews ' ) .
It forced the Habiru to storm into the plain between the Fertile Crescent and Egypt , in a genocidal campaign to exterminate and / or enslave all the previous inhabitants and destroy the memory of their cultures ( i.e. the competing memes ) .
Later , from the second century BC on , Holy Land fought the Greek Culture and Imperial Roman memes , and was decisively defeated in 135 AD .
Holy Land was forcibly cleared from Philistia and the area was taken by Imperial .
But then in the 300s , Constantine mixed the mutant anti-Roman Holy Land Messiah meme with other memes ( including Mithra and Sun Worship ) , and created the pro-Empire Catholic meme .
The Catholic meme fought for the Empire , but still had elements of Holy Land in its basic structure .
Around 1000 AD , Catholic reverted back to the original program of Holy Land and went back to trying to conquer the area around Jerusalem and exterminate the inhabitants .
After centuries of genocidal war , Catholic was driven out of the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean by a newer mutation of Holy Land that occurred in the early 600s AD , called Islam .
Meanwhile , after its defeat in 135 AD , the remnants of the original Holy Land were carried up into Iraq on scrolls by remnants of the Habiru .
From there it spread to Central Asia ; around 740 AD the ruler of the Khazars forcibly infected all the Khazars with Holy Land , probably to stop Islam and Eastern Orthodox , which he could n't control .
Khazars carrying Holy Land migrated to Eastern Europe after their defeat by Mongol tribes running KhaKhan .
The Khazars are now called Ashkenazim , and some of them still carry Holy Land and fire Hellfire missiles at suicide - bomber hosts of Islam .
Now another mutation of Holy Land has entered the meme war .
A distant descendant of Catholic , Telefundamentalist infects a significant number of Americans .
To get the electoral support of Telefundamentalist , American Presidents support Holy Land against Islam with vast quantities of foreign aid .
Our current President is trying to mobilize all the citizens of the US and all their varied memes in a general Jihad against Islam .
So the cycle of destruction continues .
Parasitic memes will continue to fight over Jerusalem until there is nothing there but a nuclear blast crater .
Then the memes will mutate in Diaspora hosts and fight over the Wailing Crater , using ever - more - powerful weapons provided by helpful , mutualistic , technical memes until a final antimatter blast turns the Holy Land into the Holy Cosmic Rays , sending the bare nuclei of holy dirt molecules expanding out into the Galaxy at near the speed of light .
Ironically , in the end there is no meaningful difference between different strains of the parasitic memes .
Memes can even be identical in every respect but name , and still fight to the death .
National Socialist is essentially no different from Stalinist or Khmer Rouge or Telefundamentalist .
All of them will try to destroy all other memes and take over every brain by force .
Of course , some memes are more virulent than others .
This is why Kim Il Sung and Castro have physical barriers around their regimes ; a month of exposure to supervirulent modern advertising memes would infect the present hosts of Beard Communism and Starvation Communism to the point that the original memes would be outnumbered and displaced from power .
So , how do we end the meme wars ?
We do n't , if we want life to continue to increase in complexity , diversity , and range .
No meme can be allowed to win and impose the peace of stasis ; we call times when single memes dominated Dark Ages .
The Liberty meme is our best countermeasure .
Liberty promises that all other memes will be allowed to survive and copy themselves , but that they must refrain from acquiring hosts by forcible means .
Liberty promises that minds will have access to all memes ; mutualistic memes will tend to predominate as the minds they infect prosper and proliferate .
If Liberty is present in a sufficient proportion of minds , we will be able to use the mutualistic , technical memes like Nuclear Propulsion to spread life throughout the galaxy .
The Liberty meme leaves room for Life Extension , Mars Terraforming , Asteroid Colonies , Drain The Van Allen Belts , and the general proliferation of complex life and memes .
But Liberty can probably never win a final victory .
Any mutation of Liberty that starts forcibly exterminating memes ( as opposed to destroying hosts running active copies of force - using memes , which is permissible ) is by definition a defective copy , and must be attacked by other copies of Liberty .
And of course , all hosts of Liberty must copy this meme and infect as many others with it as possible . . . . just kidding no I 'm not ; copy and send to entire address book .
And if there are any real gods trying to help us , Liberty allows them to be heard .
Any ' god ' that tries to use human force to wipe out other memes is just a meme itself .
Transcendent Beings
Somewhere above all the levels of simulation , perhaps there is a ' real ' universe where superpowerful beings spend part of eternity contemplating how to make your life better .
Perhaps they will contact you via angel or email .
If they do , ask them for the chemical structure for a safe and effective cancer cure ( maybe a telomerase inhibitor ) , or for the secret of the Bowhead 's 200 - year lifespan , or for a General Unified Physics equation .
If they really are transcendent beings , they wo n't have any trouble coming up with it .
If they 're just a meme , they wo n't know any more than you do .
In any case , gods of all kinds must be held to at least the moral standards of humans .
If they tell you to commit genocide , donate your income to huge institutions with poor audit trails , drown your children , or commit other destructive actions , then forget 'em .
We human beings can cause enough trouble on our own .
None of this essay should be taken as theo - investment advice .

Are We ON The Same Side ?
post # 242 — November 17 , 2006 — a Managing post
What follows began as a piece that I wrote for PSVillage.com ( a great location for IT professionals ) , and I plan to expand it into a longer article if you all find it interesting and worth commenting on .
Here it is :
In the November 6 issue of The Wall Street Journal ( page B1 ) there was an article by Erin White and Gregory Zuckerman entitled The Private Equity CEO , which explored how life for a CEO changed when a company went from being publicly - held to being owned by private equity investors .
What caught my attention was this excerpt :
â€ œMr. Bilborough ( the CEO of privately - held Generation Brands ) says one of his biggest challenges is motivating employees amid uncertainty .
Most companies controlled by private equity are sold within three to seven years .
Senior executives receive equity , which can be lucrative .
But middle managers and lower - level staffers typically donâ€™t get stock .
â€ ˜Youâ€ ™re trying to lead an organization where everybody knows weâ€™re going to be sold , said Mr. Bilborough .
â€˜It just hangs over them like a cloud as a constant distraction for people .
â€™â€ 
Exactly !
When management and employees have very different vested interests and incentives , employees really begin to question whether everyoneâ€™s on the same side .
They begin to ask â€ œIs management doing this because itâ€™s good for the company , or because itâ€™s good for them ?â€ 
People begin to wonder : â€ œAre we in this together or not ?â€ 
By the way , before you get too far in reading this , donâ€™t think Iâ€™m only talking about â€ œTHEMâ€ — the top people in large companies .
These tensions apply to all of us , even if we manage only a small project team — or even if we donâ€™t manage anybody , but just have to collaborate with others on a project or across departments .
People will always be asking :
a) What time - frame are you using for your decisions ; and
b ) Are we in this together or not ?
We are all tempted by ( and seek ) immediate gratification , and doing things that pay - off in the short term .
Underinvesting in our future is something we all due as individuals and human beings , not just as organizations .
And weâ€™ve all probably done something , sometime , where we were seen as looking out for ourselves rather than the team .
The timeframe issue is crucial , because itâ€™s hard to get your team to accomplish things that take time if they think that you , their manager , is acting with a shorter — term horizon .
This is not a matter of morality ( like some Animal Farm chant of â€œlong - term good , short - term badâ€ ) .
Itâ€™s OK to be either at different times , but you need to be honest and self - aware about which game youâ€ ™re playing .
Managers need to learn that they rarely fool anyone else about their timeframe , and itâ€™s dangerous to try and fool yourself !
So , putting all this together , there could be four outcomes of how people view you :
Youâ€ ™re in it for yourself and want a quick payback for your efforts .
Youâ€™ll â€˜play ballâ€™ as a team player as long as the team is working , but will bail out if it stops working for you .
Youâ€ ™re in it for the longer term , but youâ€ ™re still primarily focused on yourself .
Youâ€ ™re both a team player and in it for the long haul .
Which way do your people see you ?
Note that these questions donâ€™t necessarily have to have permanent answers .
People will come to a judgement about which game you are playing THIS TIME .
In my latest article called â€ œAccountability : Effective Managers Go Firstâ€ 
I argued that the best managers work hard to remove the distance between themselves and those they manage .
By this phrase , I donâ€™t mean you have to get â€œbuddy , buddyâ€ with those you manage , but , if you DO want them to pull out all the stops on behalf of you team , then those being managed need to feel that the manager is part of the team , not separate from it .
Managers and managed need to be â€œon the same side .â€ 
All too often they are not .
If the people you are trying to manage think youâ€ ™re not on their side , or are only trying to meet short - term goals , youâ€™ll have a lot less ability to influence them .
Youâ€™ll be able to manage them because they ( temporarily ) want to keep their job , but its unlikely they are going to put their hearts and minds into your teamâ€™s activities .
Youâ€™ll get todayâ€™s sausages made and shipped , but you wonâ€™t be going anywhere new as an organization .
So , those are my thoughts .
Your reactions , please ?
To ‘ lick one ’s wounds ’ is not just a figure of speech .
It is actually beneficial to do so ; human saliva contains antimicrobial com- pounds , and the saliva of rodents is known to contain nerve growth factor .
Now , we can add pain killers to the list of useful substances found in saliva : a team of neuroendocrinologists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris have found that human saliva contains an analgesic neuropeptide .
The peptide , which has been named opiorphin , is six times more potent than morphine , and its mechanism of action could lead to the development of new pain killers .
The analgesic effects of opiorphin are produced by its actions on the opioid system , which consists of three families of endogenous opioids ( the enkephalins , endorphins and dynorphins ) and the opioid receptors to which they bind .
The opioid peptides are short peptides which are synthesized in the brain , and released at nerve terminals in the spinal cord in response to pain .
By binding to opioid receptors on sensory neurons , they block the transmission of pain signals to the brain , but their actions are short - lived because , like all neurochemical transmitters , they are quickly broken down by enzymes .
In the absence of pain , the endogenous opioids produce feelings of euphoria .
The structure of synthetic opioids such as morphine and heroine resembles those of the endogenous opioids , and these drugs mimic the actions of endogenous opioids by binding to opioid receptors ( endorphin is an abbreviation of endogenous morphine ) .
Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Catherine Rougeot and her colleagues show that the analgesic effect of opiorphin is produced by the inhibition of two called ectopeptidases ( human neutral ecto - endopeptidase , hNEP and human ecto - aminopeptidase , hAP - N ) , which normally break down enkephalins .
By inhibiting these enzymes , opiorphin prolongs the actions of enkephalins at synapses in the spinal cord .
Rougeot ’s team carried out a series of behavioural tests to determine the effect of opiorphin on chemically - and mechanically - induced pain in rats .
Administration of opiorphin led to decreased paw - licking in rats which had been injected with a pain - inducing chemical and also to reduced pain in the ‘ pin - pain ’ test , in which the animals are placed on a surface overlaid with vertical stainless steel pins .
Both of these tests provide strong evidence that opiorphin had significant anti-nociceptive effects .
Opiorphin is closely related to sialorphin , another analgesic discovered by the same group three years ago .
Sialorphin is synthesized predominantly in the submandibular and prostate glands of adult rats , is released in response to stress , and acts by inhibiting the enzymatic degradation of enkephalin and substance P , another neuropeptide released by sensory neuron terminals in response to painful stimuli .
A Chinese journalist has uncovered a secret detention center in northern China that is being used by a hospital to harvest human organs for sale to domestic and international buyers .
Jin Zhong , a pseudonym for the journalist who fled China recently , also said in an interview that a failed Chinese intelligence operation led to the 2004 death of a Japanese diplomat who committed suicide rather than give up secrets .
On the prisoner abuse , Mr. Jin said he first learned of the harvesting operation between October and December and that the prisoners used were members of the outlawed Falun Gong religious group .
“ This is murder , and murder sponsored by a state , ” said Mr. Jin , who in the past has been a contributor to a Japanese news agency .
“ It must be stopped . ”
Mr. Jin said he came across the underground detention center while researching the Chinese government ’s response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) .
A Chinese official was the first person to reveal that secret medical work was being done at the Liaoning Provincial Thrombosis Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine , in Sujiatun , a suburb of Shenyang , the major city in northeastern China , he said .
Mr. Jin then said he found out that a large underground prison was built beneath the hospital and that members of the outlawed Falun Gong religious group were being held there .
As many as 6,000 people are thought to be held prisoner at the underground facility , he said .
The hospital is harvesting the organs of the prisoners , including kidneys , livers , and eye parts , he said .
The organs are then sold to people , from both China and abroad , who need medical organ transplants .
One source for Mr. Jin was the wife of a hospital doctor who was involved in the organ harvesting .
The doctor suffered psychological problems as a result of the gruesome medical work and disclosed the secret activity .
The Chinese woman also has fled to the United States .
Several other hospital workers also revealed details about the prisoner organ harvesting .
Mr. Jin said he had to hide his true identity after being threatened by Chinese government agents .
He was arrested twice for his reporting and recently fled to the United States , where he hopes to seek political asylum .
Mr. Jin said bodies of the prisoners were burned in the boiler room of the hospital and that boiler room workers had taken jewelry and watches from the dead and sold them .
He said he has provided information about the organ harvesting to U.S. government officials , including members of Congress .
A Chinese Embassy spokesman could not be reached for comment .
Regarding the Japanese diplomat , Mr. Jin said he first learned of the intelligence operation in December .
Japan ’s government protested the Chinese intelligence operation , which Beijing dismissed as a groundless accusation .

Quigo : The next Google ?
Privately held search firm Quigo is quietly winning business from Google and Yahoo !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
You 've heard of Google and Yahoo !
But how about Quigo ?
Quigo is not the household name that these other two search giants are .
But the privately held company , which competes with Google ( Charts ) and Yahoo ( Charts ) in a key part of the online advertising business , is quietly becoming a bigger player .
Google and Yahoo ! are the industry leaders in search but a private company called Quigo is gaining some contextual advertising customers with its AdSonar product .
Quigo sells a product called AdSonar to online publishers .
AdSonar , like Google 's AdSense and Yahoo's Content Match , combs through Web pages and serves up relevant ads based on the text on the page .
CNN.com and CNNMoney.com , for example , use Yahoo's Content Match on their sites and many other online media firms use either Content Match or AdSense .
( Time Warner ( Charts ) owns CNN.com and CNNMoney.com . )
But a growing number of companies are beginning to favor AdSonar .
In July , Cox Newspapers , which owns 17 daily newspapers , including The Atlanta Journal - Constitution and Austin American - Statesman , said it would begin using AdSonar .
And earlier this month , Quigo scored a big victory when ESPN.com announced that it would begin using AdSonar this fall .
The popular sports news site had been using Yahoo's Content Match .
Other sites that use AdSonar are USAToday.com , News Corp .'s ( Charts ) FoxNews.com and MarthaStewart.com .
How is such a small company able to compete against the Internet 's two established search titans ?
Banking on wariness of Google and Yahoo
Greg Sterling , principal of Sterling Market Intelligence , a research firm focusing on Internet advertising , said that Quigo is able to sell itself as a company that truly just wants to be a partner to other media firms , and not a rival .
To that end , Quigo is not trying to be an online media company competing with " old " media firms for traffic and ad dollars .
Quigo is n't billing itself as a site where people can go to check e-mail , read news , look at job listings or watch videos .
" Quigo is benefiting from a perception of independence .
There is general angst about the power that Google and Yahoo have and Quigo is able to sell against that .
They have quietly replaced Google and Yahoo in a lot of newspapers for that reason , " Sterling said .
Henry Vogel , the chief revenue officer for Quigo , agreed that his firm has been able to take advantage of the fact that it 's not viewed as a threat .
Along those lines , Quigo also sells a private - label version of AdSonar that allows web site owners to have a direct relationship with advertisers bidding for placement in the contextual link spots .
With this product , Web sites are able to pocket more of the money from contextual ad sales and wind up with more relevant ads than they 'd get from tapping into AdSense or Content Match , Vogel said .
" Google 's and Yahoo 's publisher networks are blind networks .
Google and Yahoo sit in the middle , " Vogel said .
" So from a publisher 's standpoint , you 're getting a check but you do n't own the relationship with the advertiser .
The private label approach makes publishers more money because advertisers will bid up . "
Andrew Frank , research director with tech research firm Gartner , said that companies like Quigo can thrive if they focus on a particular niche .
And in the case of Quigo , that niche could be local advertising through the private label version of AdSonar for newspaper companies .
" A lot of companies are finding that by focusing on specialized capabilities , they can actually find customers on the publishing side and advertising side that have n't bought into the ad network duopoly , " Frank said .
But other big media firms think AdSonar is a compelling alternative to the big boys of search .
Tim Dolman , vice president of strategy and business development for ESPN New Media , said having the ability to sell its own contextual ads rather than rely on Yahoo's network was the main reason ESPN.com decided to switch to AdSonar .
" Yahoo and Quigo both have good products but we liked the idea of having a little more control of our own destiny in having a private label service .
Advertisers have the opportunity to buy ads on ESPN.com on its own merits , " said Dolman .
Irrelevant results and increased competition create risks
Still , contextual search technology appears to be far from perfect , which raises questions about just how effective this form of advertising can be .
" There 's a lot of variation in relevancy .
All ad networks are not created equal , " said Frank .
For example , CNN.com and FoxNews.com both ran the same Associated Press story about the bagged spinach E.coli outbreak on Friday and this reporter looked at the contextual ads that ran on both sites .
( Remember , CNN.com uses Content Match and Fox uses AdSonar ) .
In the CNN story , there were generic links to " fitness " and " vitamin supplement " ads .
But the main contextual links that came up in the CNN story were for Internet phone service Vonage ( Charts ) , mortgage comparison site LowerMyBills.com and ProForm , which makes treadmills and other exercise equipment .
Only the ProForm ad can be truly considered a kind of relevant link since the company 's products are related to healthy living .
It was slightly better on FoxNews though .
One of the two contextual links that came up on the FoxNews story was for diet company NutriSystem .
That 's more relevant in a story about food than an ad for Vonage .
The other ad was more of a stretch but still was health - related .
It was for CigArrest , a company that makes herbal gums and lozenges to help people quit smoking .
" Quigo has been savvy and has good technology , " Sterling said .
Whether Quigo can truly become a big thorn in the side of Google and Yahoo remains to be seen .
Vogel would not comment about how much revenue the company was making or whether or not it was profitable .
But Quigo has some high - profile financial backers , which could bode well for the future .
Venture capital firm Highland Capital , which funded several Net firms that were subsequently acquired , including Ask.com , Lycos and MapQuest , is one of Quigo 's biggest investors .
Steamboat Ventures , the venture capital arm of Walt Disney ( Charts ) , which also owns ESPN.com , has a stake in Quigo as well .
Still , Quigo is n't the only company gunning for Google 's and Yahoo 's business .
Frank said that Vibrant Media , a privately held firm that sells a product which places ads that pop up over highlighted keywords within the text of a Web page , is worth keeping an eye on .
He also said that Linkstorm , which generates a menu of links that a reader can see when mousing over a word , also has interesting technology .

どうしてフリー・ソフトウェアのユーザビリティはアレなのか
Why Free Software usability tends to suck
Matthew Thomas さんの2002年4月13日のブログエントリ、
“ Why Free Software usability tends to suck ” の日本語訳です（現在はリンク切れになってますが、Internet Archive でアーカイブが読めます）。僕はこれを Joel on Software の 「 5つの世界」で（正確には書籍のほうを読んで）知りました。このエントリはいろいろと論争を巻き起こした有名なもののようですが、どうやら当時の日本ではあんまり言及されてなかったみたいなので（≒
Google で見つからなかったってことですけど）、いまさらながら日本語にしてみました。
どうしてフリー・ソフトウェアのユーザビリティはアレなのか
私は IBM 出身のある人と、フリー・ソフトウェアがすぐれたヒューマン・インターフェースを獲得することが可能かどうかずっと議論をしてきた。
理論的には、それは可能だと思う。しかし現実的にとなると、オープンソース・プロジェクトのほとんどすべてが、同時にボランティア・プロジェクトでもあって、そしてこのボランティアに頼っているということが、開発を必然的にインターフェース・デザインをアレなものに導いているように思われた。その理由は多種多様なものになるので、これはそのうち長文の、読むに値するようなエッセイにしたい。しかしとりあえず、ここにその概要を書いておこう。
報酬が得られるプロジェクトと比べると、インターフェース・デザイナーの熱心なボランティアというのはずっとレアだ。そういう人があったとしても、（不肖わたくし同様）まったくの素人だったりする。
帰結その１ : そうなると、インターフェースのデザインは、そのことについてまるで無知であるにもかかわらず、プロジェクトの貢献者たちで手がけることになる。そういった経緯でひとたび複数のデザイナーが生まれてしまうと、外見から詳細にいたる数々の不統一が発生する。インターフェース・デザインの質というのは、デザイナーの数には反比例するものだ。 帰結その２ : 献身的なインターフェース・デザイナーがいたとしても、かれらは仕事であずかっているほどの敬意は払ってもらえない。というのはかれらはまさに献身的なデザイナーなのであって、かれらのサジェスチョンを実装するパッチを書いてくれるわけじゃないからだ。
ハッカーたちの多くは、マイクロソフトやアップルがそうしているからにはいいデザインなんだろうと考えてしまいがちだが、これはそうとも限らない。これらの企業のデザインを模倣して、ボランティアのプロジェクトが連中のミスまで繰り返してしまっているようでは、プロプライエタリの競合を超えるデザインは望むべくもない。
ボランティアというのは、かれらが面白そうだと思ったもの、つまりたいていは自分で使おうというものをハックする。かれらはハッカーで、パワーユーザーだ。だからインターフェースのデザインは複雑になりすぎ、ほとんどの人には扱えないものになってしまう。
この議論は援用できる。インターフェースを改善するこまかい改善――ウィンドウが開いたときにコントロールにフォーカスを当てるとか、エラーメッセージを有用で読みやすく改善するといったこと――は、エキサイティングでやりがいを感じるような作業ではないから、そういったものは緩慢にしか改善されない（されたとしてもわずか）。
商用プロジェクトと同様、ボランティアのプロジェクトでもデザインのことでもめるときがある。報酬を得るための仕事であれば、デザインで賛同しかねるところがあってもそれを承服する動機はある。しかし入れ込んだボランティアとなると、メンテナは問題の箇所をユーザー設定を加えることで解決する傾向がある。そうすることで、見返りとして参加者たちから貢献し続けてもらえるようにするのだ。こうして大量の、不明瞭で、くだらない設定項目が生まれ、一般ユーザーをひどい混乱に陥れることになる。そのうえ、こうしたことはテストの量を肥大させて完全性を損ねる結果を招くので、みんなが損をする。 同じ理由――報酬が存在しないということ――から、多くの貢献者が、プロジェクトのインターフェースに自分の栄光を刻み付けた15ピクセルほどの土地をほしがることになる。本来なら隠れているべきであるような機能がチェックボックスやらメニューアイテムやらにあったりするのは、そのことを物語っている。
早期のリリース、頻繁なリリースはインターフェースに深刻な弊害をもたらす。機能が不完全で、バクっぽかったり遅かったりすると、人びとはその不完全さに慣れてしまったり、そのバグっぽい挙動や遅い動作をごまかせるよう設定を変更したりする。それでその機能が完成すると、その完成度に文句をつけたり、それまでの設定のまま使おうとする。同様に、誰かが能率の悪いデザインをすると、人びとはその能率のまずさに慣れてしまって、それが使いやすく変わったときに文句を言うようになる。結果として、ユーザー設定の項目がさらに追加されることになって、インターフェースはさらにひどいものになってしまう。
使いやすい製品を出荷しなければいけないという商業的なプレッシャー下にある企業から強い影響力を行使されるプロジェクト（Netscape、Eazel、Ximian
など）では、結果としてインターフェースが改善されることが期待できる。しかしこうしたプロジェクトで正反対のことがおこっている場合もある。これはひとつにはその企業に知性と不屈さを兼ね備えたデザイナーを雇うだけのキャパがなかったか、あるいはインターフェースから、最大限の（ユーザーの満足ではなく）収益を得ようというビジネスモデルをとってたりすることが原因になっているんじゃないかと思う。

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( WCAG ) 1.0 are the W3 C ’s official standards for producing accessible web content .
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group does not publish information about what user research its members used to create WCAG 1.0 .
Similarly , many of the web ’s hundreds of accessibility experts do not conduct — or at least do not cite — research that validates their advice .
Article Continues Below
After personally observing users with disabilities interacting with websites in unexpected ways , I have come to believe strongly in the value of user research — and to suspect that we really do n’t know quite as much about real - world accessibility as we think we do .
The missing link #section2
Since the WCAG - WG does n’t publicly list the studies on which its recommendations are based , I asked a reputable member of WCAG - WG what kind of user research WCAG 1.0 was based upon .
He answered that “ WCAG are based on many things , ” which sounded good , but did n’t really answer the question .
Exactly what were those “ many things ” ?
In a later response , the working group member cited the well known NielsenNormanGroup research report on users with disabilities .
The problem is that the NNG study is dated 2001 , but WCAG 1.0 was published in 1999 .
So we have no user research officially mentioned in our beloved guidelines , and my attempt to get this information directly from the source came to nothing .
We may assume that user studies were indeed used in the making of WCAG 1.0 , but we ca n’t examine them ourselves .
Furthermore , this lack of publicly discussed research has resulted in a highly concentrated conversation about technical points and scarcely any talk about real - world user behavior .
The following examples are a few of the puzzling uses of the web that I noticed were not covered by WCAG guidelines .
These experiences are merely personal observations based on only a few users , but even this limited sample suggests that current accepted wisdom on content accessibility is incomplete .
title and h1 #section3
As I observed a blind web user navigate through a few pages , he reported that hearing the h1 content on top of the page was boring and redundant for him .
Because his screen reader read the content of the title element first , the title element served as the actual title of the document for him , and the h1 — which merely repeated the content of the title element — was useless .
Of course , this was only true when the title element contained useful and pertinent information .
Given this information , a good guideline might suggest that the title element contain basic orientation information , including the name of the site and of the specific page in the site .
The h1 should then be preceded by links to the main areas of the document , like “ go to : content , main navigation , secondary navigation , footer , ” to allow blind users to skip potentially redundant information ( a repetitive h1 ) .
WCAG does n’t explicitly say this ; the guidelines say that “ repeated groups of links ” should present a skip link .
This may be true , but it is n’t enough , and even very rudimentary user testing uncovers a need for more detailed guidelines in this area .
What do you mean , nav should come first ?
#section4
The same blind user exhibited an unexpected behavior as he attempted to find a specific link on a web page .
He knew information he was trying to find and expected this information to be present in the first few links of the page .
As the page navigation block came after the page content , he listened to the first few links within the content and followed the one that sounded “ not so bad ” to him .
This is an important behavior to note , because the link the user was seeking was actually in the navigation section , below the content section .
During this user ’s session he never saw the nav section , because his strategy of navigation was based on the assumption that the main links should be at the beginning of the page .
Much conventional accessibility advice states that page content blocks should be presented first , but some <!-- --> actual user research <!-- --> suggests that screen - reader and text - browser users expect navigation to come first .
This does n’t mean that navigation should always come first in practice , but it does demonstrate that research sometimes uncovers faulty assumptions about accessibility
And of course , content order is not covered by WCAG 1.0 at all .
Size matters , but so does boldness #section5
Another example pertains to low - vision users .
A few years ago , I asked Franco Frascolla , an expert on the informatic problems of low - vision users who also has limited vision himself , to review a site I was working on .
To my surprise , Franco told me the text could n’t be sufficiently enlarged on some areas of my site .
When I tried to compare my site with others that he judged to work properly , I had a hard time figuring out what the problem was .
At the default size , the text on “ good ” and “ bad ” pages often looked similar , but after a few trials , I had an insight .
The problem was n’t only the size of the text , but also the boldness of the characters at the enlarged size as seen on Internet Explorer for Windows .
Internet Explorer for Windows is the only browser that puts an upper limit on the number of times you can enlarge website text : it allows for only five levels of text size .
Unfortunately , IE is the most widely used browser by low - vision users — especially the ones who are n’t informatics experts .
If at the “ largest ” font - size the text is not large enough , then low - vision users simply cannot read it .
But more than that it turns out that while size matters , boldness also matters .
In fact , a bigger text that is not bold , is less readable than a text of the same size that is bold .
Compare the text in the following image and you ’ll see what I mean .
Google as viewed with IE / Win with the highest text magnification allowed by that browser .
In this example , most of the text is bold or extra -bold — but not all of it .
“ Advanced search , ” “ Preferences , ” “ Language Tools , ” and “ ( c ) 2006 Google ” are large , but not bold enough .
They ’re not readable for most low - vision users .
And how about the button labels ?
It ’s easy to tell whether a particular site passes this test ; review your site with IE6 , choose “ view > text size > largest ” and ask yourself “ is all my text bolded now ? ”
Suppose that the text in the footer is larger , but not enough to become bold ; then it ’s not readable for most low - vision users .
Is there an official guideline that covers this very basic problem for low - vision users ?
Not at all .
Low - vision users are covered neither by Section 508 nor by the national Italian law .
Even basic user testing , though , can uncover problems like these .
The need for user research about accessibility # section6
The above examples come from my personal experience observing web users with disabilities .
Are they extreme examples of users in very rare situations ?
Probably not , and though we do n’t know exactly how many users are affected by these problems , we can assume that they ’re likely quite common .
Given that the W3C has spent more than eight years discussing WCAG 1.0 and 2.0 , I expected these — and probably many other common situations — to be addressed by our guidelines , but they are not .
So many experts , such little research #section7
What ’s the reason for this lack of testing - centered official guidelines ?
I do n’t think it ’s because we are deliberately omitting things .
I think it ’s because we , as experts , are using the wrong method .
How do we assess our guidelines ?
By discussion , for the most part .
This might be a good method for many technical recommendations , but may not be the right method for establishing guidelines concerning real - life user experience .
I propose that the right method would be observing users with disabilities , talking with them , and conducting both formal and informal research with them .
We could document the research so that it would be replicable and publish results so that we can stop relying on dubiously researched assumptions .
Why has n’t this been done , at least not in a visible fashion ?
I think it ’s due to the technical background of most people participating in the discussion .
Budget issues may also discourage research , but a lot of user research has been done in an inexpensive way in the past .
A sociologist might say that it could also be a matter of political issues : of power .
User research is sometimes counterintuitive .
The results may put in crisis some of our assumptions .
We may need to reorganize our thinking and rewrite our guidelines based on real user experience .
What do we need ?
Testing !
When do we need it ?
Now!#section8
Regardless of the reasons for the lack of attention to the real user experience , it ’s important to start doing more user research with disabled users now .
We need to improve our understanding of what ’s important in accessibility , and to include this information in our guidelines .
This way we can also evaluate why some surveys of disabled users seem to be so far from our expectations .
In short , we need less discussion and more user research .
Especially when our guidelines form the basis of national laws , we need to ensure that they ’re founded on real user experience .
And in the meantime , accessibility experts , let ’s conduct — and publish — more user research to support our recommendations .
" I thank everyone for getting me to 361 . " -- post on underground Libertarian Digg mailing list , about " Fixing " Digg .
" I 'm seeing more complaints in the comments about all the Mises.org articles hitting the front page .
Should we be more selective ? " -- post on underground Libertarian Digg board , about their success in fixing Digg .
" I really think this has been a phenomenal opportunity to spread the ideas of Austrian economics to a huge market " -- post on underground Libertarian Digg mailing list , about fixing Digg .
Now the Libertarians are doing it .
I was wondering why I 've seen literally dozens of articles on Digg.com from a marginal source called " mises.org " and lewrockwell .
Who are they , and where were all these articles coming from ?
These were not great articles , one was an extremely dry treatise complete with charts , graphs and footnotes about extremely arcane economic theories .
I thought -- " Wow , 200 people are interested in obscure schools of Austrian Economics ? " I guess it 's possible .
Day after day this went on .
Mises article after mises article after LewRockwell article .
Then another mises article popped up , a full page ad for a book .
Not just any book , a book that was written decades ago .
I thought " Wow , a hundred people are interested in an ad for an obscure economics book ? "
And they 're digging this ad ?
Okay , I did n't really .
I immediately thought " Okay , some scumbag somewhere has figured out how to game the system and post any old crap to the front page . "
" It might be helpful to post libertarian articles that do not explicitly identify themselves as libertarian . " --
Post on underground Libertarian Digg fixing board
Naturally , I mentioned this in the comments to one of the articles and started a massive flamewar .
After vacuuming my burnt hair and eyebrows from the floor , I noticed that SWCarson ( Stephen Carson ) had an actual link to a manifesto he had published on mises .
http://www.lewrockwell.com/carson/carson26.html
Ahah !
I thought !
Sure enough , it was a simple instruction page to tell mises readers who know nothing about digg how to digg up stories , not for the quality of the story , but " to influence the content of Digg . "
But that 's not the story .
Many dishonest people do that .
And then I noticed the mailing list .
I just had to join !
Would n't you ?
Oh yes !
Oh baby yes !
You can check out their genius high - security system here : http://groups.yahoo.com/group/libertariandiggers/messages
I started reading , and reading -- they were talking about me , among others , that I was complaining about the quality and sheer quantity of mises crap that was being pushed to the front page .
And even the Libertarians on the newsgroup were complaining that they were promoting too many of their posts to the front page !
" ... one must approach this gingerly , not spam the hell out of the site and alienate many of the users . "
Dan DeRoo , the L - Diggers
So rather than thinking to themselves , " Hey , what we 're doing is n't the right thing -- maybe this is n't moral to fix the system ? " they did n't even slow down .
Even after one of the " L - Diggers " ( which is what they call their little fixing community ) themselves complained about the massive amount of posts :
" A day or two ago I received two emails from the L - digger group .
Between the two posts , they listed 9 stories off of LRC 's home page .
LRC only links to 12 articles per day .
If we 're going to put 9 of those on Digg why do n't we just Digg all 12 ?
These two emails hit my inbox within 5 minutes of LRC updating its page for the day .
Did the
posters have time to read that many articles before they posted them to Digg ? " -- Dave Weigel Whoa .
" Put 9 of those on Digg ? " Who controls the front page ?
" Dave " asks the rhetorical question about no one actually reading the articles , but he knows the answer .
He knows that even they do n't read those articles .
This is n't about submitting good articles , this is a spamfest .
Hell , they do n't even read them .
Since people need this pointed out now , what they are doing is wrong .
Absolutely immoral .
Digg is not a place to organize a agenda pushing group .
It is not a billboard .
It is not an advertising medium .
Digg is supposed to be about individual articles .
If Kevin Rose wants to give control of the front page of his site over to this group , he'd do it in public and they would n't have to do this covertly .
This was n't moral .
It was n't " hey this article is great " it became a covert agreement to just digg up any and all articles that pushed whatever someone wanted .
It was a trade .
It was a business arrangement .
How do they justify it ?
Because they see themselves as being somehow held back by the " gatekeepers " -- for those who do n't know it , every wrong in the world is justified by playing victim .
You 're not held back because people are against you , Libertarians , you 're held back because your ideas are superficial and doing wrong against Digg does n't help .
The most interesting thing to me is that after going through these posts on their " L - diggers " group , not one , not one Libertarian questioned whether or not this was the right thing to do .

Addendum :
The L - diggers are moving their underground message board , presumably to reduce their profile .
You can see Stephen Carsons ' post here :

After this page was published , the L - Diggers started defensive posting , as you can see from the exchange below .
My only response is " Yeah , sure guys .
You did n't post that kind of thing until after you were exposed . " :

" Complainers " ?
I agree , the only suggestion I would have is to post some that attack Republicans ( anti- Bush stuff , etc ) and others that abuse the Democratic platform .
We can get friends from each side , and perhaps even change a few minds to the beliefs of liberty .

They live or die on their own .

LATEST NEWS !
As of August 14th , and after this expose , they have removed access to the archives at the yahoo group libertarian diggers , leaving only the message " The group libertariandiggers is temporarily unavailable . "
I guess they were embarrassed at what they wrote .
If it was honorable , it would stand up to scrutiny .

In some of my older articles , at least where an SSH tunnel is involved , I keep mentioning a specific way of initializing such an encrypted tunnel , which results in the automatic closure of the tunnel after the job on the remote server is finished .
Since this is my method of choice , I decided to provide some detailed explanation in this post , so that it can be used as a reference in future articles .
What is a tunnel
Assume that an SSH and a VNC server are up and running on the machine remote.example.org .
The remote firewall does not allow direct connections to the VNC port – assume that this is TCP port 5901 – from the network , which is generally a good idea .
In this case , we will connect to the remote VNC service from the local workstation through the remote SSH server , by using a feature of the SSH protocol , called local port forwarding or , simply , tunneling .
Such a tunnel can be initialized from the local workstation with the following :
[ me@local ] $ ssh -L 25901:127.0.0.1:5901 me@remote.example.org
When executed , the above statement has the following results :
forwards the local port 25901 on the local workstation to port 5901 on the remote machine through the ssh connection .
The port 25901 is an example and it could be any other available TCP port on the local machine .
The result is that any request made on the local port 25901 is transfered to port 5901 on the remote machine through the encrypted SSH connection .
connects us to the remote SSH server and logs our remote user “ me ” in .
In order to connect to the remote VNC service through that tunnel , it is required to keep the connection to the ssh server open and , from another local terminal , connect to the local port 25901 with the vnc client :
[ me@local ] $ vncviewer 127.0.0.1:25901:1
By closing the vnc client and by logging out of the remote shell , the tunnel is destroyed too .
A better way
The previous method is too far from being convenient in the everyday use .
Things could be a lot better if we could just create the SSH tunnel and launch vncviewer in one line of code .
This can be achieved by using the -f and - N flags when connecting to the remote SSH server :
[ me@local ] $ ssh -f - N -L 25901:127.0.0.1:5901 me@remote.example.org ; \ vncviewer 127.0.0.1:25901:1
The -f switch instructs the ssh client to fork the ssh session to the background .
Therefore , we remain at our local terminal ’s prompt , from where we can execute more commands on our local machine .
In this case , with a single line of code , we created the tunnel and executed vncviewer .
However , the -f switch has one requirement .
It can not be used on its own .
It needs to be accompanied either by the - N switch or we have to execute a specific command on the remote machine .
In this case , the -f - N combination keeps the tunnel up and running in the background , but the drawback is that it runs forever , requiring us to explicitly kill the ssh process if the tunnel is not needed any more .
Even if we close vncviewer , the following command confirms that the tunnel is still running , which was actually expected :
[ me@local ] $ ps ax | grep ssh | grep -v grep
The best way – Tunnels that auto- close
As it has been mentioned previously , instead of using the -f - N switch combination , we can just use -f alone , but also execute a command on the remote machine .
But , which command should be executed , since we only need to initialize a tunnel ?
This is when sleep can be the most useful command of all !
In this particular situation , sleep has two advantages :
it does nothing , so no resources are consumed the user can specify for how long it will be executed
How these help in auto - closing the ssh tunnel is explained below .
We start the ssh session in the background , while executing the sleep command for 10 seconds on the remote machine .
The number of seconds is not crucial .
At the same time , we execute vncviewer exactly as before :
[ me@local ] $ ssh -f -L 25901:127.0.0.1:5901 me@remote.example.org sleep 10 ; \ vncviewer 127.0.0.1:25901:1
In this case , the ssh client is instructed to fork the ssh session to the background ( - f ) , create the tunnel ( - L 25901:127.0.0. 1:5901 ) and execute the sleep command on the remote server for 10 seconds ( sleep 10 ) .
The difference between this method and the previous one ( - N switch ) , basically , is that in this case the ssh client ’s primary goal is not to create the tunnel , but rather to execute the sleep command for 10 seconds .
The creation of the tunnel is some kind of side - effect , a secondary goal .
If vncviewer was not used , the ssh client would exit after the 10 sec period , as it would have no more jobs to do , destroying the tunnel at the same time .
During the execution of the sleep command , if another process , vncviewer in this case , starts using that tunnel and keeps it occupied beyond the 10 sec period , then , even if the ssh client finishes its remote job ( execution of sleep ) , it can not exit because another process occupies the tunnel .
In other words , the ssh client cannot destroy the tunnel because it would have to kill vncviewer as well .
When vncviewer stops using the tunnel , then the ssh client exits too , as it has already accomplished its goal .
This way , no ssh processes are left running in the background .
Further Enhancements
Although this is not a general article about the SSH protocol , the following ssh client switches may prove useful in some situations .
The - C switch may be used in order to apply compression to the transfered data between the local workstation and the remote server .
This will save some bandwidth , but will increase the cpu load .
Also , a specific encryption algorithm may be specified with the -c option .
The blowfish cipher is a rather good choice , which offers good encryption and low cpu utilization .
[ me@local ] $ ssh - C -c blowfish -f - L 25901:127.0.0.1:5901 me@remote.example.org sleep 10 ; \ vncviewer 127.0.0.1:25901:1
Finally , the -v flag can also be used for verbose output .

Future of ThinkPad
Conclusion
Other Links
I recently got myself some Black Gold .
I want to write all about it .
Here is the story of how I fell in love with my notebook …
When you buy a ThinkPad you do n’t buy a laptop , you are instead presented with an elegant invitation to join a community of mobile computing excellence , allowing you to be a part of a cutting edge technology ownership experience that only the high quality standards of IBM can deliver .
The ThinkPad has a very interesting history - from how it was named to how the TrackPoint was called Magenta in color ( even though it is clearly red ) .
IBM Personal Computing Division embodies strict Quality control standards .
One such IBM standard stated that the only thing that could be red on a product was an emergency power switch .
Another story - IBM used to hand out pads to employees so they could jot down to - do lists .
The pad , which was designed to fit into a dress - shirt pocket , was bound in leather and embossed in gold with the IBM motto , " Think . "
Wainwright , a senior planner at IBM Corp said , " Let 's call it the ThinkPad . ” .
The IBM corporate naming committee objected to it since they felt the name would not translate into other languages .
However it turned out , that they did not have to translate it anyway .
How do you say ThinkPad in Japanese ?
Simple .
Just “ ThinkPad ” .
One of the few people who realized this fact was Cannavino , president of IBM's Entry Systems Division .
He knew competitors in Japan would share more technical information among themselves than counterparts in the U.S. IBM moved the initial ThinkPad Design and Production operations to the IBM design center in Yamato , Japan .
The initial design of the ThinkPad was inspired by the shoukadou bentou , the traditional , black - lacquered , Japanese lunch box .
If you are fascinated by all the stories that have created such an illustrious ThinkPad history , let me point you to the source of these tales .
A must read for any ThinkPad fan .
{These link needs a free registration , do n’t let that stop you from reading it}
What makes ThinkPad ( T & X Series ) so different from its competition ?
Lets look under the hood of the Magnesium Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic frame of a T series .
It ’s built like a tank .
If you read a review of any ThinkPad , one thing you are sure to notice is how it is built for durability .
For example the lid is attached to the base with two large metal hinges so that in the long run it does n’t loosen up .
There is an outer frame around the LCD which protects you screen from any material sneaking in when you throw your laptop into your carrying case .
The truth is that every component in a ThinkPad is built to last , from the hard disk with active protection system to only water resistant keyboard in mobile computing .
The best part is that even in the Mac world it ’s believed that IBM ThinkPad is better than the PowerBooks .
It is no surprise that NASA has selected the ThinkPad to be on the International Space Station .
NASA selected the ThinkPad after a ' torture drop test ' , ' bake and freeze environment test ’ and the ' torture spill test ' .
If you have followed the previous link , you would know that the ThinkPad even withstood the infamous Himalayan challenge .
Preventive failure in mobile computing has arrived .
The active protection system consistently monitors the movement of the laptop with an accelerometer and parks the Hard disk within 500 milliseconds , if it detects a potential fall or any movement which can deliver a damaging shock to the hard disk .
Now that is what you call the “ coolness factor ” .
[ Whitepaper ] .
Further to this , the hard drive is also equipped with Air Bags ( the technology you find in automobiles ) and a shock absorber ( acts like a bumper in your vehicle ) to reduce the amount of shock passed on to the drive .
The latest ThinkPads are equipped with 7200 RPM hard drives from Hitachi , which recently acquired the hard drive operations from IBM .
Hitachi developed a new component called “ femto ” for the hard drives that supports the read / write head above the surface of the disk .
This reduces the power consumption , and increases performance .
[ source
This is one area where competing vendors are eating IBM dust .
IBM has managed to fit in a full size keyboard , yes ladies and gentlemen , you read correctly …a FULL SIZE keyboard .
You ca n’t find any review about a ThinkPad that does not praise the beauty of the ThinkPad keyboard .
The keyboard conforms to the ISO 9204 Spec .
Here are some extracts from the spec , The Keyboard is so unbelievable .
Once you get used to it , you ca n’t possibly use another keyboard .
There are people out there who are ripping of old ThinkPad keyboards and finding some way to fix them to their personal computers .
They simply cannot live without it .
I understand completely .
I have disabled the Touch Pad on my ThinkPad .
I do n’t think I will ever use any other pointing device other than my beloved TrackPoint .
TrackPoint history is as long as ThinkPad itself .
The man behind this invention is Ted Selker .
He fought hard to get his invention to market within IBM .
The stories about the TrackPoint are very interesting .
For example , the initial design of the TrackPoint was black .
Since it got lost in the black keyboard they decided to make it Red .
However IBM standards dictated that nothing can be red in a machine except the emergency power switch .
So the team decided to call it Magenta instead of red .
Ingenious .
This is a story to prove that the passion in people is as important as the technology in machine itself .
The ThinkLight is a LED placed at the top edge of the display which can shed some light onto your keyboard in low light condition , making it easier to type .
“ So what ” you say ?
Well , apparently for some co-operations the ThinkLight has been the key deciding factor when selecting a ThinkPad over other notebook brands .
One such company is Lufthansa which selected the ThinkPad over other notebooks because the ThinkLight made pilots lives so much more easier in the low light conditions of an aircraft cockpit .
Once again the “ coolness factor ” .
Will this pleasure ever end ?
There are dual antennas placed on both sides of the display for optimal signal reception .
This link provides more information than what I could write here .
This is another research spanning out from the IBM labs .
I have scene some Siemens LifeBooks back at office that make more noise and get hotter than a used car .
ThinkPad does not worry you with any of those problems .
It uses Thermal Hinge technology to keep your notebook cool .
This topic deserves a blog on its own .
The Embedded Security Subsystem became so cool with the introduction of the Finger Print Scanner on the ThinkPad .
The main problem enterprises faces is getting people to use good passwords and getting them to change and maintain their personal security regularly .
The ThinkPad re-writes the security paradigm with the introduction of the breakthrough Finger Print scanner .
You could argue that finger print scanner is not something new to the notebooks and Samsung X10 Plus already has a finger print scanner .
However those are touch scanners rather than a swipe scanner .
IBM introduced the swipe scanner which solved many problems found in a touch scanner .
One of the problems the swipe scanner solves is that the user now has to drag their fingertip across the scanner , and therefore there is no way to " lift " a fingerprint from the surface .
Pragmatic HCI excellence at its best .
Here is a full review of the IBM fingerprint scanner .
This is more suitable if you want to deploy a ThinkPad across your enterprise .
In such cases the purchase cost of any notebook accounts only to 20 % of the TCO .
IBM has developed a set of technologies called ThinkVantage which address the other 80 % .
If you are a small company here is a classic case study as to how a ThinkPad deployment can increase productivity and help you to build an office where people just love to come to work each day .
If you think this is it , do n’t worry .
IBM is already tossing around some breakthrough ideas for the future of ThinkPad .
Get ready to be amazed .
IBM reached its 10 millionth ThinkPad customer in the year 2000 .
In 2003 they reached the 20 million mark .
100 % growth in 3 years .
Obviously all this history and a continuous passion of excellence have paid dividends .
I am proud to be a part of this group .
The ThinkPad belongs in a new realm of prestige and is a class of mobile computing all on its own , to be compared with no other and revered by all .
Like a BMW , a bottle of fine wine or a Villa in Italy , the only way to appreciate the ThinkPad is to drive it … taste it … and live it .
Enjoy .

It 's 1 a.m. and I 'm tossing and turning again .
Do I have insomnia ?
No .
I 'm married to a buzz saw ( or so it seems ) .
But snoring is more than just an annoyance .
" The spouse of someone who snores can lose up to 5 years off of their life , " according to Dr. Mehmet Oz , a cardiothoracic surgeon at Columbia University in New York City and host of " The Dr. Oz Show . "
Why ?
If you continually go without enough sleep , the aging process accelerates , which puts you at risk for conditions such as high blood pressure , cancer , memory loss , and possibly diabetes .
Over the years , I 've learned that the best way to combat my husband 's snoring is to fall into a sound sleep early .
As the saying goes an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of a cure .
These days , I know if I do n't follow my normal bedtime ritual , I can expect to be woken up by my husband 's snoring .
Here are some tips that help me sleep through the night :
Set the mood .
Bright lights stop your body from producing its natural sleeping aid , melatonin , according to the website of Dr. Andrew Weil , the founder and director of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center .
So , dim the lights , shut off the television and stay off the computer .
Keep the bedroom at a comfortable temperature .
For most people , that 's between 54 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit .
Keep a notepad next to your bed , so you can write down whatever pops into your mind when you 're trying to sleep .
You can worry about those things tomorrow .
Keep Fido out of your bed .
Much like humans , pets can toss and turn during the night , keeping you from getting a good rest .
Just relax .
Right before bed , clear your mind ; take a few deep breaths and stretch .
If you 're feeling especially stressed , try a warm bath before bed .
Do n't have any caffeine for about 6 hours before bed .
Avoid alcohol and nicotine around bedtime .

Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme , he said he had no idea how far the services had been undermined , with problems " in many parts of Iraq " .
It comes after the British Army said it was forced to take action to free two UK soldiers after learning Iraqi police had handed them to a militia group .
UK defence chief John Reid will meet Iraq 's prime minister on Wednesday .
Mr Reid and Ibrahim Jaafari are expected to discuss the growing tension in the southern city of Basra between the British Army and local authorities .
The Pentagon warned in July that Iraq 's police force was recruiting insurgents .
Journalists killed
The Iraqi interior minister has disputed the UK's account of the circumstances surrounding the release of the two British soldiers in Basra .
Baqir Solagh Jebr told the BBC the men never left police custody .
He said the UK forces that freed them had reacted to a " rumour " that they were in militia hands .
Separately , an Iraqi journalist with national newspaper As Safeer has been shot dead in Mosul .
The death of the paper 's Mosul bureau chief , Firas Maadidi , comes two days after the killing of his female colleague , reporter Hind Ismaeel .
On Monday , Iraqi journalist Fakher Haidar al - Tamimi was shot dead in the southern city of Basra .
Mr Tamimi worked for several foreign news agencies , including US daily The New York Times .
' Clean up police '
The Iraqi government has launched an inquiry into events surrounding the arrest of the British soldiers on Monday , both thought to be members of the SAS elite special forces .
Iraq 's interior ministry ordered the police force in Basra to release the soldiers - but that order was ignored .
[ Infiltration ] affects the Iraqi police across Iraq as a whole

Have Your Say : Basra unrest Timeline : UK troops in Iraq
The British Army said the troops had been handed over by police to a Shia militia group .
The men were freed after British troops in armoured vehicles stormed a Basra prison and then a house to which the captives had been taken .
Mr Rubaie told Newsnight : " Our Iraqi security forces in general , and these in particular and in many parts of Iraq , I have to admit that they have been penetrated by some of the insurgents , some of the terrorists as well , so I can't deny this . "
He said Iraq now had " a very scrupulous , very meticulous vetting procedure " to " clean our security forces , as well as stop any penetration in future from the insurgents or the terrorists " .
He admitted he did not know to what extent the security forces were already infiltrated by insurgents .
However , Mr Rubaie criticised the British military 's use of force instead of negotiation in freeing its troops on Monday .
" They could have been freed in a much more peaceful , much more friendly and amicable way than that , " he said .
Colonel Bill Dunham , the chief of staff for the multinational force in Basra , told BBC radio the infiltration of insurgents into Iraq 's security forces was a problem across Iraq .
A report released by the US defence department in July blamed the problem on poor vetting procedures and recommended that the quality of records at Iraq 's interior ministry be checked .

Introduction
Apple 17 " iMac Core Duo
Manufacturer : Apple ( product page )
Price : US $ 1,299 ( shop for this item )
The Big Switch has been publicly underway for a mere seven months , and it has borne fruit in the form of a new iMac and laptop , the MacBook Pro .
The MacBook Pro is due to hit store shelves at some point in February .
The iMac is available now , and we 've had a 17 " Core Duo iMac up and running at the Ars Orbiting HQ since we were able to get our hands on one .
Tech specs
Externally , the iMac appears identical to its PowerPC predecessor .
There 's the small camera above the display , the same array of ports in back , and the same white keyboard and Mighty Mouse .
It 's the inside that 's different .
Instead of the venerable PowerPC 970 CPU , there 's the latest from Intel : the Core Duo T2400 .
The Core Duo is the second 65 nm CPU from Intel ( the first being the 65nm version of Presler ) , but the first to be widely available .
Unlike the transition from 130nm to 90nm , which was the source of nightmares for engineers at both IBM and Intel , the move to 65nm appears to have gone nearly flawlessly for Intel .
As a result , Apple was able to speed its transition from IBM to Intel as its primary CPU supplier to just under seven months from the announcement , and according to Jobs , the transition across the entire Apple product line will be completed by the end of 2006 .
The Core Duo T2400
At the heart of the new iMac is the Intel Core Duo T2400 ( or T2500 in the case of 20 " , 2.0GHz iMac ) .
As mentioned previously , the T2400 is a 65 nm part .
It is rated at 1.83GHz , and because I like my warranties , I 'm not about to see how fast I can get it to run .
By the way , in the Intel processor branding system , the " 2 " after the T indicates a dual - core CPU .
The Core Solo that will presumably be used in the iBook and Mac mini will use a T1xxx designation .
Yep .
Intel Inside
The Core Duo T2400 employs Intel 's Smart Cache with its Advanced Transfer Cache Architecture .
What it amounts to is 2MB of L2 cache shared across both cores of the CPU .
It also has Intel 's SpeedStep technology , which ramps down the processor speed in order to save power .
That 's not going to be terribly important for the iMac , but the MacBook Pro should be able to take good advantage of the technology .
FSB - wise , the Core Duo line is respectable : it 's a 667M Hz , bidirectional bus .
As is typical for Intel , the memory controller sits out on the chipset 's northbridge .
This is not as efficient as current - generation dual - core Athlons , which have their memory controller integrated into the CPU .
However , for a platform that has relied on the bandwidth - choked PowerPC 7400 - series for so long , the Core Duo is a breath of fresh air .
Rumor has it that the iMac Core Duo uses a custom chipset designed by Intel .
From looking at pictures of the chips , we were able to do some deduction from the chip numbers .
The northbridge chip looks to be an 82945 GM , which identifies it as the Mobile Intel 945 GM Express chipset .
According to the S - Spec number ( SL8Z2 ) , it 's a standard Intel chipset and therefore not an Apple - specific variant .
The southbridge appears to be an ICH7 - M , which has support for a Trusted Computing module .
Graphics
Apple has gone with ATI for the new iMac , and like its G5 predecessor , it uses a 16x PCI - Express interface .
The Core Duo iMac sports an ATI Radeon X1600 with 128MB of GDDR3 RAM .
The X1600 is ATI 's middle - of - the - road card , featuring the RV530 GPU , fabbed at 90nm .
It has 12 pixel shader processors and five vertex shader processors , and should provide decent 3D performance once universal binary games start to appear .
The 1.83GHz iMac sports a 17 " LCD with a resolution of 1440x900 , same as its predecessor .
Unlike previous iMacs , you are not limited to mirroring if you hook up an external monitor .
Using a mini-DVI connector ( not included ) , you can hook an external monitor up and use an extended desktop .
You 'll be able to run a 23 " LCD at 1920x1200 , or a CRT ( yuck ) with an analog adaptor at 2045x1536 .
The only other significant hardware change ( aside from the whole Intel thing ) is the use of PC2 - 5300 DDR2 instead of PC2 - 4200 DDR2 for the system RAM .

I notice that the case the CD 's in has the " Compact Disc Digital Audio " logo on it .
This may put ColdPlay , the publisher and / or the retailers on the hot seat .
I believe California is one of those states that does n't allow the retailer and / or manufacturer to refuse to accept returns on defective products .
If they 're claiming it 's a real CD , then by refusing to accept returns because it wo n't play on CDDA - compliant devices they may be opening themselves up to legal action in California .
OTOH , if they say it 's not a real CD then they 're in the clear on that but by using the CDDA logo and putting it in with other real CDs they may be opening themselves up to charges of false advertising and consumer fraud .
The retailers are the ones most likely to get bit by this first , unless they 're willing to eat the returns or put the labels on the spot in court .
To be honest , I think that 's what it 's going to take to get DRM off the shelves : putting the retailers and the labels in a legal bind that they can only avoid by segregating all DRM'd media off in it 's own prominently - labelled section .

I thought this was a relevant story - not sure if it has been posted before :
In Motown v. Nelson , pending in federal court in Port Huron , Michigan ( Eastern District of Michigan , Southern Division ) , the defendants -- Mr. and Mrs. Nelson -- have made a motion for attorneys fees against the RIAA attorneys , pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1927 for unreasonable and vexatious litigation and improperly interfering and / or obtaining false testimony from a prospective witness .

I am having problem ripping cds to put on an ipod because of the effects of this
stupid DRM .
Using Suse 10.0 it is almost impossible to output and mp4 to put on
an ipod .
Do n't do any file sharing or anthing like that .
I am having to update
the gstreamer to the latest version , of which there are no rpms for suse x86_64 ,
then get the appropriate plugins .
Have to compile all of this and make rpms to
install .
What a pain .

The music companies need to create a new media ( maybe a square aluminum disc )
and sell a player with it 's own stand alone speakers and 110 volt wall plug ( it's
only standard ) .
If you buy into this scheme then you can buy and play their music , otherwise
forget their music .
The rest of the world can foster a new music market by a new consumer demand .
The future > ( Like who was Johnny Cash ?
Who was Elvis ?
They had some
samples of their music on the History Channel the other night . )
I guess the new world order will include new non-record contract performers .
That new guy Pelvis Eresley ?
yeah I got an mp3 of him .

I do n't quarrel with record companies ' right to put all sorts of DRM on their
products , but I think that it 's unconscionable that the customer does n't find
out about the restrictions until * AFTER * they buy , with no right of refund .
While we 're at it , this also applies to software EULAs .
Are there any laws being broken by these after - the - purchase disclosures ?
( Probably varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction ) .
What can consumers do at a personal level ?
Maybe start reporting such
occurences to the local BBB , or complaining to government consumer - protection
agencies .
In New York , maybe Spitzer might be interested in some thing like
this .
Another option might be to put up web sites with examples of such after - the - fact
restrictions .
Just be sure to host them in faraway places out of reach of
US - based SLAPP suits .

PJ , your work on behalf of OSS users and anyone concerned about intellectual
property over the last few years has been amazing and ( especially given that
it 's been given at no cost ! ) astonishingly thorough .
I 've not posted here before , but I 've been an avid follower of Groklaw since
shortly after it began .
By training , I 'm a performing musician ( that 's where my
degree is , although I now work as a programmer ) .
I 'd dearly love for you to be
able to experience the subtle relaxation and yet intense emotional expression of
the Mozart Clarinet Quintet in full .
As such I 'd like to offer to buy you a
copy of it on CD , ideally ( in the closest I 've come to my perfect performance )
played by Jack Brymer .
I do n't know if there 's a way to discriminate one payment to Groklaw from
another - if not , and I hear nothing in response to this , I 'll make sure to send
a contribution equivalent to the value of the CD doubled ( plus extra :) ) to
Groklaw via PayPal .
Here 's hoping , and all the best for 2006 .

He was very poor at calling in
loans .
This whole myth is a ?

The details of his funeral are
fairly accurate , and because this describes a victorian pauper 's funeral , it was
assumed he was poverty - stricken .
Actually , a funeral like that was * NORMAL * for
everyone below royalty , and that INCLUDES NOBILITY .
A Duke would have been
treated the same as Mozart !
He had a pretty expensive farewell , and then his body was taken away to a
communal grave .
It was unusual for people to follow the coffin to the grave , and
only Royalty could command a private plot .

The ket to playing streaming media is to know what the address of the stream is .
Many internet radio stations obfuscate the stream address inside active X or
other junk .
To listen to Classic FM for example point your media player to
mms://audio2.musicradio.com/classicfm
gxine is a very nice player for listening to internet streams and comes with
many of them preconconfigured , although it does have trouble with the BBC
streams for which I use kmplayer .

I looked it up in my old Koechel Verzeichnis :
KV 581
Quintett ( " Stadler - Quintett " ) for clarinet , two violins , viola ,
violoncello
Composed 29 September 1789 , Vienna
Mozart - Verzeichnis 112
Performed on 22 December 1789 , Vienna ( Anton Stadler played the clarinet )
It has four movements :
1. Allegro
2. Larghetto
3. Menuetto
4. Allegretto con Variazioni
A sample mp3 of the second movement can be found on :
http://www.bambergerstreichquartett.de/hoerbsp.htm
You can buy a recording , for instance , at :
http://www.jpc.de/jpcng/classic/detail/-/hnum/3655078
( EUR 5.99 in Germany )
I found a free recording via Google at :
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ushankar/recordings/index.html
( look for K. 581 ) ; the recording quality is not very good
but one can get an impression of the music .
The musicians
are not bad .
Perhaps someone with a recording can send you mp3's :-)

I disliked most of Mozart for years , and still find his juvenilia - well ,
juvenile - anything up to his early teens really , but now I love much of his
later stuff .
If you want to find a legally downloadable sample of the Clarinet
Quintet I can't a.t.m. help , but if you go to href = " http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/ " > click on CATALOGUE by Composer , find
the section headed Litolff - Pärt , scroll down to Mozart , you will find listed
all their currently available CDs ( none of them with nasty DRM ) , many of them
with downloadable samples in MP3 or Real format .
The Clarinet quintet is their ,
but there is no sample of that disc .
Samples tend to be between 3 and 10 minutes
long , so you can get a good idea of what you are in for if you buy the record .

... it should help to get it out of their system quicker .
( Excepting any more rootkit silliness )
If they carry on as they are then in the next 1 - 2 years three things are going
to happen :
1 ) Anyone half techno - savvy will continue to ignore their pathetic attempts to
shoehorn DRM onto the CD standard ( more people than they 'd like do n't put ~any ~
CD into their PC without holding down the shift key first ) ;
2 ) They 'll massively piss off the rest of the music - buying population by
preventing them playing their bought CD on their chosen CD player .
And remember ,
Philips still call the shots on what can , or cannot , be sold as a " CD "
or " CD player " ! ;
3 ) Their CD sales will continue to tank .
Now in theory they could carry on , year after year , blaming their declining
fortunes on the " evil pirates " .
Except that 's not going to happen .
Why ?
Because in the near future they 're going to try to use that excuse to screw the
artists ( more than they do already ) .
They 're going to tell Madonna or Britney or , indeed , Coldplay that they can 't
afford to pay them the royalties they 're accustomed to - because no - one wants to
buy their CDs anymore .
All their fans are evil pirates who just want to download their songs for free .
The " moment of clarity " that will then occur will , I 'm sure , be both
painful and far reaching !

Coldplay Indeed .
It 's the consumer who is left in the cold .
I am a musician and an avid music lover , and I like will NEVER buy a CD with any copy protection software installed .
I find it completely offensive having my use of a product I supposedly " own " being limited and monitored as if I were a child .
Instead of adapting to the realities of new technologies , the bigs are doing all they can to hamper the ability of the consumer to freely use the produce and at the same time doing nothing to hamper the massive amount of waste and graft and greed that typifies the recording industry .
The are alienating the very consumer whos dollars they need to survive .
The RIAA has filed suite against both XM and Sirius Satelite services because they want a bigger cut of that pie .
And do n't forget , the ASCAP sued the Boy Scouts a few years back for singing copyright protected songs around a campfire .
Now they are are going after websites that print the lyrics to songs .
It 's a world gone mad !
A bigger problem the record companies now face but ignore is that artists are no longer at the mercy of the record companies to produce AND distribute a good quality album .

PJ 's mention of Mozart ( about whom she and I have opposite opinions ; de gustibus non est disputandum ) makes me think of how the UK's law is even worse than that of the US in terms of music rights .
There , not only does copytight vest in the composers , lyricists , and arrangers of a piece , but even in the editors .
Even though Mozart is in his grave these two hundred years , it is difficult to find an edition of his music that one can perform without owing royalties to some ( perhaps anonymous ) editor .
The test case was Dr Lionel Sawkins 's suit against Hyperion Records ( follow the link for Hyperion 's announcement that its future as a company is in jeopardy as a result of its loss of the case on appeal ) .
There is a more extensive commentary in L a Follia .
In the opinion of the trial judge - upheld on appeal - the " sweat of the brow " argument reappears : I am not persuaded that one can reject a claim to copyright in a new musical work simply because the editorial composer has made no significant changes to the notes
It seems to me this is too rigid a test and not one which properly respects the reality of what music is .
The question to ask in any case is whether the new work is sufficiently original in terms of the skill and labor used to produce it .
In other words , if an editor puts in enough work on an edition , he acquires some copyright claim to the original music of the composer .
This miscarriage of justice has even music editors offended .
Sir Charles Mackerras stated :
I am shocked and horrified that the very existence of Hyperion could be jeopardised through a legal misunderstanding of what is , after all , a very abstruse and specialised area .
In the same article , composer John Rutter ( one of my modern favorites ; The Reluctant Dragon is hilarious , and his church music is sublime ) is quoted as saying , " copyright was not designed to reward scholarship but creativity . "
I once believed that one way I could be sure that my music was legal was to play it myself , on my prized 1891 Steinway parlor grand from my library of printed classical music .
Now , apparently , I have to screen the printed music , to make sure that the editions can be proven to be out of copyright .
OK , I have a number of editions that old ( I 'm also an habitué of used - book sales . )
Now , though , I come to worry .
A fair number of the old printings contain some pretty egregious errors in the engraving , or give no editorial suggestions regarding , say , the interpretation of tempi , ornaments or phrasing .
Am I perhaps guilty of unwitting copyright infringement if I make the same correction or adopt the same interpretation that some newer editor suggests ?
After all , I could have copied unconsciously from some other edition that a performer used , and that I encountered at a concert or on the radio .
For some time I took one teacher 's advice to heart : " Go to concerts .
Listen .
If you like what you hear , learn from it .
If you do n't like what you hear , you 'll learn even more . "
For some of my favorite pieces , I 'd have a hard time defending my position ; I 've heard dozens of artists perform them , and hope that I did learn from them .
Britons need to lobby Parliament to get this precedent undone by statute .
USAians need to watch out that the same nonsense does n't appear over here .
( I do n't think that any of our copyright treaties make this British decision a binding precedent over here on the left side of the pond , but I am certainly none too sure of my position . )
Helen Peate sums it up perhaps best :
The judgment means that almost every edition of an out of copyright work will in fact have its own musical copyright because the law will regard it as ' original ' .
This will affect classical record companies and performers of classical music as they will have to seek ( and pay for ) a licence before performing or recording music from an edition .
The judgment also means that the threshold for copyright and ' originality ' is extremely low .
Given that copyright subsists in every fixation of a musical work , this will mean that each time a musical work is recorded , that particular performance could be of an " original " musical work under UK copyright law .
This gives rise to the possibility of performers claiming musical copyright in addition to performing rights - something the legislators surely did not intend .
Citation for the judgment is [ 2004 ] EWHC 1530 ( Ch ) .

Have you tried Magnatune ?
( http://www.magnatune.com)This is a great company that
have a reasonable list of music ( esp classical ) .
I only ever buy music from them
and here 's why :
1 ) You get to choose what you pay ( between $ 6.00 - $ 20.00 ) for an album .
2 ) You can here the entire album IN FULL before you buy .
3 ) If you buy an album , you can give it to 3 friends .
4 ) When you buy , you can download it as many times as you want 60 days after
purchase .
5 ) There are a range of formats , from uncompressed WAV 's down to MP3's and OGG
files .
There 's a massive range of formats for every occasion and NONE of them
have DRM .
6 ) The musician (s ) get 50 % ( no less ) of what you pay magnatune .
7 ) Help for any problems is quick , friendly , and effective .
8 ) THEY CAN BE TRUSTED !!!
And all the above is an ethical stance .
PJ , you might not like Bach because he has more notes than Mozart , but if you 're
curious , try Lara St John 's ' Bach Violin Concerto's '
( http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/lara-bach/).
She 's a brilliant violinist .
I
had to persist a bit to get used to Bach , but now I play his stuff every day ,
but you might get on with some of Philharmonia Baroque 's stuff .
They do the
Seraglio music ( the link is http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/pb-mozart/ and
to listen to a high quality stream go to
http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/pb-mozart/01.m3u)
Since Magnatune arrived , I do n't buy anywhere else and a whole new world of
music has been opened up for me .
And the best thing is that it is entirely
ethical .
The musicians get a fair deal ( 50 % is way better than any record
company offers ) , you get the price and a range of formats , and you can listen to
the entire album before you buy !
Best of luck .

Here is what you do .
You make the music available to your fans on your own website .
They download it
in " flac " format .
( Fully Lossless Audio Codec ) .
It 's being done more
often these days by numerous bands .
Who needs corporate ?
We all know the answer to that question , do n't we .
Do bands
have any choice in the matter ?
Can they even so much as speak up ?
Could they put
their music on their own website , where you can pay THEM for it , then download
it in your preferred format ( mp3 for dial - up people , for instance ) .
Or perhaps
even order a CD directly from the artists ?
If they are locked into a contract ,
probably not !
Hey , it 's a job .
If you provide a quality product , you do n't need DRM .
Either people are going to
buy your music or they are n't .
I would speculate that there is probably an
inverse relationship beween music listeners viewing your music as a quality
product and corporate being willing to sign you up for a contract .
Just make the music available in a high - quality , VBR 320 mp3 or flac , from your
website .
Where people can pay YOU and then download it .
If the music is a
quality product , filesharing probably wo n't hurt it .
If the music is corporate
crap , filesharing will expose it .
Quality music is about so much more than money .
There will always be people who
will be willing to pay good money for quality music .
There will always be
wealthy people willing to contribute large amounts of money to musical societies
and so forth .
Do n't make it about money , Make it about a quality product .
That 's
really what music ought to be about .

Since PJ mentioned it , I 'd like to point out two free - to - listen music sources , both of which are dear to my heart .
The first is called iRATE radio .
It 's a free ( as in speech ) , and is distributed under the GPL .
It 's a JAVA WebStart application which contacts a master server that contains URLs for free music files on the web .
The server sends you these URLs , and your computer downloads the tracks directly from the artists ' website ( which gets around the whole ' distributing someone else 's content ' thing ; you only download publically available music offered directly from the artist ) .
The really interesting bit is that as it plays your automatically - downloaded music , you are able to give the music ratings , or bin it entirely .
The next time iRATE radio talks to the master server , it compares your ratings against the ratings from other users to find people who seem to like the same things that you like .
Once it finds some , it tries to provide you with more music that those people liked .
The upside is that as you rate more music , iRATE does a better job of fetching you interesting music that you 'll like .
The downside is that every once in a while it will send you something that you 'll really dislike .
But the ' bin it ' option is always there to immediately stop those tracks .
Real radio stations could really use a button like that !
Anyway .
Each music track will tell you the license under which it was provided ( almost always a Creative Commons license ) , and other information about the band , the website , etc .
In this way , iRATE radio has introduced me to dozens upon dozens of bands and distributors I 'd never heard of , both local and international , including my next favourite source :
Magnatune has been mentioned here many times before , but is worth mentioning again ; Extremely high quality music in many different genres , all of it free to listen to in its entirety at a reasonable level of quality .
If you choose to purchase the music , you 're free to download the music in whatever formats you like ( including FLAC , uncompressed WAV , mp3 of various qualities , ogg vorbis , AAC , etc ) , you may request a printed CD be sent to you ( for a slightly higher price ) , and what 's more , you nominate your own price for the music ; you pay exactly what you think it 's worth ( $ 8 per CD is suggested , but not enforced ) .
I 've bought about a dozen downloaded - albums from Magnatune , and have nothing but good things to say about them .
Real class act .
These days , Magnatune tracks can also be purchased via iTunes , and they operate several genre - based radio streams which are offered via iTunes , as well as via direct links from their website .
Or you can just listen to streams of particular tracks or albums , if you 're interested in listening to something more specific .

So , if I go into a shop and play something I wrote myself ( I 've done this
before ) then how does the money the shop payed to enable me to " publicly
perform " this piece get to me , the copyright owner ?

myself - why ?
I LIVE IN A VERY , VERY DUSTY AREA AND I WANT MY CDs TO LIVE , SAFE

At the moment I do not
purchase many CDs but when I do I will ensure they are not crippled or I will
not buy them .
If you DRM them all , like this , goodbye .

While the consumers side get 's full attention , the artists side of DRM however
is hardly mentioned .
For artists things look more like this :
DRM is meant to lock - in artists and lockout audience .
DRM will be a double edged tool used to let artist know that they ( the fat
execs ) can lock away audiences from the artist once they are disposable , that is
after the first NOT superhit .
They will be pressured into signing off more rights for NOT being disposed and
slowly become a owned entity like in fudal times .
DRM is meant to manipulate both ends of the channel of which they try to stay
middle men of and set them and their rights up to each other .
What irritates me most about DRM is the sheer number of corrupt people that try
to force this through our throats ,
somehow the memes in the corporate world is still that it 's cool to be corrupt ,
and the blatant arrogance which is displayed while doing this .
Real Hobbesian behaviour .
I wonder how these Mercantiles took power from modern
economists ...

The last four paragraphs / sentences are n't written in good English and really
do n't make much sense :
<< The first time that this program is used ( in Windows automatic starter
software ) it gets registered in Windows File .
Thus , programs already
registered do not affect Windows operation .
Windows OS also uses the latest files .
This CD does not support MacIntosh PC software .
Except for manufacturing problems , we do not accept exchange , return or
refund . >>
" Windows OS also uses the latest files . "
What exactly does this mean ?
" ... we do not accept ... refund . "
Should n't that be " we do n't issue refunds " ?
Who writes these things ?
And what law department reviewed this policy and the insert before
approving it ?
As others here have already pointed out , the advice they give
about activating ActiveX controls and disabling firewalls sounds like reckless
endangerment to me .

Let me get this straight .
The record companies see their demographics ( adults with money to spend on
music ) aging , so they dump Rock and Roll and replace it with Rap , Hip Hop , and
various forms of soft porn that appeal to a much younger crowd ( teens and
pre-teens who pirate all of their music because they have better things to spend
their money on ) ,
Then , they replace the 45 single with more expensive CD singles , thus reducing a
customer 's ability to try music without spending a lot of money for the whole
record .
Finally , they give us a choice of a low - quality download that 's heavily
play - restricted , or a CD that wo n't play on all equipment ( or only plays if you
let it add a root kit ) .
Now their sales are down , and they 're busy pointing the finger at everyone else
but themselves .
Tell me something , are these people the same geniuses behind
SCO 's Great Plan to sue the planet ?
Sounds like it to me .
Someone should clue these music companies in to what ID Software discovered back
when they introduced Wolfenstein 3D and the original Doom : give away a nice
taste of your product , free and clear with no restrictions , and rake - in the
money when people come knocking on your door to buy more of the same .

One thing I have wondered about ?
Can they call this disk a " CD " .
I
thought
" CD " and " Compact Disk " were trademarks and the disk had to
obey the
standard to use the name .
The last DMR disk I picked up ( a " Nora
Jones " disk )
did not mention CD on the cover at all .
The retailer certainly used the term CD in their display so I suspect I had a
refund case under Australian law if it was not really a CD .
( Fortunately , as a
Mac
user I was just able to ignore their scheme - through one of my machines did
have a problem with it ) .

PJ related her experience trying to find Mozart .
Just this past weekend I had my
own frustrating experience trying to find a piece of music .
I would have been
even more frustrated if these RIAA folks had their way .
I program computers for a living .
Most of the time , I do so listening to music .
Sometimes its Yanni or Enya , but most of the time it 's Trance music ( for the
uninitiated , that 's a type of techno dance music , not the name of a band ) .
I was
listening to a European Internet Radio station , when a vocal caught my
attention .
The MP3 tag did n't name the song , so I hit Google with some of the
lyrics .
I intended locating the CD the song was from , with the intentions of
buying it on line .
Unfortuntely , the group , Solarstone , does n't have a CD with
the song I was looking for , " Speak in Sympathy " , and that song turns
out to feature a guest singer on vocals .
Rules that out , I guess , but I 'll keep
checking back on the group 's web site , just in case they release something I
find interesting .
If these laudible RIAA lawyers get rid of the lyric sites , they will be
protecting their golden IP at the expense of sales .
Hmmm , hope the record
companies pay them in ( DRM enabled ) downloads .
But , you know , those darned people who are pirating the song lyrics are causing
the record companies lost sales , donchaknow ! [ Reply to This | # ]

Just one more thing in long list this industry has come up with , their real
skills are politics and deception , for years they have got away with paying
politcal bodies , stacking committies and ripping off the creators of the works
they claim as their own .
They add little value to the artists work other than to
own a distribution channel and even that is managed poorly .
When I was a
teenager I bought bootlegs ( recordings from a distribution company other than
the one the artist is contracted to ) .
It amazed me that the bootleggers could
make money producing better work with much smaller sales volumes , the arguement
that they wer n't paying the artist royalties , does n't hold as artist royalties
are ASFAIK less than 20 % of the cover price and the artist bears many of the
production costs .
for me it seemed that the artists should be furious with their
record company for not taking advantage of this market , not to mention the
superior mixing and production that some of the bootlegs had .
I guess the music
industry does n't really understand music .
The other thing I did as a teenager
was record off the radio , some of the albums I ended up buying others I did n't
but I was far more likely to buy something that I recorded than something that I
had just heard thesedays the radio is n't worth listening to so I do n't even own
one and I do n't buy music any more either
The other things what prompted me to
buy music was listening to it in the university record library and hearing it or
getting copies from mates ( how else do you get to check out a new band ) Instead
of accepting copying as a marketing cost the record industry employs people to
market their products my take on the industry is get rid of all the overheads
( marketing bribes to politicians etc ) and choose a cheap distribution channel
like the internet , music is a commodity and should be priced as such .
If they
had real competition like having no artist lock in this industry would have
sharpened its act a long time ago .
If I get back into music I will be looking for artists that direct market , I am
not paying an industry to bribe the politicians that I elected and whose wages
my taxes pay to further reduce my rights

I do n't think that the record companies are competing : they sign exclusive
contracts with the artists , and their leverage on the artists is that they
control their distribution channel to the retail stores .
I believe that there is a need for an Internet - based portal that acts as a
marketplace for the artists to distribute their music .
The intended result is
that both the consumers and the artists benefit , while the major record labels
starve .
If the balance of power decisively shifts away from the record labels ,
expect them to respond by fighting to weaken the copyright protections on the
artists ' music so that they can pirate it .

Could someone who is a lawyer with LRM to practice in Minnesota care to advise
on the best way to ask for my refund , and how to document the exchange as a test
case for a class action in my state ?
The 2 - fer is to get Best Buy 's attention .

I rather like this one : ▪
You ripped the CD on the computer that you are currently using , but your licenses have been deleted .
This typically occurs when you reformat your hard disk ( such as when you perform a clean installation of Windows ) , but it can occur in other circumstances as well .
To avoid this problem in the future , use the License Management feature of Windows Media Player to back up your licenses to a floppy disk ( or other storage media ) before you reformat your hard disk .
Which translates into : This Operating System frequently trashes your installation .
You lose your rights to the music when this happens .
The fact that you paid for this piece of trash is your problem , not ours .

All these companies that are trying to prevent you from making a copy of their
CD 's forget that there is plenty of recording software available that lets you
record directly from your sound card while you are playing their CD in a cd
player , or cd drive and have it convert the file to MP3 which you later can use
to burn another cd .
Just like you record from radio or record an LP ( everyone
remembers vinyl ) to tape you can record your cd to your hard drive .

DISCLAIMER : I do n't own a copy of the Coldplay CD , nor have I any intention of buying one .
But that 's not going to stop me adding my comments , so here goes ... ;-)
This insert does n't read like a license agreement to me - it looks more like a disclaimer .
The kind of thing manufacturers put into their shoddy products to protect their backsides .
In the wake of the Sony fiasco it 's only to be expected .
Some of the sentences do n't make any sense whatsoever .
The one beginning with the word " Thus " , in particular , has no logical connection with the preceding sentence .
I would n't mind betting that if you stick this CD into your Linux box you 'll have no trouble ripping it .
I have n't bought many CDs recently , but those that I have bought have ripped quite nicely thankyou .
Sometimes I have problems in the DVD drive , but if that happens I try the CD burner instead - never had problems there ...
It also occurs to me that there 's a simple way to get rid of the collecting societies .
They only work because the number of producers is small compared with the number of consumers , so the way to destroy them is to increase the number of producers .
Using the internet , everyone can be a publisher .
Writing music is very easy - all you have to do is put a few assorted black splodges on some pre-printed stave sheets .
Or use a notation program ( lilypond , rosegarden etc. ) .
I never said it has to be good music , and the definition of " good " is pretty subjective anyway .
Put the results on your web site .
You are now a music copyright holder , so you can apply to the composer 's collecting society for your share of the booty .
If you used notation software , you can transform it to midi .
Play the midi on a synth program and redirect the output to a file .
You are now a recording artist .
Publish your works on your web site , and go and claim your share of the booty from the collecting societies that extort money for recorded works .
If enough people did this , the existing state of affairs would break down and something would have to be done about it .

Not saying that Indian english is bad or anything , it 's just that this document
reads more like a technical guideline than a license agreement , which could
simply be due to a subtle semantic shift that would n't be unusual once you cross
the line from west to east .
Nowhere in that document does it say what you , as a user , are allowed to do or
not do with the music on the cd .
They would like you to assume that 's what it
says , but it does n't say that at all .
The way it reads is as a list of technical
limitations of the cd , and that 's not some kind of unreasonable stretching of
the meaning of the words .
It actually does , to my reasonably educated eye , read
like a list of technical limitations , and not a license agreement .

I seem to recall reading somewhere that Microsoft originally came to DRM reluctantly , but were presented with a difficult choice : play the game by the RIAA / MPAA rules , or be left out .
They chose to play by the rules .
Subsequently they seem to have discovered some benefits to themselves of playing the DRM game , and of the Trusted Computing platform required to fully implement DRM .
I highly recommend Ross Anderson 's Trusted Computing FAQ to anyone interested in the wider implications of DRM and Trusted Computing technology and legislation .

There 's quite a bit of reference to Microsoft in the article , and when I read : " with Microsoft in the monopoly position , it probably figures it can harass everyone else 's customers into subjection " that triggered memories of some talk , a few years ago , about Microsoft wanting to change course and enter the media business .
They had gotten involved in MSNBC , and the commentary had it that that was just a matter of " testing the waters . "
According to the comments , Microsoft was beginning to discover that there were limits to the software business -
It could n't keep adding features indefinitely ( which would be mostly " bloatware " anyway ) , and expect that people would keep rushing out to buy new software versions when their current software did everything they needed .
With a little forward thinking , Microsoft had come to the conclusion that the media business was where the real money could be made ; I remember even reading something to the effect that Microsoft may want to turn itself into a media company , and deemphasise ( or perhaps even quit ? ) the software business .
Software would , then , actually become just the tool to support their media business - Which I now presume to mean their media monopoly position .

Y'know , it 's a sad day when a consumer is forced to break the law by purchasing
something .
All DRM does is to restrict what you can or cannot do with the music you
purchase .
So why should I put up with that ?
I own an MP3 player .
It 's not a brand named one ( I 'm not rich and I do n't care
for logos .
It plays music and I have n't had to sue the manufacturer because of
scratches yet ) so it 's not " supported " by the music pigopolists .
That
is to say I am not " allowed " to copy music such as Coldplay 's X& Y
to it .
Right , let 's just put that another way :
I purchased a music disk ( bet you can't find the Phillips CD logo on X&Y ) on
faith on the basis that it would play on my device .
I purchased a music player on faith on the basis that it would play music I
chose to purchase .
I am not allowed to play music I have purchased on my device .
Why not ?
Well , obviously because I , as a music consumer , am an evil pirate and
by copying this album onto my player it will automatically be shared with the
whole Internet by magic and no - one else will ever by X&Y again .
Yes , I 'm overplaying things a bit .
Some die - hard fans ( like me ) will purchase it
to make sure the 27 p the band gets actually gets to them .
Some will buy it for
the artwork .
The world - view supported by the music industry is one that normally gets you a
Psych nurse and a course of anti-paranoia drugs .
The policy makers obviously
need our help and pity as , once more , Care in the Community fails those Mental
Health patients most at need .
Sorry , just to re-itterate , as a consumer I should put up with a sub- standard
product with severe restrictions that _may_not_even_work_ becasue if not the
music industry will collapse .
Bye guys .
Let 's start again .
X&Y will be my last " music disk "
purchase .

I suggest only using online music sites that offer DRM - free downloads , see this
article :
http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/guide/
( the box labelled " A Few Alternatives " . )
Granted that these sites will not have as many mainstream artists but I think
the quality of music is definitely top and I have gained far more exposure to
what is on offer in my favourite genres .
Rather than listen to the same tired
old pop they play on the radio everyday .

I find Digitally Imported quite good .
They stream MP3s to you in a variety of genres and at a variety of bitrates .
I 've been known to listen to the Classical and Salsa streams , but also Goa and Trance .
I would never have known about Goa music if it were not for www.di.fm
Of course you do n't get to choose what they play , so if you are looking for a particular piece of Mozart , better try www.archive.org instead .
Another cool thing you can do is try www.shoutcast.com and search the roughly 11000 " internet radio " stations they list , for something which suits your mood .
It 's good that the internet has enabled " radio stations " to specialise somewhat .
Of course these " stations " cannot reach millions of listeners ( until we develop a streaming technology which works like BitTorrent ) but the most popular stations on shoutcast are serving several thousand users at once .

Anyone heard of Nikka Costa ?
The first big grown - up CD from her : ' Everybody Got
Their Something ' was a lot better than her latest and I could even buy it over
the counter .
Sadly it also sounds very muffled and needs full treble to sound
remotely normal - but Hi-Fi apart it 's got some good tracks .
Her latest " Ca n't Never Did Nothin " is not so good , still no one has
heard of her and I had to buy mine on ebay from China !!
I got the Japanese
version as there is an extra track on it and I noticed it 's also got exactly the
same copy protection notices on it as the Coldplay one .
Because most CDs are spoilt by excessive clipping in the mastering ( e.g .
http://www.cutestudio.co.uk/data/Hi-Fi/CD/index.html)I do not have a CD player
anymore - I just rip them as WAV or mp3 and serve then using my own version of
Daapd in Debian to iTunes on my Mac , which de-clips the guilty tracks in real
time and prevents my pro-audio D/ A from getting upset .
Yes , half my CDs ( which I
paid GOOD MONEY for ) are useless in quality and can sound worse than a cassette
tape .
All the protection stuff was in Japanese on the sleeve note - so I visited the
Toshiba based web page it gave and got google to translate - it is the same
system .
Eventually I tried to just GRIP it under Debian and it worked fine
except no CDDB info .
In fact the WAV files seem fine ( includes treble this time
and also not too much severe clipping ) .
What I found REALLY ironic is that they are protecting someones record who quite
frankly you cannot even buy over here , there is no merchandise and no DVDs ,
ANYWHERE for her - it is quite the most appallingly miss - marketed person in the
history of pop .
And they protect the her latest record - trying to stop me
listening to it even once !
Doh !
Doh !

This whole DRM things is an excercise in futility .
Industry claims this is necessary to protect their revenue .
Their revenue is
falling faster now than before .
Some protection that is .
Industry claims DRM protects their contect against piracy .
Riiiiigghht .... pull
the other one it has bells on it .
Any competent audiophile can tell you more
than one way to record the content off any of these protected CDs .
Here 's a
question I would love to ask someone in the industry .
" Tell me , you say DRM
prevents piracy , how does the inconvinience of using high quality analogue
playback equipment to source a master copy prevent a pirate ?
Such a pirate
would see the hour or two spent ripping and reproducing the CD as a minor
investment in time compared to the $ 1000s made selling the forgeries .
Is n't it
true that DRM does nothing to prevent such piracy ? "
I think we already
know the answer to this .
DRM on music CDs and DRM encumbered MP3s are not targetting piracy , they target
the consumer .
The consumer is restricted in terms of the playback device and
their fair use of the content in terms of making * personal * backups .
This same
things is of course true for DVD , and the ever so wonderful and yet somehow very
pointless region coding scheme that does nothing more than inconvinience
consumers .
Search Ebay and you 'll find plenty of evidence that DRM on CD and
region coding on DVD are pathetic anti-piracy measures .
With regard to CDs there are any number of ways to rip the content from a
' protected ' CD .
The first thing any Windows user should do is permanently
disable autoplay on their computer , Google provides dozens of hits on how to do
this .
Next get a decent CD ripper , many are available .
Often the very algorithms used
to allow CD playback to ignore scratches on the disks allow the rippers to read
' protected ' content .
Alternately get a good audio CD player , a good audio cable and hook it up to
your sound card .
Play the CD , record it to a high sample rate WAV format and
then down convert to MP3 .
Do not purchase MP3s online , this will only encourage the RIAA into believing
that they are actually doing the right thing .
MP3 files purchase online ( or MP4s
at I - tunes ) are typically of relatively poor quality , they are certainly not of
the same quality as an actual CD .
Why would I pay a dollar a track for an MP3
or equivalent recorded at a paltry 128 Kbps ?
It 's a con trick of the industry ,
selling an inferior product with sever DRM encumberance .
I may be going against the grain here , but buying an actual CD and ripping it is
the only way to go .
I do n't and will not give any kind of support to the RIAA
and it 's brand of fraud and blackmail .
I do n't and will not give any kind of
support to piracy of copyright material .
I do , however , reserve my right or
privilege to make a personal backup copy of anything I purchase .
Until the
recording industry ( and movies too ) is willing to replace my damaged CDs and
DVDs at a nominal cost , I will continue to make backup copies when I can to
preservemy purchase .
I paid for the disc , I paid for the licence to listen to
the content .
If the physical embodiment of the content I purchase is damaged ,
that does not alter my purchase of the licence to use it .

... is that Microsoft 's advertising slogan " Plays For Sure " is nothing
but an admission of how bad the whole DRM mess really is .
Back in the days of vinyl LP's and plain old standards compliant CD's , it was
* expected * that the media would play on any equipment , and any media that failed
to play was considered obviously defective and could easily be exchanged .
Now that we have DRM , the expectation is that customers will have problems , and
Microsoft wants us to believe that their product is better because it supposedly
does n't cause as many problems as some of the alternatives .
" Plays For Sure " is newspeak for " Does n't suck as much " .

Thank you very much for purchasing this CD and helping the cause of " Anti-Piracy " .
The recordings in this CD have an anti-copying function .
They can not be copied into a PC .
In order for you to enjoy high quality music , we have added this special technology .
Actually , the part in bold is not exactly the truth as I would word it .
If fact most of the paragraph falls short .
Thank you very much for purchasing this CD and helping the cause of " Anti-Piracy " .
Probably the reason for purchasing the CD was the music , and without thought or regard to helping or hindering any particular cause .
Seems someone is paranoid you will buy the CD and then steal it after you bought it .
The recordings in this CD have an anti-copying function .
It would be better worded - The recordings in this CD have an anti-copying frustration for the technically uninclined .
They can not be copied into a PC .
Well sorta true , I guess , but they certainly can be ripped to format of your choice , if you know how to avoid the frustration function .
In order for you to enjoy high quality music , we have added this special technology .
I woulda been okay enjoying normal CD quality music .
Otherwise I have real problem with the logic behind this weird sentence .

You know , this DRM thing seems doomed to failure , it's to inflexible and too
nasty .
I have an idea for a DRM scheme that actually could work , but it takes a little
effort on everyone 's part , as well as some patience on the part of the content
industry .
Encryption .
Encrypt the content using a two key encryption scheme .
Give me , the consumer , a key device ( a small bluetooth capable device that is
robust and waterproof ) that stores my personal key .
When I purchase a CD or DVD the content is encrypted at the time of purchase
using my key and the industry key and burned to the media ( or downloaded to my
computer ) .
The encrypted file is useless to me unless I use my key for playback .
My PC ,
audio player , video player car stereo , portable audio device can all request the
playback key from my key device , and play the track .
If I take the disk or
whatever to a friends house , it will play there too , I just need to take my key
with me .
The encryption scheme and key technology needs to be an open standard to allow
for mass production without heavy license costs .
The key length can be something
completely ridiculous to prevent easy real time decryption of media files .
Now , if my disk breaks I can get another easily , my purchase was recorded at
the store , a replacement can be burned in minutes .
Of course this protection scheme will eventually be broken , someone will make
un -encrypted content and try to sell it .
However , most people are honest .
Most
people will actually pay for things instead of stealing them .
Making the legal
choice flexible and convinient to the consumer provides an easy choice to all
but those already inclined to do the wrong thing .
One last element is using the encryption model to bundle additional content ,
that is only available to the keyholder on an interactive basis .
This provides a
further incentive to purchase the legal way .
Now , this will never happen because the RIAA and MPAA are not patient enough or
farsighted enough to try it , not to mention Microsoft and Intel have almost a
vested interest in the current DRM technologies , where as this scheme would put
the control back in the hands of the consumer and the manufacturers of consumer
electronics . [ Reply to This | # ]

Then you 'll be able to make copies of your music .
Even if it means taking the
speaker out wires into a jack that plugs into my old digital minidisk recorder .
The point is no one should have to go through that effort .
I 'm sort of torn on this one .
I hate to see users put through that , but every
time one of these DRM stories break site traffic surges on my online music site
where full non-DRM sample tracks are available under a CreativeCommons license .
It 's a little disingenuous to complain too loud when record label stupidity is
boosting my user base .

Back in Mozart 's day , copying music was NOT a crime in any sense , though you
certainly were n't going to enhance your reputation as an artist merely by
reproducing somebody elses work .
In fact , most composers learned their craft by
copying and extending scores of earlier masters .
Lots of music credited to J.S .
Bach may have in fact been written by his sons , or others extended themes
created by Bach , and Bach himself copied and extended the work of his
predecessors and contemporaries .
The most famous example of this is Charles
Gounod 's version of Ave Maria which is based on the first prelude from Bach's
Well - Tempered Clavier .
If you look at Bethoven 's first couple of piano sonata's ,
they are clearly derived from Hayden 's work .
Eventually , Beethoven develops his
own style and becomes a master in his own right .
Given the extreme productivity
of composers before the existence of copyright , I 'd not persuaded that copyright
laws do anything to encourage musical creativity .
Incidentally , the Goodman story is interesting .
Goodman .
like a lot of others ,
made a pile of money by taking black music and making it accessible to white
audiences .
To Goodman 's credit , he was one of the first to employ black
musicians in his orchestra .
Despite making a lot of money , he felt his clarinet
playing was substandard and made a significant effort to become an accomplished
classical player as well .

Well , that settles it .
I 'm a pretty good music industry customer .
I 'm not opposed to buying CDs with
only one or two good songs on 'em ( in fact , I 've got a couple shelves of CDs I
bought just for one or two songs ... ) and I have enough disposable income to buy
several ( more than 10 ) CDs a year .
I find new music by listening to radio .
Good old FM .
Coldplay is one of those " sorta - like " bands .
I 've seen 'em on SNL ,
heard 'em on the radio , and generally think their sound makes nice background
" white noise " .
Much nicer than Celine Dion or Metallica .
( your taste
may vary )
Because of this , they had been on my " pick up if in the bargain
bin " list .
With this DRM crap , though , I will absolutely never own a Coldplay CD .
If I
ever need a Coldplay song to round out a " late 90's " mix for my mp3
player , I will use my AM / FM / Casette player ( vintage 1984 ) to record an * analog *
copy , then digitize it to create an mp3 .
Congrats , morons , you just lost a customer .

Hi , I was discussing issues of copyright and intellectual propery with my wife last night based of this article .
This Coldplay fiasco is another example of what IP should not be .
In fact , it is one of the worst examples I have ever seen .
I wonder , however , what a " good " example of IP would look like ?
Unlike some within this community , I think that there should be some limits against free flow of information , just as there have to be some limits on free speech .
An obvious example of the latter is yelling " FIRE " in a crowded theater .
The danger to community is so great that it outweighs the freedom of speech .
And what about the rights of the author of music , software , etc . ?
It seems like he should be able to say , " I will only release this [ art / software /etc. ] under the following conditions " .
Obviously , in today 's world , the supposed " rights " of the author [ and , unfortunately , most often the RIAA , MPAA , etc. ] are considered paramount and the " rights " of the public are considered inconsequential .
Esepcially with the " rights " holders exercising money and muscle on Capitol Hill ( in the US ) , it is an un-even , unfair , and unjust dynamic .
I would like to see the laws change to release the stranglehold that some corporations have over ideas .
I just do n't know what I think they should change to .
I just read that there is a new political party in Sweden that wants to abolosih ALL IP laws .
I 'm not sure that I think that course is wise .
Lawrence Lessig asserts that there should be some IP rights , but that they have to be modernized to deal with the reality of the digital world ( e.g. , what good is copyright in a world where even loading an object on your computer is a copy ) .
He states , and correctly so , that the country ( the USA ) is not yet ready for that kind of discussion ( on what IP should and should n't be ) because any time you challenge the current laws , you are labeled a " pirate " .
So , my open question to this group is what should " modern " IP laws look like ?
Do we have any good examples of " IP " now ?
Does copyright have a place in the modern world ?
What about patents in general ?
Patents for software ?
What kind of trade - offs do we having in protecting the producers and consumers of ideas ?
If you could re-write IP laws from scratch , what would they look like in your " perfect world " ?

My daughter is 12 years old .
She just got a CD this christmas , and of course she
tried to do what she does whith her new CD 's , upload it to her ipod .
Well , this one was sony OMA ( or whatever ) thing , and there is no way to do it .
She does n't have cd player , she does n't listen the CD 's at all , she only uses
the CD to purchase the music , and ipod is her only player
Now she has learned that not all CDs are created equal , some she can play and
enjoy , some others not , even if she has paid for them the same ( or more ) .
Her
learning : from now on she will be very careful selecting who produces the CD ,
not only the singer .
Of course Sony is in her black list .

So I do n't sample music or download it , unless I paid for it first .
Which does raise another point , now that I think of it .
It used to be you could listen to music on the radio , or go to a record store and listen to a song to see if you wanted to buy it .
Nowadays , the radio does n't play anything I 'd personally like to buy , no matter what part of the US I go to .
And I do n't remember the last time I went to a record store , if they even call them that any more .
Have you tried CD Baby ?
Just about all the albums have songs that you can legally download ( in non -DRM mp3 format ) and listen to .
They sell you ordinary CDs without the spyware and they offer a very wide selection of artists .
The answer to DRM is to point - blank refuse to deal with anyone who uses it .
There are alternatives .
Encourage your friends .
PS : it is bad to reinforce the mental association between sampling music and breaking the law .
The law only protects the ability of the copyright holder to set license terms -- the details of those license terms are up for negotiation .
Just because a few prominent copyright holders are dictating unreasonable terms does not make for any sort of legal standard that everyone else must follow .

In struck me this morning that this whole DRM issue is moot .
In actual fact the
music CD is extinct .
The information has not filtered through to the forebrain
from the hind brain yet but the fact is it is extinct .
It is a case of the tail
wagging the Dodo , if I may mix metaphores .
Why ?
How many people are saying that they no longer buy CDs , how many download .
The pod is king !
It takes a certain critical mass for a technological revolution
where the price falls to an acceptable level and avaiability increases along
with choice .
Expect to see portable CD players dissapear , forever , first .
It is
becoming a pod world whether the record companies like it or not .
Who will buy DRM enabled CD players ?
Well , by the time you have replaced the one
in your lounge , the one in your car , your jogging one , the one in the home cine
set , the one in the boys room how much will you have spent to replace them all ?
Just because they cannot play the new , wonderfull , protected ones .
Then out
comes DRM II and they wo n't play that .
Just how long willl consumers be prepared
to continue plunging hand into pocket .
As the price , availability , ease of use and ease of downloadability of pods
changes then they will naturally replace the lumbering CD as the new rulers .
My
portable player , never less than 1 CD in diameter , will get replaced by a pod
not a CD player .
Just look at the size for a start .
Pods will become part of the
hifi replacing the CD as the CD has pushed out vinyl .
The music companies will be sidelined .
Studios will rise from the ashes .
Why ?
Artists will use them to produce their own music that they will sell directly .
The studio will develop into a rapidly configurable , drop in shop that artists
can hire and walk away with a recording .
Some musicians will produce at home
but others may want a couple of hours worth of the studio's pet orchestra .
A
huge culture shift is about to happen .
The music companies will be left holding a bag of old catalogue material that is
declining in worth as musicians become forgotten .
A whole new music scene will
rise , mammel like , from under the feet of the fallen dinosaur .

On the original site that I saw about this license , I also saw a photo of the
jewel case with the " CD " logo visible .
I thought that Phillips , the
owner of the " CD " trademark , had declined to allow its use on silver
disks implementing DRM , as they did not adhere to the standards defining how
actual CD 's are to store data .
1 ) Is this true ?
2 ) How might it affect any of the statements about the validity of the license ,
as the silver disk within was mis-represented as being an actual CD ? [ Reply to This | # ]

I find it quite odd that people think writing down a piece of music after
hearing it is some sort of magical or even remarkable feat .
While it might be
for a 12 year old boy .
It is not for a skilled musician .
But then I have studied
music all my life .
As Richard Stallman pointed out in his lecture on software pantents , what a
professional in one field sees as common place and simple , others not familiar
with it see it as remarkable and uniuqe .
That is a lovely myth about Mozart's
brilliance as a child .
But for a musician writing down what he heard is they
same as a secretary taking dictation on a note pad or a court repporter being
able to acurately trancsribe the proeceedings by hand .
While it is a laudible
skill , its not something that is totally uniuque .
The Vatican , it seems did not
understand that what can be heard can be written down .
It seems that Music
Publishers share the same short sightedness with the Vatican .
Other musicians of the time could have done the same thing , for example , Franz
Joseph Haydn .
However they were to busy writing music for their own employers .
Haydn was employed for most of his life as the court composer for Prince
Nikolaus Esterházy .
For an interesting account of Haydn 's life , and of the times
in which both he and Mozart lived , read this essay :
< http://www.carolinaclassical.com/articles/haydn.html > .
Haydn himslef was concerned about owning the rights to the music he wrote for
the court and worked diligently to keep the rights to his work .
He was also
concerned about people stealing his music and passing it off as their own .
As
well , he had reason to be concerned that some composers were selling their own
scores as Haydn 's work because they would fetch more money .
None of these rights issues are new it seems .
By the way , Mozart and Haydn new
each other hand they both had great respect and admiration for the other .
cheers ,

and found on the fourth results page the URL : http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ushankar/recordings/
which contains links to MP3 files of the music itself , which I have not downloaded , but verified as valid links using the the link checker at http://validator.w3.org/checklink, so feel free to browse , download and give the brave clarinetist who made these recordings available a thankyou .

It 's remarkable how many posters miss one simple technological point : if there
is even one dumb CD player in the world that will play the Coldplay disc , that
means there is unencrypted Red Book audio on the CD .
It is n't necessary to make
an analog conversion or to capture streaming digital audio on its way to the
sound card .
All that is necessary is to configure the computer as a dumb CD
player , which on a Windows machine means turning off Autorun / Autoplay .
How can it be a violation of the DMCA to extract digital content that is not

100 .
Musical instrument shops must pay an annual royalty to cover shoppers who perform a recognisable riff before they buy , thereby making a " public performance " .
Forgive me for being crazy , but might not this fall foul of racketeering statutes ?
I mean , they 're essentially saying , " we know your customers are doing public performances of our songs .
We can't be bothered to prove it , but give us some cash and we wo n't break your kneecaps , er , I mean , sue you . "
Can that be legal ?

I have not seen this posted in the thread or related ones .
Sorry if it is duplicated elsewhere .
One of Coldplay 's competitors , 50 Foot Wave - a loud alternative band from Boston , recently distributed a new release called Free Music under the Creative Commons license scheme .
Their reasons for doing so are interesting to read : " The band states its goal as simply to circumvent the ' money cycle ' and get high quality ( free ) recordings into the hands of a maximum number of people for evaluation at their leisure . "

Well know , since I do not own a seperate cd player at the moment ( and have no

games that just wont run in linux ) , I guess I will just have to forgo the latest
crude from Coldplay .
I did like ' Parachutes ' and ( to an extent ) ' Rush of blood
to the head ' .
Anyone ever noticed that most bands have good songs , get signed up by big labels
and they start releasing ( mass - market ) crude .
Also , just out of curiousity , when these bands release ' re - makes ' of old songs
( ie re-make of ' The Tide is High ' by some girl group , ' What about me ? ' by that
Aussie Idol guy etc ) , does it re-new the copyright held by the labels ?

The case is the latest in a series of scandals for the US army
The girl and three family members were allegedly killed by four US soldiers .
Graphic details of the attack at the family 's home came in a sworn statement by one of the accused , James P Barker .
The preliminary hearing will decide whether to court - martial the four .
The case is one of a series of atrocities blamed on US forces in Iraq .
Along with Sergeant Paul Cortez , Private Jesse Spielman , and Private Bryan Howard , Specialist Barker is charged with rape and murder .
The four are alleged to have helped a former private - Steven Green , who has since left the army - plan , carry out and cover up the attack .
Mr Green has pleaded not guilty in a federal court and will be tried separately in the US .
A fifth soldier is alleged to have lied to cover up for his colleagues .
' Whisky and golf '
Investigator Benjamin Bierce interviewed Mr Barker , 23 , on 30 June and took down his statement , he told the hearing at a US military base in Baghdad .
On the day of the attack the soldiers had been drinking Iraqi whisky mixed with an energy drink and practising golf strokes at a checkpoint south of Baghdad , Mr Barker 's statement said .
One of the soldiers , Steven Green , said he " wanted to go to a house and kill some Iraqis , " it alleged .
The four eventually went to a house about 200 metres ( yards ) away and put the parents and their five - year old daughter in the bedroom , but kept the older girl in the living room .
According to Mr Barker 's statement , he and Mr Cortez took it in turns to rape or attempt to rape her .
Mr Barker heard shots from the bedroom , and Steven Green emerged with an AK - 47 in his hand saying " They 're all dead .
I just killed them . "
Steven Green , who has pleaded not guilty , is being tried separately
According to the testimony , Mr Green then also raped the girl and shot her dead .
Her body was doused in kerosene and set alight .
The first day of the hearing on Sunday saw an Iraqi army medic describe how he found the bodies of the four Iraqis .
He told prosecutors he was ill for weeks after witnessing the crime scene .
Proceedings are expected to continue for several days .
BBC Baghdad correspondent Jane Peel says the Mahmudiya attack is one of the worst in a series of alleged atrocities committed by US troops in Iraq .
When news of it emerged last month it caused outrage and led to calls for changes in the agreement that exempts American soldiers from prosecution in the Iraqi courts .

The Agriculture Department is now trying to trace any animals born on the ranch in the same year or in the years before or after , as well as any offspring of the cow born in the last two years .
All will be tested for the disease , which will mean killing them because parts of the brain must be scooped out to do the tests .
Dr. Clifford would not identify the ranch , calling that " privileged information . "
Nor would he name the pet food plant , explaining that the department relied on the voluntary cooperation of such plants for brain samples .
They specialize in turning diseased , dying and dead animals into pet food or into dried meal for poultry and pigs , as well as into tallow , gelatin and other products .
It is too early to tell what effect the announcement will have on beef sales .
On Saturday , after it became clear that the United States had a second case of mad cow disease , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy , and that it did not originate in Canada as the first had , Taiwan reimposed a ban on American beef it had lifted two months ago .
But domestic beef sales and futures prices have remained relatively steady .
Asked whether any other states might ban imports of Texas cattle , Dr. Clifford said he hoped not .
" It would n't make sense with the safeguards we have in place , " he said .
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas issued a statement urging citizens to remain calm and be reassured that they could trust the state 's beef .
As Zarqawi described in his letter and in subsequent broadcasts , his strategy in Iraq is to strike at the Shia -- and thereby provoke a civil war .
" A nation of heretics , " the Shia " are the key element of change , " he wrote .
" If we manage to draw them onto the terrain of partisan war , it will be possible to tear the Sunnis away from their heedlessness , for they will feel the weight of the imminence of danger . "
Again a strategy of provocation -- which plays on an underlying reality : that Iraq sits on the critical sectarian fault line of the Middle East and that a conflict there gains powerful momentum from the involvement of neighboring states , with Iran strongly supporting the Shia and with Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Jordan and Syria strongly sympathetic to the Sunnis .
More and more , you can discern this outline in the chaos of the current war , with the Iranian - trained militias of the Shia Islamist parties that now control the Iraqi government battling Sunni Islamists , both Iraqi and foreign - born , and former Baathists .
In the midst of it all , increasingly irrelevant , are the Americans , who have the fanciest weapons but have never had sufficient troops , or political will , to assert effective control over the country .
If political authority comes from achieving a monopoly on legitimate violence , then the Americans , from those early days when they sat in their tanks and watched over the wholesale looting of public institutions , never did achieve political authority in Iraq .
They fussed over liberalizing the economy and writing constitutions and achieving democracy in the Middle East when in fact there was really only one question in Iraq , emerging again and again in each successive political struggle , most recently in the disastrously managed writing of the constitution : how to shape a new political dispensation in which the age - old majority Shia can take control from the minority Sunni and do it in a way that minimized violence and insecurity -- do it in a way , that is , that the Sunnis would be willing to accept , however reluctantly , without resorting to armed resistance .
This might have been accomplished with hundreds of thousands of troops , iron control and a clear sense of purpose .
The Americans had none of these .
Instead they relied first on a policy of faith and then on one of improvisation , driven in part by the advice of Iraqi exile " friends " who used the Americans for their own purposes .
Some of the most strikingly ideological decisions , like abruptly firing and humiliating the entire Iraqi Army and purging from their jobs many hundreds of thousands of Baath Party members , seemed designed to alienate and antagonize a Sunni population already terrified of its security in the new Iraq .
" You Americans , " one Sunni businessman said to me in Baghdad last February , shaking his head in wonder , " you have created your own enemies here . "
The United States never used what authority it had to do more than pretend to control the gathering chaos , never managed to look clearly at the country and confront Iraq 's underlying political dysfunction , of which the tyranny of Saddam Hussein was the product , not the cause .
" The illusionists , " Ambassador John Negroponte 's people called their predecessors , the officials of the Coalition Provisional Authority under L. Paul Bremer III .
Now , day by day , the illusion is slipping away , and with it what authority the Americans had in Iraq .
What is coming to take its place looks increasingly like a failed state .
VI .
It is an oft - heard witticism in Washington that the Iraq war is over and that the Iranians won .
And yet the irony seems misplaced .
A truly democratic Iraq was always likely to be an Iraq led not only by Shia , who are the majority of Iraqis , but by those Shia parties that are the largest and best organized -- the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and the Dawa Islamic Party -- which happen to be those blessed by the religious authorities and nurtured in Iran .
Nor would it be a surprise if a democratic Saudi Arabia turned out to be a fundamentalist Saudi Arabia and one much less friendly to the United States .
Osama bin Laden knows this , and so do American officials .
This is why the United States is " friendly " with " apostate regimes . "
Democratic outcomes do not always ensure friendly governments .
Often the contrary is true .
On this simple fact depends much of the history of American policy not only in the Middle East but also in Latin America and other parts of the world throughout the cold war .
Bush administration officials , for all their ideological fervor , did the country no favor by ignoring it .
In launching his new cold war , George W. Bush chose a peculiarly ideological version of cold - war history .
He opted not for containment , the cautious , status quo grand strategy usually attributed to the late George F. Kennan , but for rollback .
Containment , by which the United States determinedly resisted Soviet attempts to expand its influence , would have meant a patient , methodical search for terrorists , discriminating between those groups that threaten the United States and those that do not , pursuing the former with determined , practical policies that would have drawn much from the military and law - enforcement cooperation of our allies and that would have included an effective program of nonproliferation to keep weapons of mass destruction out of terrorist hands .
Rollback , on the other hand , meant something quite different ; those advocating it during the 1950's considered containment immoral , for it recognized the status quo : Communist hegemony in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia .
They wanted instead to destroy Communism entirely by " rolling back " Communists from territory they had gained , as Gen. Douglas MacArthur did briefly and , it turned out , catastrophically , in North Korea , and as President Eisenhower refused to do when he declined to support the Hungarian revolutionaries against the Soviet invasion in 1956 .
The original advocates of rollback lost that struggle .
In this new cold war , the rollback advocates triumphed and adopted as the heart of their policy a high - stakes , metaphysical gamble to " democratize the Middle East " and thus put an end , once and for all , to terrorism .
They relied on a " domino theory " in which the successful implantation of democracy in Iraq would lead to a " democratic revolution " across the region .
The ambition of this idea is breathtaking ; it depends on a conception of American power as virtually limitless and on an entirely fanciful vision of Iraqi politics , a kind of dogged political wish - fulfillment that no sober analysis could penetrate .
Replacing any real willingness to consider whether a clear course existed between here and there , between an invasion and occupation of Iraq and a democratic Middle East , was , at bottom , the simple conviction that since the United States enjoyed a " preponderance of power " unseen in the world since the Roman Empire , and since its cause of democratic revolution was so incontrovertibly just , defeat was inconceivable .
One detects here an echo of Vietnam : the inability to imagine that the all - powerful United States might lose .
American power , however , is not limitless .
Armies can destroy and occupy , but it takes much more to build a lasting order , especially on the shifting sands of a violent political struggle : another Vietnam echo .
Learning the lesson this time around may prove more costly , for dominoes can fall both ways .
" Political engineering on this scale could easily go awry , " Stephen D. Biddle , a U.S. Army War College analyst , wrote this past April in a shrewd analysis .
" If a democratic Iraq can catalyze reform elsewhere , so a failed Iraq could presumably export chaos to its neighbors .
A regionwide Lebanon might well prove beyond our capacity to police , regardless of effort expended .
And if so , then we will have replaced a region of police states with a region of warlords and chronic instability .
This could easily prove to be an easier operating environment for terrorism than the police states it replaces . "
“ All of the things are good for you to do in general , ” Dr. Elizabeth Edgerly , a clinical psychologist with the Alzheimer ’s Association , said .
“ Do I have concerns ?
Yes .
We ’re very cautious .
Is it going to mean you can remember where you left your car keys ?
We ca n’t say that . ”
Still , the appeal of the programs is strong .
Epoch Senior Living in Providence is among the many assisted living facilities with “ brain fitness centers . ”
Surrounded by posters of Einstein , Rodin ’s “ Thinker , ” and “ Brain Facts ” ( “ one billion glial cells in the human brain ” ) , residents spend an hour a day for eight weeks doing computer exercises involving recalling story details and distinguishing similar - sounding syllables .
David Horvitz , 92 , an Epoch resident , said , “ It did improve my concentration , particularly when I read .
Before , my mind would wander and I ’d have to reread passages several times .
It also seems to me that I ’m remembering names a little bit better . ”
Emeritus Assisted Living , a chain , started a brain health program for residents , their families , staff members and people in the community .
So far , centers in Florida , Massachusetts and South Carolina offer “ brain - healthy ” foods like salmon and walnuts , activities like spelling bees and reminiscing games , prizes to staff members for recalling brain health trivia , and a “ brain health self - assessment ” questionnaire asking , among other things , if people play challenging board games , walk 10,000 steps a day , or eat flax seed three times a week .
The brain program at the Isle at Emerald Court in Tewksbury , Mass. , an Emeritus facility , includes a five - day - a - week regimen of leg lifts and stretches on the burgundy jacquard lobby chairs , influenced Ray Decker to choose the center for his mother , Joan , 75 , who is in the early stage of Alzheimer’s .
“ Those types of things may stimulate her brain and , despite her debilitating disease , she actually may come back a little , ” said Mr. Decker , 57 , who plans to adopt brain - healthy activities .
“ I think that this will keep my mother healthy for some time to come , actually extend her life in a mental and physical manner . ”
Earlier this year , the woman in my life and I decided to postpone our wedding .
My partner - whom I will call Barry to confuse you into thinking we are a gay couple and thereby protect her anonymity - and I decided it was n't worth it .
As Barry and I are the sort of Guardian - reading types who not only grow their own alfalfa from politically correct Cuban seeds but weave the results into bicycles that we ride to work and then eat for lunch , we never really wanted to get married .
( How do we get home from work you ask ?
Why , we grow alfalfa at the office too ! )
We preferred instead to knit each other eco-friendly shirts from each other 's hair of an evening .
For 20 years we have lived together happily in sin .
As Joni Mitchell put it in words that make right - thinking alfalfa weavers the world over cry into their hemp singlets : " We do n't need no piece of paper from the City Hall , keeping us tied and true . "
Nor , being atheists , do Barry and I take marriage to be a sacrament , while we obviously totally respect those who do .
What , then , made us contemplate solemnising our commitment to each other at a pounds 100 bumper fun day out with the nice lady registrar from Islington council ?
It was the thought that if I was run over on my alfalfa bike by a bus , my laughable pension would not find its way into Barry 's bank account .
It was also because custody of our baby daughter , whose anonymity I will protect by calling her Arthur , would not fall to me in the event of Barry 's death , but quite possibly to Barry 's mother , whom I will be calling Peter .
Frankly , I do n't want Peter to raise Arthur , not least because Peter has consistently frowned on Barry 's alfalfa - based lifestyle , damn him !
Let 's call the nice lady registrar Reg , incidentally .
But there was a problem .
Lots of other people insisted on horning in on our bumper fun day .
Our distant relatives Hengist and Horsa , not to mention Uncle Siegfried , Cousin Tristan and Auntie Brunnhilde ( real names withheld ) wanted to come , too .
" You 've got to make it into a big day where you declare your love publicly , " said one of my male friends , whom we will call Isolde .
But as Barry and I declare our love incessantly in private , and our intimates surely know of our feelings , that reason hardly seemed compelling .
We started to get cold feet .
And then we found out that if I signed a nomination form and sent it to my pension department , my laughable pension would go to Barry in the event of my demise .
We discovered , too , that if we changed our wills , our daughter Arthur could be raised legally by me and not Barry 's mum if Barry died .
So Barry called Reg and told him the wedding was off .
" Happens all the time , Barry , " said Reg .
How does all this bear on the Law Commission 's proposals to give cohabiting couples the same rights as married ones ?
According to Tory women 's spokesman Eleanor Laing , people like me and Barry are likely to make a mockery of marriage if the proposals become law .
" Of course people who cohabit for a significant length of time have some rights over mutually acquired assets , but there ought to remain a distinction between cohabitation and marriage , " she says .
One of those " mutually acquired assets " , Eleanor , is Peter , our daughter , thanks very much .
In any case , had these proposals loomed before we contacted Reg , we would n't have bothered with our nixed nuptials at the town hall .
But is marriage such a tender flower that people like me and Barry risk crushing it under our bike wheels ( before , of course , sensibly recycling it on our compost heap ) ?
The extension of legal rights to Barry and me is inevitable , given that they have already been granted by means of civil partnerships to the likes of my gay friends , whom I will call Susan and Jeremy .
And why should n't we have them ?
After all , just because we do n't want to be married does n't imply that we are a couple of flakes who can't commit .
We are Barry and Stuart , a couple who love each other so much that we wear each other 's hair to prove it .
Project Stuart , which you may recall was established as a makeover project to rival Project Gordon , the scheme aimed at making the chancellor cuddlesomely electable , is back .
This week , my makeover specialists decided that I should copy John Prescott and get rid of things that taint my otherwise unimpeachable proletarian credentials .
The deputy prime minister has dispensed with Dorneywood ; I 've put my inflatable travel croquet set on eBay .
No great loss : it always took a lot of puff to blow up the mallet and the balls raced over the lawn in windy conditions .
What 's more , I 've subscribed to Tesco's GI Diets , and they 've just sent me an email headlined : " Tone up - Lose the beer gut !
Start today ! "
In the spirit of cooperation that must exist between Project Stuart and Project Prescott , my minders are going to get the deputy prime minister signed up , too .
The idea is that Prezza will not not just be a deputy prime minister without portfolio but also without the unslightly belt overhang .
With luck and hard work , John , our guts will soon be history and we 'll both be the best that we can be !
Finally I 'd like to apologise to Jordan for writing that she leads a worthless life .
I made a tangential swipe at her in an article about British values .
Several correspondents have pointed out that she is raising a disabled child .
But that 's not the reason I want to say sorry .
It 's not because of the difficulties she may be facing as a mother , but because it 's shameful for me to condemn a whole life without knowing it .
I can't help but think of how , on Celebrity Big Brother two years ago , Johnny Rotten derided Jordan for her celebrity .
Fair enough , except for the fact that he incessantly referred to her as " it " , which undermined any sense his critique of her celebrity might have had .
My blanket dismissal of her " worthless " life was similarly hopeless .
I do n't want to be one of those toxic columnists who get paid for being baselessly nasty .
Nor do I want to be like Sharon Osbourne , who said foul things about Rebecca Loos , or the Boston man who wrote abusively to me saying that judging from my picture byline , a rabbit had crawled up my bum .
So shame on me .
On the plus side , though , the rabbit is thriving .
· This week Stuart watched The March of the Penguins and Grizzly Man , and preferred the latter 's bleak existential vision to the former 's twee one .
Stuart saw Tate Modern 's rehang , loved the Munoz and the Rothko rooms , and the Beuys installation but quickly got tired and irritable as he always does when he goes there , so had a lie down outside
So there 's this dude who was playing Wii Sports bowling , as his story goes , and his pal rolls a Lebowski and the next thing you know the strap breaks from the force of the swing ; his slippery hands let loose , and the Wiimote flies like a missile and cracks his pal 's TV .
Believe it or not , having played Wii Sports bowling , this is totally something we can imagine .
But you can take one of two positions here : 1 ) dude or his friend were n't using the wrist strap , as is recommended before every game starts , and the controller flew out of his hands and smashed the set ; dude(s ) cut the strap and put it on display for internet pity points ( and possibly a new TV courtesy of an anxious Nintendo ) .
Or 2 ) somehow the Wiimote strap -- which , for the record , we think feels sturdy enough -- does break mid-game and this guy really is out a 60 - inch TV thanks to Nintendo 's fabric engineering team .
But we know one thing for sure , that 's a helluva crack and something tells us it wo n't be the last .
[ Thanks ,
Sando ]
We spoke with Jon Leonard , the guy whose TV is now cracked worse than a Mad mag knockoff .
He insisted to us there was zero foul play going on here and that he's not out to get Nintendo to replace his TV , nor is he ready to pursue legal options .
Just that his pal got carried away bowling and the strap broke under somewhat normal circumstances .
( We asked if they were spinning it around or anything of the like and he said no , it was all normal , non-abusive use . )
Nintendo has n't contacted him yet -- we assume they 're just about now shuffling into the office up there in Washington -- but we 'll keep you posted .
By 1999 , Excite had merged with broadband services company @ Home for $ US6.7 billion , netting Kraus and his co-founders a paper fortune worth tens of millions each .
But dreams of a lifetime of luxury pads and Learjets were not to be .
Unable to convert internet traffic into revenue , Excite went bankrupt in late 2001 in the depths of the dotcom crash .
These days , Kraus is still in Silicon Valley , near San Francisco , and he is back in business .
And his latest internet startup , JotSpot ( www.jot.com), has just been bought by the very company that succeeded where Excite failed - Google .
JotSpot is a web - based software company that provides collaborative web 2.0 tools such as wikis - a term made famous by the publicly editable online encyclopedia Wikipedia - to small and medium - sized businesses .
Like YouTube.com , bought by Google for $ US1.6 billion last month , Jotspot is an example of the new breed of successful startup : a company that has benefited from the falling cost of technology and the increasing sense of entrepreneurial spirit in Silicon Valley .
For Kraus , launching Jotspot was a case of going back to basics .
Whereas Excite once employed 3000 people ; JotSpot 's headcount before it was bought was in double figures .
Excite took $ US3 million to get from idea to launch ; JotSpot took $ US100,000 .
But perhaps the biggest difference is this : these days there are proven business models that simply were n't there back in 1999 .
" Eight or nine years ago when the internet was really starting to get going , it was the Wild West , " says Geoff Yang , a respected venture capitalist who invested in Excite .
" There were no proven business models , they were n't proven entrepreneurs . "
Not so now .
All over Silicon Valley , it seems , those entrepreneurs who survived the first dotcom boom and bust are dipping their toes back into the water and for many the hope is that a giant like Google or Yahoo will be waiting to snap them up .
" It 's being fuelled by what may be an irrational belief that the appetite of Yahoo , Google and Microsoft is so strong that it will buy almost anything , " says Kraus , speaking before the Google deal was signed .
There are also fewer barriers to entry .
Hardware is cheaper , there is more open - source software , and - in an odd coincidence for the former owner of Excite - you no longer have to spend a fortune on advertising your website because you can market yourself cheaply via search engines such as Google .
And that , as Kraus is always quick to say , is why Google succeeded where Excite failed .
It brought its product , search - based advertising , to large numbers of small companies , not small numbers of big ones .
Where Excite had tied up deals with large cable companies after its doomed @ Home merger , Google went after the millions of small companies prepared to pay for search - based advertising and came up with the cost - per - click advertising model that has made billions .
It 's just 10 kilometres along the Bay freeway from where Jotspot has made its home to the famous Googleplex , so Kraus could be forgiven a note of nostalgia as he sold his company to the giant that Excite might have become .
In 1997 , staff at Excite enjoyed health check - ups and a weekly barbecue and had their internal mail delivered by bicycle .
If you want those kinds of perks now , you go to work for Google .
" They embody every piece of the dotcom lifestyle from a company perspective , " Kraus says .
" Tons of free food , free massages , every service you can imagine from oil changes to dry- cleaning . "
" It is a little bit of a time warp there , " says Excite co-founder Ryan McIntyre , who works these days at Mobius Venture Capital .
" [ Google ] still very much feels like a ' 99 type office , with the crazy colours and people riding around on bikes - but you know what ?
Google has the money to be that way , so God bless 'em for having that continue . "
After all , search engines , he says , are " still the lifeblood of the online economy " .
" It 's unfortunate that Excite met its demise the way it did .
But we were early , and a little before people figured out what the right business model was . "
Yet another reason why it 's cheaper to start a company these days , Kraus has noted , is easier access to global labour markets .
That 's exactly what another serial entrepreneur , Rakesh Mathur , is attempting to make the most of as he starts up yet another Silicon Valley company .
Back in 1996 , Mathur founded Junglee , a software company that made " virtual database " technology , offering access on one web page to information scattered across many resources .
As at Excite , the company lived the dotcom dream and even had its own " jungle " theme room in an attempt to keep employees creative and motivated .
In 1998 , it was sold to Amazon for $ US200 million and Mathur soon moved on to other start - ups .
Asked how much value Amazon derived from the deal , Mathur says that 30 per cent of Amazon 's revenues now come from non-Amazon sources and that many Junglee employees still work at Amazon .
He left , he says , because he prefers working with new businesses .
Today Mathur is concentrating on Webaroo , which allows users to carry a " representative sample of the internet " on their hard drives for offline research .
They are betting that computers ' memory capacity will increase at a faster rate than the spread of wireless connectivity .
Another entrepreneur who looks back 10 years with fondness is Dave Samuel , founder of Spinner.com , an online radio station launched as thedj.com in April 1996 - at almost the same time Excite went to market .
When we catch up with him , he 's sitting at the very same ping - pong table that he once used as a meeting table at Spinner.com .
Samuel remembers the " excitement and buzz " of being nominated Cool Site of the Day , then a well - known internet gong , just four days after Spinner was launched .
Samuel admits he was fortunate with Spinner , which he launched with the help of Josh Felser .
The company was sold to AOL for $ US320 million in 1999 , before ever turning a profit .
As it was to be years before anybody made money out of web radio , it seems likely that Spinner would have been in the dotcom graveyard come 2001 .
" We were very lucky with the way it worked out , " Samuel says .
" We could have taken Spinner public and I am extremely happy that we did not , because 90 per cent of the companies who went public in 1999 - 2000 barely exist or do n't exist any more . "
Samuel , too , is back in business .
In August he sold Grouper , a YouTube - style site for sharing video content , to media giant Sony for $ US65 million .
Samuel admits his life has more balance these days .
" Spinner was my sole focus - my top nine out of 10 priorities were all Spinner - related .
Here I have a wife , two kids , two companies and other responsibilities . "
But for every entrepreneur who got lucky with the internet and has gone back into the market , there are others who had their fingers burned .
For wine expert Peter Granoff , that meant his next venture would still be in San Francisco but outside the technology sphere .
In 1995 , Granoff , one of America 's best - known sommeliers , set up online wine retailer Virtual Vineyards with his brother - in - law , Robert Olson .
The company seemed to have everything going for it : knowledge about the wine industry , early mover status in the e-commerce field and technology at the heart of the business .
Despite legal impediments to shipping wine across state lines , things started off well .
The company raised about $ US30 million of venture capital between 1995 and 1999 , during which time the net " started to explode into the mainstream consciousness " , as Granoff puts it , and the company re-branded as Wine.com .
But in 1999 the pair lost control of the operation as $ US100 million came pouring in from various venture capital firms .
Wine.com was one of many companies that spent vast amounts on marketing its patch of dotcom turf - the perceived wisdom among venture capitalist investors at the time .
" It had an air of unreality to it , " Granoff says .
" My brother - in - law and I would have these conversations where we would kind of look at each other and say ' this is goofy ' .
On some level your gut just says , ' This is unreal , this ca n't go on . '
" And some time before the meltdown started in 2000 , it went through this transition .
It seemed to have ceased to have anything to do with healthy businesses for the long haul and was all about , ' How much money can I bail out here with ? ' "
The disastrous move , Granoff says , was when Wine.com merged with debt - laden rival Wineshopper.com in August 2000 .
" My biggest frustration , " he says , " was if we had been allowed to grow at a little saner pace it could have been a very healthy business .
It might not have been a venture - capital - scale healthy business but it certainly would have justified itself and then turned a profit . "
These days , Granoff has returned to his roots in wine retailing but in a bricks - and - mortar business , the Ferry Plaza Wine Merchant & Wine Bar ( www.fpwm.com), where he says he still gets dotcommers among his customers .
" San Francisco was very , very hard hit on meltdown , " he says .
" The economy [ in the city ] seems to have come back and solidified : it 's not crazy like it was , it just seems to be reasonably healthy .
And there are certainly dotcom businesses that are actually doing well , and they 're part of the fabric of the Bay Area economy - they do n't stick out [ the way they used to ] . "
But even Granoff can't ignore the internet for long .
" We 're getting ready to launch the e-commerce part of this business , " he says .
" We 've taken our time and we 're determined to integrate it as closely as we can with the experience the customer has when they 're in our shop . "
Some dotcom pioneers have followed different paths and left Silicon Valley altogether .
Neil Peretz , who co-founded mobile email company PocketScience ( www.pocketscience.com) in 1995 , is researching online cross - border disputes at the respected Catholic University in Leuven , Belgium , while training to be a lawyer .
But Peretz does not look wistfully at Google - he looks at BlackBerry .
" When I started the company , we 'd go meet [ executives ] and they 'd say : ' Mobile email ?
Why would I want that ?
I 'll just have my secretary fax it to me . '
They 're all tied to their BlackBerry these days . "
PocketScience failed to grasp the concept of wireless email that has made BlackBerry so successful .
Its email devices still require its users to dial into an analog US phone number in order to send and receive email messages .
PocketScience was ultimately bought by an Australian spin - off company that Peretz helped set up .
But he says the biggest lesson he learned from the bubble was the importance of strong personal relationships and having people in business you can trust .
He retains a certain cynicism about the new boom .
" This dotcom second wave is a lot like the first one dusted off again .
Is it a podcast or is it just that we put your MP3 files on your website ?
Is it a blog or are you just making a web page with Geocities ?
Even the social networking websites , MySpace and Friendster go back in time to ' 97 , '98 and PlanetAll and Six Degrees . "
Like Junglee , PocketScience used themed rooms to try to inspire creativity in its employees .
In 1998 , employees would wear togas in a Roman room , perhaps designed for dotcom empire - building ; or as if to prove that the dotcom bubble really was the Wild West , there was a room designed around the OK Corral .
When I ask Peretz if he has a toga in his wardrobe these days , his answer is " probably " .
" San Francisco tends to wear off on people and pervades their wardrobe - so I 'll have to find some festive gatherings to break out all the stuff that I 've picked up from having lived in San Francisco .
It does n't really come up as much in Belgium for some reason . "
Bill Lessard shot to internet fame with his book NetSlaves , about the reality of living in the dotcom boom .
Now a New York PR consultant , he remembers that for most people the bursting bubble hit hard .
" These start - ups were almost like psychological experiments , as if somebody was sitting behind a glass wall , someplace , saying : ' I wonder what would happen if we kept people here 18 hours a day and made them never see their family and friends ? '
It was totally crazy .
But this is what happens when you tell a lot of people that they can all be billionaires .
" There was no division , in people 's minds at least , between the CEO and the rank and file .
Even if you were the guy who was plugging in the servers , you still thought of yourself as an entrepreneur .
We were all entrepreneurs .
But then the realisation for me , and for others who became disgruntled technology workers , was that that was really not the case .
" In the final analysis it was the founders of the companies and the investors who were the ones who were making the money .
Your stock options were just the carrot - they were worthless at the end of the day . "
After going freelance to write his book , Lessard turned to building websites to pay his way .
Suddenly , there was no work at all .
" It was so bad that I wound up working in catering , for the better part of a year , working with a bunch of 20 - year - olds who are just there to make enough money to pay the cell phone bill . "
But for all the down times , Lessard still takes pride in his role in the dotcom boom .
" We were a generation that had been completely written off by the boomers : ' They 're just a bunch of slackers , they 're never going to amount to anything . '
And what did we do ?
We built the internet in five years . "
And that 's something that the NetSlaves and the CEOs have in common .
Asked what the high point of building Excite was , Kraus is adamant that it was the uses for the technology that gave him ultimate satisfaction .
" It 's the international plane trip where your seat mate tells you a story of how Excite found them the information on a loved one 's illness , " he says .
" You were affecting people 's lives on a broad scale . "
Seriously , the top of digg , delicious , reddit , and every other link aggregator seems to be clogged with Lists of Vital Things You Should Know .
After seeing dozens of them fly by every single day , I ’m starting to think it ’s just lazy headline writing that gets promoted up thanks to our nanosecond attention - span RSS readin ’ latte drinkin’ ruby on rails codin ’ getting things done task managin’ nerd culture .
Cool it with the lists .
Feel free to use real paragraphs and explain stuff .
I have time .
Technology Demonstrator
Version 2.1 of the Web is now available , featuring significant improvements over the older 2.0 version .
The most significant upgrade is that there is now support for the server - side blink tag .
That 's right , instead of relying on the frustrating < blink > tag - which is non-standard and not compatible with all web browsers - blinking text can now be achieved in a fully standards - compliant manner .
The server - side blink tag works by using a timed AJAX request , to let a Web 2.1 compatible server update the client document so that the blinking text is turned invisible .
This request also triggers another timed AJAX request , which allows the server to restore the blinking text after the requested delay .
As well as being standards - compliant , this approach also allows the web page to benefit from all the back - end maintenance advantages of server - side processing .
A live server can be easily upgraded to implement more sophisticated blinking capability , and any client sessions will immediately benefit from the improved functionality .
Encourage all your web developers to adopt Web 2.1 coding as soon as possible .
Note : if you did not see the blinking text above , it means that your browser is not compliant with the Web 2.1 standards .
An easy way of checking whether your browser is standards compliant is to check whether the installation files for your browser were smaller than 50MB , or the run-time memory usage is less than 300 MB .
If this is the case , you should download a more recent browser to get the full Web 2.1 experience .
Another note : there are some known bugs in Web 2.1 .
For example , a heavily - loaded web server may not be able to respond to blink requests efficiently , which will slow down the perceived blink rate .
One work - around to this would be to use a high - capacity blink server farm .
Hopefully Web 2.2 will address this sort of issue , by layering AJAX on BEEP over SCTP .
Further information about the commercial aspects of Web 2.1 can be found at this informative web - site .
( View source to see how it all works . )
( ps. many thanks to Wired 's Michael Calore for the Web 2.1 logo ! )
( Yay !
It 's good to see that there is now a Web 2.1 version of the < marquee > tag ! )
Sept. 22 , 2006  -- Comedy Central 's vulgar , profane , hilarious animated hit " South Park " begins its 10th season on Oct. 4 in an uncertain place .
In the past year , the show and its creators , Trey Parker and Matt Stone , won their first Emmy and were also honored with a Peabody for best electronic media .
But the year was also fraught with moments of censorship that caused the show 's creators to wonder if the world had changed so much in the last 10 years that " South Park " could really no longer thrive .
" What we 've stood behind for 10 years is :
It 's got to all be OK or none of it is , " Parker told ABC 's " Nightline . "
" Because as soon as you start picking , ' Well , OK , we wo n't do this , ' then all of a sudden the ones you did about that should n't be OK either .
So we were starting to say , ' I do n't know that this is a world that ' South Park ' can live in . ' "
" South Park " has been vilified as crude , disgusting and nihilistic , and the eagerness of Stone and Parker to impale every sacred cow they can reach is a major reason for its success .
After all , in the fictional town of South Park , Colo . -- home to third - graders Kenny , Kyle , Stan and the evil Cartman -- everything is fair game .
Even the Prophet Mohammed , who appeared as a superhero in a July 2001 episode called " The Super Best Friends . "
" People told us at the time , ' You ca n't really draw an image of Mohammed , ' " Parker says .
" And we were like , well , we can .
We 're not Muslim , so it's OK . "
In 2006 , however , when Stone and Parker wanted to depict Mohammed in an episode , Comedy Central would n't let them .
After all , Muslims worldwide had rioted over insulting depictions of Mohammed in a newspaper in Denmark .
It seemed odd to the creators of " South Park , " who had been and were still allowed to depict Jesus in any number of profane ways .
In fact , the episode in question , " Cartoon Wars , " shows a cartoon ( supposedly created by al Qaeda ) in which Jesus defecates on President Bush .
Open Season on Jesus
" That 's where we kind of agree with some of the people who 've criticized our show , " Stone says .
" Because it really is open season on Jesus .
We can do whatever we want to Jesus , and we have .
We 've had him say bad words .
We 've had him shoot a gun .
We 've had him kill people .
We can do whatever we want .
But Mohammed , we could n't just show a simple image . "
During the part of the show where Mohammed was to be depicted -- benignly , Stone and Parker say -- the show ran a black screen that read : " Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network . "
Other networks took a similar course , refusing to air images of Mohammed -- even when reporting on the Denmark cartoon riots -- claiming they were refraining because they 're religiously tolerant , the South Park creators say .
" No you 're not , " Stone retorts .
" You 're afraid of getting blown up .
That 's what you 're afraid of .
Comedy Central copped to that , you know : ' We 're afraid of getting blown up . ' "
" At the same time , just like we always do , we managed to get something on and say something about how we can't say something about Mohammed , " Parker says .
" South Park , " from its very beginning has been about mocking that which is held most sacred .
It began as a short film , " The Spirit of Christmas , " made as a video cartoon for an entertainment executive to send to friends that featured Santa Claus and Jesus fighting .
Its creators have stayed true to the spirit of " Spirit , " taking on Tom Cruise ( implying that the twice - married father is gay ) , as well as Cruise 's religion ( Stan declares that " Scientology is just a big fat global scam " ) .
But when the episode " Trapped in the Closet " ( Cruise hides in the closet and refuses to come out ) was scheduled to be rebroadcast , Comedy Central pulled the plug .
" We were told that the people involved with ' Mission : Impossible : III ' demanded that show be pulled off the air , " Stone says .
" And it was . "
Media behemoth Viacom , which owns Comedy Central , also owns Paramount Studios .
At the time Paramount wanted Cruise to promote M:I:III .
After weeks of negative publicity , Comedy Central agreed to broadcast the show .
' I Thought This Might Be It '
In addition to the Cruise and Mohammed shows , Comedy Central hesitated before agreeing to rebroadcast an episode featuring some unseemly bleeding by a statue of the Virgin Mary that upset many Catholics .
" Going into the last run was the most sort of scared I 've ever been , " Parker says .
" I went into the run just going , ' Wow , how many times are they going to tell us we can't do something before we bail ? '
Because we 're ready to bail .
We 're ready . …
We wanted to say some things , shake things up a bit .
And I think we 've done that , and I think we 've done it in a bigger way than we ever will in the future .
So it'd be nice to make some more shows and some more movies , but it'd also be really nice to go to a farm and raise some goats and have some kids .
You know what I mean ?
I mean , that would be really nice , too .
" As soon as we can't make the show we want to make , we 're not going to make it anymore .
At the beginning of the last run I thought we were really close .
I thought it was like this might be it .
But then , you know , we were able to still do a Mohammed show and do it the way we wanted , which was to do it and then say , ' All right , Comedy Central , you 're a network , you have a right to do with this what you want , so we 're making it this way .
And then if you want to take out the image of Mohammed , that 's fine , you can do that , but we 're also going to make the show about you taking out the image of Mohammed . ' "
But the normally über - candid Stone and Parker hold their tongues a tad when explaining what happened behind the scenes that convinced Comedy Central to re-broadcast the episode .
" We 've done exactly what we need to do to get out what we wanted to get out and not get sued , " Parker says .
" And unfortunately , that makes us have to stop short at explaining exactly what happened .
The forces of the deal made it so that depending on what we say , they can turn it around and finally turn it all into a lawsuit . "
" Now we sound like crazy Scientologists , " Stone says .
As for Cruise , Parker acknowledges that " he 's got total reason to be offended . "
That is n't the issue , Stone says .
" The thing is , he 's sued people for implying that he 's gay before .
Which is funny .
You know , I mean , people have implied we 're gay , and we have n't sued anybody .
I do n't give a s--- if somebody says I 'm gay .
That 's the difference .
That 's superfunny . "
" We do n't wish Tom Cruise any ill will , " Parker says .
" He 's just kind of a freak , you know ?
He 's like Michael Jackson . "
" How can you not make fun of him ? "
Stone asks .
South Park and Atheists ?
In addition to garnering the show tons of media attention , the episode caused a disturbance within the " South Park " family .
Musician and actor Isaac Hayes , who played the character Chef and is a Scientologist , quit .
" We knew that that was a possibility and we were sad that he decided to quit , " Parker says .
" We held off on doing a Scientology show for years because of Isaac 's personal religious belief .
And after a while , we were like , you know , we 've made fun of everything else .
There 's just too much funny stuff there .
We have to do it .
And if he quits , that 's his right , and then he did so . "
Stone , who was raised Jewish , says he 's not religious .
Parker says he considers himself religious , but it would take him a long time to explain it .
Both say they believe in God .
" I believe there 's something going on that we do n't know , " Parker says .
" That 's as far as I can go . "
" Recently , atheists and people who hate religion have , like , really glommed on to our show because we make fun of a lot of religions , " Stone notes .
" But neither one of us is anti-religious at all .
I mean , I 'm fascinated by religion . "
" All the religions are superfunny to me , " Parker adds .
" The story of Jesus makes no sense to me .
God sent his only son .
Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die ?
It 's just bad writing , really .
And it 's really terrible in about the second act . "
But Parker says atheism is more ludicrous to him than anything else .
" Out of all the ridiculous religion stories -- which are greatly , wonderfully ridiculous -- the silliest one I 've ever heard is , ' Yeah , there 's this big , giant universe and it's expanding and it's all going to collapse on itself and we 're all just here , just ' cuz .
Just ' cuz .
That to me , is the most ridiculous explanation ever , " he says .
" So I think we have a big atheism show coming . "
The two offer mock - apologies to anyone offended by their show .
" Part of living in the world today is you 're going to have to be offended , " Stone says .
" The right to be offended and the right to offend is why we have a First Amendment .
If no speech was offensive to anybody , then you would n't need to guarantee it . "
Parker says " South Park " mocks that which is dearest to him all the time -- though few people know it .
" A lot of people do n't realize this , but probably the one person that gets made fun of in " South Park " more than anybody is my dad , " he says .
" Stan 's father , Randy -- my dad 's name is Randy -- that 's my drawing of my dad ; that 's me doing my dad 's voice .
That is just my dad .
Even Stan 's last name , Marsh , was my dad 's stepfather 's name .
So my dad grew up Randy Marsh .
And he is , by far , the biggest dingbat in the entire show .
And we 've had him , you know , with his pants down , drunk , throwing up , you know .
And my dad was a great dad .
He 's a great dad .
And my dad is constantly like : ' Why did you do that to me ? '
And I 'm like , ' Dad , I 'm just having fun . '
I hold my father very dear .
But it does n't mean I 'm not going to rip on him . "
South Park Conservatives
Atheists are n't the only ones to have " glommed on " to the show and claimed it as one of their own .
Conservatives have as well , starting with commentator / blogger Andrew Sullivan , who first coined the term " South Park Conservatives " to describe an independent , somewhat libertarian mind - set .
Libertarian New York Times columnist John Tierney recently wrote that he had " bad news for the GOP regarding that promising new bloc of voters , the " South Park Republicans . "
It turns out they 're not Republicans , at least not anymore . "
" We would love to think that we could control a group of people and take over the country in a new political party , " Stone says .
But they have their doubts .
And in truth , they say they 're not necessarily all that conservative , it 's just that they enjoying poking fun at liberal orthodoxies and celebrities , and it's far more rebellious to lean right in Hollywood than to lean left .
" We 're probably more conservative than most Hollywood liberals , but that does n't mean a whole lot , " Stone says .
" At the end of the day , we know our job is to entertain and make people laugh , " says Parker .
" We never get to a writers ' meeting and sit down and go , ' What statement can we make about this ? '
That never happens .
We always start with the show .
What is Stan feeling ?
What 's his emotion ?
What can he go through with the kid ?
And a lot of times , it will come to me Tuesday , the day before the show airs , and we 're getting done with the show .
And we 're like , ' Oh , we 've kind of said that . ' "
So who did they vote for ?
John Kerry or George W. Bush ?
Parker says anyone interested can look at their show that ran just before the 2004 election called " Douche and Turd . "
In it the South Park Elementary School students are forced to choose between a Giant Douche and a Turd Sandwich as a new school mascot .
The character Stan protests , saying he does n't find either option attractive , and is decried by the school , his parents and P. Diddy for not voting .
" When people ask how did you vote , it 's like : ' Watch that episode .
You 'll know exactly who we voted for , ' " Parker says .
One of the reasons " South Park " can stay more topical than other satiric animated shows like " The Simpsons " or " Family Guy " is because Parker , Stone and their team turn the show around in a week .
Thursday morning they begin sketching out the show , and it airs the following Wednesday night .
" Thursday morning , we show up with a big cup of coffee and go , what should next week 's show be about ? "
Parker says .
" And then it 's basically a race .
It 's six days and we 're working about 90 - 95 hours .
And we 're talking about a 90 - hour production process . "
It 's grueling -- and not at all like the pizza - and - bong - fueled image of the creative process fans envision , they say -- but it allows the creative team to respond to what is going on in the news that moment , as in their Emmy Award - winning episode " Best Friends Forever . "
In that episode , the character Kenny goes into a persistent vegetative state , arousing all sorts of right - to - die issues , like those that were being debated at that moment in the United States because of the Terri Schiavo controversy .
Despite the attention for the hot - button episodes about Cruise , Mohammed or Terri Schiavo , Stone and Parker say their favorite episodes deal with the kids of South Park acting like kids .
" When the show first came out , there were a lot of people calling it ' Peanuts on Acid , ' " Parker says .
" I was a big Charlie Brown fan as a kid . "
" And I was a big acid fan , " says Stone .
The beginnings of the show focused mainly on " this is how kids talk , " Parker says .
" This is what four little boys do when left alone .
These are the things they say .
Here 's how kids really are . "
" They 're selfish , " Stone says .
" They 're little bastards .
And society makes them better .
It 's not ' Society corrupts them . ' "
" See , " Parker says , " that 's probably the most conservative viewpoint we have . "
Ready for $ 262 a barrel oil ?
Two of the world 's most successful investors say oil will be in short supply in the coming months .
DAVOS , Switzerland ( FORTUNE ) -
Be afraid .
Be very afraid .
That 's the message from two of the world 's most successful investors on the topic of high oil prices .
One of them , Hermitage Capital 's Bill Browder , has outlined six scenarios that could take oil up to a downright terrifying $ 262 a barrel .
The other , billionaire investor George Soros , would n't make any specific predictions about prices .
But as a legendary commodities player , it 's worth paying heed to the words of the man who once took on the Bank of England -- and won .
" I 'm very worried about the supply - demand balance , which is very tight , " Soros says .
" U.S. power and influence has declined precipitously because of Iraq and the war on terror and that creates an incentive for anyone who wants to make trouble to go ahead and make it . "
As an example , Soros pointed to the regime in Iran , which is heading towards a confrontation with the West over its nuclear power program and does n't show any signs of compromising .
" Iran is on a collision course and I have a difficulty seeing how such a collision can be avoided , " he says .
Another emboldened troublemaker is Russian president Vladimir Putin , Soros said , citing Putin 's recent decision to briefly shut the supply of natural gas to Ukraine .
The only bit of optimism Soros could offer was that the next 12 months would be most dangerous in terms of any price shocks , because beginning in 2007 he predicts new oil supplies will come online .
Hermitage 's Bill Browder does n't yet have the stature of George Soros .
But his $ 4 billion Moscow - based Hermitage fund rose 81.5 percent last year and is up a whopping 1780 percent since its inception a decade ago .
A veteran of Salomon Bros. and Boston Consulting Group , the 41 - year old Browder has been especially successful because of his contrarian take ; for example , he continued to invest in Russia when others fled following the Kremlin 's assault on Yukos .
Doomsdays 1 through 6
To come up with some likely scenarios in the event of an international crisis , his team performed what 's known as a regression analysis , extrapolating the numbers from past oil shocks and then using them to calculate what might happen when the supply from an oil - producing country was cut off in six different situations .
The fall of the House of Saud seems the most far - fetched of the six possibilities , and it's the one that generates that $ 262 a barrel .
More realistic -- and therefore more chilling -- would be the scenario where Iran declares an oil embargo a la OPEC in 1973 , which Browder thinks could cause oil to double to $ 131 a barrel .
Other outcomes include an embargo by Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez ( $ 111 a barrel ) , civil war in Nigeria ( $ 98 a barrel ) , unrest and violence in Algeria ( $ 79 a barrel ) and major attacks on infrastructure by the insurgency in Iraq ( $ 88 a barrel ) .
Regressions analysis may be mathematical but it's an art , not a science .
And some of these scenarios are quite dubious , like Venezuela shutting the spigot .

Energy chiefs at the World Economic Forum in Davos downplayed the likelihood of a serious oil shortage .
In a statement Friday , Shell 's CEO Jeroen Van der Veer declared , " There is no reason for pessimism . "
OPEC Acting Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said " OPEC will step in at any time there is a shortage in the market . "
But then no one in the industry , including Van der Veer , foresaw an extended run of $ 65 oil -- or even $ 55 oil -- like we 've been having .
It 's clear that there is very , very little wiggle room , and that most consumers , including those in the United States , have acceded so far to the new reality of $ 60 or even $ 70 oil .
And as Soros points out , the White House has its hands full in Iraq and elsewhere .
Although there are long - term answers like ethanol , what 's needed is a crash conservation effort in the United States .
This does n't have to be command - and - control style .
Moral suasion counts for a lot , and if the president suggested staying home with family every other Sunday or otherwise cutting back on unnecessary drives , he could please the family values crowd while also changing the psychology of the oil market by showing that the U.S. government is serious about easing any potential bottlenecks .
Similarly , he could finally get the government to tighten fuel - efficiency standards and encourage both Detroit and drivers to end decades of steadily increasing gas consumption .
These kinds of steps would create a little headroom until new supplies do become available or threats like Iran 's current leadership or the Iraqi insurgency fade .
It 's been done it before .
For all the cracks about Jimmy Carter in a cardigan and his malaise speech , America did reduce its use of oil following the price shocks of the 1970s , and laid the groundwork for low energy prices in the 1980s and 1990s .
But it would require spending political capital , and offending traditional White House allies , and that 's something this president does n't seem to want to do .

It ’s been obvious for years that Donald Rumsfeld is in denial of reality , but the defense secretary now also seems stuck in a time warp .
You could practically hear the dominoes falling as he told the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday that it was dangerous for Americans to even talk about how to end the war in Iraq .
“ If we left Iraq prematurely , ” he said , “ the enemy would tell us to leave Afghanistan and then withdraw from the Middle East .
And if we left the Middle East , they ’d order us and all those who do n’t share their militant ideology to leave what they call the occupied Muslim lands from Spain to the Philippines . ”
And finally , he intoned , America will be forced “ to make a stand nearer home . ”
No one in charge of American foreign affairs has talked like that in decades .
After Vietnam , of course , the communist empire did not swarm all over Asia as predicted ; it tottered and collapsed .
And the new “ enemy ” that Mr. Rumsfeld is worried about is not a worldwide conspiracy but a collection of disparate political and religious groups , now united mainly by American action in Iraq .
Americans are frightened by the growing chaos in the Mideast , and the last thing they needed to hear this week was Mr. Rumsfeld laying blame for sectarian violence on a few Al Qaeda schemers .
What they want is some assurance that the administration has a firm grasp on reality and has sensible , achievable goals that could lead to an end to the American involvement in Iraq with as little long - term damage as possible .
Instead , Mr. Rumsfeld offered the same old exhortation to stay the course , without the slightest hint of what the course is , other than the rather obvious point that the Iraqis have to learn to run their own country .
The observations of the judicious Blackstone , in reference to the latter , are well worthy of recital : " To bereave a man of life , [ says he ] or by violence to confiscate his estate , without accusation or trial , would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism , as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation ; but confinement of the person , by secretly hurrying him to jail , where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten , is a less public , a less striking , and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government .
The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution .
By a limited Constitution , I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority ; such , for instance , as that it shall pass no bills of attainder , no ex post facto laws , and the like .
Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice , whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void .
Without this , all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing .
. . .
The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts .
A constitution is , in fact , and must be regarded by the judges , as a fundamental law .
It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning , as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body .
If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two , that which has the superior obligation and validity ought , of course , to be preferred ; or , in other words , the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute , the intention of the people to the intention of their agents .
. . . yet it is not to be inferred from this principle , that the representatives of the people , whenever a momentary inclination happens to lay hold of a majority of their constituents , incompatible with the provisions in the existing Constitution , would , on that account , be justifiable in a violation of those provisions ; or that the courts would be under a greater obligation to connive at infractions in this shape , than when they had proceeded wholly from the cabals of the representative body .
Until the people have , by some solemn and authoritative act , annulled or changed the established form , it is binding upon themselves collectively , as well as individually ; and no presumption , or even knowledge , of their sentiments , can warrant their representatives in a departure from it , prior to such an act .
I began writing a post in response to this truly ridiculous Op - Ed by John Yoo in this morning 's NYT -- in which Yoo gleefully celebrates every authoritarian transgression of the Bush administration , from torture and pre-emptive wars to endless invocations of presidential secrecy , the issuance of " hundreds of signing statements " declaring laws invalid , and even what Yoo calls the President 's assertion of his power to " that invade his executive authority " ( what we used to call " breaking the law " ) ( emphasis added in all instances ) .
But then I thought better of it , because , at this point , anyone who fails ( or refuses ) to recognize that the President does not have the power in our system of government to violate laws by invoking national security concerns is never going to recognize that .
Yoo 's Op - Ed is so flagrantly frivolous that it ought not be taken seriously .
He even goes so far as to claim that the " founders intended thatwould be checked by presidential action . "
How can you be on the faculty of a major law school and say this ?
It is indeed true that the President has the power to " check " legislation that he considers " wrongheaded or obsolete " -- by vetoing bills before they 're enacted into law , not by violating them after they 're enacted into law .
The whole point of Hamilton 's Federalist No. 73 is to explain the purpose of the veto power , and specifically that " the case for which it is chiefly designed " is " that of an immediate attack upon the constitutional rights of the executive . "
That is how the President in our system of government defends against Congressional encroachments on his power and imposes " checks " on " wrongheaded or obsolete legislation " -- by vetoing such bills ( an action which is then subject to being overridden ) , not by secretly violating laws at will .
Why is it even necessary to point out that the U.S. President does not have the power to violate laws which he thinks are " wrongheaded or obsolete , " or that Presidents have no authority to disregard " wrongheaded or obsolete judicial decisions " ( whatever that might mean ) ?
And what permits a " law professor " to claim otherwise on the Op - Ed page of the NYT ?
Under this administration , there is no notion too radical or authoritarian to be off limits not only from being subject to debate , but from being implemented .
Just look at the things we 're debating -- whether the U.S. Government can abduct and indefinitely imprison U.S. citizens without charges ; whether we can use torture to interrogate people ; whether our Government can eavesdrop on our private conversations without warrants ; whether we can create secret prisons and keep people there out of sight and beyond the reach of any law or oversight ; and whether the President can simply disregard long - standing constitutional limitations and duly enacted Congressional laws because he has deemed that doing so is necessary to " protect " us .
These have n't been open questions for decades if not centuries .
They 've been settled as intrinsic values that define our country .
Yet nothing is settled or resolved any longer .
Everything -- even the most extremist and authoritarian policies and things which were long considered taboo -- are now openly entertained , justifiable and routinely justified .
Rather than dissect
Yoo 's lawlessness - venerating Op - Ed , I instead want to quote a " lefty blogger " who makes some critically important points even though he is ( admittedly ) rather shrill and imprudent with his language and often sounds a bit like a partisan hysteric ( he uses regrettably shrill words like " tyranny " and " despotism " ) .
But on two issues in particular -- ( a ) secret prisons and detentions , along with punishment without trials , and ( b ) claims ( such as those by Yoo and the White House ) that courts are acting improperly by " interfering " in the President 's national security programs -- he really does articulate some important points .
Here is the first post
Here is the second one
This lefty blogger fails to take seriously the existential threat posed by Islamofascist - Nazi Terrorists , because he resists the notion that the Constitution changes as a result of that threat .
Instead , he claims that the Constitution can only be changed by the amendment process set forth within that document , not by whimsical reactions to contemporary events .
Apparently , he has n't heard the brilliant insight that the Constitution is not a " suicide pact " -- which means we can disregard it any time doing so makes us safe -- or that , as the President said , Judge Taylor 's decision ruling the NSA program unconstitutional happened because she " simply do[es ] not understand the nature of the world in which we live " :
The vision of John Yoo and the Bush administration is exactly what this country was founded in order to avoid .
The powers
Yoo insists the President possesses are exactly those which were identified by the Founders as the hallmarks of tyrants and despots .
Of course , if Hamilton said anything like he said in the above - excerpted quotes as part of our current debates , he would be branded a shrill , unserious , soft - on - terrorism , partisan hysteric by the Washington Post Editorial Board and certain highly serious and very responsible magazines
If only Alexander Hamilton and the other Founders had understood the grave , existential , unprecedented threat posed by Islamicfascist Nazi jihadists , they would have understood all of this and would have enthusiastically embraced all the things they waged war to prevent and which they impetuously and shrilly called " notorious acts of despotism . "
But there is no need to change the Constitution they created and for which they advocated .
It can just be decreed to be different by the President whenever national security demands it .
Just ask John Yoo or Richard Posner or any Bush followers .
That 's what they 'll tell you .* * * * * * At 2:20 pm EST today , I will be on the Ian Masters Show on KPFK 90.7 FM public radio in Los Angeles -- along with Marty Lederman -- to discuss the FISA and military commission issues .

And more shrill , partisan lefty bloggers -- here and here -- respond to John
Yoo by claiming that we ought to maintain the rule of law and Constitutional limits on government even though Islamofascist Nazis want to stage more terrorist attacks .
The project was set to save more than £ 60 m for the DWP by 2008
The IT project , key to streamlining payments by the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) , was quietly axed at an internal meeting last month .
The project had been central to delivering savings of more than £ 60 m for the DWP by 2008 .
It is the latest in a long series of computer problems for the government .
DWP pays out around £ 100bn a year in benefits through a variety of computer systems .
' Refocused '
It decided three years ago to combine them into one new system - known as the Benefits Processing Repayment Programme .
But the ambitious project ran into trouble , leading in February this year with a " review " of its progress - effectively a suspension .
It is pretty disgraceful that after 2.5 years of spending public money on this project , the government has walked away from it
Phillip Hammond
Shadow work and pensions secretary
The BBC has learned that the department 's investment committee of senior civil servants decided about two weeks ago to cancel the programme - which had by then absorbed more than £ 140m .
The civil servant in charge of the project is believed to have left the department .
A DWP spokesman said the department acted of its own accord to close the programme after realising the scale of the problems .
It has now " refocused " on developing a new system for a single benefit , the planned employment support allowance .
' No - one sacked '
Phillip Hammond , the Conservatives ' shadow work and pensions secretary , told BBC News 24 : " It is pretty disgraceful that after two and half years of spending public money on this project , the government has walked away from it .
" We never hear of somebody actually losing their job because they have failed to implement a project they were responsible for . "
Mr Hammond said if this had happened in the private sector , that person " would be heading for the door " .
There is growing concern about web censorship
The free program has been constructed to let citizens of countries with restricted web access retrieve and display web pages from anywhere .
The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab software , called psiphon , will be released on 1 December .
Net censorship is a growing issue , and several countries have come under fire for blocking online access .
Governments have militarized their censorship efforts to an incredible extent
Ronald Deibert
' Net enemies ' named
Human rights organisation Reporters Without Borders recently released a list of 13 countries it believed were suppressing freedom of expression on the net , including Syria , China and Vietnam .
But the Citizen Lab , which is based at the Munk Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto , believes its program will allow surfers to bypass web censorship .
Psiphon works through social networks .
A net user in an uncensored country can download the program to their computer , which transforms it into an access point .
They can then give contacts in censored countries a unique web address , login and password , which enables the restricted users to freely browse the web through an encrypted connection to the proxy server .
' E- avesdropping '
The Citizen Lab said the system provides strong protection against " electronic eavesdropping " because censors or ISPs can only see that end users are connected to another computer and not view the sites that are being visited .
It added that using small trusted networks as a delivery mechanism made it more difficult for censors to find and shut down psiphon .
However , it also warned potential users that bypassing censorship could violate laws , and urge them to consider potential consequences of doing so .
Ronald Deibert , director of the Citizen Lab , told the New York Times : " Governments have militarized their censorship efforts to an incredible extent so we 're trying to reverse some of that and restore that promise that the internet once had for unfettered access and communication . "
Beta testing of the system began over the summer , and the free program will be launched on 1 December .
Ten years ago , scientists from NASA said they had found small rod-like structures in the meteorite that were believed to be fossil bacteria .
But most experts now believe there is no evidence of life in the 1.9 kilogram rock , ALH 84001 .
The rods and other " biosignatures " could all have been produced by inorganic processes , scientists say .
The new meteorite , called Nakhla , fell to Earth on June 28 , 1911 , exploding into dozens of fragments over Egypt .
Nakhla was one of the first meteorites confirmed to have come from Mars by its chemical composition .
The meteorite is estimated to be 1.3 billion years old and shows signs of being altered by the water once thought to have flowed on Mars .
It spent some 11 million years drifting through space before entering Earth 's atmosphere .
Scientists are now quietly taking seriously the possibility that Nakhla contains signs of Martian life , according to a US biology professor writing in New Scientist magazine .
A team led by Martin Fisk at Oregon State University found tiny tubular holes similar to those in volcanic Earth rocks believed to be caused by bacteria or ancient organisms called archaeans .
Averaging one to three micrometres in diameter and up to 100 micrometres long , the tunnels often contain biomolecules such as nucleic acids .
Peter Ward , from the University of Washington in Seattle , wrote : " When Fisk 's team examined volcanic minerals inside Nakhla , to their surprise they found small tunnels virtually identical in size and shape to those in Earth rocks . "
John McKay , from the Johnson Space Centre in Houston , Texas , later found carbon - rich matter in the rock 's tunnels .
Analysis suggested that it was carbon originating on Mars — an intriguing finding since all known life is based on carbon .
" Those involved have been careful not to get carried away by this new evidence , " Dr Ward said .
Professor Fisk and his colleagues have stopped short of claiming the tunnels are proof of life on Mars .
Instead they say the features might be a " useful biosignature " given the abundance of volcanic rock in the solar system .

Not too long ago , Amazon released their Simple Storage Service ( or " S3 " for short ) .
It provides a hosted storage platform which developers can build all sorts of applications on top of .
Smugmug , a popular photo sharing web site , is using it to store and host pictures .
I 've been considering using S3 as the backend to an on - line backup , since I 'd been beating that for a while ( see : Swimming Pools and Hard Disks and Cheap On - Line Storage Coming Soon ) .
In a few days I 'll write about how to do this -- I 'm only partially through the process right now .
But right now I want to lay out the motivation for doing this .
The Cost of A Home Server
Amazon 's pricing model is pretty compelling .
The current rate is that I 'd pay $ 0.15 / GB monthly for the data I store .
Data transfer costs $ 0.20 / GB .
My home server is a 2.4GHz Pentium 4 that contains 3 250 GB SATA disks in a RAID configuration , plus an 80 GB boot and OS disk .
I decided to measure its power use using my Kill A Watt and found that it consumes roughly 120 watts of power with the CPU idle and disks spinning .
That 's about 80 kilowatt hours every four weeks .
According to PG&E's Residential Rates , the average cost of electric power in San Jose is $ 0.16247 per kilowatt hour .
My home server costs me a minimum of $ 13 every four weeks just to leave powered on and idling , or $ 170 per year .
That does n't count the roughly $ 700 I sunk into the disks and the other $ 700 I likely spent on the motherboard , CPU , case , RAM , and so on .
Remember , these are absolute minimums , since the CPU does consume more power when it 's actually doing work .
So if we assume that I spent $ 1,400 on the server and would keep it for 5 years , that 's another $ 22 per month ( 4 weeks ) of costs .
If you 're keeping score , that 's $ 22 + $ 13 = $ 35 every four weeks just to have backups of my stuff ( most of which lives on servers in a few datacenters ) .
That puts the total cost for 5 years worth of backups around $ 2,275 assuming that no hardware breaks .
The Cost on S3
My backups require about 125 GB of disk space today without compression .
That 'd cost me $ 18.75 per month to store on Amazon 's S3 .
Let 's further assume that I increase that by 1GB / month for the next five years ( mostly photos ) and transfer about 2GB every week doing backups ( log files , mail , and other temporary stuff is much of that ) .
2GB every week is 8 GB every four weeks , which costs another $ 1.60 every four week " month " for a total of $ 20.80 per year or $ 104 over 5 years .
Assuming that growth rate has me up to 190 GB five years from now .
Let 's call it 200GB .
If I 'm growing at a constant rate , I can use the average of 200GB and 125GB , which is 162.5GB .
Multiply that by 13 " weeks " and 5 years yields $ 1,584 .
Adding it all up , if those guesses are right and we assume that Amazon 's prices do n't fall ( they certainly could in a few years ) , I 'd end up paying $ 1,688 .
In other words , switching to S3 could save me $ 587 over five years !
Other Benefits
It 's clear that going with S3 could save me money both from a reduced electric bill and not having to buy backup hardware ( server and disks ) .
But why else might I do this ?
Availability .
It 's less likely that Amazon 's service will go down when compared to my home server and residential grade broadband service .
Speed .
If a remote server dies , I 'd need to push all the bits there from my artificially slow DSL or Cable connection at home .
Using S3 means I can restore faster .
Simplicity .
This is one less Unix box I have to spend any time administering .
Even if it 's only 5 minutes every week or two , that all adds up .
Again , I 'll write up the process ( tools and stuff ) in a few days ( or weeks ) .
Update :
The economics are even better than I thought .
It turns out that I mis -read some du output last night .
I really only need half the space I thought I did .
That is , ~ 75GB today instead of 125GB .
Hmm ...

AMERICAN VERTIGO
Traveling America
in the Footsteps of
Tocqueville .
By Bernard - Henri Lévy .
Translated by
Charlotte Mendel .
308 pp. Random House . $ 24.95 .
Any American with a big urge to write a book explaining France to the French should read this book first , to get a sense of the hazards involved .
Bernard - Henri Lévy is a French writer with a spatter - paint prose style and the grandiosity of a college sophomore ; he rambled around this country at the behest of The Atlantic Monthly and now has worked up his notes into a sort of book .
It is the classic Freaks , Fatties , Fanatics & Faux Culture Excursion beloved of European journalists for the past 50 years , with stops at Las Vegas to visit a lap - dancing club and a brothel ; Beverly Hills ; Dealey Plaza in Dallas ; Bourbon Street in New Orleans ; Graceland ; a gun show in Fort Worth ; a " partner - swapping club " in San Francisco with a drag queen with mammoth silicone breasts ; the Iowa State Fair ( " a festival of American kitsch " ) ;
Sun City ( " gilded apartheid for the old " ) ; a stock car race ; the Mall of America ; Mount Rushmore ; a couple of evangelical megachurches ; the Mormons of Salt Lake ; some Amish ; the 2004 national political conventions ; Alcatraz -- you get the idea .
( For some reason he missed the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally , the adult video awards , the grave site of Warren G. Harding and the World 's Largest Ball of Twine . )
You meet Sharon Stone and John Kerry and a woman who once weighed 488 pounds and an obese couple carrying rifles , but there 's nobody here whom you recognize .
In more than 300 pages , nobody tells a joke .
Nobody does much work .
Nobody sits and eats and enjoys their food .
You 've lived all your life in America , never attended a megachurch or a brothel , do n't own guns , are non-Amish , and it dawns on you that this is a book about the French .
There 's no reason for it to exist in English , except as evidence that travel need not be broadening and one should be wary of books with Tocqueville in the title .
In New Orleans , a young woman takes off her clothes on a balcony as young men throw Mardi Gras beads up at her .
We learn that much of the city is below sea level .
At the stock car race , Lévy senses that the spectators " both dread and hope for an accident . "
We learn that Los Angeles has no center and is one of the most polluted cities in the country .
" Headed for Virginia , and for Norfolk , which is , if I 'm not mistaken , one of the oldest towns in a state that was one of the original 13 in the union , " Lévy writes .
Yes , indeed .
He likes Savannah and gets delirious about Seattle , especially the Space Needle , which represents for him " everything that America has always made me dream of : poetry and modernity , precariousness and technical challenge , lightness of form meshed with a Babel syndrome , city lights , the haunting quality of darkness , tall trees of steel . "
O.K. , fine .
The Eiffel Tower is quite the deal , too .
But every 10 pages or so , Lévy walks into a wall .
About Old Glory , for example .
Someone has told him about the rules for proper handling of the flag , and from these ( the flag must not be allowed to touch the ground , must be disposed of by burning ) he has invented an American flag fetish , a national obsession , a cult of flag worship .
Somebody forgot to tell him that to those of us not currently enrolled in the Boy Scouts , these rules are n't a big part of everyday life .
He blows a radiator writing about baseball -- " this sport that contributes to establishing people 's identities and that has truly become part of their civic and patriotic religion , which is baseball " -- and when , visiting Cooperstown ( " this new Nazareth " ) , he finds out that Commissioner Bud Selig once laid a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington , where Abner Doubleday is also buried , Lévy goes out of his mind .
An event important only to Selig and his immediate family becomes , to Lévy , an official proclamation " before the eyes of America and the world " of Abner as " the pope of the national religion . . . that day not just the town but the entire United States joined in a celebration that had the twofold merit of associating the national pastime with the traditional rural values that Fenimore Cooper 's town embodies and also with the patriotic grandeur that the name Doubleday bears . "
Uh , actually not .
Negatory on " pope " and " national " and " entire " and " most " and " embodies " and " Doubleday . "
I ’ll say one thing :
Not having a coherent scientific theory can lead to factionalization .
Strains appeared today among the Plutophants , as many among their number were dismayed by the latest IAU attempt to keep Pluto a planet .
The new transparently plutophantic scheme involved no less than four categories of planets :
1. Terrestrial
2. Gas Giant
3. Dwarf Non-Pluton ( a special class for Ceres , formerly an asteroid )
4. Dwarf Pluton ( for literally dozens of ice dwarfs )
Or something like that .
No one ’s really sure if you have to say “ dwarf pluton , ” or whether all plutons are automatically dwarfs , or whatever .
Appropriately , those of us following the Pluto issue have also spilt into four categories , the Pluto - haytas ( who will win ) and three groups of fractured plutophants .
For those of you following at home , here ’s a quick rundown :
1. The No Iceball Left Behind Group
The NILBies are the bunch who officially won today .
They produced the bizarre scheme above , following the philosophy that planet - ness is primarily all about roundness .
Asteroids , ice balls , whatever — if it ’s big enough for its own gravity to squish it into a sphere , but not so big it undergoes fusion ( becoming a sun ) , and it ’s not a moon , it ’s a planet .
Many Plutophants were happy at first , because this means that Pluto and UB313 are definitely planets .
But soon the scales fell from their eyes , and they realized that the NILBie victory spells doom to Pluto in the long run .
Why ?
Because it means scores of trans -Neptunian planets will appear almost instantly .
Like a sweaty Joe McCarthy , the IAU brandished a lit of 43 known plutons , and admitted they have a secret list of dozens more .
This is your solar system :
This is your solar system on NILBie :
Hmm .
Of course , not all Plutophants want the nonsensical scribbles above , which brings me to :
2. The Culture Vultures
The Vultures are a hardy band of simple folk who believe that the mnemonics of their childhood are in fact the laws of the universe .
Oh , sure , they make claims about “ planets ” being a “ cultural ” term , because , you know , science changes , but culture has always been the same .
The Vultures are sort of like those people who think that popular music was perfected while they were in high school , and wonder why all these new bands even exist .
So Pluto will never change in their lifetime , anymore than Supertramp can ever be replaced .
They ’re happy with the current mess , thinking that as the clearly insane NILBies inflate the term “ planet ” to meaninglessness , the rest of culture will fearfully retreat to the warm glowing warmth of the “ nine historical planets . ”
That ’s their new buzzword , “ Nine historical planets . ”
Because , like , history stops in 2006 ?
The Vultures seem to forget that our culture :
Once called the sun and moon “ planets ” ;
Once called whales “ fish ” ( see the King James and Moby Dick ) ;
Once used the word “ animal ” to refer solely to non-human animals .
In all of these cases , the scientific usage ultimately won .
Maybe people sometimes say , “ Delta does n’t allow animals onboard . ”
But asked to define animal , they ’ll admit to the scientific definition after a moment ’s thought .
And anyone who says that whales are fish , or the sun a planet , is pretty quickly shouted down .
If scientists start saying “ eight planets ” a lot , so will the rest of us .
We listen to scientists , at least when it comes to stuff like planets .
That ’s part of our , you know , culture .
More on that later .
Because here ’s our final Plutophantic faction :
3. The UB313 Guy
This is a faction of one : Mike Brown .
He ’s one of the guys who discovered UB313 , which will be made a planet under the new NILBie scheme .
But he realizes all too well that his discovery will be made much less interesting , given that 50 - something other planets will appear with the same stroke of the pen .
( He coined the “ No Iceball Left Behind ” slur . )
In the NY Times today , he freely admits that eight planets is the logical scientific number .
But then he rhapsodizes a bit about the Culture Vulture argument , with one slight change . . .
He thinks UB313 should be a planet , too .
I ’m biased , but I like to imagine this question through the eyes of the child I was in the 1970 ’s . . .
If I had heard back then about the discovery of something at the edge of the solar system , I would n’t have waited for a body of astronomers to tell me what it was .
I would have immediately cut out a little disk of white paper and taped it to the poster of planets on my bedroom wall .
That night , I would have looked up , straining to see the latest addition to our solar system , hoping that I , too , might someday find a new planet .
I hope the union . . . simply declares 2003 UB313 our 10th , full - fledged planet .
Doing so might convince schoolchildren to put new paper disks on their walls , to look up to the sky and realize that exploration does continue , and that they can be part of it , too .
Well , except they can ’t , Mike , because it ’s pretty much all iceballs from here on out . *
But at least your iceball would n’t be left behind .
Which brings us to . . .
4. The Pluto - Haytas
So while the Plutophants are crumbling into disarray , what does head Pluto - hayta Neil deGrasse Tyson have to say ?
“ A Plutophile is well served by this definition , ”  he said .
“ It is one of the few that allow you to utter Pluto and Jupiter in the same breath . ”
Diss !
Dissing aside , though , here ’s my new plan :
Let ’s get rid of Pluto by whatever means necessary .
It ’s a friggin ’ iceball , okay ?
Let ’s keep saying “ eight classic planets ” until everyone drops the “ classic . ”
But before we define the word “ planet ” for all times and all places , why not wait until we have observed ten or so other solar systems in their entirety ?
Out there in the rest of the galaxy , there may be all kinds of crazy stuff :
Multiple accretion disks !
Ice - worlds big enough to impress even me !
Objects that are n’t round , but are still totally planets !
Captured rogue gas giants with wacky orbits !
We just do n’t know yet .
And we do n’t want to wind up like the ancients who thought the sun was a planet , until they figured out that we went around it .
And we do n’t want to wind up with a bunch of lame iceballs lumped in with the cool stuff , just because of the pathetic Plutophants .
This ai n’t about your bedroom walls , kiddies , it ’s about the universe .
So let ’s get some more of the universe under our belts before making final judgements .
So Pluto ’s not a planet .
It ’s an iceball .
Deal .
Engineers at Lehigh and Carnegie Mellon universities , working with a Philadelphia - based start - up , have integrated robotics , laser and wireless technologies into a new system that promises to make it safer and cheaper for wheelchair users to drive a car .
The Automatic Transport and Retrieval System ( ATRS ) , scheduled to go on sale next spring , allows wheelchair users to get in and out of their vehicles , stow and retrieve their chairs , and drive while sitting in standard automobile seats .
The new system is the product of a collaboration between the two universities ; Freedom Sciences LLC , a robotics company located at the Philadelphia Navy Yard ; and Freedom Lift Corp. of Green Lane , Pa. Freedom Sciences has signed a licensing agreement on the ATRS with Lehigh .
John Spletzer , assistant professor of computer science and engineering , says the ATRS has achieved a breakthrough by enabling wheelchair users to drive while sitting in standard automobile seats that meet federal safety regulations .
Current solutions for wheelchair users who desire independent mobility require operators to sit in their chairs while driving .
Because they are often poorly secured and not crash - test - approved , wheelchairs provide far less protection than standard seats .
According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , 35 percent of all automobile fatalities related to wheelchairs result from inadequately secured chairs .
The ATRS is also modular , says Spletzer , and can be installed without making permanent – and expensive – changes to the vehicle .
Drivers trading in their cars merely remove the ATRS from the old vehicle and install it in the new one .
By contrast , wheelchairs users who now wish to drive must convert their vehicles , which requires lowering or replacing the floor of their van or minivan ; rerouting fuel lines , heating and air - conditioning systems ; and relocating the fuel tank .
" These changes severely restrict the resale value of the vehicle , " says Spletzer .
" With the ATRS , however , you can buy or lease a vehicle , usually a van , and install the ATRS without making permanent changes to the vehicle .
If you decide to buy another vehicle , you simply remove the ATRS , sell or return your van , and install the ATRS in your new vehicle .
" This gives you a lot more freedom and personal choice . "
The ATRS will cost $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 , versus the $ 30,000 and up that wheelchair users now pay to convert vehicles .
The figures do not include the cost of the wheelchair or vehicle .
Spletzer and Tom Panzarella , CEO of Cook Technologies , parent company of Freedom Lift Corp. , say the ATRS should be a boon to the six million people who , according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation , have difficulty finding transportation .
" This is a major contributor to the unemployment rate of the disabled population nationally , which is estimated at over 65 percent by the U.S. Census Bureau , " Spletzer and Panzarella wrote in a report .
How it works
The ATRS contains three key components : an articulated power seat that extends outside the vehicle to facilitate wheelchair - to - seat transfers , a power lift platform , and a " smart " wheelchair system .
The ATRS works in the following manner :
You move your powered wheelchair next to the driver 's side of your vehicle .
Using a remote - control device similar to a key fob , you open the vehicle door and direct the vehicle to lower the driver 's seat alongside your wheelchair .
You then slide over from your wheelchair into the driver 's seat .
Once in the driver 's seat , you deploy the power lift platform from the rear of the vehicle through the touch of a button .
Using a joystick for remote control , you then guide your empty wheelchair to the rear of the van .
There , the chair is switched to autonomous mode , and drives itself onto the lift platform using position feedback from an integrated laser system at a rate of 10 times per second .
The lift platform then raises and stows the chair in the back of the van .
At this point , you press another button to raise the driver 's seat , in which you are sitting , up into the van .
The driver 's seat is then restored to its normal driving position and secured .
When you arrive at your destination , you reverse the entire procedure .
Spletzer , who directs Lehigh 's Vision , Autonomous Devices , and Experimental Robotics ( VADER ) Laboratory , says the ATRS represents a cutting - edge application of mobile robotics .
" There have been many advances in mobile robotics in recent years , " says Spletzer , who has worked two years with Freedom Sciences on the ATRS .
" But most of these outdoor applications are in mining and other environments where people are excluded by design .
The ATRS , on the other hand , is designed to assist humans and to be used with their direction .
We believe it has the potential to become one of the most widespread outdoor applications of commercial robotics to date . "
The ATRS contains several other features that add value while enhancing reliability and safety , says Spletzer .
--
The laser system on the rear lift platform takes corrective action if an obstruction or slick spot causes the wheelchair to veer off course as it moves toward the platform .
" The laser system is constantly monitoring itself , " says Spletzer .
" If it is not 99.9 percent sure that the docking will be successful , it will back the chair up and perform corrective action . "
-- A camera above the platform lift , working in tandem with a human - robot user - interface computer on the ATRS dashboard , lets the driver know when to use the joystick to close the rear hatch of the ATRS - equipped vehicle .
--
Once the chair has been stowed , two hooks on the rear platform grip a plow bar on the chair and lock it in place .
" In the event of a vehicle accident or collision , the locking mechanism prevents the chair from becoming a dangerous projectile inside the vehicle , " says Spletzer .
--
To help drivers move from wheelchair to car seat , the ATRS Freedom Seat is fully articulated .
Its adjustable height allows drivers to always move down when they slide from wheelchair to car seat or vice versa .
--
The system 's modularity enables the ATRS to accommodate almost all sizes and models of wheelchairs and to offer easy upgrades for wheelchair users who have progressive diseases .
Next year , says Spletzer , Freedom Sciences is planning to develop an advanced ATRS for wheelchair users who have difficulty sliding themselves from the chair to the car seat .
The new system will be fully automated , using a small " smart " camera instead of a joystick .
The modifications required to make a wheelchair ATRS - compatible are invisible , says Spletzer , as the computing , gyroscope and encoders that are added to the chair are transparent to the user .
" In normal day to day use , " he says , " it is no different from a standard power chair . "
The ATRS is going to market at an opportune time , say Spletzer and Panzarella .
The expected increase in the population of Americans aged 65 and over will no doubt cause a corresponding rise in the number of wheelchair users , they say .
" We 've already received a number of e-mails from people who say the ATRS will really help them in their daily lives , " says Spletzer .
Spletzer developed the algorithms , or sets of rules , for autonomous navigation of the ATRS .
These were first validated in simulation using MATLAB , a technical computing language , before being ported to the actual hardware .

Mathematical proof ends wobbly table woes .
Do you always get the wobbly table at restaurants and cafés ?
Do n't despair .
A physicist has proved that , within reasonable limits , it is always possible to rotate the table to a position where all four legs stand solidly on the ground .
Wobbly tables can always be fixed - if they have four legs .
© Punchstock
André Martin was moved to study the problem because he was fed up with the wobbly tables at CERN , the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva , Switzerland , where he works on abstruse problems in high - energy physics .
Anyone who drinks a cup of coffee on the terrace of the CERN cafeteria , says Martin , discovers that the tables usually have only three feet resting on the ground , so that the slightest touch spills your drink .
Time after time , Martin would find himself rotating the table to look for a stable position .
" I 've always been able to find one , " he says .
" People are sometimes amazed that it works . "
More than ten years ago , Martin decided to see if he could find some proof that a stable state always exists .
He believed that he'd found one , and even presented it at a summer school in 1998 , but he never wrote it up and discovered that in any case it was n't completely correct .
“ People are sometimes amazed that it works . ”
André Martin
CERN , Geneva .
Now Martin believes he has a more watertight case , and this time he has gone public1 .
" I had the feeling that mathematicians were interested , " he explains .
Square solution
To turn the problem into one that could be described mathematically , he had to make some simplifying assumptions .
For one thing , he considered only tables with legs at the corners of a square .
And he assumed that each leg touches the ground only at a single point .
The ground itself , meanwhile , is more amenable than it often is in nature .
It has any number of bumps , but no really sharp curves or changes in height : the inclination between any two points on the surface is never more than 15° .
ADVERTISEMENT
" Compared with nature , it is smooth , " Martin admits .
But he adds that a poorly levelled concrete surface or a bumpy lawn would probably meet these conditions .
So long as that is so , Martin has demonstrated that there will always be a way of making all four of the table 's legs touch the ground .
In general , that wo n't leave the tabletop perfectly horizontal , but any slope will be small .
David Dallman , a CERN librarian , asked Martin whether his proof could be extended to tables with non-square arrangements of four legs .
Martin suspects this can be done if all four feet lie on a circle , but he does n't yet have a rigorous proof .
Whether it will help during the coffee breaks at CERN is another matter : the ground there might be too irregular .
" The trouble with the terrace is that there is both grass and paving slabs , " Martin says .

For someone left for dead 12 years ago , Candice Ivey seems to be doing pretty well .
She 's still got her homecoming queen looks and A - student smarts .
She has earned a college degree and holds a job as a recreational therapist in a retirement community .
She has , however , lost her ballerina grace and now walks a bit like her feet are asleep .
She slurs her words a little , too , which sometimes leads to trouble .
" One time I got pulled over , " she says in her North Carolina twang .
" The cop looked at me and said , ' What have you been drinking ? '
I said , ' Nothing . '
He said , ' Get out here and walk the line . '
I was staggering all over the place .
He said , ' All right , blow into this . '
Of course I blew a zero , and he had to let me go . "
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
In November 1994 , when Ivey was 17 , a log truck T - boned her Chevy Blazer .
She remembers nothing of the next two months .
But it 's all seared into the memory of her mother , Elaine , especially the part where the doctors told her that Candice , who was in a coma and breathing by respirator , should be pronounced dead .
Her brain , they said , was entirely and irreversibly destroyed by a week of swelling and bleeding and being pushed up against the inside of her skull like a ship scuttled on a reef .
A few days later , however , Candice proved the doctors wrong .
Unhooked from the respirator , she continued to breathe on her own – something she could n't have done if she were truly brain - dead .
Now Elaine faced the horrible decision of whether or not to feed her child .
The doctors warned her that Candice would probably never wake up , and if she did , she almost certainly would be unable to live independently .
In the worst case , she would enter the permanent twilight known as a persistent vegetative state , in which she might sleep and wake and move her limbs , yawn and sneeze and utter sounds , but not in a way that was purposeful .
Elaine decided to keep the feeding tube in place , which , she recalls , made the neurosurgeon furious .
" He thought I was just prolonging her agony and that I would have a vegetable on my hands , " she says .
" But when it 's your child lying there , you 'll do anything . "
In this case , anything included letting an orthopedic surgeon named Edwin Cooper try an experimental treatment .
He approached Elaine out of the blue soon after the accident and urged her to let him put an electrified cuff on Candice 's wrist .
It sent a 20 - milliampere charge – enough to make her hand clench and her arm tremble a little – into her median nerve , a major pathway to the brain .
It might rouse her from her coma , he said .
" I thought it was hokey , if you want to know the truth , " Elaine says .
She agreed nonetheless – she was , she says , " drunk as a coot " from a combination of " nerve pills and a full glass of whisky " – and the cuff went on .
Within a week , Elaine was sure that Candice was stirring .
Her doctors doubted it .
" They kept telling me it was just reflexes , but a momma knows . "
Then , just before New Year 's Day , a month after the accident , Cooper asked Candice how many little pigs there were .
She held up three fingers .
Now 29 , Candice
Ivey is thrilled to see the 64 - year - old Cooper when he shows up at her door .
She gives him a big , warm hug and sits close to him on the couch .
They chat about the presentation on traumatic brain injury that she recently gave to nurses at Cooper 's hospital , and how hearing the story of her ordeal again brought him to tears .
As she tells me of her injury and its aftermath , she comes back time and again to her gratitude .
" The wreck was my fault , " she says .
" But getting better , that was God 's doing .
He sent Dr. Cooper to my momma , did n't he ? "
Edwin Cooper has been sent , or has sent himself , to about 60 severely brain - injured people since the mid-1980s , when he first made the accidental discovery that electrical stimulation had effects on arousal .
He was using a neuro - stimulator to relieve spasticity in the limbs of microcephalics , people with abnormally small skulls who often have reduced mental capacity and poor muscle control .
During the treatment , he recalls , one patient started looking around his room and smiling when people walked in , instead of staring blankly .
Cooper had already observed that when he placed the stimulator on one arm of a quadriplegic patient to strengthen the muscles there , the opposite arm also got stronger .
He concluded that the electricity was making its way to the brain , crossing to the opposite hemisphere , and stimulating arousal centers in the process .
He began to wonder about the effect this might have on unconscious people .
" I thought , if someone were normal and able - bodied but in a coma , maybe this would make a difference , maybe help wake them up , " Cooper says .
" It was like maybe we could reboot the brain . "
Cooper started testing this hypothesis in 1993 .
Candice
Ivey was one of his first research subjects , and her recovery remains the most spectacular .
But Cooper has gathered data on 37 other patients in two studies ( at the University of Virginia and East Carolina University ) .
The results indicate that people given electrical stimulation emerge from comas sooner and then regain function more quickly than if they are given only traditional treatment .
They 're more likely to leave the hospital under their own steam , with less - severe disabilities than would be predicted by the nature and extent of their injuries .
Still , Cooper knows that 38 patients is a tiny sample , especially in a field where so little is understood and in which unexplained spontaneous awakenings , even after long periods of unconsciousness , are not uncommon .
But despite being published in the peer - reviewed journals Brain Injury and Neuropsychological Rehabilitation , his work has yet to attract the attention of mainstream researchers .
So , in the meantime , he hustles for every patient .
He heard about Candice while at a friend 's wake , waiting to view the body .
Another mourner mentioned that there was a girl in a coma at ECU 's Pitt County Memorial Hospital .
" I got right out of that line and went to find her , " he says .
He adds that he has Google news trackers set up for " brain stem injury " and " teenage coma . "
But the patients and doctors he contacts rarely respond , and Cooper and his stimulator remain on the margins of medicine , frustrated .
" It 's so easy .
Why do n't people just use it ? "
Cooper 's best hope may lie overseas in Japan , where over the last two decades doctors have used electrical stimulation on hundreds of patients – some of whom have been unconscious for many years .
The evidence that the Japanese doctors have amassed could confirm Cooper 's claims and bring hope to the families of patients most American doctors consider beyond cure .
But it may also undermine the hard - won yet fragile consensus on what , neurologically speaking , makes someone alive and when it is acceptable to pull the plug .
Cooper may be without honor in his own home , but mention his name at the Fujita Health University Hospital , just outside the industrial city of Nagoya , Japan , and surgeons light up with recognition .
He 's been there a few times , collaborated with them on a book chapter , and told them about Candice Ivey and his other patients .
They 're glad to have a fellow traveler in the US , but they 're quick to point out – politely , of course – that they 've been doing this work longer than Cooper and have treated many more patients .
The Japanese also use a more spectacular method :
They implant the electrodes right into the spine .
That 's what Isao Morita is doing today .
Trained at the Cleveland Clinic , he 's a neurosurgeon who wears his hair in a brush cut and speaks passable English .
The patient , Katsutomo Miura , lies facedown on the table .
He 's anesthetized , even though he was already unconscious when he was passed through the doors separating the sterile surgical wing from the rest of the hospital .
He 's been unconscious for nearly eight years .
He was 23 when an ambulance crew found him bleeding and unresponsive on the road near his home in Osaka , next to his wrecked motorbike and his helmet .
His legs were shattered , and one of them is now permanently bent at the knee , like he was frozen in place as he was about to run away .
It sticks up from the table , making a little pup tent of the blue surgical drapes .
" Yoroshiku onegai shimasu " ( " Thank you in advance for your cooperation " ) , Morita says , and waits for the five - person surgical team to respond in kind before he slices into Miura 's neck .
It takes 20 minutes of cutting and cauterizing , of spreading muscle and clearing away blood and gristle , for Morita to burrow down to Miura 's spine .
" C - 5 , " he announces to me , a little triumphantly , as he points into the cavity he has created .
Peering over his shoulder , I can see the vertebra that was his target .
It is pure white and glistening .
Morita takes a pneumatic drill and tunnels along the spine , toward Miura 's head , explaining that , so far , this is exactly how a disc surgery would go .
I resolve to take better care of my back .
Morita tries to thrust an inch - and - a - half - long , quarter - inch - wide flat metal bar into the tunnel , but it wo n't go .
He drills and pushes four more times until the electrode finally settles into place along the second and third cervical vertebrae .
He snakes a wire from there under Miura 's skin to a second incision he has made between the shoulder blades .
Meanwhile , another doctor has been working at Miura 's waist to create an internal pouch for the battery pack that will power the electrode on his spine .
Now she runs a wire up to the opening in his back , and Morita , using four tiny screws , splices it to the lead to complete the circuit .
Once the swelling goes down and they switch the implant on , it will send a train of electrical pulses through his spinal column and into his brain .
The hard part over , the surgeons begin to chat easily as they close up Miura , even laughing a little bit about the anesthesiologist , who has dozed off at his station .
I 've already seen this kind of operation .
It was part of the PowerPoint presentation I got the day before from Tetsuo Kanno , Morita 's mentor and the originator of the surgery .
Kanno discovered the virtues of the dorsal column implant accidentally , he says , when he was using it to stimulate muscles in stroke patients .
He shows me statistics on the 149 people he and his staff have treated .
He cites one study of patients who had been unconscious for an average of 19 months .
A vegetative state is considered permanent after one year , but 42 percent of Kanno 's patients showed significant improvement .
He explains that even a guy like Miura stands a chance .
If the electric current keeps flowing into his brain for long enough , maybe years , Miura is likely to make " some recovery . "
Which is either good news or bad news , depending on how you feel about Kanno 's definition of recovery .
Most of the implant recipients , he says , move up a notch in their level of consciousness , from a persistent vegetative state to a " minimally conscious state , " a condition in which people are able to muster small but unmistakable signs of awareness .
" Maybe the patient just smiles or follows with their eyes , " Kanno says .
Other Japanese doctors using deep brain stimulation – in which electrodes are implanted directly in brain tissue – have reported similar results : patients who improve to the point where they are severely disabled rather than entirely unresponsive .
But this is enough for Mariko Miura , who spent $ 30,000 on her son 's implant .
The day after the surgery , she declares through a translator that she senses her son is calm and comfortable .
" If he could just show what he feels , " she adds , " yes or no , maybe blinking once or twice , maybe holding hands , maybe a smile , that would be great . "
The doctors say this is exactly their goal , even though the patient 's MRI shows that the right hemisphere of his brain is almost entirely atrophied .
" There is no medical indication in this case , " Morita says .
" This surgery is socially indicated .
It is the family 's decision if they want to go on , and our job to do what they wish . "
These doctors know how strange this kind of reasoning sounds to American ears .
" US doctors say that it does n't mean anything .
But even if the patients can't talk , " Kanno says , " if they just look up when the family comes in the room , it makes the family very happy . "
Then again , he says , " you are very dry people in America , dry and cool .
Here we are very wet and warm .
You see just a body ; you say , OK , stop feeding it .
But we think a person in a vegetative state has a soul . "
No one is sure exactly why electrical stimulation works , but there is strong evidence that it has undefined but profound effects on the brain .
We know that electricity can rouse unconscious animals and that deep brain stimulation is widely used to treat Parkinson 's disease and dystonia , a disorder in which muscles twist and contract uncontrollably .
Kanno and his team have also recorded that patients receiving stimulation have higher levels of dopamine and norepinephrine , as well as increased blood flow in the brain – both conditions are associated with arousal .
This increased activity could well lead to nerve cells in the brain forming new connections more quickly , which a recent paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigation showed can lead to minimally conscious patients reawakening .
There are critics , of course .
Electrical stimulation as a treatment for vegetative state " is junk science , " according to the recently deceased Ronald Cranford , an expert in the clinical and ethical aspects of prolonged unconsciousness .
Joseph Giacino , a rehabilitation psychologist at New Jersey 's JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute who has led efforts to define the minimally conscious state , says that he thinks much of the " success " reported by Kanno occurred because his patients were minimally conscious , not vegetative , to begin with .
Giacino does agree , however , with Cooper and the doctors in Japan that there is enough evidence to warrant further investigation .
But the doctors who would like to conduct the necessary research are finding the scientific and political climate inhospitable to their work .
Among the obstacles they face is the consensus that emerged following the 1976 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that Karen Ann Quinlan , a 22 - year - old who had suffered severe brain damage , was beyond hope of regaining sentience and could be allowed to die of starvation .
According to bioethicist Joseph Fins , who directs the medical ethics division at Cornell 's Weill Medical College , this has led doctors to abandon severely brain - injured patients too quickly .
The result : statistics indicating that these patients do n't get better .
Families and doctors then give up , and researchers are discouraged from pursuing possible treatments – a vicious circle that Fins calls therapeutic nihilism .
He says this approach ought to be reconsidered .
" We 've spent a long time allowing people to die .
Maybe they deserve more intellectual , diagnostic , and therapeutic engagement than we have acknowledged . "
To Fins , that engagement could well include electrical stimulation .
He and a Weill colleague , neurosurgeon Nicholas Schiff , have laid out a framework for testing deep brain stimulation on the severely brain - injured , but they 're a long way from actually doing any treatment .
Fins knows , however , that they 're up against " proponents of the right to die who have been concerned about … the hard - won right to forgo life - sustaining therapy , " and that getting the research under way may be difficult as a result .
Things will get especially complicated if firm evidence shows , as Cooper believes it will , that electrical stimulation often pushes people out of a persistent vegetative state and into a minimally conscious state .
If it becomes clear that a PVS is not entirely hopeless and irreversible , then the diagnosis , which has functioned as a rationale for ending life support , will no longer provide moral clarity .
If that happens , Giacino says , " people are going to have to really think about what this all means before nonchalantly pulling the plug . "
Of course , it is hard to imagine that anyone makes that monumental decision nonchalantly .
But perhaps people do take as certain some things that might not be quite true – namely , that vegetative states cannot be treated .
This , of course , was the pivot on which the Terri Schiavo spectacle turned : People argued that her doctors were wrong about the hopelessness of her condition , that maybe that little smile meant starving her might be murder , rather than mercy .
As it happens , she would have been unlikely to respond to any form of electrical stimulation ; cases in which the brain has been deprived of oxygen , rather than injured by force , are the hardest to treat .
But accident victims fill emergency rooms , and it is hard to picture how much more tortuous our decisions will get if new truths about electrical stimulation displace old certainties about hopelessness .
Even with current guideposts , the complexities seem mind - bending .
Just ask Candice Ivey .
She has impaired short - term memory , a lack of stamina , and difficulty with impulse control that makes it tough to keep friends .
Because of that , her life – one of the best possible outcomes after so severe an injury – is still immeasurably harder than it was before her accident .
" God 's allowed me to do a lot of good things , " she says .
" But I remember what life used to be like and what I used to do mentally and physically , and I would n't want to do this again .
If this ever happens again , I want them to terminate me . "
Later , her mother draws deeply on her cigarette when I ask her about this .
" It goes through my head every day , " Elaine says .
" If I had let her die , she 'd at least be at peace .
And I keep thinking there has to be a reason for this – her life will turn around .
But when it does n't happen … I mean , it 's been 12 years now . "
Things are no simpler in Katsutomo Miura 's hospital room the day after his surgery .
He 's entirely still except for his lips , which are rooting ceaselessly like a hungry infant's .
His mother , who is bustling over him , leans into his face , squeezes his cheek , and talks to him .
I realize she is introducing me to him .
" My son and I , we are one person , " she told me earlier , and , as if to prove her point , she picks up his right hand and extends it for me to shake .
It is warm and wet .
Not for the first time in my three days at Fujita , I 'm reminded of another doctor who more famously applied electricity to a lifeless body to animate it .
Of course , Victor Frankenstein's wish to cheat mortality lies behind all medicine , but you do n't often see its monstrous implications displayed as clearly as in this poor man suspended by good intentions between two worlds .
" We produce these patients , " Kanno says .
" It is the dark side of neurosurgery . "
Unintended consequences , and the impossibility of unraveling them , are on my mind as I finish my visits with Japanese implant patients and their mothers .
No one seems to be much concerned about what this is like for the patients ( " We have no discussion with them , " Kanno says ) , and I 'm wondering why these women can't see that their children are gone forever , why they can't move on .
I want to say something like this to my translator as we get into the elevator , but there are tears in her eyes .
" They 're so well loved , " she says , and I can't help but think that I am not only on the other side of the world , but on the other side of our beliefs about what makes a life worth living , that I am grasping the moral chaos that will ensue if science proves these doctors right .
Elliotte Rusty Harold ’s RELAX
Wins may be a milestone in the life of XML .
Everybody who actually touches the technology has known the truth for years , and it ’s time to stop sweeping it under the rug .
W3C XML Schemas ( XSD ) suck .
They are hard to read , hard to write , hard to understand , have interoperability problems , and are unable to describe lots of things you want to do all the time in XML .
Schemas based on Relax NG , also known as ISO Standard 19757 , are easy to write , easy to read , are backed by a rigorous formalism for interoperability , and can describe immensely more different XML constructs .
To Elliotte ’s list of important XML applications that are RELAX - based , I ’d add the Atom Syndication Format and , pretty soon now , the Atom Publishing Protocol .
It ’s a pity ; when XSD came out people thought that since it came from the W3C , same as XML , it must be the way to go , and it got baked into a bunch of other technology before anyone really had a chance to think it over .
So now lots of people say “ Well , yeah , it sucks , but we ’re stuck with it . ”
Wrong !
The time has come to declare it a worthy but failed experiment , tear down the shaky towers with XSD in their foundation , and start using RELAX for all significant XML work .

Introduction
Page Rank is a topic much discussed by Search Engine Optimisation ( SEO ) experts .
At the heart of PageRank is a mathematical formula that seems scary to look at but is actually fairly simple to understand .
Despite this many people seem to get it wrong !
In particular “ Chris Ridings of www.searchenginesystems.net” has written a paper entitled “ PageRank Explained : Everything you ’ve always wanted to know about PageRank ” , pointed to by many people , that contains a fundamental mistake early on in the explanation !
Unfortunately this means some of the recommendations in the paper are not quite accurate .
By showing code to correctly calculate real PageRank I hope to achieve several things in this response :
Clearly explain how PageRank is calculated .
Go through every example in Chris ’ paper , and add some more of my own , showing the correct PageRank for each diagram .
By showing the code used to calculate each diagram I ’ve opened myself up to peer review – mostly in an effort to make sure the examples are correct , but also because the code can help explain the PageRank calculations .
Describe some principles and observations on website design based on these correctly calculated examples .
Any good web designer should take the time to fully understand how PageRank really works – if you do n’t then your site ’s layout could be seriously hurting your Google listings !
[ Note : I have nothing in particular against Chris .
If I find any other papers on the subject I ’ll try to comment evenly ]
How is PageRank Used ?
PageRank is one of the methods Google uses to determine a page ’s relevance or importance .
It is only one part of the story when it comes to the Google listing , but the other aspects are discussed elsewhere ( and are ever changing ) and PageRank is interesting enough to deserve a paper of its own .
PageRank is also displayed on the toolbar of your browser if you ’ve installed the Google toolbar ( http://toolbar.google.com/).
But the Toolbar PageRank only goes from 0 – 10 and seems to be something like a logarithmic scale :
Toolbar PageRank ( log base 10 ) Real PageRank 0 0 - 10 1 10 - 100 2 100 - 1,000 3 1,000 - 10,000 4 10,000 - 100,000 5 and so on …
We ca n’t know the exact details of the scale because , as we ’ll see later , the maximum PR of all pages on the web changes every month when Google does its re-indexing !
If we presume the scale is logarithmic ( although there is only anecdotal evidence for this at the time of writing ) then Google could simply give the highest actual PR page a toolbar PR of 10 and scale the rest appropriately .
Also the toolbar sometimes guesses !
The toolbar often shows me a Toolbar PR for pages I ’ve only just uploaded and cannot possibly be in the index yet !
What seems to be happening is that the toolbar looks at the URL of the page the browser is displaying and strips off everything down the last “ / ” ( i.e. it goes to the “ parent ” page in URL terms ) .
If Google has a Toolbar PR for that parent then it subtracts 1 and shows that as the Toolbar PR for this page .
If there ’s no PR for the parent it goes to the parent ’s parent ’s page , but subtracting 2 , and so on all the way up to the root of your site .
If it ca n’t find a Toolbar PR to display in this way , that is if it does n’t find a page with a real calculated PR , then the bar is greyed out .
Note that if the Toolbar is guessing in this way , the Actual PR of the page is 0 – though its PR will be calculated shortly after the Google spider first sees it .
PageRank says nothing about the content or size of a page , the language it ’s written in , or the text used in the anchor of a link !
Definitions
I ’ve started to use some technical terms and shorthand in this paper .
Now ’s as good a time as any to define all the terms I ’ll use :
PR : Shorthand for PageRank : the actual , real , page rank for each page as calculated by Google .
As we ’ll see later this can range from 0.15 to billions .
Toolbar PR : The PageRank displayed in the Google toolbar in your browser .
This ranges from 0 to 10 .
Backlink :
If page A links out to page B , then page B is said to have a “ backlink "  from page A
That ’s enough of that , let ’s get back to the meat …
So what is PageRank ?
In short PageRank is a “ vote ” , by all the other pages on the Web , about how important a page is .
A link to a page counts as a vote of support .
If there ’s no link there ’s no support ( but it ’s only an abstention from voting rather than a vote against the page ) .
Quoting from the original Google paper , PageRank is defined like this :
We assume page A has pages T1 … Tn which point to it ( i.e. , are citations ) .
The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1 .
We usually set d to 0.85 .
There are more details about d in the next section .
Also C( A ) is defined as the number of links going out of page A . The PageRank of a page A is given as follows : * PR ( A ) = ( 1 -d ) + d ( PR ( T1 ) / C( T1 ) + … + PR ( Tn ) /C( Tn ) ) *
Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages , so the sum of all web pages '
PageRanks will be one .* PageRank or PR ( A ) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm , and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web . *
but that ’s not too helpful so let ’s break it down into sections .
PR ( Tn ) —
Each page has a notion of its own self - importance .
That ’s “ PR ( T1 ) ” for the first page in the web all the way up to “ PR ( Tn ) ” for the last page C( Tn ) —
Each page spreads its vote out evenly amongst all of it ’s outgoing links .
The count , or number , of outgoing links for page 1 is “ C ( T1 ) ” , “ C( Tn ) ” for page n , and so on for all pages .
PR ( Tn ) / C( Tn ) — so if our page ( page A ) has a backlink from page “ n ” the share of the vote page A will get is “ PR ( Tn ) / C( Tn ) ” d(… —
All these fractions of votes are added together but , to stop the other pages having too much influence , this total vote is “ damped down "  by multiplying it by 0.85 ( the factor “ d "  ) ( 1 - d ) —
The ( 1 - d ) bit at the beginning is a bit of probability math magic so the “ sum of all web pages ’ PageRanks will be one " : it adds in the bit lost by the d(… .
It also means that if a page has no links to it ( no backlinks ) even then it will still get a small PR of 0.15 ( i.e. 1 - 0.85 ) .
( Aside : the Google paper says “ the sum of all pages ” but they mean the “ the normalised sum ” otherwise known as “ the average ” to you and me .
How is PageRank Calculated ?
This is where it gets tricky .
The PR of each page depends on the PR of the pages pointing to it .
But we wo n’t know what PR those pages have until the pages pointing to them have their PR calculated and so on …
And when you consider that page links can form circles it seems impossible to do this calculation !
But actually it ’s not that bad .
Remember this bit of the Google paper :
PageRank or PR ( A ) can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm , and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web . \
What that means to us is that we can just go ahead and calculate a page ’s PR without knowing the final value of the PR of the other pages .
That seems strange but , basically , each time we run the calculation we ’re getting a closer estimate of the final value .
So all we need to do is remember the each value we calculate and repeat the calculations lots of times until the numbers stop changing much .
Lets take the simplest example network : two pages , each pointing to the other :
Each page has one outgoing link ( the outgoing count is 1 , i.e. C( A ) = 1 and C( B ) = 1 ) .
Guess 1
we do n’t know what their PR should be to begin with , so let ’s take a guess at 1.0 and do some calculations :
d = 0.85 PR( A ) = ( 1 – d ) + d( PR ( B ) /1 ) PR ( B ) = ( 1 – d ) + d( PR ( A ) /1 )
i.e .
PR( A ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 1
= 1 PR( B ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 1
= 1
Hmm , the numbers are n’t changing at all !
So it looks like we started out with a lucky guess !!!
Guess 2
No , that ’s too easy , maybe I got it wrong ( and it would n’t be the first time ) .
Ok , let ’s start the guess at 0 instead and re-calculate :
PR( A ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0 = 0.15 PR ( B ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.15 = 0.2775
And again :
PR( A ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.2775 = 0.385875 PR
( B ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.385875 = 0.47799375
And again
PR( A ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.47799375 = 0.5562946875 PR
( B ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.5562946875 = 0.622850484375
and so on .
The numbers just keep going up .
But will the numbers stop increasing when they get to 1.0 ?
What if a calculation over - shoots and goes above 1.0 ?
Guess 3
Well let ’s see .
Let ’s start the guess at 40 each and do a few cycles :
First calculation
PR( A ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 40 = 34.15 PR ( B ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 34.15 = 29.1775
And again
PR( A ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 29.1775 = 24.950875 PR
( B ) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 24.950875 = 21.35824375
Yup , those numbers are heading down alright !
It sure looks the numbers will get to 1.0 and stop .
Here ’s the code used to calculate this example starting the guess at 0 : Show the code
Principle : it does n’t matter where you start your guess , once the PageRank calculations have settled down , the “ normalized probability distribution ” ( the average PageRank for all pages ) will be 1.0
Getting the answer quicker
How many times do we need to repeat the calculation for big networks ?
That ’s a difficult question ; for a network as large as the World Wide Web it can be many millions of iterations !
The “ damping factor ” is quite subtle .
If it ’s too high then it takes ages for the numbers to settle , if it ’s too low then you get repeated over - shoot , both above and below the average – the numbers just swing about the average like a pendulum and never settle down .
Also choosing the order of calculations can help .
The answer will always come out the same no matter which order you choose , but some orders will get you there quicker than others .
I ’m sure there ’s been several Master ’s Thesis on how to make this calculation as efficient as possible , but , in the examples below , I ’ve used very simple code for clarity and roughly 20 to 40 iterations were needed !
Example 1
You can see the calculations by running the program
Show the code
So the correct PR for the example is :
You can see it took about 20 iterations before the network began to settle on these values !
Look at Page D though – it has a PR of 0.15 even though no - one is voting for it ( i.e. it has no incoming links ) !
Is this right ?
The first part , or “ term ” to be technical , of the PR equation is doing this :
PR ( A ) = ( 1 -d ) + d ( PR ( T1 ) / C( T1 ) + … + PR ( Tn ) /C( Tn ) )
So , for Page D , no backlinks means the equation looks like this :
PR ( A ) = ( 1 - d ) + d * ( 0 )
= 0.15
no matter what else is going on or how many times you do it .
Observation : every page has at least a PR of 0.15 to share out .
But this may only be in theory – there are rumours that Google undergoes a post - spidering phase whereby any pages that have no incoming links at all are completely deleted from the index …
Example 2
A simple hierarchy with some outgoing links
( click the images , and others , for the calculations )
As you ’d expect , the home page has the most PR – after all , it has the most incoming links !
But what ’s happened to the average ?
It ’s only 0.378 !!!
That does n’t tie up with what I said earlier so something is wrong somewhere !
Well no , everything is fine .
But take a look at the “ external site "  pages – what ’s happening to their PageRank ?
They ’re not passing it on , they ’re not voting for anyone , they ’re wasting their PR like so much pregnant chad !!!
( NB , a more accurate description of this issue can be found in this thread )
Example 3
Let ’s link those external sites back into our home page just so we can see what happens to the average …
That ’s better – it does work after all !
And look at the PR of our home page !
All those incoming links sure make a difference – we ’ll talk more about that later .
Example 4
What happens to PR if we follow a suggestion about writing page reviews ?
Example 5
A simple hierarchy
Our home page has 2 and a half times as much PR as the child pages !
Excellent !
Observation : a hierarchy concentrates votes and PR into one page
Example 6
Looping
[ ] ]( /gpr/pr6.pl )
This is what we ’d expect .
All the pages have the same number of incoming links , all pages are of equal importance to each other , all pages get the same PR of 1.0 ( i.e. the “ average ” probability ) .
Example 7
Extensive Interlinking – or Fully Meshed
Yes , the results are the same as the Looping example above and for the same reasons .
Example 8
Hierarchical – but with a link in and one out .
We ’ll assume there ’s an external site that has lots of pages and links with the result that one of the pages has the average PR of 1.0 .
We ’ll also assume the webmaster really likes us – there ’s just one link from that page and it ’s pointing at our home page .
In example 5 the home page only had a PR of 1.92 but now it is 3.31 !
Excellent !
Not only has site A contributed 0.85 PR to us , but the raised PR in the “ About ” , “ Product ” and “ More "  pages has had a lovely “ feedback "  effect , pushing up the home page ’s PR even further !
Principle : a well structured site will amplify the effect of any contributed PR
Example 9
Looping – but with a link in and a link out
Well , the PR of our home page has gone up a little , but what ’s happened to the “ More ” page ?
The vote of the “ Product ” page has been split evenly between it and the external site .
We now value the external Site B equally with our “ More "  page .
The “ More "  page is getting only half the vote it had before – this is good for Site B but very bad for us !
Example 10
Fully meshed – but with one vote in and one vote out
That ’s much better .
The “ More "  page is still getting less share of the vote than in example 7 of course , but now the “ Product "  page has kept three quarters of its vote within our site – unlike example 10 where it was giving away fully half of it ’s vote to the external site !
Keeping just this small extra fraction of the vote within our site has had a very nice effect on the Home Page too – PR of 2.28 compared with just 1.66 in example 10 .
Observation : increasing the internal links in your site can minimise the damage to your PR when you give away votes by linking to external sites .
increasing the internal links in your site can minimise the damage to your PR when you give away votes by linking to external sites .
Principle :
If a particular page is highly important – use a hierarchical structure with the important page at the “ top "  .
Where a group of pages may contain outward links – increase the number of internal links to retain as much PR as possible .
Where a group of pages do not contain outward links – the number of internal links in the site has no effect on the site ’s average PR .
You might as well use a link structure that gives the user the best navigational experience .
Site Maps
Site maps are useful in at least two ways :
If a user types in a bad URL most websites return a really unhelpful “ 404 – page not found "  error page .
This can be discouraging .
Why not configure your server to return a page that shows an error has been made , but also gives the site map ?
This can help the user enormously
Linking to a site map on each page increases the number of internal links in the site , spreading the PR out and protecting you against your vote “ donations ”
Example 11
Lets try to fix our site to artificially concentrate the PR into the home page .
That looks good , most of the links seem to be pointing up to page A so we should get a nice PR .
Try to guess what the PR of A will be before you scroll down or run the code .
Oh dear , that did n’t work at all well – it ’s much worse than just an ordinary hierarchy !
What ’s going on is that pages C and D have such weak incoming links that they ’re no help to page A at all !
Principle : trying to abuse the PR calculation is harder than you think .
Example 12
A common web layout for long documentation is to split the document into many pages with a â€ œPreviousâ€  and â€ œNextâ€ link on each plus a link back to the home page .
The home page then only needs to point to the first page of the document .
In this simple example , where there ’s only one document , the first page of the document has a higher PR than the Home Page !
This is because page B is getting all the vote from page A , but page A is only getting fractions of pages B , C and D .
Principle : in order to give users of your site a good experience , you may have to take a hit against your PR .
There ’s nothing you can do about this – and neither should you try to nor worry about it !
If your site is a pleasure to use lots of other webmasters will link to it and you ’ll get back much more PR than you lost .
Can you also see the trend between this and the previous example ?
As you add more internal links to a site it gets closer to the Fully Meshed example where every page gets the average PR for the mesh .
Observation : as you add more internal links in your site , the PR will be spread out more evenly between the pages .
Example 13
Getting high PR the wrong way and the right way .
Just as an experiment , let ’s see if we can get 1,000 pages pointing to our home page , but only have one link leaving it …
Yup , those spam pages are pretty worthless but they sure add up !
Observation : it does n’t matter how many pages you have in your site , your average PR will always be 1.0 at best .
But a hierarchical layout can strongly concentrate votes , and therefore the PR , into the home page !
This is a technique used by some disreputable sites .
But I ca n’t advise this – if Google ’s robots decide you ’re doing this there ’s a good chance you ’ll be banned from Google !
Disaster !
On the other hand there are at least two right ways to do this :
1. Be a Mega-site
Mega-sites , like http://news.bbc.co.uk have tens or hundreds of editors writing new content – i.e. new pages – all day long !
Each one of those pages has rich , worthwile content of its own and a link back to its parent or the home page !
That ’s why the Home page Toolbar PR of these sites is 9/10 and the rest of us just get pushed lower and lower by comparison …
Principle : Content Is King !
There really is no substitute for lots of good content …
2. Give away something useful
www.phpbb.com has a Toolbar PR of 8/10 ( at the time of writing ) and it has no big money or marketing behind it !
How can this be ?
What the group has done is write a very useful bulletin board system that is becoming very popular on many websites .
And at the bottom of every page , in every installation , is this HTML code :
Powered by phpBB
The administrator of each installation can remove that link , but most do n’t because they want to return the favour …
Can you imagine all those millions of pages giving a fraction of a vote to phpBB ?
Wow !
Principle :
Make it worth other people ’s while to use your content or tools .
If your give - away is good enough other site admins will gladly give you a link back .
: Make it worth other people ’s while to use your content or tools .
If your give - away is good enough other site admins will gladly give you a link back .
Principle : it ’s probably better to get lots ( perhaps thousands ) of links from sites with small PR than to spend any time or money desperately trying to get just the one link from a high PR page ( just say “ No ! ” to anyone advertising “ Text links for sale ” ) .
A Discussion on Averages
From the Brin and Page paper , the average Actual PR of all pages in the index is 1.0 !
So if you add pages to a site you ’re building the total PR will go up by 1.0 for each page ( but only if you link the pages together so the equation can work ) , but the average will remain the same .
If you want to concentrate the PR into one , or a few , pages then hierarchical linking will do that .
If you want to average out the PR amongst the pages then “ fully meshing ” the site ( lots of evenly distributed links ) will do that – examples 5 , 6 , and 7 in my above .
( NB .
this is where Ridings ’ goes wrong , in his MiniRank model feedback loops will increase PR – indefinitely ! )
Getting inbound links to your site is the only way to increase your site ’s average PR .
How that PR is distributed amongst the pages on your site depends on the details of your internal linking and which of your pages are linked to .
If you give outbound links to other sites then your site ’s average PR will decrease ( you ’re not keeping your vote “ in house ” as it were ) .
Again the details of the decrease will depend on the details of the linking .
But again , do n’t worry about that too much ; if your site is worth something , you ’re likely to get a link back in return .
Given that the average of every page is 1.0 we can see that for every site that has an actual ranking in the millions ( and there are some ! ) there must be lots and lots of sites who ’s Actual PR is below 1.0 ( particularly because the absolute lowest Actual PR available is ( 1 – d ) ) .
It may be that the Toolbar PR 1,2 correspond to Actual PR ’s lower than 1.0 !
E.g. the logbase for the Toolbar may be 10 but the Actual PR sequence could start quite low : 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 , 100 , 1,000 etc …
Finally
PageRank is , in fact , very simple ( apart from one scary looking formula ) .
But when a simple calculation is applied hundreds ( or billions ) of times over the results can seem complicated .
PageRank is also only part of the story about what results get displayed high up in a Google listing .
For example there ’s some evidence to suggest that Google also pays attention to the text in a link ’s anchor when deciding the relevance of a target page – perhaps more so than the page ’s PR …
PageRank is still part of the listings story though , so it ’s worth your while as a good designer to make sure you understand it correctly .
History
Around 39.4 million people are thought to have HIV / AIDS
Andrew Stimpson , 25 , was diagnosed HIV - positive in 2002 but was found to be negative in October 2003 by Chelsea and Westminster Healthcare NHS Trust .
Mr Stimpson , from London , said he was " one of the luckiest people alive " .
The trust said the tests were accurate but had been unable to confirm Scotsman Mr Stimpson 's cure because he had declined to undergo further tests .
A statement from the trust said : " This is a rare and complex case .
When we became aware of Mr Stimpson 's HIV negative test results we offered him further tests to help us investigate and find an explanation for the different results .
I think I 'm one of the luckiest people alive
Andrew Stimpson
Bacteria modified to fight HIV
" So far Mr Stimpson has declined this offer . "
A trust spokeswoman added : " We urge him , for the sake of himself and the HIV community , to come in and get tested .
" If he does n't feel that he can come to Chelsea and Westminster then he should please go to another HIV specialist . "
' Miracle '
There have been anecdotal accounts before from Africa of people shaking off the HIV virus .
Mr Stimpson , who is originally from Largs in Ayrshire , said : " There are 34.9 million people with HIV globally and I am just one person who managed to control it , to survive from it and to get rid of it from my body .
" For me that is unbelievable - it is a miracle .
I think I 'm one of the luckiest people alive . "
Mr Stimpson told the News of the World and Mail on Sunday that he became depressed and suicidal after being told he was HIV - positive but remained well and did not require medication .
Further tests
Some 14 months later he was offered another test by doctors , which came back negative .
He sought compensation but has apparently been told there is no case to answer because there was no fault with the testing procedure .
He has told the papers he would do anything he could to help find a cure .
Deborah Jack , chief executive of the National Aids Trust , said : " This appears to be a highly unusual case and without further tests it is impossible to draw any conclusions for people living with HIV .
" The virus is extremely complex and there are many unknowns about how it operates and how people 's bodies react to it .
" Therefore , if this case were able to shed further light , it could be extremely valuable for research into treatments or a cure . "
Vaccine clue
Aids expert Dr Patrick Dixon , from international Aids group Acet , said the case was " very , very unusual " .
" I 've come across many anecdotal reports of this kind of thing happening in Africa , some quite recently , but it 's difficult to verify them , " he told BBC News 24 .
" You have to be rock - solid sure that both samples came from the same person , no mix - up in the laboratory , no mistakes in the testing , etc .
" This is the first well - documented case . "
He said the case was important because " inside his immune system is perhaps a key that could allow us to develop some kind of vaccine " .

The media claim that North Korea is trying to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction .
Yet the United States , which opposes this strategy , has used or threatened to use such weapons in northeast Asia since the 1940s , when it did drop atomic bombs on Japan .
The forgotten war — the Korean war of 1950 - 53 — might better be called the unknown war .
What was indelible about it was the extraordinary destructiveness of the United States ’ air campaigns against North Korea , from the widespread and continuous use of firebombing ( mainly with napalm ) , to threats to use nuclear and chemical weapons .
and the destruction of huge North Korean dams in the final stages of the war .
Yet this episode is mostly unknown even to historians , let alone to the average citizen , and it has never been mentioned during the past decade of media analysis of the North Korean nuclear problem .
Korea is also assumed to have been a limited war , but its prosecution bore a strong resemblance to the air war against Imperial Japan in the second world war , and was often directed by the same US military leaders .
The atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been examined from many different perspectives , yet the incendiary air attacks against Japanese and Korean cities have received much less attention .
The US post -Korean war air power and nuclear strategy in northeast Asia are even less well understood ; yet these have dramatically shaped North Korean choices and remain a key factor in its national security strategy .
Napalm was invented at the end of the second world war .
It became a major issue during the Vietnam war , brought to prominence by horrific photos of injured civilians .
Yet far more napalm was dropped on Korea and with much more devastating effect , since the Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) had many more populous cities and urban industrial installations than North Vietnam .
In 2003 I participated in a conference with US veterans of the Korean war .
During a discussion about napalm , a survivor who lost an eye in the Changjin ( in Japanese , Chosin ) Reservoir battle said it was indeed a nasty weapon — but “ it fell on the right people ” .
( Ah yes , the “ right people ” — a friendly - fire drop on a dozen US soldiers . )
He continued : “ Men all ( ... )
O'Reilly 's History of Programming Languages poster is fascinating reading .
If you trace programming languages back to their origins , you 'll find that we 've been at this programming stuff a long , long time .
C is roughly as old as I am ; FORTRAN is as old as my parents .
But what about the new kids on the block ?
the TIOBE software TCPI metrics page provides some data on language popularity going back to the year 2001 .
Consider the tender age of many of the newest , hippest programming languages :
Ruby is barely a teenager .
JavaScript has n't even hit its teens yet .
Now correlate the ages of those modern languages with the publication dates of a few books that represent current thinking in modern software development :
Modern software development is a recent development .
Even though we collectively have over fifty years of experience under our belt , the profession of software development is still very much in its infancy .
Consider source control as an example .
Source control is the absolute bedrock of software engineering .
I believe that source control was not widely prevalent until 1999 .
Here 's why :
Although CVS has been around since the late eighties , it was widely popularized through SourceForge , which did n't exist until the year 2000 .
Microsoft 's SourceSafe was available starting in the mid-90's but did n't hit mainstream acceptance until it was bundled as a part of Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise in 1998 .
Clearly , source control existed before the year 1999 .
Why did it take so long for this essential tool of software engineering to filter down to the mainstream ?
The answer lies in the Redwine - Riddle maturation model ( pdf ) :
Redwine and Riddle reviewed a number of software technologies to see how they develop and propagate .
They found that it typically takes 15 - 20 years for a technology to evolve from concept formulation to the point where it 's ready for popularization .
They identify six typical phases : Basic research .
Investigate basic ideas and concepts , put initial structure on the problem , frame critical research questions .
Concept formulation .
Circulate ideas informally , develop a research community , converge on a compatible set of ideas , publish solutions to specific subproblems .
Development and extension .
Make preliminary use of the technology , clarify underlying ideas , generalize the approach .
Internal enhancement and exploration .
Extend approach to another domain , use technology for real problems , stabilize technology , develop training materials , show value in results .
External enhancement and exploration .
Similar to internal , but involving a broader community of people who were n't developers , show substantial evidence of value and applicability .
Popularization .
Develop production - quality , supported versions of the technology , commercialize and market technology , expand user community .
Redwine and Riddle presented timelines for several software technologies as they progressed through these phases up until the mid-1980s .
I presented a similar analysis for the maturation of software architecture in the 1990s .
CVS was released in 1986 .
It took another fifteen years for CVS usage to become mainstream , exactly as predicted by Redwine - Riddle .
The model Redwine - Riddle proposed in 1980 is very much alive today .
Mark Dominus , in Design Patterns of 1972 , reaches back nearly thirty - five years to illustrate how we 're still struggling to evolve our programming languages today :
Had the " Design Patterns " movement been popular in 1960 , its goal would have been to train programmers to recognize situations in which the " subroutine " pattern was applicable , and to implement it habitually when necessary .
While this would have been a great improvement over not using subroutines at all , it would have been vastly inferior to what really happened , which was that the " subroutine " pattern was codified and embedded into subsequent languages .
Identification of patterns is an important driver of progress in programming languages .
As in all programming , the idea is to notice when the same solution is appearing repeatedly in different contexts and to understand the commonalities .
This is admirable and valuable .
The problem with the " Design Patterns " movement is the use to which the patterns are put afterward : programmers are trained to identify and apply the patterns when possible .
Instead , the patterns should be used as signposts to the failures of the programming language .
As in all programming , the identification of commonalities should be followed by an abstraction step in which the common parts are merged into a single solution .
Multiple implementations of the same idea are almost always a mistake in programming .
The correct place to implement a common solution to a recurring design problem is in the programming language , if that is possible .
The stance of the " Design Patterns " movement seems to be that it is somehow inevitable that programmers will need to implement Visitors , Abstract Factories , Decorators , and Faades .
But these are no more inevitable than the need to implement Subroutine Calls or Object - Oriented Classes in the source language .
These patterns should be seen as defects or missing features in Java and C ++.
The best response to identification of these patterns is to ask what defects in those languages cause the patterns to be necessary , and how the languages might provide better support for solving these kinds of problems .
I do think the pace of change in software development is quickening , thanks to exponential increases in communication over the last fifty years -- television , satellites , cellular phones , and of course the internet .
As software developers , we 've grown accustomed to computer hardware doubling in speed every 18 months .
What we have n't been able to cope with so well is how long it takes for the human beings to catch up with the hardware .
The warnings will pop up before people visit a site
The warning will pop up if users click on a link to a page known to host spyware or other malicious programs .
The initiative comes out of a larger project cataloguing programs that plague people with unwanted ads , spy on web habits or steal personal data .
Google is one of several companies trying to act as an " in-flight adviser " to ensure people stay safe online .
Web watch
The warnings will be seen by anyone using the search engine who clicks on a link to a site identified as harmful by the Stop Badware coalition .
Google , PC maker Lenovo and Sun set up this initiative in January 2006 to identify dangerous software and the websites that try to trick people into installing these malicious programs .
DANGEROUS KEYWORDS
Free screensavers Bearshare Screensavers Winmx Limewire Lime wire Free ringtones
Initially the warnings seen via the search site will be generic and simply alert people to the fact that a site has been flagged as dangerous .
Eventually the warnings will become more detailed as Stop Badware researchers visit harmful sites and analyse how they try to subvert users ' machines .
The warning suggests that people try a different site but if they want to continue to the potentially dangerous webpage Google will not stop them .
A research report released in May 2006 looked at the safety of the results returned by a search and found that , on average , 4 - 6 % of the sites had harmful content on them .
For some keywords , such as " free screensavers " the number of potentially dangerous sites leapt to 64 % .
The keywords are used to entice people to access the website .
The research report was partly sponsored by McAfee 's SiteAdvisor which also warns people when they are about to visit potentially harmful sites .
Another company ScanSafe has also created the Scandoo search engine which overlays its warnings on results produced via Google and MSN .
" Most dodgy websites that have spyware or are infected with viruses come through search , " said Eldar Tuvey , chief executive of ScanSafe .
" Because they are the ones that people do not know as well and find through searching . "
The most important aspect of any module is not how it implements the facilities it provides , but the way in which it provides those facilities in the first place .
-- Damian Conway in Ten Essential Development Practices Public APIs are forever -- ( you have ) one chance to get it right .
-- Joshua Bloch in How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters
Interfaces matter .
The more public they are , the more they matter .
Indeed , once a public API -- such as Conway 's CPAN modules or Bloch 's Java SPIs -- attracts widespread usage , changing it becomes practically impossible .
By contrast , just about anything else can be easily fixed in a later release .
And yet -- as indicated by Brooks ' famous aphorism , plan to throw one away ; you will , anyhow -- you 're most unlikely to concoct the perfect API at your first attempt .
Making the task more daunting still , the dark art of interface and API design is certainly not an easy one to master , there being many disciplines in play : computer science , human factors ( ergonomics ) , cognitive science , psychology , sociology , linguistics , usability , and so on .
I 've spent the past few weeks researching this difficult topic and found very few references dedicated to this subject .
Instead , many books devote a section or two to the art of interface design , or perhaps mention it in passing while analyzing a knotty design or coding matter .
This meditation reports the interface and API design references I 've found useful and further presents some general interface design ideas and checklists in the hope that they may prove useful -- and that they might be improved upon by your insightful feedback .
I 'm writing a Lisp - to - C compiler , trying to keep compiler and runtime very simple and close to C , because I want to embed the language into C applications , and use C libraries .
My closures are structs with a C function pointer and an environment .
Ideally , I 'd like the language to be properly tail - recursive like Scheme ; however , without resorting to techniques like trampolines , Cheney on the M.T.A. , or putting the whole program into one function , it seems that the only possible thing is what BitC does :
Within any function f , calls to f that appear in tail position w.r.t. the body of f must be tail recursive . [...]
Within a letrec , calls to any function bound in the letrec that appear in tail position within some function bound by the letrec must be tail recursive .
These requirements apply only to function calls whose destination can be statically resolved by the compiler at compile time .
What do you think about this restriction ?
Does anyone have experience with the new tail call optimization of GCC , especially when making an indirect call via a function pointer ?
The Heidgen jury , which took five days to reach its verdict , seems to have had difficulty confronting these questions .
In a way , the confrontation was forced on them — in part by a newly installed district attorney elected on an anti-drunken driving platform and in part by a grieving mother .
The facts of the case were never in dispute : Mr. Heidgen , an insurance salesman returning home from a party , was very drunk , his blood - alcohol level three times the legal limit .
He was driving the wrong way on a highway when he plowed head - on into the limousine carrying the family of Neil and Jennifer Flynn home from a wedding .
He killed the chauffeur , Stanley Rabinowitz , and Katie Flynn , 7 .
The girl ’s mother used no euphemisms in describing the accident .
“ As I crawled out of the car , the only thing that was left of Kate was her head , ” Mrs. Flynn , 36 , said two days after the crash .
“ And I took her , just like that , and sat on the side of the Meadowbrook and watched at the horrendousness going on around me .
I want everybody to know that . ”
There is no official count of how many times drunken drivers involved in fatal accidents have been charged or convicted of murder .
But of the more than 13,000 alcohol - related driving deaths last year in the United States , prosecutors are aware of only a few murder cases each in Texas , California and New York .
So there seems to be at least a bit of ambivalence about whether drunken drivers who kill people should be subject to the same legal penalties as gunmen who kill people .
“ There is a certain psychological barrier there , ” said Marcia Cunningham , director of the National Traffic Law Center , an agency of the National District Attorneys Association , in Alexandria , Va. Americans spend an enormous amount of time in their cars , she noted , and at one time or other just about everyone has had too much to drink .
“ The combination of these two familiar activities makes for a certain , what have you , difficulty with the word ‘ murder . ’ ”
Apple 's recent quarterly earnings report blew past all expectations .
More importantly , dramatic unit sales growth shows the company is executing a working strategy for building the Mac platform .
That raises the obvious question : why has Apple 's market share historically been so low , and why did Apple fail to make any progress in the 1990's ?
Here 's a look at why Apple 's platform fell into crisis , and why the solutions proscribed by analysts did n't work .
A follow up article will describe how Apple turned its fortunes around , and why the company is now poised make further gains .
The Market Share of Apples and Oranges
Analysts have long been fixated with Apple 's market share .
However , limited market share was n't Apple 's real problem .
That 's why attempts to " fix " Apple 's market share -- by following strategies which worked in the PC world - - did n't work for Apple .
Market analysts commonly report individual PC manufacturers ' unit sales and their market share , or percentage of the overall market .
This is useful in determining how well a vendor performed relative to its own previous sales and in comparison to the rest of the market .
Market share numbers are meaningful for companies that directly compete for the same sales .
Comparing Dell and HP is equivalent to comparing Ford to GM ; in both cases , the two sell a similar range of models in similar price categories .
However , overall market share numbers convey less useful information when comparing specialized companies with an entirely different product mix .
Comparing Apple 's worldwide market share to HP or Dell fails to consider that Apple sells a different product mix to a very different segment of the market .
Imagine comparing the market share numbers of BMW against Ford and GM ; BMW sells motorcycles and luxury cars , and does not sell pickup trucks or economy cars , nor do it sell large fleets of cars to rental agencies .
Overall market share numbers have always been particularly unimpressive for Apple , because the company similarly has never participated in large segments of the PC market .
Apple has never had significant corporate PC sales , nor does the company sell volume , loss leader PCs at disposable prices .
Apple sells premium computers with a unique operating system .
This leaves it with no direct equivalent in the market .
Apple 's very different product mix means that market share not only does n't tell the whole story , but actually was not the real problem .
In fact , all the focus on driving up market share turned out to be a red herring , and spawned disastrous business decisions that made Apple ’s actual problem worse .
Apple 's Premium PCs
Of course , almost all other PC manufacturers also sell premium PCs , and in fact , this is where they earn most of their profits .
The two largest PC makers , Dell and HP , will gladly sell consumers machines from their premium lines , but are also forced to service the shallow profits of broad waters in low - end PC market .
These manufacturers typically use advertisements of $ 299 eWaste PCs to lead consumers toward their higher end models .
If Dell gave up its sub -$ 500 PC sales , it would not lose profit initially .
However , HP and others would happily rush in to accommodate those entry - level PC buyers , and similarly seek to point them toward more expensive machines .
Dell would eventually lose important sales that resulted from the profitless low - end .
Low - end PC sales are a high volume , low profit business , but a critical segment of the Windows PC market .
By keeping sales volumes high , Dell and HP can lower overall manufacturing costs by benefiting from large economies of scale .
They are also very much aware that every PC they fail to sell will be sold by a competitor , because demand in the PC market is huge .
The Mac Platform Problem
Apple serves a specialized market that has always been constrained to a limited audience of potential Mac buyers .
Macs and PCs have n't been interchangeable , so a company buying a new fleet of computers could n't even consider Apple 's products .
Comparing Apple 's Macs with the market for various manufacturers '
PCs is very much an Apples to oranges comparison .
Macs were n't ever part of the overall PC market , because they were n't PCs at all .
They could n't run DOS or Windows , which was the definition of PC ever since IBM applied the letters to its first home computer .
Industry analysts liked to talk about Apple 's market share , but the company 's real problem was n't its share of the overall PC market , but rather the size of its own limited market .
If Apple could create and maintain a functional Mac market , its share of the overall market for PCs would n't matter any more that its share of the market for all devices that used electricity .
Apple did n't need PC market share , it needed Mac market expansion .
Those two ideas may sound like the same thing , but they are achieved in very different ways .
Unlike the various PC vendors , the only way Apple can sell more Macs is to entice new users to its unique platform .
As the Rise and Fall of Platforms has outlined , moving established users to a new platform is very difficult .
For HP , Dell , and all the other PC makers , stealing each other 's PC sales is much easier .
They can simply lower prices , increase performance , or target sales in different channels .
For example , Dell pushed to the top of PC sales by building an efficient , direct mail order operation .
Thinking that Apple could simply follow the success stories within the PC world , analysts determined that Apple needed to be more like HP and Dell , or alternatively more like Microsoft .
They were disastrously wrong , primarily because Apple was n't selling the same product as either the PC makers or Microsoft .
Simply copying their successes would n't work .
Being like HP : Disasters in Retail
Apple struggled to expand the Mac market in 1992 by broadening out into new retail outlets , including Sears , with a new , low - end Performa line .
This effort to sell Macs more like HP failed due to poor marketing and poor retail presentation .
Additionally , the low profit margins on low - end computers meant that PCs with cheaper components were more profitable for retailers than Macs .
Few retailers wanted to invest in selling Apple 's unique platform for the company , and none were interested if it meant lower retail profits .
If Apple wanted to sell more Macs , it would have to learn how to do that itself .
That did n't happen until 2001 , when Apple opened its first retail stores .
Interestingly , while Apple failed to sell Macs like PCs , it later has succeeded in selling Macs where PCs failed .
Sony and Gateway 's retail stores did n't work , but were the right fit for Apple .
The reason : Apple 's Mac and PCs represented very different products .
Being like Microsoft : Disasters with Clones
In 1995 , Apple began experimenting with Mac clones .
It licensed hardware designs and Mac OS 7 software to Motorola , Power Computing , and several other hardware manufacturers , with the intention that they would expand the market for Macs , particularly into the growing low - end of consumer PCs .
This was supposed to make Apple more like Microsoft , earning its profits from hardware reference designs and licensed software .
However , the assumption that Microsoft 's business plan would be easy to copy was wrong .
As pointed out in the Microsoft Invincibility Myth , even Microsoft has found it impossibly difficult to duplicate its success with Windows into new areas , from WinCE , to handheld Windows PCs , to WMA music players .
In fact , Microsoft has recently abandoned new efforts in software licensing to begin copying Apple 's model with the Macintosh : both the Xbox and the Zune involve integrated hardware and software sold directly by Microsoft ; there are no licensees .
Similarly , video game consoles from Sony and Nintendo have always followed this model , and there are few other examples of successful companies who only license technology designs for others to build , particularly in the consumer electronics market .
Being like Dell : Disasters in Direct Sales
Additionally , cloning also attempted to sell Mac hardware more like Dell : target the large low - end market with cheap hardware and trade lower profits for higher volumes using a direct sales model .
The president and CEO of Power Computing , Apple 's leading cloner , was originally from Dell , and the cloner ran a direct sales operation similar to Dell's .
It turned out that the analysts were wrong .
Cloning did n't work for Apple for the same reasons that Apple was having its initial problems : the company had a limited potential share of the market .
Copying the business model of commodity PC makers was not going to work for Apple because the company did n't have the same market or demand volume to exploit .
Instead of expanding the overall Mac market , cloners simply siphoned off the cream of Apple 's sales .
The smaller cloners were able to offer low volume , faster chips first , enabling them to take the high margin sales away from Apple .
That was the exact opposite of what Apple 's executives had imagined would happen .
Just as with its retail initiatives , Mac clone licensing and the low - end , high volume sales models that worked for PCs did n't work for Apple .
Even more importantly , these efforts to copy PC makers failed to attack the real problem : Apple was doing little to entice new users to the Mac platform .
Cheaper Macs were not increasing market share , they only served to move existing Mac users onto lower quality machines .
Apple really needed to give new consumers a reason to buy a Mac .
If Apple could expand the Mac market , it would n't need to worry about market share .
No Reason to Buy Macs
Prior to Windows , Macs held an obvious advantage in running desktop publishing and graphic design applications .
As Windows began to develop into a comparable product , Apple fell behind in progressive development of differentiating features .
Once a leader in multimedia with the innovative QuickTime , Apple fell into a distant third place behind Microsoft and Real in the highly visible Internet media streaming market .
Apple also failed to deliver the new System 8 , code named Copland .
Those failures also impaired third party development .
The Mac was dying was because nobody had any reason to buy it .
Without offering a compelling reason to buy a Mac , low prices , retail exposure , and profit sharing with cloners did nothing but make the situation worse .
The NeXT Plan
After buying NeXT in the final days of 1996 , Apple spent several years investing in its new , NeXT based operating system .
However , Mac OS
X in itself was not going to sell a lot of new Macs .
Apple still needed functional reasons for users to buy Macs : competitive software applications that would serve as killer apps , just as PageMaker had a decade earlier .
During the development of Mac OS X , Apple 's fortunes rested largely upon Microsoft 's Office suit of business applications , print production and graphic design software from Adobe and Quark , and Macromedia 's suite of web design tools .
These four companies forced Apple to delay its migration to NeXT in order to support the classic Mac OS .
Without the assurance that Apple would even survive the decade , they did not want to invest in an entirely new Mac platform .
Apple 's existing Mac platform was almost entirely dependent upon these four developers ; without them , Apple 's Mac would turn into another Amiga or Be : interesting , oddball hardware which lacked much serious software .
Apple was forced to dump its initial plans to quickly migrate Mac users to NeXTSTEP under the code name Rhapsody , and instead undertook an extensive engineering effort to completely reengineer a new hybrid operating system and development environment .
During the development of Mac OS X , Apple polished the existing classic Mac OS , and salvaged what it could of Copland developments .
Apple modernized its existing Mac APIs into Carbon , which would run software in Mac OS 9 , and later allow it to run natively in Mac OS X .
Despite fixing the obvious flaws in Apple 's operating system offering , Mac OS X did not in itself solve Apple 's problem .
The company now only had an improved platform that nobody had any reason to buy .
The real solution to Apple 's problem was stumbled onto by a fortunate accident .

— Dan Kinel , Rochester , NY
We 've had our Wii kicking around the office for a little while now , but we had to hold off on answering your many questions about it until last night when they rolled out their launch update .
Trust us , it definitely changed some answers , so let 's get to the FAQ .
Oh , and thanks for the questions .
Feel free to leave your followups in the comments .
Mr Litvinenko died in London last month
" Co-operation has already begun , " Interpol 's Russian office chief Timur Lakhonin said in Moscow .
He said Interpol was providing " speedy exchange of information " between police in Britain , Russia and Germany , who had already launched their own inquiries .
Mr Litvinenko , 43 , died in a London hospital last month - it is suspected he was poisoned by polonium - 210 .
Interpol , which has 186 member countries around the globe , facilitates cross - border police co-operation .
It is hoped that its involvement in the Litvinenko case could speed up the exchange of information between detectives in the three countries involved and also make it easier for them to obtain evidence and testimony .
Contacts questioned
British investigators have already travelled to Moscow to question those who met Mr Litvinenko in a London hotel on 1 November - the day he fell ill .
Andrei Lugovoi has been questioned by police in Moscow
Litvinenko case : Key names Germany gripped by spy story
Andrei Lugovoi - a KGB officer - turned - businessman - was interviewed on Monday in a Moscow hospital where he is undergoing medical checks after traces of polonium - 210 had been reportedly found in his body .
Mr Lugovoi - who denies any involvement - said afterwards that he was questioned as a witness .
Dmitry Kovtun - another man who met Mr Litvinenko on 1 November - has also been questioned by British and Russian detectives .
On Tuesday , Mr Kovtun - who has been hospitalised with radiation poisoning in a Moscow hospital - told Russia 's Channel One TV that his " health was improving " .
The former KGB officer is being investigated by German detectives on suspicion of plutonium smuggling into Germany in October .
But in a separate interview , Mr Kovtun said he had been contaminated by Mr Litvinenko in London weeks before the latter fell fatally ill .
" I have only one explanation for the presence of polonium , " Mr Kovtun told Spiegel TV .
" It is that I brought it back from London , where I met Alexander Litvinenko on October 16 , 17 and 18 , " he said .
However , British detectives reportedly found no radiation on a bus ticket Mr Litvinenko used to get to the meeting at the London hotel on 1 November .
If confirmed , this implies that Mr Litvinenko was not contaminated before the meeting .
In Germany , four people close to Mr Kovtun - his ex-wife , her partner and two children living in or near Hamburg - are still undergoing tests for possible radiation contamination .
According to German police , the four have shown signs of contamination after Mr Kovtun stayed at his ex-wife 's flat before flying to London .
He denies any involvement in Mr Litvinenko 's death .
' Whistleblower missing '
Russian investigators , meanwhile , are reportedly preparing to travel to London to question witnesses .
Mr Litvinenko's widow earlier said she would not assist the Russian inquiry .
Friends of Mr Litvinenko believe he was poisoned because of his criticisms of the Russian government since defecting to the UK , but the Kremlin has dismissed suggestions it was involved in any way .
Russia 's foreign intelligence service has also issued a statement denying any involvement .
The concept of harm reduction is at the heart of conflicting international drug policies .
The Dutch pioneered this approach .
Today most European countries and Canada have embraced the idea that society benefits most when drug policy is designed to help people with drug problems to live better lives rather than to punish them .
In contrast , the United States federal policy demands rigid zero tolerance with overwhelming emphasis on incarceration of offenders ( the Drug War ) .
Although , seemingly reasonable arguments can be made to support both sides of the dispute , the recent global trend towards harm reduction has resulted from the acknowledgement that drug use has been a part of all societies throughout history and the realization that repressive policies are expensive , ineffective , and often harmful .
A dramatic example of the benefits that can result from a harm reduction approach to drugs is seen with needle exchange programs .
While prohibitionists argue that providing clean injection equipment promotes drug use , the facts do not support this contention .
For example , the Australian needle exchange program is credited with keeping the HIV / AIDS infection rate very much lower than what is typically found globally http://www.chr.asn.au/about/harmreduction.
Commonly cited examples of the failed repressive policies championed by the United States are the now repealed alcohol prohibition and the current drug war .
Crime , financial support for terrorism , disrespect for the law , and destruction of families , communities , and ecosystems can all be attributed to drug prohibition .
Yet , the staggering cost of the drug war , driven by United States policy and taxpayers ' money , amounts to many billions of dollars a year .
Cannabis is the third most commonly used drug in the world , following tobacco and alcohol .
In the United States , much of the drug war is focused on marijuana ( over 700,000 people arrested last year alone ) .
Is there justification for this policy ?
The gateway theory states marijuana use leads to the use of other drugs , and drives the U.S. policy despite evidence that suggests alcohol and tobacco use may foster the gateway effect [ 1 , 2 ] .
In contrast , countries that support harm reduction focus their enforcement and social support efforts on " hard drugs . "
Consequently , many countries have effectively decriminalized marijuana .
Holland , having the most liberalized drug laws , does not have more cannabis users ( over age twelve ) than do more repressive countries , and the per capita number of heroin users is also lower http://www.drugpolicy.org/global/drugpolicyby/westerneurop/thenetherlan/.
The Dutch Ministry of Justice estimates that 0.16 % of cannabis users are heroin users .
This figure does not support cannabis being a gateway drug .
Data from the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse ( U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ) also shows that the vast majority of people who try cannabis do not go on to use hard drugs .
A little explored question is what does harm reduction specifically mean with respect to cannabis consumption ?
This article will address cannabis harm reduction from a biological perspective .
Two directions will be examined : what are the biological effects of cannabis use and what are the social effects that emerge from the biological foundation .
Like many substances that are put into the human body , there can be positive or negative consequences that result from cannabis consumption , depending on amount , frequency , quality , and probably most importantly , the idiosyncratic biochemistry of the user .
Prohibitionists concentrate their efforts on the negative effects of cannabis use , while anti-prohibitionists tend to focus on the positive effects .
If we assume that both sides have valid arguments , the issue to be resolved is one of balance between the negative and positive effects .
Would a policy of tolerance , or prohibition , be more likely to reduce harm overall ?
Which policy would better serve society as a whole , as well as problematic drug users ?
Biological science can be more objectively evaluated than social science .
The central theme that will be presented in this article is that appropriate cannabis use reduces biological harm caused by biochemical imbalances , particularly those that increase in frequency with age .
Proper cannabis use , as distinguished from misuse , may have significant positive health effects associated with the way cannabis mimics natural cannabinoids .
In essence , it is proposed that the endocannabinoid system , selected by 600 million years of evolution , is a central mediator of biological harm reduction through its homeostatic activities .
The social implications of cannabis use will be viewed as emerging from the biological platform .
Herein lies the paradox of cannabis and harm reduction .
Is appropriate use of cannabis better than no use ?

Using RubyInline to Speed Up Code By 10x
By Peter Cooper
After writing a basic routine to print all prime numbers between 1 and 10,000 in Ruby , Pat Eyler found it took almost 3 seconds to complete , and seeked out a way to make it faster .
Enter RubyInline ( covered previous at RubyInside ) ..
With RubyInline he added a basic C function into the Ruby mix and knocked down the time required to 0.3 seconds .
The code :
require " rubygems " require " inline " class Primes inline do | builder | builder .
c ' int prime ( int num ) { int x ; for ( x = 2 ; x < ( num - 1 ) ; x++ ) { if ( num == 2 ) { return 1 ; } if ( num % x == 0 ) { return x ; } } return 1 ; } ' end end p = Primes .
new for num in 2 .. 10_000 do is_prime = p . prime ( num ) if is_prime == 1 puts " # {num} is a prime number " else puts " # {num} equals #{is_prime} * # {num / is_prime} " end end

Alfred Hitchcock ( 1899 - 1980 ) was one of the most outstanding filmmakers of the twentieth century .
In a career spanning six decades , Hitchcock made 53 films , the best of which are at once suspenseful , exciting , disturbing , funny and romantic .
The so - called ‘ master of suspense ’ pioneered many of the techniques of the thriller genre , and remains highly influential to this day .
He was one of the first directors to portray psychological processes in film narrative .
However , his films were initially more popular with audiences than with critics , and it was not until the latter part of his career , largely due to directors of the French New Wave , such as François Truffaut , that his genius was recognized .
Hitchcock was born in 1899 in Leytonstone , East London into a Cockney Catholic family .
He was educated at boarding schools , where he remained until the death of his father in 1913 .
In 1920 , Hitchcock obtained a full - time job designing film titles at Islington Studios , which was owned by the American production company Famous Players - Lasky .
While there , he endeavoured to learn as much as he could about the film business .
Within 3 years of starting his job at the studio , Hitchcock became an assistant director and , in 1925 , a director .
The following year , Hitchcock married Alma Reville , his assistant director , with whom he had a daughter , Patricia , in 1928 .
During these early years of his career , Hitchcock made some of his best films , such as The 39 Steps , and The Man Who Knew Too Much .
In the late 1930s , the British film industry was in a financial crisis ; Hitchcock took up a contract with Hollywood producer David O. Selznick , and took his family to the United States in 1939 .
Hitchcock once remarked that “ television has done much for psychiatry by spreading information about it , as well as contributing to the need for it . ”
During much of Hitchcock ’s career , Freud ’s ideas were dominant , and although Hitchcock was skeptical of psychoanalysis ( as he was of other explanations for human behaviour ) , Freudian concepts and motifs recur in many of his films .
Repression is one of the Freudian concepts which recurs in Hitchcock ’s films .
According to Freud , “ the essence of repression lies simply in the turning something away , and keeping it at a distance , from the conscious ” .
Freud believed that traumatic memories , usually of childhood events , are repressed by the conscious mind ; this is a defence mechanism which keeps the ego free of conflict and tension .
These memories remain hidden in the subconscious , and manifest themselves in the neuroses and psychoses of the individual , when something induces the momentary retrieval of a repressed memory , triggering a neurotic or psychotic episode .
One aim of Freudian psychoanalysis is the retrieval of these repressed memories from the subconscious , in the hope that confronting them will cure the patient ’s neuroses .
Psychoanalysis began featuring in film plots in the early 1940s .
Hitchcock ’s Spellbound ( 1945 ) was one of the first Hollywood films to sell psychoanalysis to an American audience , and was the first in which a psychiatrist instead of a private detective solved the mystery .
The opening title of Spellbound states :
Our story deals with psychoanalysis , the method by which modern science treats the emotional problems of the sane .
The analyst seeks only to induce the patient to talk about his hidden problems , to open the locked doors of his mind .
Once the complexes that have been disturbing the patient are uncovered and interpreted , the illness and confusion disappear …and the evils of unreason are driven from the human soul .
Hitchcock described Spellbound as “ just another manhunt story wrapped up in pseudo - psychoanalysis . ”
The main characters , played by Gregory Peck and Ingrid Bergman , are both psychiatrists .
Gregory Peck ’s character takes over as the head of a psychiatric institution and , upon his arrival , he and the institution ’s only female psychiatrist , Constance Peterson ( Ingrid Bergman ) are immediately attracted to each other .
The two fall in love , but it soon becomes apparent that Peck ’s character has some psychological problems .
He has anxiety attacks whenever he sees a fork being rubbed against a table cloth , or a pattern of parallel lines .
This makes Peterson professionally and personally more interested in him .
Peterson starts to unravel his mysterious past , but Ballantine is arrested , charged with the murder of Dr. Edwards , and imprisoned .
However , Peterson eventually solves the mystery , and Ballantine is vindicated .
It emerges that Ballantine ’s fear of parallel lines has its roots in an incident that occurred during his childhood , in which his brother is killed .
Ballantine has always held himeself responsible for his brother ’s death , and his guilt is transferred to the demise of Dr. Edwards – Ballantine convinces himself that he is the murderer .
Spellbound also contains a dream sequence by the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí , which is full of striking imagery and symbolism , such as eyes and mutilation , which Freud considered to be important in his interpretation of dreams .
The Oedipus complex is another theme that runs throughout the film ; Bergman ’s character represents a mother figure , with whom Ballantine falls in love .
Vertigo ( 1958 ) , a masterful study of fantasy and anxiety , is another of Hitchcock ’s films which draws heavily on Freudian concepts .
It is considered to be one of the director ’s finest films , and was nominated for , but did not win , the Best Art Direction and Best Sound Academy Awards .
Vertigo has perhaps been analyzed more than any other film , and I will only touch on some of it ’s Freudian aspects .
The plot revolves around the efforts of James Stewart ’s character , Scottie , who is a private detective , to follow a friend ’s mentally ill wife ( played by Kim Novak ) , in order to try and determine the reason for her strange behaviour .
Scotty soon establishes that all is not what it appears to be , but , by that time , he has fallen in love with Novak ’s character .
In the opening scene , the protagonist watches a colleague fall to his death during a rooftop chase .
Stewart ’s character is racked with guilt , as his colleague was rescuing him when he fell from the roof .
This guilt , and the acrophobia ( fear of heights ) produced as a result of the rooftop incident , are the root of the character ’s psychological problems .
The intricate plot of Vertigo is ludicrous , but , again , is filled with Freudian themes and symbols .
Scottie ’s fear of heights is one theme which is alluded to repeatedly throughout the film .
Hitchcock employed the dolly zoom technique , in which the cameraman zooms in while moving away from the actor , or zooms out while moving in , to achieve a disorienting ‘ falling ’ effect .
Freud placed great importance on dreams involving falling ; the repeated use of the theme has been interpreted by some to be a manifestation of Hitchcock ’s obsession with death .
Another example of Hitchcock ’s use of the notion of repressed memories is the film Marnie ( 1964 ) , starring Tippi Hedren as the psychologically dysfunctional title character .
Marnie is a kleptomaniac who loathes men and has a great need to be loved by her mother .
She moves from one city to the next , embezzling her employees .
Her scams are eventually discovered by Mark Rutland ( played by Sean Connery ) , who , by that time , has become obsessed with her .
Rutland blackmails her into marrying him , and tries to get to the root of her psychological problems .
Soon after they are married , Rutland discovers that Marnie is frigid ; she also has an immense fear of the colour red and of thunderstorms .
During the course of the film , we learn of the causes of Marnie ’s neuroses .
It transpires that Marnie ’s mother , Bernice , was a prostitute , and that her irrational fears can be traced to an incident that occurred when she was six years old .
During a storm , the young Marnie is frightened , and one of her mother ’s clients , played by Bruce Dern , tries to calm her down .
Thinking that he is molesting her daughter , Bernice attacks the client .
Marnie , seeing her mother struggling with the man , picks up a fireplace poker , and strikes him over the head , killing him .
The pool of blood produced as a result , and the association of that event with the thunderstorm , are the causes of Marnie ’s neuroses .
“ There is no terror in the bang , only in the anticipation of it . ”
From this quote alone , it is clear that Hitchcock had a profound understanding of the human psyche .
He knew that the imagination was far more powerful than any image he could render on the screen , and this knowledge was key to his remarkable ability to manipulate his audience .
Graphic violence was rarely featured in Hitchcock ’s films ; the audience instead used their imagination to ‘ fill the gaps ’ .
Take , for example , the shower scene in Psycho ( 1960 ) , which remains the most famous murder scene in cinema history .
The scene , which lasts 45 seconds , involved 78 camera set ups and took one week to film .
Not once do we see the knife penetrate the flesh of Janet Leigh ’s character , yet the scene is one of the most shocking ever filmed .
The piercing violin of Bernard Herrmann ’s score is one of the things that makes this scene so effective .
“ Always make the audience suffer as much as possible , ” Hitchcock once said .
An interviewer once remarked that Hitchcock never watched his films with the audience , and asked whether he missed hearing them scream , to which he replied , “ No .
I can hear them when I ’m making the picture . ”
Yet Hitchcock ’s own psychology remains a mystery .
Famously , he had ambivalent views towards women , and his relationships with his cast , particularly the leading ladies , were rocky .
Generally , mothers are powerful characters in Hitchcock ’s films .
“ A boy ’s best friend is his mother , ” Norman Bates tells Marion Crane in Psycho .
Freud would have concluded that Hitchcock ’s attitude towards women , and his obsession with strong mother figures , is probably due to Hitchcock ’s experiences of his own mother , who sometimes made the young Hitchcock stand at the foot of her bed for several hours as a punishment ( this is alluded to in a scene in Psycho ) .
Hitchcock once said that “ the way to get rid of my fears is to make films about them ” ; his films can , therefore , be regarded as projections , conscious or otherwise , of his own neuroses onto the silver screen .
Some critics have suggested that Hitchcock had a severely pathological psychology .
Hitchcock has been criticized for the ‘ caricatures ’ of psychoanalysis presented in his films .
But Hitchcock ’s portrayals of psychoanalysis should be regarded as a criticism , rather than an endorsement , of the technique .
Even though Freud ’s thinking was highly influential at the time , Hitchcock was skeptical of it , as he was of other explanations for human behaviour .
( In this respect , Hitchcock was ahead of his time , as Freud was highly influential in psychiatry at the time . )
Nevertheless , Freudian concepts were employed almost routinely by Hitchcock in his films , which still retain their impact , despite the displacement of Freud ’s theories by biological explanations of mind and behaviour .
The vanity of pride hides the true reflected man .
But every now and again an event will occur that straightens out the distortions and exposes one 's real identity .
One such event happened to me at a meeting between officials of a local city and the school district I serve as a board member .
Before the call to the table , as members of both governments were milling about , the city manager spotted me from across the room and loudly congratulated me on my reference to Hayek in my then - recent letter to the editor .
The city manager hastened over to me and excitedly talked about reading Road to Serfdom while in college .
He loved the book and appreciated my reference .
I , in turn , mentioned similar books from Mises that I had just read .
Then it hit me .
There I stood looking at my reflection ; a Hayekian and a Misesian talking shop just before we were to be seated at an intergovernment planning meeting .
It was as if the meeting existed in another dimension , but there was the table , and here we stood , two hypocrites seeing ourselves as fighters for freedom while living lives of statists .
Vanity could hide the truth for only so long , and when the veil is finally lifted , the true image is humbling .
It is moments like these that expose supposed achievements and actions , and allows one to take stock of where they are and where they want to be .
These moments bring reality back into focus ; they provide clarity to the distorted images .
What were we planning ?
What were our big ideas ?
The city and school officials were set to solve all the issues facing the local residents , but these plans never work out as envisioned .
They only plot a new course toward chaos .
The irony is that as the public school system slips ever further into disarray , more interventions are proposed and implemented .
Each new program simply adds more layers of regulations , which then require new interventions , ad infinitum .
None of those in attendance at the planning meeting have any clue as to the solution .
The problems are large and getting larger , though the solution is as simple today as it was over two hundred years ago .
Why then can't the officials find the solution ?
Simple , they refuse to admit that they themselves are the problem .
I am the evil one , a minor member of the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion , serving as an elected member of a free and compulsory school district .
We all recognize that public education is in a sorry state .
Money is being thrown down the rabbit hole by those who adhere to the Mad Hatter logic of " Clean cup , clean cup , move down " whereby the initiator of the intervention wins the clean cup full of hot tea while the rest are drinking from someone else 's cup .
The unions , the state departments of education and the local school boards all conspire to grab the new cup — the tax dollars — in the name of a supposed public good .
" It 's for the kids you know . "
No it 's for the system .
And our future — our children — will be stuck trying to down a lukewarm liquid from a used cup .
I started my intellectual journey toward economic truths after I was first elected .
At the time I believed in the system .
Sure there were failures in the past , but I was going to be the one to set the right direction , I would be the omniscient one .
But as Mises showed decades earlier , and Rothbard confirmed , there is no rational way to direct a government bureaucracy .
In fact , it 's impossible .
It does not even matter if the elected or appointed board member or administrator is skilled in the market or knowledgeable about economics ; all members of a bureaucracy are flying blind .
But that truth never stops those who aspire to use government as the mean to an end .
Instead of omniscient , I became omnipotent in matters of school policies .
Like Nero as Rome burns , school board members , school administrators , and local , state and federal officials , bursting with pride garnered from a belief in their own omnipotence and omniscience , meet to fiddle the next intervention .
The pretenders swear fealty and kiss the ring of the highest official in attendance .
His is the one that holds the power to douse the raging flames of public school failure .
If the meeting is held in the audience of a congressman , then you know you have shaken the hand of a man who shook the hand of the President .
Awe , pride , and self - conceit fill the room with a testosterone effect , power is certainly an enticing drug .
At the head of the table is the congressman who can get the job done , and he will tell you so .
Your solutions become his solutions .
Yes , even a lowly school board member can change the course of history .
Maybe they will name the federal legislation after you .
Maybe you will receive a pen from the signing of the bill into law .
Regardless , you know that you are finally part of the solution .
At least in your view of the situation , you are the selfless public servant delivering the public goods .
Bush proposes federal initiatives , state education departments add new programs , and local school boards pronounce missions and goals , but each can fix nothing .
They simply form the current version of the Soviet Gosplan , creating five - year plans of improvement that will only create more havoc , more chaos .
Two questions beg answers :
What are the solutions ?
And , what am I doing serving the beast .
I have been on the school board for over six years and I can state that government cannot solve the current education fiasco , and never will .
Mises knew this in the early 1900s , but the advocates of public education sit here in the 21st century pretending that what Mises said has no value .
They truly accept the Progressive belief that government is the way to salvation .
I am here to say that Mises was indeed correct .
I learned from the shock of my image at the meeting that talking and doing can be separate actions .
I allowed that moment of clarity to redirect my efforts toward liberty .
I am using the remaining months I have on the school board to try to make a change .
No , I am not expecting improvements in the current system , none have happened thus far .
Instead I am working for a revolutionary change , one that takes us back to the private system of education that was the primary education - delivery structure at the time of the Revolution ; revolutionary indeed .
Do not buy the " education is a public good " mantra , and do not accept the current system — a system patterned after the 19th - century collectivist and socialist Prussian state .
Instead , work for a free - market education system that benefits all and harms none .
That is a future worthy of envisioning .
That is the means to reestablish liberty in the United States .

How to Buy Books ( And Not by their Cover ) April 4 , 2006
Posted by TimTheFoolMan in Books
As a tech - oriented person and avid book owner , I have been constantly faced with the dilemma of how to choose between a myriad of selections at the local bookstore , or when shopping at Amazon or Barnes & Noble online .
After reading about Donald Knuth ’s methodology for grading comp-sci projects ( solving long and complex programming problems ) , I modified my approach , and have been using the following method for the past few years .
A Highly Recommended Approach
Obviously , if you can get first - hand recommendations from someone else , those are a plus .
Most of the books that I ’ve bought in the past year are a direct result of listening to a topic discussed in a podcast or at a presentation , and catching a recommendation along the way .
Depending on the speaker ’s knowledge of the subject matter , I may value a recommendation more or less , but that ’s not always a definitive guide .
After all , sometimes a bozo discovers a good book , and sometimes a leader in the field will recommend something that is far beyond my level of understanding ( i.e. most everything except his own books that he recommends ) .
Use Your Index Fingers
Unfortunately , I do n’t always have a good recommendation to go by .
That ’s when I fall back on the modified - Donald - Knuth - paper - grading approach .
Here ’s how it goes .
For a given subject you want to buy a book about , let ’s say … the history of cartooning , pick a moderately obscure factoid that you think a good book on the subject should cover .
For instance , you may have some knowledge of the political cartoons that were created about Abraham Lincoln as President .
Now , hit the Index , and find a page where it ’s mentioned , and read the entire page ( before and after the factoid reference ) .
If you repeat this process for all the books in front of you , after a couple of books , you should have a good idea of the writing style the author (s ) use .
This is an important point .
If the factoid appears in the middle of the book ( and not in the first or last chapter ) , then it ’s probably representative of the bulk of the text .
( Some authors are notorious for writing really good first and last chapters , and taking up space in the middle , so choose a factoid that does n’t appear there .
This is analogous to not buying a US - manufactured car in the 1970 ’s that was built on a Monday or Friday , but for the exact opposite reasons . )
Table of ( dis ) Contents
Over time , the method I ’ve described here has become second - nature .
I still check the Table of Contents , as that gives me a clue about the scope of the subject the book intends to cover .
However , I always wait to check the TOC until after I ’ve been to the Index .
That way , I wo n’t be tempted by the scope ( almost always fluffed up ) and lose sight of the quality of the writing ( or lack thereof ) .
Das Entblößen der Brust am Strand , das Ablegen des Bikini - Oberteils , ist ein Schritt , der so normal er inzwischen sein mag doch unterbewusst mit vielen Regeln und Verhaltensweisen einhergeht .
Kaufmann fragt sie akribisch hintereinander ab :
In welchem Altersfenster zeigen sich Frauen ganz selbstverständlich barbusig , welche Altersgrenzen werden von den ungeschriebenen Strandregeln und Ästhetiknormen gesetzt ?
Warum wird von den Strandbesuchern ein bewegter , nackter Busen als anstößiger empfunden , als wenn die Trägerin flach auf dem Rücken liegt ?
Warum greifen manche beim Gang ins Wasser zum Oberteil , so als wäre das vertikale Entblößen etwas anderes als das horizontale ?
( Antwort : Intuitives Fröstelempfinden )
Darf barbusig Volleyball gespielt werden ?
( Antwort : Nur in Ausnahmefällen )
Warum wird sowohl eine zu schöne Brust als auch eine unförmige als unzeigbar empfunden ?
( Antwort : Weil man sie in beiden Fällen anschauen muss . )
Die Antworten findet Soziologe Kaufmann in den Erfahrungen und Schilderungen der befragten Barbusigen , die er vergleicht und aus denen er interessante Allgemeinverhalten und Häufungen ableitet .
Zum Beispiel bei der Auswahl des Strandplatzes :
In der Nähe von anderen Barbusigen , aber nicht zu nah , keinesfalls an exponierter Stelle und eher in Wassernähe ( wegen der vertikalen Unsicherheit ! ) , nicht bei Jungsgruppen und alten , alleinbadenden Männern .
Leicht voyeuristische Blicke sind überwiegend geduldet , wenn sie von jungen Männern zwischen 20 und 40 Jahren kommen und werden dann quasi als biologische Unabänderlichkeit verschmerzt , wobei Blicke von älteren Männern sehr schnell als störend gelten .
Solche selbstverständlichen Wahrnehmungen sind für den Soziologen eine wissenschaftliche Fundgrube , beim normalen Leser erzeugen sie immerhin einen unterhaltsamen „ Aha “ - Effekt oder ein ertapptes „ Stimmt ! “ .
Und man kreist mit dem Wissenschaftler die kniffligen Alltagsprobleme des Strandlebens ein .
Ist es einfacher mit guten Freunden Oben - Ohne zu machen oder mit ganz Fremden ?
Wie empfindet man ein unerwartetes Zusammentreffen zum Beispiel mit Arbeitskollegen ?
Welche Vorzeigekriterien stellen Frauen an die öffentlichen Busen anderer Frauen ?
( Es sind die gleichen Kriterien , die die Männer anstellen ! ) .
Über diese ergründeten Strandrituale hinaus , werden die seit den 70er - Jahren verbreitete , nackte Strand - Brust in die Gesellschaftshistorie eingeordnet und abstraktere Fragen angedacht .
„ Wie kann man sich erklären , dass ein nackter Busen anderswo ein erotisches Objekt ist , nicht aber ( zumindest theoretisch ) am Strand ? “
Und wo hört der Strand auf und fängt das Unziemliche an ?
So simpel das Phänomen , so vielfältig und komplex kann man sich daran abarbeiten und Autor Kaufmann macht das mit Sorgfalt und Ruhe , ohne zu langweilen mit aller gebotenen wissenschaftlichen Neutralität .
Eine interessante Strandlektüre .
I have a hard time respecting anyone who believes that science or technology is neutral .
Unfortunately , even when people consciously know that they are not , they give credence to the biased outputs without questioning the underlying assumptions .
This is why i’m an academic – nothing gives me greater joy than to think about what biases go into the creation of a particular system .
After reminding folks at Blogher that there are gender differences in networking habits , i decided to do some investigation into the network structures of blogs .
Kevin Marks of Technorati kindly gave me a random sample of 500 blogs to play with .
I began coding them based on gender ( which is surprisingly easy to do given the amount of personal information people put about themselves ) and looking for patterns in links and blogrolls .
I decided to do the same for non-group blogs in the Technorati Top 100 .
I had n’t looked at the Top 100 in a while and was floored to realize that most of those blogs are group blogs and / or professional blogs ( with “ editors ” and clear financial backing ) .
Most are covered in advertisements and other things meant to make them money .
It ’s very clear that their creators have worked hard to reach many eyes ( for fame , power or money ? ) .
Here are some of the patterns that i saw * :
Blogrolls :
All MSNS paces users have a list of “ Updated Spaces ” that looks like a blogroll .
It ’s not .
It ’s a random list of 10 blogs on MSNS paces that have been recently updated .
As a result , without special code ( like in Technorati ) , search engines get to see MSNS pace bloggers as connecting to lots of other blogs .
This would create the impression of high network density between MSNS paces which is inaccurate .
paces users have a list of “ Updated Spaces ” that looks like a blogroll .
It ’s not .
It ’s a random list of 10 blogs on paces that have been recently updated .
As a result , without special code ( like in Technorati ) , search engines get to see pace bloggers as connecting to lots of other blogs .
This would create the impression of high network density between paces which is inaccurate .
Few LiveJournals have a blogroll but almost all have a list of friends one click away .
This is not considered by search tools that look only at the front page .
Bloggers who use hosting services tend to link to only others on the same hosting service ( from the blogrolls on Xanga and Rakuten to the friend links on LJ ) .
The blogroll structure on these is often set up to only accept lists of blogs from that service .
Blogrolls seem to be very common on politically - oriented blogs and always connect to blogs with similar political views ( or to mainstream media ) .
Blogrolls by group blogging companies ( like Weblogs , Inc. ) always link to other blogs in the domain , using collective link power to help all .
A fraction of the Top 100 have blogrolls of blogs .
Some have blogrolls that are a link away ( like Crooked Timber ) .
Quite a few use that space to advertise or link to mainstream media or companies .
Male bloggers who write about technology ( particularly social software ) seem to be the most likely to keep blogrolls .
Their blogrolls tend be be dominantly male , even when few of the blogs they link to are about technology .
I have n’t found one with > 25 % female bloggers ( and most seem to be closer to 10 % ) .
On LJ ( even though it does n’t count ) and Xanga , there ’s a gender division in blogrolls whereby female bloggers have mostly female “ friends ” and vice versa .
I was also fascinated that most of the mommy bloggers that i met at Blogher link to Dooce ( in Top 100 ) but Dooce links to no one .
This seems to be true of a lot of topical sites – there ’s a consensus on who is in the “ top ” and everyone links to them but they link to no one .
I also get the impression that blogrolls are not frequently updated ( although i have to imagine that the blogs one reads are ) .
I wonder how static blogrolls are .
Linking patterns :
The Top 100 tend to link to mainstream media , companies or websites ( like Wikipedia , IMDB ) more than to other blogs ( Boing Boing is an exception ) .
) more than to other blogs ( Boing Boing is an exception ) .
Blogs on blogging services rarely link to blogs in the posts ( even when they are talking about other friends who are in their blogroll or friends ’ list ) .
It looks like there ’s a gender split in tool use ; Mena said that LJ is like 75 % female , while Typepad and Moveable Type have far fewer women .
Bloggers often talk about other people without linking to their blog ( as though the audience would know the blog based on the person ) .
For example , a blogger might talk about Halley Suitt ’s presence or comments at Blogher but never link to her .
This is much rarer in the Top 100 who tend to link to people when they reference them .
Content type is correlated with link structure ( personal blogs contain few links , politics blogs contain lots of links ) .
There ’s a gender split in content type .
When bloggers link to another blog , it is more likely to be same gender .
I began this investigation curious about gender differences .
There are a few things that we know in social networks .
First , our social networks are frequently split by gender ( from childhood on ) .
Second , men tend to have large numbers of weak ties and women tend to have fewer , but stronger ties .
This means that in traditional social networks , men tend to know far more people but not nearly as intimately as those women know .
( This is a huge advantage for men in professional spheres but tends to wreak havoc when social support becomes more necessary and is often attributed to depression later in life . )
While blog linking tends to be gender - dependent , the number of links seems to be primarily correlated with content type and service .
Of course , since content type and service are correlated by gender , gender is likely a secondary effect .
Interestingly , there are distinct clusters of norms wrt linking in blogging , not a coherent and consistent one .
The search engines ( and the Technorati 100 and PubSub ’s Daily 100 Top Links ) are validating one of those clusters , regardless of whether or not that is what searchers are looking for .
The Top 100 is a list of blogs who either fit into those norms or have adopted those norms in their patterns ( most commonly the companies ) .
I also want to point out a few other issues in link biases that are relevant here :
All links are created equal .
All relationships are not .
Treating everything like a consistent weak tie is quantity over quality and in social networks , that means male over female .
When the data being measured has inconsistent structure rules , any ranking metric is inherently flawed .
In blogs , there ’s no consistency for what a link means , no consistent social norms for blogrolls , no agreed - upon links norms .
Metrics inherently squish out this nuance and force all of the square pegs into the round holes .
Links indicate no weight , no valence , no attributes .
I know Technorati has asked folks to indicate positive / negative in their links or to use nofollow , but few do this .
And even if people did , that kind of articulation is a social disaster ( :: cough : : think Friendster ) .
Traditionally , there is power in keeping your black book shut ; one ’s position in a network can be quite powerful .
You get kudos by helping two unconnected people .
You can limit information flow and acquire credit when you take something from one group to another .
( This is the basis for some interesting work on creativity – creativity is when bridges connect information from disparate worlds . )
While some think that transparency is good , some hide their network to maintain power .
For example , if as a blogger , you provide “ cool links , ” you want others to read you , not the collection of people you read .
Of course , a reasonable counter argument is that this person is no longer needed as a bridge , but as a curator .
Still , some people hide so that they must be asked for recommendations directly and thus can control who they send people to .
( Note : this is a particular kind of power move ; transparency can also be a power move by through gifting . )
There are social consequences to linking structures and those who have a lot of eyes on them are probably more aware of the consequences of their linking habits .
This is another reason why people with a lot of eyes may get rid of blogrolls .
Having to negotiate lots of requests for links can be a real turn - off .
People will try to manipulate any ranking if there is an advantage to being up top .
Static measurement algorithms cause harm to the entire community that is being measured .
Web search engines know this , but it ’s equally critical for blog search .
These services are definitely measuring something but what they ’re measuring is what their algorithms are designed to do , not necessarily influence or prestige or anything else .
They ’re very effectively measuring the available link structure .
The difficulty is that there is nothing consistent whatsoever with that link structure .
There are disparate norms , varied uses of links and linking artifacts controlled by external sources ( like the hosting company ) .
There is power in defining the norms , but one should question whether or companies or collectives should define them .
By squishing everyone into the same rule set so that something can be measured , the people behind an algorithm are exerting authority and power , not of the collective , but of their biased view of what should be .
This is inherently why there ’s nothing neutral about an algorithm .
While i’ve been looking into the linking patterns , Mary Hodder has been thinking through new metrics for measurement .
These are very important but not because one is better than the other .
In fact , if we all switched to any of her metrics , we ’d have just as many biases as we have now .
And many of the Top blogs would try to figure out how to get rank in that system .
The significance lies in the ability to offer choice .
Of course , choice is difficulty .
Lots of people want to know what the “ best ” one is and do n’t want to think about the metrics behind it ( yes , these are the “ neutral ” people ) .
Unfortunately , many of those types have a lot of power that motivate people to want their attention .
The press want a list of the best and many bloggers want the attention of the press and thus want to be listed among the best .
Breaking this cycle is virtually impossible , but it how power maintains power .
And in our current system , we are doing a damn fine job of replicating the power structures that pervade everyday life under the auspices of creating a new system that usurps power .
Ah , what fun .
Still , i think it ’s critical to work on new metrics so that we can at least start showing alternate ways of organizing information if for no other reason than to push back against the conception of neutrality .
And thus , i’m stoked to help Mary out and i would encourage everyone else interested in altering the power structure to do so as well .
At the least , i do think we need to really think about what is at stake and what we ’re inadvertently supporting through our current systems .
Are these the power structures that we want to maintain ?
Because there ’s nothing neutral about our technological choices .
Note : these are patterns , not findings .
The methodology used here is not solid enough for findings .
I am not offering quantitative data because i want it to be clear that these are trends based on tracking patterns .
Think of them as guesstimated hypotheses ( and i’d be ecstatic if someone would compute them ) .

THE true story of how your wife 's stalker rang her to discuss killing you is n't supposed to provoke mirth .
But when John Morreall , of the College of William and Mary in Virginia , related the events last week to a group of scholars in Tuebingen in Germany , they were in stitches as he divulged the details of how his wife tried to dissuade the confused young man by pleading that her mortgage was too large to pay without her husband 's help .
So why did they laugh ?
Dr Morreall 's thesis is that laughter , incapacitating as it can be , is a convincing signal that the danger has passed .
The reaction of the psychologists , linguists , philosophers and professional clowns attending the Fifth International Summer School on Humour and Laughter illustrates his point .
Dr Morreall survived to tell the tale and so had an easy time making it sound funny .
One description of how laughter is provoked is the incongruity theory developed by Victor Raskin of Purdue University and Salvatore Attardo of Youngstown State University , both in America .
This theory says that all written jokes and many other humorous situations are based on an incongruity — something that is not quite right .
In many jokes , the teller sets up the story with this incongruity present and the punch line then resolves it , in a way people do not expect .
Alternatively , the very last words of the story may introduce the absurdity and leave the listeners with the task of reconciling it .
For instance , many people find it funny that a conference on humour could take place in Germany .
Why do people laugh at all ?
What is the point of it ?
Laughter is very contagious and this suggests that it may have become a part of human behaviour because it promotes social bonding .
When a group of people laughs , the message seems to be “ relax , you are among friends ” .
Indeed , humour is one way of dealing with the fact that humans are “ excrement - producing poets and imperfect lovers ” , says Appletree Rodden of the University of Tuebingen .
He sees religion and humour as different , and perhaps competing , ways for people to accept death and the general unsatisfactoriness of the world .
Perhaps that is why , as Dr Morreall calculates in a forthcoming article in the journal Humor , 95 % of the writings that he sampled from important Christian scholars through the centuries disapproved of humour , linking it to insincerity and idleness .
Fear of idleness is why many managers discourage laughter during office hours , Dr Morreall notes .
This is foolish , he claims .
Laughter or its absence may be the best clue a manager has about the work environment and the mood of employees .
Indeed , another theory of why people laugh — the superiority theory — says that people laugh to assert that they are on a level equal to or higher than those around them .
Research has shown that bosses tend to crack more jokes than do their employees .
Women laugh much more in the presence of men , and men generally tell more jokes in the presence of women .
Men have even been shown to laugh much more quietly around women , while laughing louder when in a group of men .
But laughter does not unite us all .
There are those who have a pathological fear that others will laugh at them .
Sufferers avoid situations where there will be laughter , which means most places where people meet .
Willibald Ruch of Zurich University surveyed 1,000 Germans and asked them whether they thought they were the butts of jokes and found that almost 10 % felt this way .
These people also tended to classify taped laughter as jeering .
Future research will focus on the hypothesis that there is something seriously wrong with their sense of humour .
Dr. Christoph Westphal , Sirtris ’s chief executive , replied to this objection with a question : “ Is it too good to be true that when you are young you get no disease ? ”
He believes that activation of the sirtuins is what keeps the body healthy in youth , but that these enzymes become less powerful with age , exposing the body to degenerative disease .
That is the process that he says is reversed by resveratrol and , he hopes , by the more powerful sirtuin - activator drugs that his company is developing , though many years of clinical trials will still be needed to demonstrate whether they work and are safe to use .
The developing buzz over sirtuin activators has captivated some scientists who do research on the aging process , several of whom are already taking resveratrol themselves .
Dr. Sinclair has said that he has been swallowing resveratrol capsules for three years , and that his parents and half his lab staff do the same .
So does Dr. Tomas Prolla at the University of Wisconsin .
“ The fact that investigators in the field are taking it is a good sign there is something there , ” he said .
But many others believe taking the drug now is premature , including Dr. Leonard Guarente of M.I.T. whose 15 - year study of the sirtuins laid the basis for the field of study .
It was after working in Dr. Guarente ’s lab as a postdoctoral student that Dr. Sinclair found in 2003 that resveratrol was a sirtuin activator .
Though resveratrol has long been known to be a component red wine and other foods , it is present there in only minuscule amounts , compared with the very large doses used in experiments .
Dr. Sinclair dosed his mice daily with 22 milligrams of resveratrol for each kilogram of weight , and Dr. Auwerx used up to 400 milligrams .
No one could drink enough red wine to obtain such doses .
Resveratrol is now available in capsules that contain extracts of red wine and giant knotweed , a plant found in China .
One manufacturer of such capsules is Longevinex , whose president , Bill Sardi , said today that demand for the product had increased by a factor of 2400 since Nov. 1 .
But even Longevinex ’s capsules , which at present contain 40 milligrams of resveratrol each , would have to be gulped in almost impossible quantities for a human to obtain doses equivalent to those used in mice .
“ It ’s like eating a whole bottle of Tums every day , ” Dr. Evans said .
Shu Ha Ri. What is Shu Ha Ri? Shu Ha Ri is a Japanese term , usually applied to martial arts training , to describe the stages in learning a skill .
The first word , " Shu " , means " to obey " .
The second word , " Ha " , means " to break free " .
The third word , " Ri " , means " to depart " .
These three words describe the three stages of learning .
When you are a novice , just starting out on a new skill , you need clear , precise , unambiguous instructions .
You do not understand the bigger picture or the intent for the instructions .
Any further background only confuses you .
You are at the " Shu " stage - " to obey " .
After a while , you begin to learn the instructions , and the question that comes up is " why ? " .
Why am I following these rules this way ?
What is the intent behind them ?
You slowly start to understand the context behind these rules .
At this point , you have broken free of the rules .
You are at the " Ha " stage - " to break free " .
Finally , you become an expert .
You not only know the rules and the reasons , but you are in a position to create your own rules .
You no longer follow the old rules , but follow your rules , crafted by you , just for you .
You are at the " Ri " stage - " to depart " .
In a fascinating experiment , expert airline pilots were asked to prepare rules for novice pilots .
The novice pilots followed the rules and had no problems with them .
However , when the expert pilots were then asked to follow their own rules , they found that their performance fell sharply .
This is because expert pilots do not usually fly planes the way described in the rules .
Expert pilots rely a lot on experience and intuition and often break the very rules that they had prescribed .
They use contextual decision making and rules leave very little room for this type of decision making .
However , had novice pilots been asked to perform without the rules , they would not have been able to , because they lacked the experience and intuition .
Rules are critical for novice pilots to fly a plane .
That is Shu Ha Ri .
What is good for the expert is often not so good for the novice and vice - versa .
This principle is particularly applicable to process , or software development process to be more precise , although it is equally applicable to any organizational process .
The great big battle about whether we need processes or not is missing the point completely .
Everyone follows a process in their head .
Even no process is a process .
The question is whether to follow a predefined process or an ad - hoc process where you just do whatever you are thinking of at that moment .
Let us apply the Shu - Ha - Ri principle at this point .
Are you a novice at managing projects ?
In that case you need a clear , unambiguous process .
If you have been in multiple project , then you need a less defined process , or apply your own process if you are an expert at project management .
These leave room for the contextual decision making we talked about earlier .
However , the reverse will simply not work .
Leaving novices without a process , or imposing a rigid process on an expert are both doomed to fail right from the start .
So the point to take away from this is that the way novices and experts perform the same task is very different , and the guidance that they require is also very different .
For all those grappling with the process question , think back again to Shu Ha Ri and see how it can help you .

Every once in a while the formerly libertarian Cato Institute lets loose with an analysis of the shape of libertarianism in the form of a voter profile : they did this some years back , you ’ll recall , with a study ( based on a Pew Center survey ) that showed a considerable portion of the voters belonging to loose designation known as “ enterprisers ” —
Americans who do n’t want to regulate what people do with their bodies , or put in their bodies , and do n’t cotton to government regulation of business , either .
Now they ’re back again , with a profile of “ The Libertarian Voter ” — but , in this era of war and “ weapons of mass destruction ” on every streetcorner , there is one curious omission , and I quote :
“ W eâ€™re omitting foreign policy issues from this analysis because they are not easily categorized in a yes - no , less government - more government dichotomies . ”
This is nonsense .
Aside from the question of how does a “ libertarian ” fund an effort to “ liberate ” Iraq — and , indeed , the entire Middle East — the whole issue of an ostensible libertarian endorsing mass murder by the state would seem to run head on into the issue of the non-aggression axiom , which — unlike , say , school vouchers — is essential to libertarianism properly understood .
Of course , the folks over at Cato have n’t understood libertarianism for quite some time now — as we pointed out here , here , and here , for starters — and so this latest outrage is hardly surprising .
It ought to give pause , though , that what many point to as the premier libertarian thinktank is not committed in principle to a noninterventionist foreign policy .
The next time our libertarian readers consider where their donations are going to go , they might factor this into their decision .
It ’s interesting that the authors of this Cato study , David Boaz and David Kirby , aver that endorsing gay marriage “ or civil unions ” is a defining characteristic of the libertarian voter , while opposition to a foreign policy of unremitting aggression is not .
Over in Cato - land , it ’s all so very subjective ….

Who are The Brights ?
We are participants in an international internet constituency of individuals .
All of us have a naturalistic worldview , free of supernatural or mystical elements .
A Bright 's ethics and actions are based on a naturalistic worldview .
The Brights aspire to an egalitarian civic vision .
We want citizens who have a naturalistic worldview to be accepted as full participants in civil society
Definitions :
A " super " ( noun ) is a person whose worldview includes supernatural and / or mystical elements .
A " bright " ( n. ) is a person whose worldview is naturalistic ( no supernatural and mystical elements ) .
A " Bright " is a bright who has registered at this website in support of the egalitarian civic vision of the Brights movement .
What is the Challenge ?
Currently , the naturalistic worldview is insufficiently expressed within most cultures - even politically and socially repressed .
To be a Bright is to participate in a movement to address the situation .
There is a great diversity of persons who have a naturalistic worldview .
Some are members of existing organizations that foster a supernatural - free perspective , but far more are not associated with any formal group or label .
Under the broad umbrella of the naturalistic worldview , participants in the constituency of Brights can undertake social and civic actions designed to influence a society otherwise permeated with supernaturalism .
This website registers brights into the constituency ( of Brights ) and serves as a communications hub for actions that align with the aims and principles of the Brights movement .
Featured Projects :
Support Our Vision
The Brights '
Net is entirely funded by personal donations of individuals from across the globe .
Most are brights .
But there are supers who also want to help advance the civic vision of the Brights movement .
Whether you are a bright or a super , if you would like to support this vision of civic equality for the citizens who have a naturalistic worldview , please consider becoming a " checkbook activist " by following this link :
Is Your Worldview Naturalistic ?
Think about your own worldview to decide if it is free of supernatural or mystical deities , forces , and entities .
If you decide that you fit the description above , then you are , by definition , a bright !
On this website , you can simply say so and , by doing so , join with brights from all over the world in an extraordinary initiative to elevate the thinking of society — the Brights movement .

I 'm Tired Of Saving !
by Michael Feathers
November 21 , 2005
Summary
Is n't it wonderful to complain about something minor ?
Something so nit picky < Ctrl - S > that most people would n't care about it ?
Well , here 's something in that vein . < Ctrl-S >
Advertisement
I recently downloaded Google Desktop and I really like it .
It gives you a sidebar with some very useful features .
You can have a continual weather feed , news , a rotating set of photographs .. the list goes on , but the thing I love the most is the Scratch Pad .
It 's just a simple pane of text that is always up .
I constantly write notes to myself and this pane just hovers there ready for inspection .
I can read it , I can type into it , and I never have to save !< Ctrl-S >
There .
I said it .
I 'm tired of saving .
Yes , we all have our story .. our story about how we first learned that we need to save frequently .
Mine involves losing a whole afternoon 's worth of work in a school computer lab because of a vacuum cleaner ..
Yes !
Someone vacuuming in a computer lab when people were working !
I can't imagine anyone vacuuming in while people are reading in a library but then there would be no power cords for the vacuum to knock out in a library , would there ?
Better to vacuum in a computer lab while people are working , right ?
So , I lost an entire afternoon 's work because of a vacuum cleaner , and because ..
I did n't save .
It 's a lesson that we all learn early < Ctrl - S > .
But still ...
I resent it a little , moreso now because I 've seen alternatives .
< Ctrl-S >
Jonathan Edwards has a very forward thinking programming environment called Subtext that he demoed at OOPSLA 2005 .
It has more interesting ideas than I can get into here , but one of them < Ctrl - S > is that the environment is active .
As you change a program it 's constantly executing and showing you the results on example values < Ctrl - S > you specify .
< Ctrl-S >
For anyone who has been doing Test Driven Development for a while , < Ctrl - S > the connection should be clear .
< Ctrl - S>Running our tests gives us immediate feedback .
It makes the feedback cycle very small and very tight .
When your editing actually triggers computation , you do n't have to do anything special to get feedback , it 's right there .
< Ctrl-S >
Personally , I think that this is the way things are going to go .
The trend is already there in most IDEs .
Nearly every IDE worth its download is active to some degree .
When you type , your IDE parses and colors keywords ; it prompts you with suggestions when you type a dot after an identifier .
So , why not do other things ?
Why not save automatically ?
Some IDEs will save automatically when you compile but why not continuously ?
I guess there are a couple of reasons why manual save has persisted .
One reason is because having a sandbox gives us a feeling of security .
And then , there 's the question of undo ..
Undoing character by character is tedious .
Manual save is like a single breadcrumb that we can leave behind us , it helps us get back to a known point .
But how often do we really use it ?
Maybe we 'd program better if we typed every keystroke like we meant it ? :-)
Fortunately , in programming environments we have something else we can use as breadcrumbs : successful test runs .
This is an idea quite a few people have investigated , but I want an environment like that in front of me .
I want an IDE with a switch that puts it into continuous save mode and triggers test execution on each keystroke .
< Ctrl - S >
If we want to undo , we can undo to each previous successful test execution .
That would be an undo that really means something .
David Saff has been doing research in an area he calls Continuous Testing for the past few years .
He 's built an Eclipse plugin which runs your tests continuously in the background but the tool still preserves a bi-modal environment .
You type in one mode and the tests run in another .
You have to save . < Ctrl -S >
He did some research with an earlier tool , one that tried to trigger execution on each keystroke but found that many users did n't want that much feedback , but I wonder .. is there more to this ?
Is the idea of an active environment flawed or do we need to find another way ?
Triggering tests on every keystroke would be great , but at this point , I wonder whether the ability to save manually really is useful .
Maybe it is just an evolutionary artifact .. an appendix we can just discard .
Do you think you would ever give up saving if an environment allowed you to ?< Ctrl-S >

THE DEBATE about Iraq has moved past the question of whether it was a mistake ( everybody knows it was ) to the more depressing question of whether it is possible to avert total disaster .
Every self - respecting foreign policy analyst has his own plan for Iraq .
The trouble is that these tracts are inevitably unconvincing , except when they argue why all the other plans would fail .
It ’s all terribly grim .
So allow me to propose the unthinkable : Maybe , just maybe , our best option is to restore Saddam Hussein to power .
Yes , I know .
Hussein is a psychotic mass murderer .
Under his rule , Iraqis were shot , tortured and lived in constant fear .
Bringing the dictator back would sound cruel if it were n’t for the fact that all those things are also happening now , probably on a wider scale .
At the outset of the war , I had no high hopes for Iraqi democracy , but I paid no attention to the possibility that the Iraqis would end up with a worse government than the one they had .
It turns out , however , that there is something more awful than totalitarianism , and that is endless chaos and civil war .

Nobody seems to foresee the possibility of restoring order to Iraq .
Here is the basic dilemma :
The government is run by Shiites , and the security agencies have been overrun by militias and death squads .
The government is strong enough to terrorize the Sunnis into rebellion but not strong enough to crush this rebellion .
Meanwhile , we have admirably directed our efforts into training a professional and nonsectarian Iraqi police force and encouraging reconciliation between Sunnis and Shiites .
But we have n’t succeeded .
We may be strong enough to stop large - scale warfare or genocide , but we ’re not strong enough to stop pervasive chaos .
Hussein , however , has a proven record in that department .
It may well be possible to reconstitute the Iraqi army and state bureaucracy we disbanded , and if so , that may be the only force capable of imposing order in Iraq .
Chaos and order each have a powerful self - sustaining logic .
When people perceive a lack of order , they act in ways that further the disorder .
If a Sunni believes that he is in danger of being killed by Shiites , he will throw his support to Sunni insurgents who he sees as the only force that can protect him .
The Sunni insurgents , in turn , will scare Shiites into supporting their own anti-Sunni militias .

And it ’s not just Iraqis who act this way .
You could find a smaller - scale version of this dynamic in an urban riot here in the United States .
But when there ’s an expectation of social order , people will act in a civilized fashion .
Restoring the expectation of order in Iraq will take some kind of large - scale psychological shock .
The Iraqi elections were expected to offer that shock , but they did n’t .
The return of Saddam Hussein -- a man every Iraqi knows , and whom many of them fear -- would do the trick .
The disadvantages of reinstalling Hussein are obvious , but consider some of the upside .
He would not allow the country to be dominated by Iran , which is the United States ’ major regional enemy , a sponsor of terrorism and an instigator of warfare between Lebanon and Israel .
Hussein was extremely difficult to deal with before the war , in large part because he apparently believed that he could defeat any U.S. invasion if it came to that .
Now he knows he can’t .
And he ’d probably be amenable because his alternative is death by hanging .
I know why restoring a brutal tyrant to power is a bad idea .
Somebody explain to me why it ’s worse than all the others .

Who Do We Work For ?
The FT Global 500 is pretty much what you see when you look up “ capitalistic orgy ” in the dictionary .
It ’s a compilation of the largest 500 mega - corporations in the world , as measured by the market .
So , when I picked up the print edition while overseas last month , I was frankly a bit surprised to see an openly soul - searching article entitled “ Fair shares ? ” by FT ’s management editor , Michael Skapinker .
It relates the concerns of those who criticize unbridled capitalism ;
Every time a company declines or disappears ( usually because another one acquires it ) , people suffer .
Employees lose their jobs .
Their lives and those of their families are disrupted .
Workplace friendships are ripped apart as staff are made redundant or forced into early retirement .
Pensioners who gave their working lives to the company are deprived of the satisfaction of knowing they helped to build something enduring .
Neighborhoods decline as factories , bank branches or shops close .
All this to satisfy the short - term whim of stock market investors .
Things get even more interesting when he turns his gaze onto how people respond to “ the way that companies put shareholder value above all other interests . ”
[ T ]he most impassioned attack came in an article by Sumantra Ghoshal of London Business School , published posthumously in the US Academy of Management ’s Learning & Education Journal earlier this year .
Ghoshal , who died in 2004 at the early age of 55 , argued that putting shareholders ’ needs first was based on the outdated notion that they were the risk - takers who made capitalism possible .
In fact , he said , shareholders took little risk .
If they were unhappy with the company ’s management , they could sell their shares .
The real risk - takers were company employees , he said .
For dissatisfied employees , moving jobs was much harder .
It was also more difficult for companies to recruit talented and committed workers than it was to find investors .
“ In every substantive sense , employees of a company carry more risks than do the shareholders , ” Ghoshal wrote .
“ Also , their contributions of knowledge , skills and entrepreneurship are typically more important than the contributions of capital by shareholders , a pure commodity that is perhaps in excess supply . ”
Wow ( emphasis mine ) ; that ’s one of the most thought - provoking things I ’ve read in some time .
Mind you , Ghoshal was a respected management guru , not a raving Marxist ; that said , his words could be the basis of another revolution .
Hungry for more , I Googled Ghoshal ’s manuscript , “ Bad Management Theories Are Destroying Good Management Practices . ” [ pdf ]
“ By propagating ideologically inspired amoral theories , business schools have actively freed their students from any sense of moral responsibility . ” — Sumantra Ghoshal
In a nutshell , Ghoshal argued that business schools have , for the past 30 + years , been preoccupied by two things , to little good result .
First , they have a need to have their work considered in the same favourable light that “ hard ” science is , by replacing ethics with “ a firm belief in causal determinism for explaining all aspects of corporate performance . ”
This is problematic , according to Ghoshal , because unlike in science , where the universe acts in much the same way no matter what you say about it , the object of the social sciences — people — will change based on what you think about them , either rising to the occasion or sinking as appropriate .
He calls this misapplication of the scientific method “ the pretense of knowledge . ”
The second theme is that of ideology of liberalism ( in the original economic , rather than subsequent social , sense ) , and no name pops up more in this context than Milton Friedman .
Ghoshal posits that they ’ve become focused on the negative aspects of business — i.e. , risks — while ignoring the positive ways that businesses and people interact .
He calls this “ the negative problem ” of an “ ideology - based gloomy vision ” , which has lead to phenomenon like the complete exclusion of social benefits from business planning , because it is “ irrational ” and considered an aberration in a free , open market .
Dismal science , indeed .
I ca n’t help but wonder how technology can be used to help put management back on track .
Right now , for example , investors can easily buy and sell the rights to a company ’s future revenues with the click of a mouse ; the price the market pays sends a signal to management about how they ’re doing .
It ’s a very coarse - grained signal , however ; it does n’t say whether the investors prefer a long - term approach , or are in it for a quick ride .
Since we have the technology to buy and sell so easily , can we not also have the ability to impart more information into the transaction ?
To tell the Board that we ’d prefer them to think beyond the next quarter ?
That maybe they ’re paying the executives too much ?
How hard would that be for NASDAQ or E*Trade to do ?
Introduction
90 % of the of the votes in The Netherlands are cast on the Nedap / Groenendaal ES3B voting computer .
With very minor modifications , the same computer is also being used in parts of Germany and France .
Use of this machine in Ireland is currently on hold after significant doubts were raised concerning its suitability for elections .
This website contains much of the raw information that was gathered during the research for the paper " Nedap / Groenendaal ES3B voting computer , a security analysis " .
It shows how we found out how it works , how we wrote software for it and how , when given brief access to the devices at any time before the election , we can gain complete and virtually undetectable control over election results .
It also shows how we discovered that radio emanations from an unmodified ES3B can be received at several meters distance and be used to tell who votes what .
We 've worked in secret for a while to make sure we actually had something to present and to be able to work without people breathing down our necks to get preliminary findings .
But now that it 's all in the open , reasearch into the inner working of the ES3B is not going to stop .
In fact , we invite everyone to take a look , verify what we found , and hopefully even tell us things we did n't find .

Introduction
The most monotonous entities in the known universe , forms , are a staple of every web programmer ’s balanced diet .
Whether we like them or not , forms are the gatekeepers to our site ’s goodies and often their design alone determines whether a user will try what you ’re selling or simply walk away .
Without pomp or circumstance , here are ten tips to transform your plain vanilla into double chocolate chunk with marshmallows .
The Code
The code examples below will not work “ as is . ”
They are dependant on an external library , prototype.js with addEvent included .
Additionally , the functions below need to be attached to events , such as onclick or onmouseover .
Check back for a downloadable example file .
1. Remember Your Markup
We ’ve notice a lot of people forgetting to use the tools that are already made accessible to them by the very medium that they work in .
And so we ’ve highlighted a few HTML elements below that are made especially for forms .
Just to refreshen the ol’ web noggin .
Label
A label is used to attach information to a control .
If you focus on a label , its associated control will gain focus .
This is useful when a user clicks on a label name and the associated field gains focus .
< label for =" email " > Email : </ label > < input type =" text " id =" email " >
or
< label > Email : < input type =" text " id =" email " ></ label >
Fieldset
“ The FIELDSET element allows authors to group thematically related controls and labels .
Grouping controls makes it easier for users to understand their purpose while simultaneously facilitating tabbing navigation for visual user agents and speech navigation for speech - oriented user agents .
The proper use of this element makes documents more accessible . ”
W3C Recommendation
Legend
“ The LEGEND element allows authors to assign a caption to a FIELDSET .
The legend improves accessibility when the FIELDSET is rendered non-visually . ”
W3C Recommendation
Tabindex
“ This attribute specifies the position of the current element in the tabbing order for the current document .
This value must be a number between 0 and 32767 .
User agents should ignore leading zeros .
The tabbing order defines the order in which elements will receive focus when navigated by the user via the keyboard .
The tabbing order may include elements nested within other elements . ”
W3C Recommendation
Accesskey
“ This attribute assigns an access key to an element .
An access key is a single character from the document character set .
Note .
Authors should consider the input method of the expected reader when specifying an accesskey . ”
W3C Recommendation
Password
By adding type= ” password ” to your input field , characters entered will be transformed into a series of asterisks .
“ Application designers should note that this mechanism affords only light security protection .
Although the password is masked by user agents from casual observers , it is transmitted to the server in clear text , and may be read by anyone with low - level access to the network . ”
W3C Recommendation
2. CSS
This is n’t new , but CSS can turn your eye sore of a form into something negative fugly .
There is no need to reinvent the wheel here , so check out the following sources on enhancing your form with some CSS and a little Javascript .
Style Those Buttons - The Man In Blue shows us how to make those buttons not look so cheap .
Niceforms - Niceforms does a great job of turning that ugly form into something much more tolerable using a little CSS action .
Hide Optional Fields -
In this example , a little CSS and Javascript is used to make a form better looking and more usable .
CSS Forms - Jeff
Howdens shows us how to create a well layed out and styled form without using tables .
3. AutoTab
When navigating through a form , the user traditionally presses the tab button in order to advance to the next form control .
This AutoTab function automatically sets the focus to the next control after the control ’s maxlength is reached .
This allows for the user to no longer manually tab through fields with a maxlength .
This function is particularly useful for fields such as social security or phone numbers containing a character limit for each input field .
For example , after a user enters the area code of a phone number , the form automatically tabs to the next input box allowing the user to continue entering their phone number without interruption .
To flag an input element to be autotabbed , you only need to include three things in your markup : tabindex , className of autoTab and maxlength .
< input type =" text " name= " areacode " class= " autoTab " tabindex = " 1 " maxlength = " 3 " />
On page load , it ’ll attach the events to input fields for autotabbing .
If a field has a maxlength and that maximum is reached , the focus is automatically set to the control with the next highest tabindex value .
Here ’s a quick look at our function , autoTab ( ) :
function autoTab(e ) { if ( this.value.length == this.getAttribute (" maxlength " ) && e.KeyCode != 8 && e.keyCode != 16 && e.keyCode != 9 ) { new Field.activate(findNextElement(this.getAttribute ( " tabindex " ) ) ) ; } }function findNextElement ( index ) { elements = new Form.getElements (' shippingInfo' ) ; for( i = 0 ; i < elements.length ; i++) { element = elements [ i ] ; if ( parseInt( element.getAttribute ( " tabindex " ) ) == ( parseInt ( index ) + 1 ) ) { return element ; } } return elements [ 0 ] ; }
Two things worth noting :
You could also use input. form [ ( getIndex ( input ) +1 ) ] . focus ( ) , but that causes a weird javascript error when using Firefox .
An example of this can be seen at The Javascript Source .
When a user presses shift - tab , the previous element should still get focus , and autotab with automatically disable .
4. Field Information
It ’s always good policy to provide information describing a field ’s requirements and restrictions .
How else is the user going to know a password must have 3 capital letters , an exclamation point and be somewhere between 6 and 17 characters long ?
Inspired by the forms used over at Tangent , we came up with some additional suggestions .
Store all related information in a fields label tag .
You can place a className of required , an accesskey , and a descriptive title in there , so that all information is in one place .
This makes it easier to roganize , and easier for JavaScript to pull from .
We choose to use onfocus instead of onmouseover when displaying information to the user .
While mostly personal preference , it is still nice to know that the proper information will be displayed on the field with focus rather than where the mouse is .
It is easier to give labels an id similar to the field they related to .
For example , if a field is named fname , call the label lfname .
It makes things much easier on the JavaScript side to pull information .
You can see the labels title being accessed below : p = document.createElement ( " p " ) ; p.innerHTML = $ ( " l " + this.id) .title ; span.appendChild(p ) ;
5. Error Displays
When a user makes a mistake , it ’s your duty to show them errors quickly and efficiently .
Here are some ideas to make your forms display errors better :
Do n’t just show the user one error .
If they left 3 required fields blank , make sure that you tell them they have three errors , this way they can correct them all in one fell swoop .
Provide as much information to the user beforehand as possible .
Examples of this would be marking a field as required , or explaning the minimum password length ( See # 2 above ) .
Be aware of the three validation options at your disposal : 1 ) you can give responsive feedback straight from the JavaScript .
The user benefits from instant feedback , but you will have to duplicate your validation functions on the client and server .
2 ) You can provide Degradable Ajax Validation that gets rid of the duplicated code , but increases the server load .
3 ) You may validate only on form submit which leaves you with no duplicated code , no additional server load , and unfortunately , no instant feedback .
Put some effort into the display of your error messages .
Make them bold , noticable , and throw in a bit of creativity .
It is also best to stick with colors that the user is comfortable with : red for errors , yellow for warnings , green for success .
Obviously you can switch those up based on your evaluation , but going to far and making an error message pink could cause some confusion .
6. Postbacks
There is nothing worse than filling out a form , encountering an error , and having to retype all of your information all over again .
In order to save your users from needless frustration , we need to ensure that all data is preserved .
This means if there is an error , the fields should be repopulated .
If we have a multistep form , back and forward navigation should also keep the form populated .
A common approach is to set a form ’s action to it ’s current URL .
That way , you can read in the form value and populate the fields immediately if there is an error .
For example , just set the value to the post :
< input type =" text " name = " fname " value= " <?=$ _POST [ " fname " ] ? > " />
And the field will be populated .
If there is no error , just redirect the page to the form completion page .
7. onFocus
Visual cues , such as changing a field ’s border color , help show the user which field has focus .
CSS provides an easy solution for adding borders with the border selector , but this feature is n’t currently supported in IE and does n’t work at all with select elements .
Our solution creates custom borders and backgrouds by adding a span to each form element using a little J - Juice .
The concept here is that by enclosing our form element within a span , we can produce a unique effect .
Do n’t worry , you do n’t need to hand code the span — this unobtrusive JavaScript function will dynamically add and remove it automatically .
The nice part is that the span can have background images , borders and any other desired combination of the two to create an effect that will work on text , textarea , and select elements .
Here is how everything looks when it is done :
< span class = " focus " > < input type =" text " id =" fname " name = " fname " /> </span>function showFocus ( ) { this.parentNode.className = " focusHover " ; function hideFocus ( ) { this.parentNode.className = " focus " ; }
The reason a state is needed for the span when the field does not have focus is to prevent shifting of the page .
For example , if our custom span has 3 pixels of padding onfocus , we need 3 pixels of transparent padding when there is no focus , so that we do not see form elements “ jumping ” as the user navigates them .
8. Label Click
When a label receives focus , whether it be through onclick or through accessKeys , the associated element specified in the labels for attribute should receive focus also .
When a LABEL element receives focus , it passes the focus on to its associated control .
W3C Recommendation
Unfortunately , this is not guaranteed in all browsers .
To remedy the situation , a simple JavaScript function will do the trick :
function initLabels ( ) { labels = document.getElementsByTagName( " label " ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < labels.length ; i++) { add Event ( labels [i ] , " click " , labelFocus ) ; } }function labelFocus ( ) { new Field.focus( this.getAttribute ( ' for ' ) ) ; }
9. Double Submit
Nooo !
Our user has submitted the form twice , probably because the site did not respond fast enough .
Not only will the data be processed twice , but the last submission will be the active submission which often will provide errors that will confuse the user even more .
Three things to keep in mind for this situation :
If JavaScript is enabled , use it to submit the form .
After one submission , disable the button .
If JavaScript is not enabled , provide your users with a clear message asking them not to submit critical data more than once .
Do what you can on the server to prevent the processing duplicate information .
Track payments , accounts , etc and flag them when an action has occured .
This way , the second round of processing will just be ignored .
10 . Leftovers
And we ’re going to close this off by highlighting some awesome links to some features people have already implemented , or could implement .
You may not need them in your particular situation , but they ’re definitely lifesavers when you do .
Mini Calendar -
Whenever there is a date field , it is always best to provide a popup calendar .
Ideally , this calendar will not open in a new window , and will be responsive .
To get started , Dynarch has the best solution .
Combo boxes -
The element that missed the HTML cut is the half select , half text input breed known as the combo box .
This concept allows the user to type in their own option if they can’t find what they ’re looking for in the drop down .
Take a look at Upgrade Your Select Element to a Combo Box to see how we approached a solution .
Visual Maps -
Just like the popup calendar , popup maps can also be effective .
Take a look at Orbitz , and click on airport code .
That takes you to a text listing of all airports .
This could easily be a dynamic in page popup that displays a clickable map , which in turn popualtes the field when clicked .
These are some ideas to get you started .
Please let us know if you have more to add to the list .
Clarification of erroneous news reports indicating WHO genetic research on hair colour
1 October 2002 - In response to recent media reports citing an alleged World Health Organization ( WHO ) study predicting the extinction of the naturally blonde hair gene , WHO wishes to clarify that it has never conducted research on this subject .
Nor , to the best of its knowledge , has WHO issued a report predicting that natural blondes are likely to be extinct by 2202  .
WHO has no knowledge of how these news reports originated but would like to stress that we have no opinion on the future existence of blondes .
Rake is a build language , similar in purpose to make and ant .
Like make and ant it's a Domain Specific Language , unlike those two it's an internal DSL programmed in the Ruby language .
In this article I introduce rake and describe some interesting things that came out of my use of rake to build this web site : dependency models , synthesized tasks , custom build routines and debugging the build script .
I 've been using Ruby extensively now for many years .
I like its terse but powerful syntax , and its generally well - written libraries .
A couple of years ago I converted much of my web site generation from XSLT to Ruby and have been utterly happy with that change .
If you are a regular reader of mine , you 'll not be surprised to know that my entire web site is built automatically .
I originally used ant - the build environment popular in the Java world - to do this as that fitted well with Java XSL processors .
As I 've been using Ruby more I 've made more use of Rake , a build language based on Ruby developed by Jim Weirich .
Recently I completely replaced the build process removing all the ant in favor of Rake .
In my early days with Rake , I used it in a similar way to how I 'd used ant .
In this push , however , I tried to do things differently to explore some of the interesting features of Rake .
As a result I thought I 'd write this article to delve into some of these areas .
Rake is my third build language .
I used make many years ago ( and have forgotten much of it ) .
I 've used ant quite a lot in the last six years or so .
Rake has many features that these languages have , and a few more that are ( to me ) new twists .
Although Rake is written in Ruby and heavily uses the language , you can use it for any automated build processing .
For simple build scripts you do n't need to know Ruby , but as soon as things start getting more interesting then you need to know Ruby to get Rake to do its best things .
This is a somewhat skewed story .
I 'm not trying to write a tutorial on Rake - I 'm going to concentrate on things I find interesting rather than give a complete coverage .
I 'm not going to assume you know Ruby , Rake , or indeed any other build language .
I 'll explain relevant bits of Ruby as I go along .
Hopefully if you 've done any messing with these , or are just interested in different computational models , you 'll find this worth a diverting read .
Dependency Based Programming Hang on - in the preceding paragraph I said " different computational models " .
Is n't that rather a grand phrase for a build language ?
Well no , it is n't .
All the build languages I 've used ( make , ant ( Nant ) , and rake ) use a dependency based style of computation rather than the usual imperative style .
That leads us to think differently about how to program them .
It does n't strike most people that way as most build scripts are pretty short , but it 's actually quite a profound difference .
It 's time for an example .
Let 's imagine we want to write a program to build a project .
We have several different steps to this build .
CodeGen : take data configuration files and use them to generate the database structure and the code to access the database .
Compile : compile the application code .
DataLoad : load test data into the database .
Test : run the tests .
We need to be able to run any of these tasks independently and ensure everything works .
We can't test until we do all the previous steps .
Compile and DataLoad need CodeGen run first .
How do we express these rules ?
If we do it in imperative style , it looks like this making each task a ruby procedure .
# this is comment in ruby def codeGen #def introduces a procedure or method # do code gen stuff end def compile codeGen # do compile stuff end def dataLoad codeGen # do data load stuff end def test compile dataLoad #run tests end Notice there 's a problem with this .
If I call test I execute the codeGen step twice .
This wo n't cause an error because the codeGen step is ( I assume ) idempotent - that is calling it multiple times is no different to calling it once .
But it will take time , and builds are rarely things that have time to spare .
To fix this I could separate the steps into public and internal parts like this def compile codeGen doCompile end def doCompile # do the compile end def dataLoad codeGen doDataLoad end def doDataLoad # do the data load stuff end def test codeGen doCompile doDataLoad #run the tests end This works , but it 's a little messy .
It 's also a perfect example of how a dependency based system can help .
With an imperative model , each routine calls the steps in the routine .
In a dependency based system we have tasks and specify pre-requisites ( their dependencies ) .
When you call a task , it looks to see what pre-requisites there are and then arranges to call each pre-requisite task once .
So our simple example would look like this .
task : codeGen do # do the code generation end task : compile => : codeGen do # do the compilation end task : dataLoad => : codeGen do # load the test data end task : test => [ : compile , : dataLoad ] do # run the tests end ( Hopefully you can get a sense of what this says , I 'll explain the syntax properly in a moment . )
Now if I call compile , the system looks at the compile task and sees it 's dependent upon the codeGen task .
It then looks at the codeGen task and sees no pre-requisites .
As a result it runs codeGen followed by compile .
This is the same as the imperative situation .
The interesting case , of course , is the test .
Here the system sees that both compile and dataLoad are dependent on codeGen so it arranges the tasks so codeGen runs first , followed by compile and dataload ( in any order ) and finally test .
Essentially the actual order of the tasks run is figured out at run time by the execution engine , not decided at design time by the programmer who writes the build script .
This dependency based computational model fits a build process really well , which is why all three use it .
It 's natural to think of a build in terms of tasks and dependencies , most steps in a build are idempotent , and we really do n't want unnecessary work to slow down the build .
I suspect that few people that knock up a build script realize they are programming in a funky computational model , but that 's what it is .
Domain Specific Language for Builds
All my three build languages share another characteristic - they are all examples of a Domain Specific Language ( DSL ) .
However they are different kinds of DSL .
In the terminology I 've used before : make is an external DSL using a custom syntax
ant ( and nant ) is an external DSL using an XML based syntax
rake is an internal DSL using Ruby .
The fact that rake is an internal DSL for a general purpose language is a very important difference between it and the other two .
It essentially allows me to use the full power of ruby any time I need it , at the cost of having to do a few odd looking things to ensure the rake scripts are valid ruby .
Since ruby is a unobtrusive language , there 's not much in the way of syntactic oddities .
Furthermore since ruby is a full blown language , I do n't need to drop out of the DSL to do interesting things - which has been a regular frustration using make and ant .
Indeed I 've come to view that a build language is really ideally suited to an internal DSL because you do need that full language power just often enough to make it worthwhile - and you do n't get many non-programmers writing build scripts .
Rake Tasks
Rake defines two kinds of task .
Regular tasks are similar to tasks in ant , and file tasks are similar to tasks in make .
If either of those mean nothing to you , do n't worry , I 'm about to explain .
Regular tasks are the simplest to explain .
Here 's one from one of my build scripts for my testing environment .
task : build_refact => [ : clean ] do target = SITE_DIR + ' refact / ' mkdir_p target , QUIET require ' refactoringHome '
OutputCapturer.new.run {run_refactoring} end
The first line defines much of the task .
In this language task is effectively a keyword that introduces a task definition .
: build_refact is the name of the task .
The syntax for naming it is a little funky in that we need to start it with a colon , one of the consequences of being an internal DSL .
After the name of the task we then move onto the pre-requisites .
Here there 's just the one , : clean .
The syntax is => [ : clean ] .
We can list multiple dependencies inside the square brackets separated by commas .
From the much earlier examples you can see that we do n't need the square brackets if there 's only one task .
We do n't need the dependencies at all if there are n't any ( or indeed for other reasons - there 's a fascinating topic in there that I 'll get to later ) .
To define the body of the task we write ruby code within do and end .
Inside this block we can put any valid ruby we like - I wo n't bother explaining this code here , as you do n't need to understand it to see how tasks work .
The nice thing about a rake script ( or rakefile as rubyists call it ) is you can read this pretty clearly as a build script .
If we were to write the equivalent in ant it would look something like this : < target name = " build_refact " depends = " clean " > <-- define the task --> </ target >
Now you can look at this as a DSL and follow it , but since it's an internal DSL you may be interested in how this works as valid ruby .
In reality task is n't a keyword , it 's a routine call .
It takes two arguments .
The first argument is a hash ( the equivalent of a map or dictionary ) .
Ruby has a special syntax for hashes .
In general the syntax is { key1 => value1 , key2 => value2} .
However the curly brackets are optional if there 's only one hash , so you do n't need them while defining the rake task , which helps to simplify the DSL .
So what are the key and the value ?
The key here is a symbol - identified in ruby by the leading colon .
You can use other literals , we 'll see strings shortly , and you can use variables and constants too - which we 'll discover to be rather handy .
The value is an array - which is really the equivalent of a list in other languages .
Here we list the names of the other tasks .
If we do n't use the square brackets we just have one value instead of a list - rake copes with an array or a single literal - very accommodating of it , I must say .
So where 's the second argument ?
It 's what lies between do and end - a block - ruby 's word for a Closure .
So as the rake file runs it builds up an object graph of these task objects , connected to each other through the dependency links and each having a block to execute when the right time comes .
Once all the tasks are created the rake system can then use the dependency links to figure out which tasks need to be run in what order and then it does that , calling the blocks for each task in the appropriate order .
A key property of closures is that they do n't need to be executed when they are evaluated , they can be saved for later - even if they refer to variables that are n't in scope when the block is actually executed .
The thing here is that what we are seeing is legal ruby code , admittedly arranged in a very odd way .
But this odd way allows us to have to have a pretty readable DSL .
Ruby also helps by having a very minimal syntax - even little things like not needing parentheses for procedure arguments helps this DSL stay compact .
Closures are also vital - as they often are in writing internal DSLs , because they allow us to package code in alternative control structures .
File Tasks
The tasks I talked about above are similar to tasks in ant .
Rake also supports a slightly different kind of task called a file task which is closer to the notion of tasks in make .
Here 's another example , slightly simplified , from my web site rakefile .
file ' build/dev/rake.html ' => ' dev/rake.xml ' do |t| require ' paper ' maker = PaperMaker.new t.prerequisites[0 ] , t.name maker.run end With a file you are referring to actual files rather than task names .
So ' build/dev/rake.html ' and ' dev/ rake.xml ' are actual files .
The html file is the output of this task and the xml file is the input .
You can think of a file task as telling the build system how to make the output file - indeed this is exactly the notion in make - you list the output files you want and tell make how to make them .
An important part of the file task is that it 's not run unless you need to run it .
The build system looks at the files and only runs the task if the output file does not exist or its modification date is earlier than the input file .
File tasks therefore work extremely well when you 're thinking of things at a file by file basis .
One thing that 's different with this task is that we pass the task object itself as a parameter into the closure - that 's what the |t| is doing .
We can now refer to the task object in the closure and call methods on it .
I do this to avoid duplicating the names of the files .
I can get the name of the task ( which is the output file ) with t.name .
Similarly I can get the list of prerequisites with t.prerequisites .
Ant has no equivalent to file tasks , instead each task does the same kind of necessity checking itself .
The XSLT transform task takes an input file , style file and output file and only runs the transform if the output file does n't exist or is older than any of the input files .
This is just a question of where to place the responsibility of this checking - either in the build system or in the tasks .
Ant mostly uses canned tasks written in java , make and rake both rely on the build writer to write code for the task .
So it makes more sense to relieve the writer of the task of the need to check if things are up to date .
However it 's actually pretty easy to do the up to date checks in the rake tasks .
This is what it would look like .
task : rakeArticle do src = ' dev/rake.xml ' target = ' build/dev/rake.html ' unless uptodate ?( target , src ) require ' paper ' maker = PaperMaker.new src , target maker.run end end Rake provides ( via the fileutils package ) a bevy of simple unix - like commands for file operations such as cp , mv , rm , etc .
It also provides uptodate ?
which is perfect for these kinds of checks .
So here we see two ways of doing things .
We can either use file tasks or regular tasks with uptodate ?
in order to decide whether to do things - which should we choose ?
I must admit I do n't have a good answer to this question .
Both tactics seem to work pretty well .
What I decided to do with my new rakefile was to push fine - grained file tasks as far as I could .
I did n't do this because I knew it was the best thing to do , I did it mainly to see how it would turn out .
Often when you come across something new it can be a good idea to overuse it in order to find out its boundaries .
This is a quite reasonable learning strategy .
It 's also why people always tend to overuse new technologies or techniques in the early days .
People often criticize this but it's a natural part of learning .
If you do n't push something beyond its boundary of usefulness how do you find where that boundary is ?
The important thing is to do so in a relatively controlled environment so you can fix things when you find the boundary .
( After all , until we tried it I thought XML would be a good syntax for build files . )
I 'll also say now that so far I 've not found any problems with pushing file tasks and fine - grained tasks too far .
I may think otherwise in a year or two 's time , but so far I 'm happy .
Defining Dependencies Backwards
So far I 've mostly talked about how rake does similar things to what you find in ant and make .
That 's a nice combination - combine both capabilities with the full power of ruby on tap - but that alone would n't give me too much of a reason for this little article .
The thing that got my interest was some particular things that rake does ( and allows ) that are a bit different .
The first of these is allowing to specify dependencies in multiple places .
In ant you define dependencies by stating them as part of the dependent task .
I 've done this with my rake examples so far as well , like this .
task : second => : first do #second 's body end task : first do # first 's body end Rake ( like make ) allows you to add dependencies to a task after you 've initially declared it .
Indeed it allows you to continue to talk about a task in multiple places .
This way I can decide to add dependencies close to the pre-requisite task , like this .
task : second do # second 's body end task : first do # first 's body end task : second => : first
This does n't make much difference when the tasks are right next to each other in the build file , but in longer build files it does add a new bit of flexibility .
Essentially it allows you to think about dependencies either in the usual way , or add them when you add the pre-requisite tasks , or indeed put them in a third location independent of both .
As usual this flexibility gives new questions , where is it best to define dependencies ?
I do n't have a certain answer yet , but in my build file I used two rules of thumb .
When I was thinking about one task that needed to be done before I could do another , I defined the dependency when I was writing the dependent task , in the conventional way .
However I often used dependencies to group together related tasks , such as the various errata pages .
When using dependencies for grouping ( a common part of structuring build files ) it seemed to make sense to put the dependency by the pre-requisite task .
task : main => [ : errata , :articles ] #many lines of build code file ' build/eaaErrata.html ' => ' eaaErrata.xml ' do # build logic end task : errata => ' build/eaaErrata.html '
I do n't actually have to define the : errata task with a task keyword , just putting it as a dependency for : main is enough to define the task .
I can then add individual errata files later on and add each to the group task .
For this kind of group behavior this seems a reasonable way to go ( although I do n't actually do it quite like this in my build file , as we 'll see later . )
One question that this raises is ' how do we find all the dependencies when they are spread out all over the build file ? '
It 's a good question but the answer is to get rake to tell you , which you can do with rake - P , which prints out every task with its pre-requisites .
Synthesizing Tasks
Allowing you to add dependencies after you 've defined a task , together with having full ruby available to you , introduces some further tricks to the build .
Before I explain about synthesized tasks , however , I need to introduce some important principles about build processes .
Build scripts tend to have to do two kinds of build - clean builds and incremental builds .
A clean build occurs when your output area is empty , in this case you build everything from its ( version controlled ) sources .
This is the most important thing the build file can do and the number one priority is to have a correct clean build .
Clean builds are important , but they do take time .
So often it 's useful to do incremental builds .
Here you already have stuff in your output directories .
An incremental build needs to figure out how to get your output directories up to date with the latest sources with the minimal amount of work .
There are two errors that can occur here .
First ( and most serious ) is a missing rebuild - meaning that some items that should have got built did n't .
That 's very bad because it results in output that does n't really match the input ( in particular the result of a clean build on the input ) .
The lesser error is an unnecessary rebuild - this builds an output element that did n't need to be built .
This is a less serious error as it's not a correctness error , but it is a problem because it adds time to the incremental build .
As well as time it adds confusion - when I run my rake script I expect to see only things that have changed get built , otherwise I wonder " why did that change ? "
Much of the point of arranging a good dependency structure is to ensure that incremental builds work well .
I want to do an incremental build of my site just by going ' rake ' - invoking the default task .
I want that to build only what I want to .
So that 's my need , an interesting problem is to get that to work for my bliki .
The sources for my bliki is a whole bunch of xml files in my bliki directory .
The output is one output file for each entry , plus several summary pages - of which the main bliki page is the most important .
What I need is for any change to a source file to re-trigger the bliki build .
I could do this by naming all the files like this .
BLIKI = build ( ' bliki/index.html ' ) file BLIKI => [ ' bliki/SoftwareDevelopmentAttitude.xml ' , ' bliki/SpecificationByExample.xml ' , #etc etc ] do #logic to build the bliki end def build relative_path # allows me to avoid duplicating the build location in the build file return File. join ( ' build ' , relative_path ) end But clearly this would be dreadfully tedious , and just asking for me to forget to add a new file to the list when I want to add one .
Fortunately I can do it this way .
BLIKI = build ( 'bliki/index.html ' ) FileList [' bliki/*.xml '] . each do |src| file BLIKI => src end file BLIKI do #code to build the bliki end FileList is part of rake , it will generate lists of files based on the glob that 's passed in - here it creates a list of all the files in the bliki source directory .
The each method is an internal iterator that allows me to loop through them and add each one as a dependent to the file task .
( The each method is a collection closure method . )
One other thing I do with the bliki task is add a symbolic task for it .
desc " build the bliki " task : bliki => BLIKI
I do this so I can just build the bliki alone with rake bliki .
I 'm not sure I really need this any more .
If all the dependencies are set up properly ( as they are now ) I can just do a default rake and there 's no unnecessary rebuild .
But I 've kept it in for the moment .
The desc method allows you to define a short description to the following task , this way when I run rake -T I get a list of any tasks with a desc defined for them .
This is a useful way of seeing what targets are available to me .
If you 've used make before , you may be thinking that this is reminiscent of one of make 's greatest features - the ability to specify pattern rules to automatically make certain kinds of file .
The common example is that you want build any foo .o file by running the C compiler on the corresponding foo .c file .
%.o : %.c gcc $< -o $@ The %.c will match every file that ends with '.c '. $< refers to the source ( pre-requisite ) and $@ to the target of the rule .
This pattern rule means that you do n't have to list every file in your project with the compile rule , instead the pattern rule tells make how to build any *.o file it needs .
( And indeed you do n't even need this in your make file as make comes packaged with many pattern rules like this . )
Rake actually has a similar mechanism .
I 'm not going to talk about it , other than to mention it exists , because I have n't yet found I needed it .
Synthesizing tasks worked for all I needed .
Block Scoping Tasks
One of the problems I found with using file names and dependencies is that you have to repeat the file names .
Take this example .
file ' build/articles/mocksArentStubs.html ' => ' articles/mock/mocksArentStubs.xml ' do |t| transform t.prerequisites [ 0 ] , t.name end task : articles => ' build/articles/mocksArentStubs.html '
In the above example ' build/articles/mocksArentStubs.html ' is mentioned twice in the code .
I can avoid repeating in the action block by using the task object , but I have to repeat it to set up the dependency to the overall articles task .
I do n't like that repetition because it 's asking for trouble if I change my file name .
I need a way to define it once .
I could just declare a constant , but then I 'm declaring a constant that 's visible everywhere in my rakefile when I 'm only using it in this section .
I like variable scopes to be as small as possible .
I can deal with this by using the FileList class that I mentioned above , but this time I use it with only a single file .
FileList [ ' articles/mock/mocksArentStubs.xml'].each do |src| target = File.join( BUILD_DIR + ' articles ' , ' mocksArentStubs.html ' ) file target => src do transform src , target end task : articles => target end
This way I define src and target variables that are only scoped within this block of code .
Notice that this only helps me if I define the dependency from the :articles task here .
If I want to define the dependency in the definition of the :articles task , I would need a constant so I get the visibility across the whole rakefile .
When Jim Weirich read a draft of this he pointed out that if you find the FileList statement too wordy , you can easily define a method specifically to do this : def with ( value ) yield ( value ) end and then do with ( ' articles/mock/mocksArentStubs.xml' ) do |src| # whatever end
Build Methods
One of the really great things about having a build language be an internal DSL to a full programming language is that I can write routines to handle common cases .
Sub -routines are one of the most elementary ways of structuring a program , and the lack of convenient sub - routine mechanisms is one of the great problems of ant and make - particularly as you get more complex builds .
Here 's an example of such a common build routine I used - this is to use an XSLT processor to convert an XML file into HTML .
All my newer writing uses ruby to do this translation , but I have a lot of older XSLT stuff around and I do n't see any rush to change it .
After writing various tasks to process XSLT I soon saw that there was some duplication , so I defined a routine for the job .
def xslTask src , relativeTargetDir , taskSymbol , style targetDir = build ( relativeTargetDir ) target = File.join( targetDir , File.basename(src , '.xml ' ) + '. html ' ) task taskSymbol => target file target => [ src ] do |t| mkdir_p targetDir , QUIET XmlTool.new.transform(t.prerequisites [0 ] , t.name , style ) end end
The first two lines figure out the target directory and the target file .
Then I add the target file as a dependent to the supplied task symbol .
Then I create a new file task with instructions to create the target directory ( if needed ) and use my XmlTool to carry out the XSLT transform .
Now when I want to create an XSLT task I just call this method .
xslTask ' eaaErrata.xml ' , '. ' , : errata , ' eaaErrata.xsl '
This method nicely encapsulates all the common code and parametrizes the variables for my needs at the moment .
I found it really helpful to pass in the parent group task into the routine so that the routine would easily build the dependency for me - another advantage of the flexible way of specifying dependencies .
I have a similar common task for copying files directly from source to the build directories , which I use for images , pdfs etc. def copyTask srcGlob , targetDirSuffix , taskSymbol targetDir = File.join BUILD_DIR , targetDirSuffix mkdir_p targetDir , QUIET FileList[srcGlob ].each do |f| target = File.join targetDir , File.basename( f ) file target => [ f ] do |t| cp f , target end task taskSymbol => target end end The copyTask is a bit more sophisticated because it allows me to specify a glob of files to copy , this allows me to copy stuff like this : copyTask ' articles /*.gif ' , ' articles ' , :articles
This copies all gif files in the articles sub - directory of my sources into the articles directory of my build directory .
It makes a separate file task for each one and makes them all dependents of the :articles task .
Platform Dependent XML Processing
When I used ant to build my site , I used java based XSLT processors .
As I started to use rake I decided to switch to native XSLT processors .
I use both Windows and Unix ( Debian and MacOS ) systems , both of which have XSLT processors easily available .
Of course they are different processors and I need to invoke them differently - but of course I want this to be hidden to the rakefile and certainly to me when I invoke rake .
Here again is the nice thing about having a full blown language to work with directly .
I can easily write an Xml processor that uses platform information to do the right thing .
I start with the interface part of my tool - the XmlTool class .
class XmlTool def self .
new return XmlToolWindows.new if windows ?
return XmlToolUnix.new end def self .
windows ?
return RUBY_PLATFORM
=~ /win32/i end end
In ruby you create an object by calling the new method on the class .
The great thing about this , as opposed to tyrannical constructors , is that you can override this new method - even to the point of returning an object of a different class .
So in this case when I invoke XmlTool.new I do n't get an instance of XmlTool - instead I get the right kind of tool for whatever platform I 'm running the script on .
The simplest of the two tools is the Unix version .
class XmlToolUnix def transform infile , outfile , stylefile cmd = " xsltproc #{stylefile} #{infile} > # {outfile} " puts 'xsl : ' + infile system cmd end def validate filename result = `xmllint - noout - valid #{filename}` puts result unless '' == result end end You 'll notice I have two methods here for XML , one for XSLT transform and one for XML validation .
For unix each one invokes a command line call .
If you 're unfamiliar with ruby notice the nice ability to insert a variable into a string with the #{variable_name} construct .
Indeed you can insert the result of any ruby expression in there - which is really handy .
In the validate method I use back - quotes - which execute the command line and return the result .
The puts command is ruby 's way of printing to standard output .
The windows version is a bit more complex as it needs to use COM rather than the command line .
class XmlToolWindows def initialize require ' win32ole ' end def transform infile , outfile , stylefile # got idea from http://blog.crispen.org/archives/2003/10/24/lessons-in-xslt/ input = make_dom infile style = make_dom stylefile result = input.transformNode style raise " empty html output for # {infile} " if result.empty ?
File.open ( outfile , 'w ' ) { |out| out << result} end def make_dom filename , validate = false result = WIN32OLE.new ' Microsoft.XMLDOM ' result.async = false result.validateOnParse = validate result .load filename return result end def validate filename dom = make_dom filename , true error = dom.parseError unless error.errorCode == 0 puts " INVALID : code #{error.errorCode} for #{filename} " + " ( line #{error.line} )
#{error.reason} " end end end
The statement require ' win32ole ' pulls in ruby library code for working with windows COM .
Notice that this is a regular part of the program ; in ruby you can set things up so that libraries are only loaded if needed and present .
I can then manipulate the COM objects just as with any other scripting language .
You 'll notice there 's no type relationship between these three XML processing classes .
The xml manipulations work because both the windows and unix XmlTools implement the transform and validate methods .
This is what rubyists refer to as duck typing - if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it must be a duck .
There 's no compile time checking to ensure these methods are present .
If a method is incorrect it will fail at run time - which should be flushed out by testing .
I wo n't bother going into the whole dynamic vs static type checking debate , just point out that this is an example of the use of duck typing .
If you are using a unix system , you may need to use whatever package management system you have to find and download the unix xml commands I 'm using ( on the Mac I used Fink ) .
The XMLDOM DLL usually comes with windows , but again depending on your setup you may need to download it .
Going Pear - Shaped
The one thing you can guarantee about programming is that stuff always goes wrong .
However much you try there 's always some mismatch between what you think you said and what the computer hears .
Take a look at this bit of rake code ( simplified from something that actually did happen to me ) .
src = ' foo.xml ' target = build ( ' foo.html ' ) task : default => target copyTask ' foo.css ' , '.' , target file target => src do transform src , target end See the bug ?
Neither did I .
What I did know is that the transformation that builds build / foo. html was always happening even when it did n't need to - an unnecessary rebuild .
I could n't figure out why .
The timestamps on both files were correct even if I made damn sure the target was later than the source I 'd still get a rebuild .
My first line of investigation was to use rake 's trace capability ( rake -- trace ) .
Usually it 's all I need to identify strange invocations , but this time it did n't help at all .
It just told me that the ' build / foo.html ' task was being executed - but it did n't say why .
At this point one might be inclined to blame Jim for the lack of debug tools .
Perhaps cursing might at least make me feel better : " your mother is a she wolf from Cleveland and your father is piece of wet carrot " .
But I have a better alternative .
Rake is ruby and tasks are just objects .
I can get a reference to these objects and interrogate them .
Jim may not have put this debug code into rake , but I can just as easily add it myself .
class
Task def investigation result =
"------------------------------
" result << " Investigating #{name}
" result << " class : #{self.
class}
" result << " task needed : #{needed ? }
" result << " timestamp : #{timestamp}
" result << " pre-requisites :
" prereqs = @prerequisites.collect { |name| Task [ name ] } prereqs.sort !
{ |a , b| a.timestamp <=> b.timestamp} prereqs.each do |p| result << "--#{p.name} ( #{p.timestamp} )
" end latest_prereq = @prerequisites.collect{|n|
Task[n].timestamp}.max result << " latest- prerequisite time : #{latest_prereq}
" result << " ................................
" return result end end Here 's some code to see what all this should be .
If you 're not a rubyist you may find it odd to see I 've actually added a method to the task class that 's part of rake .
This kind of thing , the same thing as an aspect - oriented introduction , is quite legal in ruby .
Like many ruby things you can imagine chaos with this feature , but as long as you are careful it 's really nice .
Now I can invoke it to see more about what 's going on src = ' foo.xml ' target = build ( ' foo.html ' ) task : default => target copyTask ' foo.css ' , '.' , target file target => src do |t| puts t.investigation transform src , target end I get this printed out :
------------------------------
Investigating build / foo. html class :
Task task needed : true timestamp : Sat Jul 30 16:23:33 EDT 2005 pre-requisites : -- foo.xml ( Sat Jul 30 15:35:59 EDT 2005 ) -- build/./foo.css ( Sat Jul 30 16:23:33 EDT 2005 ) latest - prerequisite time : Sat Jul 30 16:23:33 EDT
2005 ................................
At first I wondered about the timestamp .
The timestamp on the output file was 16:42 , so why did the task say 16:23 ?
Then I realized the class of the task was Task not FileTask .
Task 's do n't do date checking , if you invoke them they will always run .
So I tried this .
src = ' foo.xml ' target = build ( ' foo.html ' ) file target task : default => target copyTask ' foo.css ' , '.' , target file target => src do |t| puts t.investigation transform src , target end
The change is that I declared the task as a file task before I mention it in the context of other tasks later .
That did the trick .
The lesson from this is that with this kind of internal DSL you have the ability to interrogate the object structure to figure out what 's going on .
This can be really handy when weird stuff like this happens .
I used this approach in another case where I had unnecessary builds - it was really useful to pop the hood and see exactly what was happening .
( By the way my investigation method breaks if the output file does n't exist yet , such as in a clean build .
I have n't spent any effort to fix it because I only needed it when the file was already there . )
Since I wrote this Jim added an investigation method , very close to this one , to rake itself .
So you no longer need to do what I did here .
But the general principle still holds - if rake does n't do something you want , you can go in and modify its behavior .
Using Rake to build non-ruby applications
Although rake is written in ruby , there 's no reason why you can't use it to build applications written in other languages .
Any build language is a scripting language for building stuff , and you can happily build one environment using tools written in another .
( A good example was when we used ant to build a Microsoft COM project , we just had to hide it from the Microsoft consultant . )
The only thing with rake is that it 's useful to know ruby in order to do more advanced things , but I 've always felt that any professional programmer needs to know at least one scripting language to get all sort of odd - jobs done .
Running Tests
Rake 's library allows you to run tests directly within the rake system with the TestTask class require ' rake/testtask ' Rake :: TestTask.new do |t| t.libs << " lib/test " t.test_files = FileList [ 'lib/test/*Tester.rb ' ] t.verbose = false t.warning = true end
By default this will create a : test task which will run the tests in the given files .
You can use multiple task objects to create test suites for different circumstances .
By default the test task will run all the tests in all the given files .
If you want to run just the tests in a single file , than you can do that with rake test TEST =path / to/tester.rb
If you want to run a single test called " test_something " , you need to use TESTOPTS to pass in options to the test runner .
rake test TEST =path / to/tester.rb
TESTOPTS=--name=test_something
I often find it helpful to create temporary rake tasks for running specific tests .
To run one file , I can use : Rake :: TestTask.new do |t| t.test_files = FileList['./testTag.rb ' ] t.verbose = true t.warning = true t.name = ' one ' end
To run one test method I add in the test options : Rake :: TestTask.new do |t| t.test_files = FileList['./testTag.rb ' ] t.verbose = true t.warning = true t.name = ' one ' t.options = " --name=test_should_rebuild_if_not_up_to_date "
end
File Path Manipulations
Rake extends the string class to do some useful file manipulation expressions .
For example if you want to specify a target file by taking the source and changing the file extension you can do so like this " / projects/worldDominationSecrets.xml " .ext ( " html " ) # => '/ projects/worldDominationSecrets.html '
For more complicated manipulations there is a pathmap method that uses template markers in a similar style to printf .
For example the template " % x " refers to the file extension of a path and " % X " refers to everything but the file extension , so I could write the above example like this .
" / projects/worldDominationSecrets.xml " .pathmap ( " %X.html " ) # => '/ projects/worldDominationSecrets.html '
Another common case is having things from ' src ' turn up in ' bin ' .
To do this we can do substitution on elements in templates by using " %{pattern, replacement}X " , for example " src/org/onestepback/proj/foo.java".pathmap ( " %{^src , bin}X.class " ) # => " bin/org/onestepback/proj/foo.class "
You can find the full list of path manipulation methods in Rake 's String .
pathmap documentation .
I find these methods so useful that I like to use them whenever I 'm doing file path manipulations in my own code .
To make them available you need : require ' rake/ext/ string '
Namespaces
As you build up a larger build script , it 's easy to end up with lots of tasks with similar names .
Rake has a concept of namespaces which helps you organize these .
You create a namespace with namespace : articles do # put tasks inside the namespace here eg task : foo end You can then invoke the namespaced task with rake articles : foo If you need to refer to tasks outside the namespace you are currently in , then you use a fully qualified name for the task - which is usually easier using a string form of task name .
namespace :other do task : special => ' articles : foo ' end
Built in Cleaning
A common need with builds is to clean up the files you 've generated .
Rake provides a built in way to make this work .
Rake has two levels of cleaning : clean and clobber .
Clean is the gentlest approach , it removes all intermediate files , it does n't remove the final product , only temporary files that are used to derive the final product .
Clobber uses stronger soap and removes all generated files , including the final products .
Essentially clobber restores you to only the files that are checked into source control .
There is some terminological confusion here .
I often hear people using " clean " to mean removing all generated files , equivalent to rake 's clobber .
So be wary of that confusion .
To use the built in cleaning , you need to import rake 's built in cleaning with require ' rake / clean ' .
This introduces two tasks : clean and clobber .
As they stand , however , the tasks do n't know which files to clean .
To tell it you use a pair of file lists : CLEAN and CLOBBER .
You can then add items to the file lists with expressions like CLEAN.include ( '*.o' ) .
Remember that the clean task removes everything in the clean list , and clobber removes everything in both clean and clobber lists .
Odds and Ends
By default , rake does not print out the stack trace if you get an error in the code that rake calls .
You can get the stack trace by running with the -- trace flag , but usually I 'd just rather see it anyway .
You can do that by putting Rake.application.options.trace = true into the rakefile .
Similarly I find the file manipulation outputs from FileUtils to be distracting .
You can turn them off from the command line with the - q option , but also disable them in your rakefile with the call verbose ( false ) .
It 's often useful to turn warnings onwhen you run rake , you can do this by manipulating $ VERBOSE , there 's some good notes on using $ VERBOSE from Mislav Marohni ć
To look up a rake task object in the rakefile itself , use Rake : : Task [ : aTask ] .
The task 's name can be specified either as using a symbol or as a string .
This allows you to invoke one task from another without using a dependency using Rake :: Task [ : aTask ] .invoke .
You should n't need to do this often , but it 's occasionally handy .

The full text of his article can be downloaded from here , but I 'll focus only on his list of recommendations for the EU .
It 's scary .
A lot of people have discovered in the past year that Europe 's dependence on Russian gas was growing , and have begun to panic .
The result has been increasing stridency and hostility against Russia , or coldwaritis , as exemplified by the latest opus from the CSIS ( Center for Strategic and International Studies , a well known think tank ) , written by former ambassador to Lithuania Keith Smith .
No , in this case , I worry ( again ) about the growing body of institutional support for " toughness " against Russia on gas matters .
I 'm not talking about the neocons on Iraq or Iran , nor about the neolibs on Social Security privatisation , labor market " reform " or trickle down , but it 's the same kind of behavior .
It 's hard to avoid thinking that some people are stupid and that they will never learn , when they keep on proposing the same solutions over and over again , despite obvious failure in previous attempts .
Trouble is , these people are still in power - or in positions of influence .
The following would constitute important signs that the EU is adopting a tougher attitude : 1 . An EU decision to enforce its competition and antitrust rules in deals between Russian companies such as Gazprom and individual EU governments , in the same way that the Commission acted against the U.S. companies Microsoft and Honeywell .
I would hope that any efforts would be more effective than those against Microsoft , which have gone nowhere ( but at least the EC has not given up like the US DoJ ) , but I 'm not sure exactly on what grounds competition and antitrust rules would apply .
All European companies are free to buy gas from Gazprom if they want to ( and if they can get access to Gazprom gas , something the EC can say little about ) .
The EC already enforces rules on third party clauses ( i.e. the ability for Gazprom customers to onsell their gas to others ) , with unexpected consequences on European markets ....
Or does Mr Smith suggest that long term contracts be ditched in favor of spot sales of Russian gas ?
Or that a single EU buyer negotiate with Gazprom ?
As I 've written before , this would require to respond to a number of questions , such as who would run that body ( the European Commission ?
EU governments ?
Utilities ?
Gas buyers ? ) , under what decision making rules ( pro rata their gas consumption ?
Their gas imports ?
Their Russian gas imports ? ) , and what it would do with that gas and at what price it would sell it .
That proposal makes no sense unless explicited in detail - something these people somehow never get around to do ...
The tough posture must be enough .
2. Efforts by the EU to prevent member states from reaching deals with Russia that undercut the viability of EU plans to help construct pipelines from Central Asia that bypass Russia .
Again , that suggests to put a number of roadblocks - but on who exactly ?
Governments ?
Companies from a given country ?
And to prevent them from doing what ?
That sounds like blatant intervention in markets to pick winners - something that I thought governments were no longer supposed to do .
Especially as I 've noted before that gas pipelines from Central Asia that bypass Russia make no economic sense .
The arguments I used about Afghanistan two years ago apply here too - and we actually had a real life demonstration in that point in the 90s when the US governement energetically pushed the PSG pipeline from Turkmenistan to Turkey ( developed by Shell , Bechtel and Enron ) and it lost the market to Gazprom 's Blue Stream , a supposedly unfeasible pipeline under the Black Sea which is now in service while PSG went nowhere .
Nobody has tried recently , but the outcome would be the same .
Even if the EU were to decide to subsidize the construction of such a pipeline , it would need to reach agreements with all the countries involved , and Russia has more leverage with all of them - because it does not need to pay for an actual pipeline - the link is already there and is free to use .
Thus Russia will always be able to offer a better price for gas than Europe will - and earlier .
3. EU action to counter oil disruptions to the Baltic states designed to force these countries into selling their energy facilities to Russian companies .
That sort of makes sense , and the EU should indeed guarantee supplies to its more isolated members .
But it should be noted that the Baltic terminals , refineries and pipelines are physically integrated with the Russian network , and there is a industrial logic in seeing these controlled by Russian companies .
With the Baltic countries now paying market prices , Russia has no real motivation not to sell them oil or gas .
As an element of background , I 'll note that Mr Smith , Ambassador to Lithuania , then was an advisor to Williams , the US oil company , which had bought the main Lithuanian refinery , Majeika , and then got embroiled in a tug - of - war with Lukoil over the supply and the control of the refinery , which it solved by inviting Khodorkhovski's Yukos to take a stake in the refinery - i.e. turining to Russians to fight off other Russians ...
4. EU leadership in building a more secure network of electricity interconnectors between the countries of Western , Central , and Eastern Europe .
Interconnectors are a good thing .
The questions are , of course , ( i ) who pays for them , and ( ii ) how do you deal with pesky locals who do not want the ugly transmission lines in their backyard ( the main reason these lines , which both local governments and utilities want , are blocked most of the time ) ?
Is the EU going to run roughshod over national and / or local permitting procedures ?
Are they going to subsidize construction , again putting public money where the markets apparently deem it is not worthwhile ?
5 . An EU effort to marshal the international banks , including the EBRD and the EIB , to take equity positions in the pipeline systems of Ukraine , Bulgaria , Moldova , and Poland .
This would help these countries modernize their pipelines , provide a “ neutral ” party to ward off attempts by nontransparent Russian or national companies to take control of the pipelines , and increase competition in gas and oil transportation .
I am pretty sure that Russia would be quite happy to not have to deal with the problems associated with transit through these countries , and pass on the problem to the EU .
Because they would get paid the full value of gas at the Russian border , and the EU would have to deal with the fact that the transit countries still physically control the pipelines , and are unwilling to pay for gas that they can simply take for free along the way .
Would the EU accept to subsidize these countries ' energy consumption as Russia has been forced to do ( in order not to compromise its commitments to Europe ) ?
Or to intervene more vigorously in their domestic affairs ?
That might get interesting really quickly ...
6. EU decisions to promote international financing for the proposed Nabucco natural gas pipeline from the Caspian basin through Turkey to Bulgaria , Romania , Hungary , and Austria , which would increase energy security in Central and Eastern Europe , and to push hard with Kazakhstan and Ukraine for the construction of the Odessa - Brody oil pipeline system .
Nabucco is being prepared , and is likely to be financed by the private sector .
Why should it be subsidised ?
Again , picking winners and losers , or supporting corporate welfare ?
As to the Odessa - Brody oil pipeline , it is actually already in service - but the Ukrainians have found it more profitable to use it in the other direction , for transport of Russian crude to the Black Sea , rather than for transit of crude in the Black Sea ( presumably from Azerbaijan via Georgia , or from Russia itself ) to central and Northern Europe ...
Should they be paid to change the flow ?
By whom ?
Efforts by Central and Eastern European countries to improve their security by increasing domestic energy storage , boosting indigenous supplies of gas and oil , and creating a welcoming and transparent environment for foreign investors .
Indigenous supplies of gas and oil is so ridiculous that I wo n't even comment on it ( if the resources were there , I 'm sure they would be exploited ) .
Storage makes a lot of sense , and indeed Central European countries have been building up strategic oil reserves as per the EIA recommendations .
Gas storage is harder , as it requires the right kind of facilities , which can not be built just anywhere .
Central Europe has some , but they are geared up for distribution of Russian gas ; in any case , gas storage is mostly needed to deal with the seasonality of demand ( which is 3 times higher in winter than in summer ) which requires large storage buildup during the warm months .
And the liturgic reference to the " welcoming environment for investors " will be translated as " give US energy companies tax breaks to invest " ...
8. EU insistence that the opening of European downstream assets to Russian ownership is contingent on Moscow ’s implementation of the Energy Charter Treaty and , particularly , the Transit Protocol .
That 's already been made clear ( against all marker precepts which state that the nationality of the owner of assets is irrelevant ) and is pointless as Russia will not ratify the Energy Charter which brings it no advantage whatsoever .
Why would Russia give up control of its pipelines to Western oil companies with no compensation ?
Thus , we have the same mixture of bluster and wishful thinking as always , an absolute incoherence with the otherwise pushed for liberalisation drive , and an insistence to paint Russia as the evil empire trying to withhold ( our ) energy from us .
And we have absolutely no mention of what would actually make sense and be within our control : stop building new gas - fired plants ( something structurally encouraged by the liberalisation of the markets , which favors the kinds of plants which are easiest to finance by the private sector , i.e. gas - and coal - fired plants ) , and try to otherwise focus on energy savings .
But no , confrontation is so much more fun , and so much more manly .

The Amateur Lord of the Rings
One has to ask why The Lord of the Rings is so popular .
What are its peculiar qualities ?
Time and again it tops , or is a runner up with honours , in various best book reader - voted contests .
What is in it that it reaches out to so many .
What is it about the book and its writer that pierces and reaches so many ?

If you 're a widget maker , one of the trickier parts of your business is pricing your widget : too high , and they wo n't sell ; too low , and there 's no profit .
When you 're just starting out , this can be nerve - racking , and there 's a chance you 'll turn to market studies that use polling data .
But there 's a catch : when it comes to pricing , you 'll rarely hear consumers say " wow , you should charge more for that . "
So , at first glance one might not be surprised that a recent Ipsos study indicates that 75 percent of users polled believe that music simply costs too much .
However , when we pause to look at the situation , we see that this kind of data is more than significant .
It 's essential reading for the music industry .
Will they pay attention ?
The poll , conducted for The Associated Press and Rolling Stone magazine , called up 1,000 people and asked them about their preferences in music , their views on the legality of file sharing , and more .
80 percent of respondents said that they believed that the unauthorized download of music was " stealing , " and 92 percent claimed to have never engaged in such shenanigans .
These are the kinds of numbers the music industry wants to see : a high awareness of the legal issues , and an even higher rate of ( purported ) abstinence .
But the smiles end there , because as the movie industry has also learned , the quality of your product does matter .
58 percent of respondents said that music is getting worse , so can it be any wonder that these are tumultuous times for the industry ?
While the RIAA is worried that the radio is going to become a replacement for download services , they have to fear something even worse : the growing wash of apathy among would - be consumers .
How does a business battle that ?
I can tell you how it does n't .
Like a greedy king who risks ruining it all for the smallest of victories , the music industry wants to exploit the booming digital business without thinking about what raising prices might do to its growth .
While digital music sales tripled in 2005 , the year was also dominated by infighting between Apple and the music labels over the cost of those downloads .
Like star - crossed protagonists , the 99 cent download and the consumer seem locked into an ill fate : 71 percent of people polled thought that 99 cents was a good price for digital downloadsonly four percent lower than the number of people who think that music is generally too expensive .
This happy little sweet - spot is doomed , however , because of where it sits : at the crossroads of album sales and the singles factory .
The Ipsos study lends credence to our view that choice is what the consumer wants , and the music industry loathes .
Times were good when Rick Springfield could sell an entire album just because he had it bad for some other dude 's girlfriend .
Now , however , people are generally displeased with the cost of music , although the digital download price is seen as being acceptable .
This speaks volumes to the way that per-song pricing speaks to the average consumer .
And yet perception does n't match reality , yet .
According to the same poll , only 15 percent had actually purchased a song online .
To a well seasoned marketer ( hey , I know a few ) , this suggests that the current market has not reached its potential , and that something other than price is holding people back .
Without more data , it would be hard to speculate ( I still maintain that there is a perception that digital downloads are inferior to hard CDs ) , but one thing is exceedingly clear : the disparity between those who find the pricing of online music to be acceptable and those engaging in purchasing said music will not decrease with a price increase .
It 's just simple market dynamics .
Finally , it must be noted for the umpteenth time that this is yet another data point that suggests that casual piracy is not the problem that the labels face .
It 's apathy on the part of consumers coupled with unrealistic views on the part of the industry .
When I was covering the recent broadcast flag hearing on Capitol Hill , the RIAA 's Mitch Bainwol surprised me when he insisted on one of the big differences between music and TV / movies being replayability .
Bainwol believes that music needs more legal protection and more favorable copyright terms than video entertainment needs because people will listen to a song or an album repeatedly .
Given the data here , and given Bainwol 's argument , I 'm inclined to say that the RIAA knows exactly what is happening : music has largely become a commodity , and the public would rather trade in singles than in albums .
But when the latter does n't sell , we all know what will be blamed now , do n't we ?

The system of philosophy named after its founder , Carvaka , was set out in the Brhaspati Sutra in India probably about 600 BCE .
This text has not survived and , like similar philosophies in Greece , much of what we know of it comes from polemics against it and remarks by its critics .
There is a further similarity with Greece in that this is a rationalistic and skeptical philosophy , thus undermining the widespread belief in the West that Indian philosophy is primarily religious and mystical .
Amartya
Sen has argued , in fact , that there is a larger volume of atheistic and agnostic writings in Pali and Sanskrit than in any other classical tradition —
Greek , Latin , Hebrew , or Arabic .
He adds that this applies also to Buddhism , the only agnostic world religion ever to emerge .
Carvaka ’s philosophy developed at a time when religious dogma concerning our knowledge of reality , the constitution of the world , and the concept of an afterlife were being increasingly questioned , both in India and elsewhere .
Specifically , the school of Carvaka contained within itself a materialism that ruled out the supernatural ( lokayata ) , naturalism ( all phenomena described in terms of the properties of the four elements ) , rejection of the Vedas ( nastika ) , and a skepticism that included rejection of inferential logic , or induction .
One of the best sources for Carvaka ’s atheistic argument happens to be a book , Sarvadarshansamgraha ( the collection of all philosophies ) , written in the Fourteenth Century by Madhavacarya , a Vaishnavite ( Hindhu ) scholar .
Extracts from this are provided below .
1 The efforts of Carvaka are indeed hard to eradicate , for the majority of living beings endorse the current refrain —
While life is yours live joyously ;
No one can avoid Death 's searching eye :
When this body of ours is burnt , How can it ever return again ?
In accordance with the dictates of policy and enjoyment , the mass of men consider wealth and satisfaction of desire the only ends of man .
They deny the existence of any object belonging to a future world , and follow only the doctrine of Carvaka .
Hence another name for that school is Lokayata — a name well accordant with the thing signified [ that only the material world , loka , exists ] .
2 The only end of man is enjoyment produced by sensual pleasures .
Nor may you say that such cannot be called the end of man as they are always mixed with some kind of pain , because it is our wisdom to enjoy the pure pleasure as far as we can , and to avoid the pain which inevitably accompanies it .
Thus the man who desires fish takes the fish with their scales and bones , and having eaten the parts he wants , desists .
Or the man who desires rice , takes the rice , straw and all , and having taken that which he wants , desists .
It is not therefore for us , through a fear of pain , to reject the pleasure which our nature instinctively recognizes as congenial .
Men do not refrain from sowing rice because there happen to be wild animals to devour it ; nor do they refuse to set the cooking - pots on the fire , because there happen to be beggars to pester us for a share of the contents .
If any one were so timid as to forsake a visible pleasure , he would indeed be foolish like a beast , as has been said by the poet —
That the pleasure arising to man from contact with sensible objects , is to be relinquished because accompanied by pain — such is the reasoning of fools .
The kernels of the paddy , rich with finest white grains ,
What man , seeking his own true interest , would fling them away because of a covering of husk and dust ?
3 If you object that , if there be no such thing as happiness in a future world , then why should men of experience and wisdom engage in the sacrificial offering to fire and other phenomena , which can only be performed with great expenditure of money and bodily fatigue ?
Alas , your objection cannot be accepted as any proof to the contrary , since the sacrificial offerings are only useful as means of livelihood .
The Veda is tainted by the three faults of untruth , self - contradiction , and tautology .
The impostors who call themselves Vedic scholars are mutually destructive , as the authority of the chapter on knowledge is overthrown by those who maintain the authority of the chapter on action .
Conversely those who maintain the authority of the chapter on knowledge reject that on action .
Lastly , the three Vedas themselves are only the incoherent rhapsodies of rascals , and to this effect runs the popular saying —
The Sacrifices , the three Vedas , the ascetic 's three staves ,
and smearing oneself with ashes —
Brhaspati says these are but means of livelihood
for those who have no manliness nor sense .
4 Hence it follows that there is no other hell than the mundane pain produced by purely mundane causes , such as thorns and so forth .
The only supreme being is the earthly monarch whose existence is proved by all the world 's eyesight .
And the only liberation is the dissolution of the body .
By holding the doctrine that the soul is identical with the body , such phrases as " I am thin " , or " I am black , " are at once intelligible as the body ’s attributes of thinness or blackness .
In a similar way , self - consciousness will reside in the same subject .
5 In this school the four elements , earth , fire , water and air are the original principles .
From these alone , when transformed into the body , intelligence is produced — just as the intoxicating power of some herbs is developed from the mixing of certain ingredients .
When the body is destroyed , intelligence at once perishes also .
They quote the Vedic text for this :
Springing forth from these elements itself
solid knowledge is destroyed
when they are destroyed —
after death no intelligence remains .
Therefore the soul is only the body distinguished by the attribute of intelligence , since there is no evidence for any self distinct from the body .
Therefore the existence of such a separate self cannot be proved , because this school holds that perception is the only source of knowledge and does not allow inference as an alternative source .
6 " It could be , " says an opponent of this view ; " that your wish would be gained if inference , or logic , had no force of proof ; but they do have this force .
If they had not , then how , on perceiving smoke , should the thoughts of the intelligent immediately proceed to fire .
Or why , on hearing another say , " There are fruits on the bank of the river , " do those who desire fruit go off at once to the shore ? "
All this , however , is only the inflation of the world of fancy .
Those who maintain the authority of inference accept the sign or middle term as the causer of knowledge , which middle term must be found in the minor and be itself invariably connected with the major .
Now this invariable connection must be a relation destitute of any condition accepted or disputed .
This connection does not possess its power of causing inference by virtue of its existence , as the eye or other sense organs are the cause of perception , but by virtue of its being known .
What then is the means of this connection being known ?
We will first show that it is not perception , which is held to be of two kinds , external and internal .
External perception is not the required means ; for although it is possible that the actual contact of the senses and the object will produce the knowledge of the particular object thus brought in contact , yet as there can never be such contact in the case of the past or the future , the universal proposition which was to embrace the invariable connection of the middle and major terms in every case becomes impossible to be known .
Nor may you maintain that this knowledge of the universal proposition has the general class as its object , because , if so , there might arise a doubt as to the existence of the invariable connection in this particular case .
Nor is internal perception the means , since you cannot establish that the mind has any power to act independently towards an external object , since all allow that it is dependent on the external senses .
As has been said by one of the logicians , " The eye and other sense organs have their objects as described ; but mind externally is dependent on the others . "
Nor can inference be the means of the knowledge of the universal proposition , since in the case of this inference we should also require another inference to establish it , and so on , and hence would arise the fallacy of an infinite regression .
7 Nor can testimony be the means thereof , since we may either allege in reply , in accordance with the Vaisesika doctrine of Kanada , that this is included in the topic of inference ; or else we may hold that this fresh proof of testimony is unable to leap over the old barrier that stopped the progress of inference , since it depends itself on the recognition of a sign in the form of the language used in a child 's presence by an old man .
Moreover , there is no more reason for our believing on another 's word that smoke and fire are invariably connected than for our receiving the unsupported assertion of the existence of Manu [ a mythical being with no body ] and the like .
And again , if testimony were to be accepted as the only means of the knowledge of the universal proposition , then in the case of a man to whom the fact of the invariable connection between the middle and major terms had not been pointed out by another person , there could be no inference of one thing , such as fire , on seeing another , such as smoke .
Hence , on your own showing , the whole topic of inference for oneself would have to end in mere idle words .
8 Then again , comparison and the like must be utterly rejected as the means of the knowledge of the universal proposition , since it is impossible that they can produce the knowledge of this invariable connection , because their end is to produce the knowledge of quite another connection , namely , the relation of a name to something so named .
Again , this same absence of a condition , which has been given as the definition of an invariable connection or universal proposition , can itself never be known ; since it is impossible to establish that all conditions must be objects of perception .
Therefore , although the absence of perceptible things may be itself perceptible , the absence of non-perceptible things must be itself non-perceptible ; and thus , since we must here too have recourse to inference , we cannot leap over the obstacle which has already been planted to bar this .
But since the knowledge of the condition must here precede the knowledge of the condition 's absence , it is only when there is the knowledge of the condition that the knowledge of the universality of the proposition is possible , i.e. , a knowledge in the form of such a connection between the middle term and major term as is distinguished by the absence of any such condition ; and , on the other hand , the knowledge of the condition depends upon the knowledge of the invariable connection .
Thus we fasten on our opponents , as with adamantine glue , the thunderbolt - like fallacy of reasoning in a circle .
Hence by the impossibility of knowing the universality of a proposition it becomes impossible to establish the validity of inference .
The step which the mind takes from the knowledge of smoke , etc , to the knowledge of fire , etc. , can be accounted for by its being based on a former perception or by its being an error .
Or in some cases this step is justified as accidental , just like the coincidence of effects observed in the employment of gems , charms , drugs , and so forth .
9 From this it follows that fate and its various counterparts do not exist , since these can only be proved by inference .
But an opponent will say , if you thus do not allow the existence of unseen forces the various phenomena of the world become destitute of any cause .
But we cannot accept this objection as valid , since these phenomena can all be produced spontaneously from the inherent nature of things .
Thus it has been said :
Fire is hot , water cold ,
refreshingly cool is the breeze of morning ;
By whom came this variety ?
They were born of their own nature .
This also has been said by Brhaspati :
There is no heaven , no final liberation ,
nor any soul in another world ,
Nor do the actions of the four castes ,
orders , or priesthoods produce any real effect .
If a beast slain as an offering to the dead
will itself go to heaven ,
why does the sacrificer not straightway offer his father ?
If offerings to the dead produce gratification
to those who have reached the land of the dead ,
why the need to set out provisions
for travelers starting on this journey ?
If our offering sacrifices here gratify beings in heaven ,
why not make food offerings down below
to gratify those standing on housetops ?
While life remains , let a man live happily ,
let him feed on butter though he runs in debt ;
When once the body becomes ashes ,
how can it ever return again ?
If he who departs from the body goes to another world ,
why does he not come back again ,
restless for love of his kinfolk ?
It is only as a means of livelihood
that brahmins have established here
abundant ceremonies for the dead —
there is no other fruit anywhere .
Hence for kindness to the mass of living beings
we must fly for refuge in the doctrine of Carvaka .

" An Assessment of the Millenium " by Amartya Sen. UNESCO Lecture , New Delhi , 1998
In any war , one of the most useful opportunities is a chance to see the conflict through the other side ’s eyes .
A Marine captain recently sent me a fascinating look at the misnamed " war on terror " through the eyes of al - Qaeda , in the form of an interview by an al - Qaeda journal , Sawt Al - Jihad , of Fawwaz bin Muhammad Al - Nashami , who is identified as the leader of the attack at Khobar , Saudi Arabia , on May 29 of this year in which 22 " infidels " were killed .
I have no way of determining whether the account is genuine , though internal evidence suggests it probably is .
There is also no doubt that much of what Al - Nashami says is propagandistic .
It is intended to rouse other young Islamic militants to emulate his " great " deeds and kill more infidels .
But al - Qaeda is a sophisticated operation , sufficiently so to understand that good propaganda contains as much truth as possible .
The story is a blow - by - blow , hour - by - hour tale of the Khobar raid .
From the standpoint of Fourth Generation war ( 4GW ) theory , what stands out most strongly is its intense mix of ancient and modern .
Much of Al - Nashami ’s account could come straight from Homer .
It stresses the vast strength and great riches of the opponent , contrasted with the weakness of the four men who made up the al - Qaeda raiding group .
Allah is a constant player , just as gods fought for Greeks and Trojans .
Defeated enemies are publicly humiliated : " We tied the infidel by one leg [ behind the car ] everyone watched the infidel being dragged . "
While the enemy was strong in numbers , they were also cowards : " We encountered forces that hastened to defend the Americans .
Their great cowardice was evidenced by their behavior .
They were very far away , and as we approached them they kept withdrawing and distancing themselves . "
Heroes boast and show enemy heads : " Brother Nimr swaggered around inside the compound we found a Swedish infidel .
Brother Nimr cut off his head , and put it at the gate so that it would be seen by all those entering and exiting . "
Right in the midst of the fighting , when the raiders are hungry they eat , and when they are tired they sleep .
After the first encounter , " We turned to the hotel .
We entered and found a restaurant , where we ate breakfast and rested a while . "
Later , surrounded by Saudi security forces , " The brothers slept for an hour .
Then we decided we would be the ones to attack . "
Yet the modern is mixed intimately with the Homeric .
Sawt Al - Jihad asks , " How did you begin [ the operation ] ? "
Al - Nashami replies , " We left the apartment at precisely a quarter to six . "
Arab timekeeping is usually like Scandinavian cuisine : there is n’t much of it and most of what there is is bad .
Mission orders show up : " We met with the brothers and I explained to them the goals and plan of the operation . "
The raiders did multiple recons , and " we had learned more than one route to the second site . "
Most interestingly , the raiders use television both to send and receive information .
In the middle of the raid , they call al - Jazeera and do an interview .
When they need tactical intel , they turn on the TV : " Then I went to one of the rooms .
I watched the news on television and the news was that the emergency forces ‘ were now breaking into the compound . ’
I split up the brothers to certain positions in the hotel , and we got ready to repel an attack by the dogs of the state . "
This mix of ancient and modern is a central characteristic of 4GW , and it is one of the strengths of religiously motivated non-state forces .
It is also a very difficult thing for militaries such as our own to understand .
It is central to our opponents ’ strength at the moral level , which shows through strongly in the interview : " Many [ of the Arabs and Muslims at the compound ] prayed for our victory and success .
We spoke with them until their fear was gone and they began to joke with us and to direct us to the sites of the infidels . "
On the other side , the reported cowardice of the state security forces illustrates a problem with hiring people to fight for a cause they do not believe in : " The tracer bullets frightened these cowards greatly .
We shouted ‘ Allah Akbar ’ and ‘ There is no God but Allah .
We broke through the first ring [ of security ] , and the second , and the third . "
Hireling troops often do not have much fight in them , as we have also seen in Iraq .
Not surprisingly , the raiders escape with only one killed by a deus ex machina ending : " We ascended above one of the artificial waterfalls which overlooked the road .
The distance between us and the ground was very great , 13 meters .
But with Allah ’s mercy , the ground was soft and wet , because of the waterfall . "
The only thing missing is Zeus or Athena gently handing the raiders down .
Again , there is no question that the account is propaganda .
But propaganda is itself revealing .
It allows us to see our enemies as they see themselves , and the self - image of al - Qaeda that emerges from this account is one that should concern us .
The seamless blending of ancient and modern , of divinely protected heroism and technological competence , is potent .
That is particularly true when , as in this case , al - Qaeda ’s opponent is the hired troops of a corrupt regime – a regime America depends on to keep the oil flowing .
If , in war , one of the keys to success is pitting strength against weakness , al - Qaeda knows all too well what it is doing .
And its chances of victory are substantially greater than any tally of resources or troops numbers would suggest .
The unconventional proposals were made by the US Air Force
Other weapons that never saw the light of day include one to make soldiers obvious by their bad breath .
The US defence department considered various non-lethal chemicals meant to disrupt enemy discipline and morale .
The 1994 plans were for a six - year project costing $ 7.5 m , but they were never pursued .
The US Air Force Wright Laboratory in Dayton , Ohio , sought Pentagon funding for research into what it called " harassing , annoying and ' bad guy ' - identifying chemicals " .
The plans were obtained under the US Freedom of Information by the Sunshine Project , a group which monitors research into chemical and biological weapons .
' Who ? Me ? '
The plan for a so - called " love bomb " envisaged an aphrodisiac chemical that would provoke widespread homosexual behaviour among troops , causing what the military called a " distasteful but completely non-lethal " blow to morale .
Scientists also reportedly considered a " sting me / attack me " chemical weapon to attract swarms of enraged wasps or angry rats towards enemy troops .
A substance to make the skin unbearably sensitive to sunlight was also pondered .
Another idea was to develop a chemical causing " severe and lasting halitosis " , so that enemy forces would be obvious even when they tried to blend in with civilians .
In a variation on that idea , researchers pondered a " Who ? Me ? " bomb , which would simulate flatulence in enemy ranks .
Indeed , a " Who ? Me ? " device had been under consideration since 1945 , the government papers say .
However , researchers concluded that the premise for such a device was fatally flawed because " people in many areas of the world do not find faecal odour offensive , since they smell it on a regular basis " .
Captain Dan McSweeney of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate at the Pentagon said the defence department receives " literally hundreds " of project ideas , but that " none of the systems described in that [ 1994 ] proposal have been developed " .
He told the BBC : " It 's important to point out that only those proposals which are deemed appropriate , based on stringent human effects , legal , and international treaty reviews are considered for development or acquisition . "
Dave Givens knew a seven - hour roundtrip commute to and from Mariposa to Cisco's San Jose headquarters was n't normal , but he did n't think it exceptionally unusual .
Then Midas called .
The auto repair firm this week handed Givens its " America 's Longest Commute " award for his daily 372 mile trek .
Givens had entered the contest on a coworker 's suggestion and never expected to win .
Now , the electrical engineer is giving the massive commute a rethink .
" I was thinking that a few people would have a commute like this , " he told us .
" I really did n't think I had the longest one .
" I am totally stoked about winning .
But , on the other hand , it is really pointing out to me that it 's quite the dubious award .
It makes you wonder if this is right lifestyle . "
Givens , however , has no plans to change his routine any time soon after running the same route since 1989 .
With his family still sleeping , Givens heads out the door at around 4:30 a.m. from a horse ranch at the edge of the astonishing Yosemite National Park .
On a good day , he can make the 186 - mile trip to Cisco 's sprawling offices in less than three hours .
It takes about nine cups of coffee , XM satellite radio and audio books to make the drive tolerable .
Givens then usually arrives home at around 8 or 8:30 p.m .
This drive home through thicker traffic can take up to five hours some days .
The glorious Yosemite country and horses make the commute worth the effort to Givens – who pounds more than 30 cups of coffee by the end of the day .
" I could live a bit closer , but it would cost more and would n't be anywhere near as scenic , " he said .
As a winner of the award , Givens receives $ 10,000 in gas money and maintenance services from Midas .
He beat out a 175 - mile one - way Chicago man and a 164 - mile North Carolina lass .
Contestants had to provide the most direct route from their main residence to the office .
What do you think ?
Is it worth it ? ®
Claim : A construction worker survived an accident that poked an 18 - inch - long drill bit through one eye and out the side of his skull .
Status : True .
Origins :
Although we dread the gory industrial accidents that leave their victims dead or result in the loss of a limb ( or more ) , other types of on - the - job injuries can strike us as far more horrific .
One such accident took place on 15 August 2003 , when Ron Hunt , a Truckee , California , construction worker , landed face - first on a large drill
bit .
Hunt was working in the Tahoe Donner Subdivision in Truckee , standing atop a six - foot ladder while drilling over his head , when he gave the drill an extra push to bore a hole .
As he felt the ladder begin to wobble out from under him , he tried tossing his power drill aside ( a standard practice in the construction industry , intended to prevent workers from injuring themselves attempting to regain grips on out - of - control power tools ) before falling to the ground .
Unfortunately , he was n’t able to throw the drill far enough away , and he landed upon it face - first .
The 18 - inch - long , 1.5 - inch diameter chip auger drill bit pierced Hunt ’s right eye and exited through the side of his skull .
As Hunt described the mishap :
By the time I was falling , and I let the drill go down , I was already on top of it .
The drill was facing up but it was off .
When the drill hit , it just exploded my eye .
It skewered me .
I ran my hands up the drill bit , up to my eye , and put my other hand in the back of my head and felt it coming through the back of my head , and that ’s where pretty much the shock set in .
The first thing I thought was ‘ Am I going to die ? ’
I knew it was serious .
I was scared .
I did n’t know if it was in my brain or not .
The only other worker on the site that morning , Forrest Keating , heard Hunt call for help and rushed to assist him :
The first thing I saw was this drill sticking out about 6 inches from the back of his head and 6 inches out the front .
It was a trip , like something out of a horror movie .
I was amazed he was still alive .
Keating removed his shirt and attempted to stem the flow of blood gushing from Hunt ’s eye by wrapping the shirt around the drill .
He then ran
300 yards to a nearby house to summon medical help , and when paramedics arrived they released the body of the drill from the bit and loaded Hunt onto a gurney .
Hunt ( conscious throughout his ordeal ) was then flown by helicopter to Washoe Medical Center in Reno , Nevada , where doctors pondered their options for treating the bizarre injury .
Miraculously , although the drill bit tunneled between Hunt ’s scalp and his skull as it came out of the side of his head , it pushed his brain aside rather than pushing into it , sparing him from death , brain damage , or paralysis .
Dr. Paul Ludlow , an ear , nose and throat specialist who was the facial trauma physician on call that morning , initially intended to cut off the drill bit but eventually decided that the best approach was to , in effect , unscrew it from Hunt ’s head :
We had to either cut down on it , which meant making a rather long incision through a lot of muscle , or just unscrew it – twist it all the way through and out .
We would have cut it off , but after a few minutes of drilling , we noticed that it was loose .
And so we just put down our blade and twisted the bit .
Hunt had sufficiently recovered from his injuries by early September to appear on national television programs such as CNN News and ABC ’s “ Good Morning America . ”
Although he was truly fortunate not to have suffered more severe injuries ( or damage to his motor or speech skills ) , he came away from the accident far from unscathed : besides suffering a fractured skull ( which required a second operation to insert two titanium plates to reinforce the fractured bone ) , he lost an eye and now faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and rehabilitation costs .
According to news accounts ,
Hunt is not covered by state compensation for on - the - job injuries , and he was a self - employed worker with no medical insurance .
Injuries of this type always call to mind the case of Phineas Gage , who in 1848 survived an accident which blew a 3 - foot , 7 - inch tamping iron under a cheek bone and completely out through the top of his head .
Although Gage lived on for almost another dozen years , he suffered dramatic changes in personality and was subject to epileptic seizures in his final months .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2007 January 28
Explanation :
What lies at the bottom of Hyperion 's strange craters ?
Nobody knows .
To help find out , the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn swooped past the sponge - textured moon in late 2005 and took an image of unprecedented detail .
That image , shown above in false color , shows a remarkable world strewn with strange craters and a generally odd surface .
The slight differences in color likely show differences in surface composition .
At the bottom of most craters lies some type of unknown dark material .
Inspection of the image shows bright features indicating that the dark material might be only tens of meters thick in some places .
Hyperion is about 250 kilometers across , rotates chaotically , and has a density so low that it might house a vast system of caverns inside .

Only about 1 % of Japan 's population is registered as foreign
Doudou Diene , a UN special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia , was speaking at the end of a nine - day tour of the country .
He said Japan should introduce new legislation to combat discrimination .
Mr Diene travelled to several Japanese cities during his visit , meeting minority groups and touring slums .
He said that although the government helped to organise his visit , he felt many officials failed to recognise the seriousness of the racism and discrimination minorities suffered .
He was also concerned that politicians used racist or nationalist themes , as he put it , to whip up popular emotions .
He singled out the treatment of ethnic Koreans and Chinese and indigenous tribes .
Mr Diene says he plans to recommend that Japan enact a law against discrimination , which he said should be drawn up in consultation with minority groups .
He said he would now wait for the Japanese government to respond to his comments before submitting a report to the United Nations .
Scientists have conclusively demonstrated the extent of the link between the Sahara desert and the Amazon rainforests .
It might sound unlikely , but their work has shown that the Amazon rainforest depends on dust from one tiny area of the Sahara desert to restock its soil with nutrients and minerals .
Analysis of images from NASA 's MODIS satellite have revealed the Bodélé , a region of the Sahara not far from Lake Chad , as the source of more than half the material that fertilises the rainforest .
The Bodélé depression was already known as one of the largest sources of dust in the world , but the scientists involved in the research say no one had any idea of the scale of the region 's importance to the Amazon .
It transpires that if the Bodélé was not there , the Amazon would be a mere wet desert .
Dr Ilan Koren , lead author of the paper said : " Until now no one had any idea how much dust [ The Bodélé ] emits and what portion arrives in the Amazon .
Using satellite data , we have calculated that it provides on average more than 0.7 million tons of dust on each day that it is actively emitting dust . "
The dust is swept into the atmosphere by the surface winds in the Sahara .
The Bodélé region loses most of its dust during the spring and winter months , unlike the rest of the Sahara , because of its unique geography .
The Bodélé depression is located downwind ( in the winter , when the Harmattan winds blow ) of a huge crater - like valley between the Tibesti and Ennedi mountains .
This crater narrows to a cone - shaped pass which focuses the winds , and they speed up towards the Bodélé .
This is how the region , which is just half a per cent of the size of the Amazon , can produce as much dust as it does .
Dr Koren explains the process : " In the early morning on an emission day the winds speed up to the critical velocity for lifting and transporting dust when they reach the Bodélé .
" By using data from two satellites that take images of the same areas three hours apart , we can estimate the wind speed and calculate the size of the ' dust parcels ' that are produced at the Bodélé .
We are then able to track the progress of the parcel the next day after it has left the Bodélé and watch it progress across the desert . "
The research team use the MODIS satellite to watch the dust , and the MISR instrument , which only covers a small area , to find out more about the quantity of dust in each parcel .
The work has prompted more questions , however .
The team wants to know how long the Bodélé depression has been ' sending ' dust to the Amazon , and how long it will continue to do so .
The research is reported in the first edition of the Institute of Physics open - access journal , Environmental Research Letters . ®
Introduction to Common Errors in English Usage
What is an error in English ?
The concept of language errors is a fuzzy one .
I ’ll leave to linguists the technical definitions .
Here we ’re concerned only with deviations from the standard use of English as judged by sophisticated users such as professional writers , editors , teachers , and literate executives and personnel officers .
The aim of this site is to help you avoid low grades , lost employment opportunities , lost business , and titters of amusement at the way you write or speak .
But is n’t one person ’s mistake another ’s standard usage ?
Often enough , but if your standard usage causes other people to consider you stupid or ignorant , you may want to consider changing it .
You have the right to express yourself in any manner you please , but if you wish to communicate effectively , you should use nonstandard English only when you intend to , rather than fall into it because you do n’t know any better .
Why do n’t you cover all important points of grammar ?
Other sites do this ; mine is dedicated to errors in usage .
This is not a site dealing with grammar in general .
I ’m learning English as a second language .
Will this site help me improve my English ?
Very likely , though it ’s really aimed at the most common errors of native speakers .
The errors others make in English differ according to the characteristics of their first languages .
Speakers of other languages tend to make some specific errors that are uncommon among native speakers , so you may also want to consult sites dealing specifically with English as a second language ( see , for example , “ Curricular Resources in English “ ) .
An outstanding book you may want to order is Ann Raimes ’ Keys for Writers .
Are n’t some of these points awfully picky ?
This is a relative matter .
One person ’s gaffe is another ’s peccadillo .
Some common complaints about usage strike me as too persnickety , but I ’m just discussing mistakes in English that happen to bother me .
Feel free to create your own page listing your own pet peeves , but I welcome suggestions for additions to these pages .
First , read the Commonly Made Suggestions page , and if you still want to write me , please do so , after reading the instructions on that page .
What gives you the right to say what an error in English is ?
I could take the easy way out and say I was a professor of English and did this sort of thing for a living .
True , but my Ph.D. is in comparative literature , not composition or linguistics , and I taught courses in the history of ideas rather than language as such .
But I admire good writing and tried to encourage it in my students .
I found a word you criticized in the dictionary !
You will find certain words or phrases criticized here listed in dictionaries .
Note carefully labels like dial .
( dialectal ) , nonstandard , and obsolete before assuming that the dictionary is endorsing them .
The primary job of a dictionary is to track how people actually use language .
Dictionaries differ among themselves on how much guidance to usage they provide ; but the goal of a usage guide like this is substantially different : to protect you against patterns which are regarded by substantial numbers of well - educated people as nonstandard .
Why do you discuss mainly American usage ?
Because I ’m an American , my readers are mostly American , and American English is quickly becoming an international standard .
I often take note of ways in which American English differs from standard British practice .
However , the job is complicated by the fact that Canadians , Australians , and many others often follow patterns somewhere between the two .
If the standard usage where you are differs from what is described here , tell me about it , and if I think it ’s important to do so , I ’ll note that fact .
Meanwhile , just assume that this site is primarily about American English .
If you write mainly about American English , why do you so often cite the Oxford English Dictionary ?
First of all , I do not write exclusively about American English .
I address UK usage in many entries on this site .
Second , the OED strives to cover both UK and US usage , and often notes words or expressions as having either originated in or being used mainly in the US .
It is by no means an exclusively British dictionary .
Third , the OED is the recognized authority among linguists for etymology .
It ’s not always the last word in explanations of word origins and history , but it is the first source to turn to .
That ’s the main purpose for which I use the OED .
Fourth , because the OED tends to be more conservative than some popular American dictionaries , when it accepts a controversial usage , that ’s worth noting .
If even the OED regards a usage as accepted in modern English , then one should hesitate to argue that such usage is an error .
But because the OED is so conservative , and does n’t always note when a formerly obsolete word is revived or changes in usage , it ’s not a perfect guide to contemporary usage .
It is particularly weak in noting changes in spoken rather than written English .
Does it oppress immigrants and subjugated minorities to insist on the use of standard English ?
Language standards can certainly be used for oppressive purposes , but most speakers and writers of all races and classes want to use language in a way that will impress others .
The fact is that the world is full of teachers , employers , and other authorities who may penalize you for your nonstandard use of the English language .
Feel free to denounce these people if you wish ; but if you need their good opinion to get ahead , you ’d be wise to learn standard English .
Note that I often suggest differing usages as appropriate depending on the setting : spoken vs. written , informal vs. formal ; slang is often highly appropriate .
In fact , most of the errors discussed on this site are common in the writing of privileged middle - class Americans , and some are characteristic of people with advanced degrees and considerable intellectual attainments .
However you come down on this issue , note that the great advantage of an open Web - based educational site like this is that it ’s voluntary : take what you want and leave the rest .
It ’s interesting that I have received hundreds of messages from non-native speakers thanking me for these pages and none from such people complaining that my pages discriminate against them .
But you made a mistake yourself !
We all do , from time to time .
If you think you ’ve found an error in my own writing , first read the “ Commonly Made Suggestions ” page , then follow the instructions on that page if you still think I need correcting .
I ’ve changed many aspects of these pages in response to such mail ; even if I disagree with you , I try to do so politely .
If you write me , please do n’t call me “ Brian . ”
My given name is Paul .
The President ’s English
A few residents of the United Kingdom and Canada have taken umbrage at my statement that “ American English is quickly becoming an international standard . ”
“ Piffle , ” they assert ; “ everyone knows that the Queen ’s English is the worldwide standard , ” or words to that effect .
Let ’s see if I can make this clear while being reasonably polite .
First of all , note that I do not claim ( though I could ) that American English is the international standard , only that it is becoming a standard , alongside the older UK standard .
Because so many people use it , it is important to understand its peculiarities .
When most English speakers were part of the Empire — or later , of the Commonwealth — British patterns of spelling , punctuation , and usage prevailed .
Now we live in a different world .
Chinese from Hong Kong and Singapore speak with a British accent for good historical reasons , but enormous numbers of them from Taiwan and The People ’s Republic study mostly American patterns .
Arabs from the Middle East , Japanese , Russians , Central Asians of all sorts , and hosts of other people study much more often in American colleges than in British ones .
When treaties are being negotiated , international statements issued , meetings translated , and films dubbed , the lingua franca is far more likely to be American English than UK standard .
American television and movies have alone spread American accents throughout the world .
This may be a deplorable fact , but it is a fact .
Like many Americans , I warmly admire traditional English speech patterns and accents .
This site in no way suggests that American ones are superior .
They are simply more prevalent , in the world at large , and certainly on the Web .
I am not an expert on UK usage .
It is also worth noting that in a surprising number of cases , American pronunciation and usage are more conservative than that of the British .
Some instances are noted on these pages in which US speakers preserve older patterns abandoned by speakers in the British Isles .
My goal is to defend American standard usage from the bullying of non-American critics , and to warn Americans not to be parochial in assuming that everyone speaks like they do .
For obvious reasons , careful writers have to pay attention to a relatively small number of differences , but we do n’t have to let those differences whip us into a frenzy of mutual denunciation .

The world ’s oldest spider web – complete with captured prey – has been discovered , preserved in 110 - million - year - old amber
The world ’s oldest spider web – complete with captured prey – has been discovered , preserved in 110 - million - year - old amber .
The web was trapped in the early Cretaceous period as sticky sap seeped from a tree in what is now Spain .
It had hung from a tree so that it would catch insects on the wing .
The sap may have dripped onto the web , or the web may have blown onto its surface , says David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History in New York , US .
Then more sap covered it , forming a small amber “ stalactite ” 18 millimetres long and 7.5 millimetres wide .
Palaeontologists who found the amber sliced it into three thin sections , revealing at least 26 silk strands , some interconnected .
The web is not complete enough to be firmly identified as an orb web , with a spiral strand wound on radial spokes .
But Grimaldi says the fragments are consistent with orb webs .
“ It ’s a geometrically complex web , certainly not a random assortment of strands like a cobweb .
It was certainly in one plane , ” he told New Scientist .
Ancient spinners
Spiders are far more likely to be fossilised than their silk and such finds have shown that spiders have had spinnerets for extruding silk for at least 400 million years .
The oldest known spider silk was found in 2003 in 130 - million - year - old amber from Lebanon , but it was only a single 4 - millimetre strand ( see Silken clue to ancient spider ’s mastery ) , revealing very little about the web it came from .
The new fossil is by far the oldest web fragment .
It contains a group of five strands in the same plane , at least three of which are connected to a perpendicular incomplete strand in the same way as in modern orb webs .
The amber also contains bits of prey stuck to the web , including a mite , a fly , a beetle and a wasp .
“ They are basically the type and size of prey you expect in a web several centimetres in size ” today , although the fossil species are all extinct , Grimaldi said .
That means similar webs have shaped the evolution of flying insects for over a hundred million years .
For example , moths and butterflies , which evolved at the same time as flowering plants about 130 million years ago , have scaly bodies that allow them to escape from sticky webs .

LAHORE , Pakistan , Aug. 22 — After months of widespread frustration with corruption , the economy and a lack of justice and security , doubts about President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan , and by extension the American - led effort to rebuild that nation , have led to a crisis of confidence .
Interviews with ordinary Afghans and with foreign diplomats and Afghan officials make it clear that the expanding Taliban insurgency in the south represents the most serious challenge to his presidency to date .
The insurgency , along with the other issues , has brought an eruption of doubts about Mr. Karzai , who is widely viewed as having failed to attend to a range of problems .
That has left more and more Afghans asking what the government is doing .
Corruption is so widespread , the government apparently so lethargic and the divide between rich and poor so gaping that Mr. Karzai is losing public support , warn officials like Ahmad Fahim Hakim , deputy chairman of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission .
Olbermann had a good round up on Countdown last night .
Tony Snow seems to think that Colin Powell is just a little bit confused over Article 3 .
He might have been used in the run up to the war , but I think he understands this issue quite well .
The rest of the gaggle was just as perplexed .
Olbermann also talks about Bush 's new approach to Osama -- Just " fuggetabouthim " and threw in a little IAEA to boot .
Michael Stickings writes about the IAEA : Yes , it looks " like prewar Iraq all over again , " in the words of one former nuclear inspector .

As Tbogg shows :
There is no shortage of people in this administration who will say anything that they are told to say .
Tony Snow discussing the Geneva Convention ...
Q Does that not invite other countries to do the same , to have other interpretations of Article III ?
MR . SNOW : What it allows every country to do is to have an interpretation .
Our European allies do n't have an interpretation .
Q And your critics say that 's bad for U.S. troops if you allow those kinds of interpretations .
MR . SNOW : No , I think just the opposite .
As a matter of fact , the five guys who are Judge Advocates General right now say we need it .
The people who interpret the law , the people who serve as the chief legal officers within the Pentagon themselves say we need it .
..
Q Tony , I 'm confused .
Everybody I talked to today on the Hill says , look , you 've had the Geneva Conventions in place since 1947 .
This is n't the Migratory Birds Treaty we 're talking about .
This is the Geneva Conventions .
MR. SNOW : Right .
Q And it 's a very simple argument .
We do n't want to talk about the definition of amend or change , but that it stands on its own as written , has n't been tinkered with since 1947 , does n't need to be tinkered with now .
So if that seems to be the position from a former JAG and a former POW and a former Secretary of the Navy , where 's the room to work anything out ?
MR . SNOW : Well , I think there is .
For instance , in 1987 , we did n't know what the Genocide Convention said , so we passed a law to deal with it .
Q Not the Geneva Conventions .
MR. SNOW : It appears .
Yes , the Geneva Convention .
Q But not Article -- it has nothing with this specific article --
MR . SNOW : Well , that 's because Common Article III had never been construed as applying to any conflict in which the United States had ever been a party .
And furthermore , it has not been construed as applying to conflicts for the most part that afflicted any of our allies , to which they 've been a party .
It is something that they had never had to think about , and for which there was not a substantial and settled body of law that would define what the terms mean .
And this is a key point .
Nobody has defined in law what the terms mean .
And we think it 's important not only that we define what the terms mean , but that our -- the people who are working for us , either as soldiers in the field , or those who are doing the questioning for the CIA , they have to know that it passes constitutional muster , and it is defined and approved as abiding by our international treaty obligations .
The reason nobody talked about this from 1948 is , it had n't come up .
And there are times -- you 'll be surprised to know --
Q There 's been a lot of wars .
MR . SNOW : But , you know what , Helen , it did n't apply to most of those wars .
It did n't apply to most of those wars which is why people have not asked the questions .
Q This seems -- hang on a second -- this seems to be --
MR . SNOW : Well , and let me just make the point here , the predicate of your question was , it had been sitting around and everybody knew what the meaning was , and the fact is , nobody knew what the meaning was .

Haskellから入った人には、cinとかcoutとか微妙すぎてよくないだろ、と、思ったので、適当に。
対象読者は、Haskellわかるし、C++もわかる人（意味ねー）。ネタを理解できる人です。
C++とは C++とは、以下のような特徴を持ったプログラミング言語です 参照透明（！）
出現評価( occurrence evaluation ) （などといういかがわしい単語をつくる）
パターンマッチでき る
全く直感的でない構 文
IO モナドを書くための大量のsyntax sugarがあ る
説明していくと長くなるので、それぞれ、おいおい必要になったときに説明するようにします。
C++の型 C++には、次の型があります。 整数
真偽値
連想配列 まあ、おいおい説明。（はやくも飽きてきた ）
変数 飽きてきたので、さっさとプログラムを紹介。値を名前に束縛できます。なお、整数、真偽値と、連想配列で、束縛の仕方が違うので注意！ int const n = 10 ; 整数値10を名前nに束縛します。なお、'const'は必須なので注意。（驚くべきことに、'int n = 10 ;'とした場合、IOモナドを生成するsyntax sugarになります！これについては後述（しないです））
Haskellで書くとこんな感じ n :: Int n = 10 なお、C++には残念ながら型推論が無いので、型を省略することはできません。
続いて、真偽値。 bool const b = true ; 真偽値trueを名前bに束縛します。これもconst付けないとsyntax sugarになるので注意。
最後に連想配列。連想配列の束縛のしかたは整数、真偽値と違うので注意。 struct AssocArray { static int const n = 10 ; static int const m = n+10 ; static bool const b = true ; } ; 名前' AssocArray ' に連想配列 { n:: int= > 10 , m:: int= > 20 , b:: bool = > true } を束縛します 。
C++の世界では、連想配列を" type（型）"
と呼びます！イカれた名前ですね！連想配列は、type型（型型）になります。
連想配列を定義すると、あとで、 int const z = AssocArray : :n + AssocArray ::m ; とか書けます。（もはやどういう用語を使えばいいかわかんない。教えて！偉い人！）
尚、連想配列のメンバを定義するときは、'static'を忘れないようにしましょう。（何故ですか？知りません。） struct AssocArray { int const n = 10 ; int const m = n+10 ; bool const b = true ; } ; これはコンパイルエラーになります。
名前に束縛された連想配列の値をさらに別の名前に束縛するときは、typedefを使います。
// ' AssocArray'に束縛されてる値を' AssocArray2'という名前にも束縛する。 typedef AssocArray AssocArray2 ; Haskellで書くと、 assocArray2 :: Type assocArray2 = assocArray こんな感じです 。
関数 関数を書きましょう！関数の構文はどうかしてるので注意！ 何故かキーワード ' template 'を使いま す
返せる型は、連想配列のみとなります
大変読みにくいです！ さあ！心を落ち付かせて！何故こんなへんてこりんな仕様になってるのか！それは神のみぞ知る！
整数加算を行う関数は↓のようになります。 template < int n , int m > struct add_int { static int const result = n+m ; } ; なお、返せる値が連想配列のみなので、どっかで加算した結果を拾ってくるプログラムが必要になります。 int const n = 10 ; int const m = 20 ; typedef result_aarray = add_int <n , m > ; // add_int<n , m>の評価結果を'result_aarray 'に束縛 int const o = result_aarray :: result ; // result_aarrayのメンバresultが、加算した結果 さあ、よいですね！（よいわけがないが）関数の書きかたについて説明していきましょう。 template // 関数であることを示すキーワード
< int n , int m > // 引数は n:: int , m:: int のふたつ struct // 戻り値が連想配列であることを示す（といっても、連想配列しか返せないけど…） add_int // 関数名 { static int const result = n+m ; } // この部分が、関数の戻り値 ; あと、パターンマッチが使えます。たとえば、上の、add_intは、 template < int n, int m> struct add_int { static int const result = n+m ; } ; template <> struct add_int < 10,10 > { static int const result = 40 ; } ; こうやっておけば、引数が 、( 10,10 ) だった場合に、一般 のadd_intとは違う値が返せます。 int const z = add_int<10,10 >:: result ; // z = 40 パターンマッチを使うときは、パターンの位置が変なところに来るのに注意。 template < 10,10 > struct add_int { static int const result = 40 ; } ; ではないです ！
さあ、よいですNE！（よいわけないが）さっそく、階乗ですよ。階乗は、 fact n = fact ( n - 1 ) * n fact 1 = 1 こんな感じですね ！C++で書くと、こうなります↓ template < int n> struct fact { static int const result = fact < n - 1>:: result * n ; } ; template <> struct fact < 1 > { static int const result = 1 ; } ; int const z = fact < 4>:: result ; あとは、こういうのを組み立てていけば、なんかもう、なんでもできます。（いや、なんか、制限があるんだよな…確か）

Architecture and Security
You ’ve seen them : those large concrete blocks in front of skyscrapers , monuments and government buildings , designed to protect against car and truck bombs .
They sprang up like weeds in the months after 9/11 , but the idea is much older .
The prettier ones doubled as planters ; the uglier ones just stood there .
Form follows function .
From medieval castles to modern airports , security concerns have always influenced architecture .
Castles appeared during the reign of King Stephen of England because they were the best way to defend the land and there was n’t a strong king to put any limits on castle - building .
But castle design changed over the centuries in response to both innovations in warfare and politics , from motte - and - bailey to concentric design in the late medieval period to entirely decorative castles in the 19th century .
These changes were expensive .
The problem is that architecture tends toward permanence , while security threats change much faster .
Something that seemed a good idea when a building was designed might make little sense a century — or even a decade — later .
But by then it ’s hard to undo those architectural decisions .
When Syracuse University built a new campus in the mid-1970s , the student protests of the late 1960s were fresh on everybody ’s mind .
So the architects designed a college without the open greens of traditional college campuses .
It ’s now 30 years later , but Syracuse University is stuck defending itself against an obsolete threat .
Similarly , hotel entries in Montreal were elevated above street level in the 1970s , in response to security worries about Quebecois separatists .
Today the threat is gone , but those older hotels continue to be maddeningly difficult to navigate .
Also in the 1970s , the Israeli consulate in New York built a unique security system : a two - door vestibule that allowed guards to identify visitors and control building access .
Now this kind of entryway is widespread , and buildings with it will remain unwelcoming long after the threat is gone .
The same thing can be seen in cyberspace as well .
In his book , Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace , Lawrence Lessig describes how decisions about technological infrastructure — the architecture of the internet — become embedded and then impracticable to change .
Whether it ’s technologies to prevent file copying , limit anonymity , record our digital habits for later investigation or reduce interoperability and strengthen monopoly positions , once technologies based on these security concerns become standard it will take decades to undo them .
It ’s dangerously shortsighted to make architectural decisions based on the threat of the moment without regard to the long - term consequences of those decisions .
Concrete building barriers are an exception :
They ’re removable .
They started appearing in Washington , D.C. , in 1983 , after the truck bombing of the Marines barracks in Beirut .
After 9/11 , they were a sort of bizarre status symbol :
They proved your building was important enough to deserve protection .
In New York City alone , more than 50 buildings were protected in this fashion .
Today , they ’re slowly coming down .
Studies have found they impede traffic flow , turn into giant ashtrays and can pose a security risk by becoming flying shrapnel if exploded .
We should be thankful they can be removed , and did not end up as permanent aspects of our cities ’ architecture .
We wo n’t be so lucky with some of the design decisions we ’re seeing about internet architecture .

Bush Fmr. Elections Chair : E- Voting Ripe for Fraud
Bush 's Former Elections Chair : E- Voting Ripe for Fraud
First Bush - appointed chair of US Election Assistance Commission says " no standards " for e-voting devices , system " ripe for stealing elections ! "
Bradblog & Truthout.org
Tueday 17 October 2006
The BRAD BLOG has obtained an EXCLUSIVE partial transcript from a recent , unaired interview by a major broadcast network with former U.S. Elections Assistance Commission ( EAC ) chair Rev. DeForest Soaries .
Soaries was appointed by George W. Bush as the first chair of the commission created by the federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) in the wake of the 2000 Presidential Election Debacle .
In the interview , available here for the first time , Soaries excoriates both Congress and the White House , referring to their dedication to reforming American election issues as " a charade " and " a travesty , " and says the system now in place is " ripe for stealing elections and for fraud . "
Having resigned from the commission in April of 2005 , Soaries goes on to explain that he believes he was " deceived " by both the White House and Congress , and that neither were ever " really serious about election reform . "
The explosive comments are the latest evidence highlighting serious deficiencies in the federal body , created by HAVA for oversight of elections systems , including new electronic voting devices , and standards for the use and security of those systems .
In the unaired interview , conducted last August , Soaries says there are " no standards " for voting systems and that Congress and the White House " made things worse through the passage of the Help America Vote Act . "
Due to underfunding and lack of attention to the EAC and the Election Reform it was supposed to oversee , Soaries says we now have an " inability to trust the technology that we use " to count votes in our American democracy , even as " we 're spending a billion dollars a week in Iraq . "
" We know more today about how to build a machine to take pictures of rocks on Mars than we know about how to build a machine to safeguard the American right to vote , " complained Soaries in the interview .
On Electronic Voting System standards - which HAVA mandated would be created by the EAC - Soaries blasts both the White House and Congress for failing to supply them with the needed resources to complete the mandate , both for the federal government and the states that were relying on them to do so .
" [ T ]he states were forced to comply and they were asking us for guidance .
We were ill - equipped to provide guidance .
We did n't begin our work until January 2004 and we spent the first three months of our work looking for office space .
Here we were , the first federal commission , responsible for implementing federal law in the area of election administration and for the first three months we did n't even have an address .
And we physically had to walk around Washington DC looking for office space .
This was a travesty .
I was basically deceived by the leaders of the House , the Senate and the White House . "
" Someone has got to be able to say , no one in America should use machine ' A ' ever again , " he says , in reference to the EAC 's failure to decertify electronic voting systems even after they have been proven to be easily vulnerable to hackers and tampering .
" And if it 's not EAC , " he continued , " it 's got to be someone .
Someone in America has got to hold America accountable for protecting the most fundamental right in a democracy and that is the right to vote . "
The straightforward comments from the EAC 's first chair are in stark contrast to the actions of his Bush - appointed replacement , the current EAC head , Paul DiGregorio .
The outgoing chair , DiGregorio , whose term has now ended , made news several days ago when it was discovered he had allowed the commission to withhold the release of a May 2006 report revealing claims of epidemic " Voter Fraud " - as made by GOP operatives in order to push an agenda calling for restrictive , unconstitutional Photo ID laws at polling places - are wholly unfounded .
Where Soaries was disappointed at the lack of interest by officials for true reform by the EAC during his tenure , his predecessor appears to have been using the post as an arm of the White House to continue its manipulation and perversion of the American electoral system .
UPDATE 7:27 pm PT :
The folks from KTLK in Los Angeles called to say they will have Soaries on the " Harrison on the Edge " show tonight to discuss this interview at 8:30 pm PT .
You can listen online here ...
The transcript of Soaries comments , as taken from the unaired August 2006 interview are posted below ...
Transcript from Unaired September 2006 Interview
Rev. DeForest Soaries , Former U.S. Elections Assistance Commission Chair " I resigned , effective April 30th , 2005 after having served through the 2004 elections and concluding that neither the White House nor the Congress was really serious about election reform .
" Florida 2000 , the whole world watched America express embarrassment over the status of the Election Assistance Administration and by November 2004 , we had not only not made significant changes but in many ways , had made things worse through the passage of the Help America Vote Act .
" After Florida 2000 , the politicians were all on the soap box promising the country that we would ' repair ' the problem and the problem was much more than hanging chads and lever machines .
For instance , the Help America Vote Act mandates that an electronic voting machine be in every precinct in the country and that mandate preceded the funding of research necessary to ensure that there is some prototype or standard for such machines .
If every home were mandated to have a microwave without the prerequisite kinds of safety standards for microwaves , it would be considered scandalous .
But we know more today about how to build a machine to take pictures of rocks on Mars than we know about how to build a machine to safeguard the American right to vote .
" There is no prototype .
There are no standards .
There is no scientific research that would guarantee any election district that there 's a machine that can be used to answer these very serious questions .
And so , my sense is that the politicians in Washington have concluded that the system can't be all that bad because , after all , it produced them .
And as long as an elected official is an elected official , then whatever machine was used , whatever device was used to elect him or her , seems to be adequate .
But there 's an erosion of voting rights implicit in our inability to trust the technology that we use and if we were another country being analyzed by America , we would conclude that this country is ripe for stealing elections and for fraud .
" What was ironic that was each of us accepted our appointments knowing that EAC had no statutory authority to regulate .
But what we were told was that EAC would have sufficient money to do research .
And while regulatory authority was not present , we felt that if we could do the proper research , no state would be caught dead using equipment that did n't meet up to the standards that our research proved were acceptable standards .
Well , in the absence of regulatory authority and in the absence of money to do the research , we were basically asked to make bricks without straw .
" Well , the states were forced to comply and they were asking us for guidance .
We were ill - equipped to provide guidance .
We did n't begin our work until January 2004 and we spent the first three months of our work looking for office space .
Here we were , the first federal commission , responsible for implementing federal law in the area of election administration and for the first three months we did n't even have an address .
And we physically had to walk around Washington DC looking for office space .
This was a travesty .
I was basically deceived by the leaders of the House , the Senate and the White House .
And I decided that it just made more sense to spend my time watching my sons play basketball than to participate in this charade .
" While we 're spending a billion dollars a week in Iraq , we 're told at EAC , by both the White House and the Congress , here is how much we 're going to give you .
You tell us what you 're going to do with it .
They never asked us the question , what would it really take to lead election reform in this country .
How much money should the country really spend not only on buying new equipment , but on doing the proper research before using that equipment and how much will it cost over the long haul to keep that equipment up to date and to repair such equipment .
Those questions were not asked .
So in my view , it was a just a charade that I would chose not to participate in .
" Most people who really know , like election officials .
They pray on election day that the election is not close .
Because if an election is not close , then the flaws are hidden .
But it 's when you have this perfect storm of equipment failures like Florida and a close election where there 's a call for recounts and an inability to determine who won right away , that 's when the glaring issues emerge and when election officials begin biting their nails .
" Either EAC or some agency must have the capacity to hold the entire system , elections officials , public officials and the manufacturers of voting equipment accountable .
Where there 's no accountability , then you 're open for fraud and for inefficiency .
EAC has regulatory authority over the National Voting Rights
Act but that 's a small piece of the voting process .
Someone has got to be able to say , no one in America should use machine ' A ' ever again .
And if it 's not EAC , it 's got to be someone .
Someone in America has got to hold America accountable for protecting the most fundamental right in a democracy and that is the right to vote . "

British banks are banning piggy banks because they may offend some Muslims .
Halifax and NatWest banks have led the move to scrap the time - honoured symbol of saving from being given to children or used in their advertising , the Daily Express / Daily Star group reports here .
Muslims do not eat pork , as Islamic culture deems the pig to be an impure animal .
Salim Mulla , secretary of the Lancashire Council of Mosques , backed the bank move .
“ This is a sensitive issue and I think the banks are simply being courteous to their customers , ” he said .
However , the move brought accusations of political correctness gone mad from critics .
“ The next thing we will be banning Christmas trees and cribs and the logical result of that process is a bland uniformity , ” the Dean of Blackburn , Reverend Christopher Armstrong , said .
“ We should learn to celebrate our difference , not be fearful of them . ”
Khalid Mahmoud , the Labour MP for a Birmingham seat and one of four Muslim MPs in Britain , also criticised the piggy - bank ban .
“ We live in a multicultural society and the traditions and symbols of one community should not be obliterated just to accommodate another , ” Mr Mahmoud said .
“ I doubt many Muslims would be seriously offended by piggy banks . ”

The View
You know it 's a little bit ridiculous that we continue to watch these TV stars and movie stars who smear our leaders .
I just wonder , Rob , if you 'll think for a moment what our enemies think of seeing TV personalities comparing the outgoing Defense Secretary to Adolph Hitler .
I mean , you know , conservatives never get a pass .
Strom Thurmond is wished a Happy Birthday by Trent Lott and the sky falls in on Trent Lott .
But if Joy Behar goes on national TV and compares a good man like Rumsfeld to the evilest man in the world and there 's no repercussions for Joy Behar .
You know , I think we should round up all of these folks .
Round up Joy Behar , round up Matt Damon , who last night on MSNBC attacked George Bush and Dick Cheney .
Round up Olbermann , take the whole bunch of them and put them in a detention camp until this war is over because they 're a bunch of traitors .
The View

the hanging
Howard Dean should be arrested and hung for treason or put in a hole until the end of the Iraq war !
Commentary
's Cliff May doled out a lecture yesterday about the meaning of free speech to an Islamic cleric in Azerbaijan .
The cleric was objecting to a newspaper article which blamed Islam for Azerbaijan 's economic troubles , and the cleric said : " I am for freedom of speech but not the freedom to insult . "
In reply , May sermonized : " You can't have one without the other .
" Many of May 's ideological comrades here in America are in need of that lecture as much as ( at least ) the Azerbaijan imam .
On Fox News several days ago , Bill Hemmer hosted a segment protesting the " comparison " by 's Joy Beher of Adolph Hitler and Donald Rumsfeld .
One of the two Fox guests was right - wing radio talk show host Mike Gallagher , and this is what he said ( h/t mbf ) : Let us leave to the side for the moment the laughter - until - choking - inducing premise ( highlighted by Newshounds ) that Islamic terrorists are watchingand are emboldened by Joy Behar 's criticisms of Donald Rumsfeld .
Let us also leave to the side Gallagher 's gushing praise , also expressed on Fox back in 2004 , for a political ad that he said " brilliantly put together side by side Al Gore 's raging , maniacal rant next to Adolf Hitler .
It was actually pretty cleverly done .
" And let us further leave to the side the all - consuming irony that Gallagher is bitterly complaining about the oh - so - inappropriate invocation of Nazism when criticizing right - wing Bush followers , only to then advocate that critics of the Government -- what he calls " our leaders " -- should be " rounded up " and placed into concentration camps ( but only " until this war is over " -- which happens never ) .
One could spend all day if one were so inclined ridiculing Mike Gallagher , but he is n't the issue here .
What is notable is how unnotable comments like these are .
There is something quite striking about the fact that Fox News casually broadcasts to its viewers a call for Americans who critcize government leaders to be put into detention camps .
And while the opposing guest , radio host Rob Thompson , somewhat lamely pointed out that criticism of " our leaders " is n't treasonous , there was no real challenge to Gallagher 's truly disgusting remarks .
In fact , the grinning , empty - headed Bill Hemmer said nothing about Gallagher 's outburst .
He did , though , point out that he found the remarksto be " a bit unexcusable , " and he ended the segment by inviting the guests back " next week , " and then cheerfully added : " Happy Holidays , see you guys .
" Perhaps my surprise is a bit naive ( and I know there will be several people in comments eager to point out how naive ) , but should n't the expressed call to put domestic political opponents of the Bush administration into " detention camps " render someone beyond the pale ?
If that does n't , what does ?
Is there anything that is considered too authoritarian for Fox News ?
Gallagher is n't the first person to make this " argument " of course .
Ben Shapiro , among others , on Townhall called for the prosecution and imprisonment of leading Democrats ( Al Gore , Howard Dean , John Kerry ) for their " sedition " ( meaning their criticism of " our leaders " ) .
And Michael Reagan -- a regular guest on Fox and sometimes guest host on Hannity & Colmes -- made one of the most reprehensible though under - appreciated statements from any relatively mainstream political figure when he called for the hanging ---- of Howard Dean as a result of Dean 's remarks about the war in Iraq :
The danger here -- at least the short - term , imminent danger -- is not that anyone is going to be implementing the calls by Gallagher , Shapiro and Reagan to start putting Bush critics into concentration camps .
The real issue is the same one raised by the post yesterday discussing 's call for war on Iran in order to seize its oil assets , and it is the same point raised by the " debates " we have had over torture and indefinite detention .
By including advocates of these views in what is considered to be acceptable political discourse -- given forums by the likes of Fox News and treated with respect -- the scope of acceptable and mainstream viewpoints expands outwards towards its most authortarian fringes , until it squarely includes full - blown advocacy of tyranny .
As but one example , by including pro-concentration - camp arguments from Gallagher and Reagan in our mainstream discourse , Fox renders the recent , repeated and truly radical calls from Newt Gingrich for a so - called " debate " on what the First Amendment " should protect " as moderate and mild .
The fact that one can turn on Fox News and regularly hear people who advocate the hanging or imprisonment of mainstream Bush critics for the opinions they express is a far more notable development than passive acceptance of it would suggest .
I ’ll admit the title is a little sensationalistic , but I have yet to see any contrarian view - point on the story of Google acquiring Writely .
All the stories I ’ve read so far seem to tout Google Office and how they are one step closer to getting an office - for - the - web to defeat Microsoft .
When I first read the story , I was surprised that Google was really buying a company like Writely .
Now I am not trying to bash Writely at all here – In fact , I ’ve been a beta - tester of Writely since its launch and I think Writely is a good tool .
I even recently ran a little project at work to see if we could use Writely as a collaboration tool .
And so my thoughts on this matter as more about Google than Writely .
Writely is a neat idea but where ’s the real value here ?
If Google just wanted a WSYIWIG web - editor , they did n’t have to buy a company .
They could have used one of the many open - source products out there like TinyMCE , FCKeditor and countless others that essentially do what Writely does at its core .
Writely does add on the storage , versioning and other features on top of the WYSIWYG editors but is that worth buying the whole company ?
Every time a large company buys a small company , I almost always flashback to a meeting I had in July 2000 with Paul Butterworth , who was then the CTO of Sun ’s tools division .
Paul had joined Sun as part of Sun ’s acquisition of Forte Software .
Paul Butterworth was the founder of Forte Software and spent a few months at Sun before moving on and starting AmberPoint , which is doing some really cool things .
Not sure how many remember Forte Software , but Forte was the maker of a 4GL programming language called TOOL with a pretty cool n-tier architecture .
Instead of using anything that Forte had , Sun decided to buy NetBeans and just use the name Forte for its tools .
What a joke – billions of shareholder dollars wasted but that ’s history now .
Any rate , a group of us got to spend an afternoon with Paul as part of a client visit .
As we were quizzing him on why Sun bought Forte , he said something that ’s still with me and rings true in most acquisitions .
He theorized that large companies are always amazed at all the innovation coming from small companies and so they buy these small companies in hopes of bringing the small company magic into the larger company – and that almost never works as the small companies were innovative because they were n’t constrained by all the big company process , policies and red-tape .
The minute the small company joins the large company , innovation stops as people that could have been creative and really stretched were now constrained by all the big company bureaucracy .
When I think about Google ’s acquisition of Writely , I am reminded of that story .
Google has some brilliant people that can take something like TinyMCE , FCKeditor or write something like that and ‘ network - enable ’ the whole idea of a web editor .
Why would you buy Writely ?
Is it just to get the developers ?
Is Google getting too big that all the innovation that we expected from Google is just not materializing ?
Obviously I have no idea why Google purchased Writely and there may be something really there that I ’m missing .
What do you think ?
Is Google too big to be nimble and innovative like it was in the past ?
Am I reading too much into this Writely thing ?
Hitting the financial jackpot , it appears , may have created some headaches for YouTube , the wildly popular video - sharing Web site that has agreed to be bought by Google for $ 1.65 billion in stock .
The site late last week began purging copyrighted material from Comedy Central , including clips from YouTube stalwarts like “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , ” “ The Colbert Report ” and “ South Park . ”
The action was “ a result of third - party notification by Comedy Central , ” according to one such e-mail message sent to a YouTube user , Jeff Reifman , who broke the news on the Web site NewsCloud .
A week earlier , nearly 30,000 clips of TV shows , movies and music videos were taken down after the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors , Composers and Publishers cited copyright infringement .
Eventually , though , prizes began to be replaced by grants that awarded money upfront .
Some of this was for good reason .
As science became more advanced , scientists often needed to buy expensive equipment and hire a staff before having any chance of making a discovery .
But grants also became popular for a less worthy reason : they made life easier for the government bureaucrats who oversaw them and for the scientists who received them .
Robin Hanson , an economist at George Mason University who has studied the history of prizes , points out that they create a lot of uncertainty — about who will receive money and when a government will have to pay it .
Grants , on the other hand , allow a patron ( and the scientists advising that patron ) to choose who gets the money .
“ Bureaucracies like a steady flow of money , not uncertainty , ” said Mr. Hanson , who worked as a physicist at NASA before becoming an economist .
“ But prizes are often more effective if what you want is scientific progress . ”
In fact , when Netflix announced its prize in October , Mr. Hastings said he did n’t necessarily expect contestants to make a lot of quick progress .
Computer scientists say that Cinematch , along with Amazon ’s recommendation system , was already one of the most sophisticated .
“ We thought we built the best darn thing ever , ” Mr. Hastings said .
But Mr. Hastings underestimated the power of an open competition .
Within days , many of the top people in a field known as machine learning were downloading the 100 million movie ratings Netflix had made public .
The experts have since been locked in a Darwinian competition to build a better Cinematch , with the latest results posted on a leader board at Netflix ’s Web site .
Last week , I called Geoffrey Hinton , a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto whose team had been in first place when I last checked .
But by the time I reached him , his team had been bumped down to second by a Hungarian team .
( The contestants have also turned up some good trivia about movie preferences .
Benji Smith of Salt Lake City deserves credit for the “ Oz ” - “ Lambs ” connection . )
To claim the million - dollar prize , a team has to build a system that is at least 10 percent better than Cinematch at predicting how many stars someone would give a movie .
There are a small number of people , for instance , who love “ The Wizard of Oz ” but ca n’t stomach “ Silence of the Lambs . ”
Perhaps it is possible to identify them based on their attitude toward an eclectic group of other movies — but only an advanced algorithm can find this pattern .

BBC News , Delhi and Beijing
The rapid growth of the Indian and Chinese economies have transformed the two countries in recent years .
But this prosperity has also brought other problems .
Heavy investment has turned Beijing into a modern city
I am not sure what caused it to happen , what particular event or news story .
I just remembered the phone in the BBC's Beijing Bureau started ringing and it has not stopped since .
Well now it is happening again and this time it is not China , it is India .
Every time you turn on the television or pick up a magazine , it is no longer the rise of China , it is now the rise of China and India .
The desire to make comparisons is understandable .
Both have more than a billion people .
Both are growing at 10 % a year .
Delhi is an overwhelming experience .
It is as if all of humanity has been squeezed into one city
I have spent the last eight years living in Beijing , and only four days in Delhi , so comparisons are difficult .
But the few days I recently spent in India made me look at China in a new light .
' Shocking experience '
Over 15 million people live in Delhi
The streets groan under the weight of people .
The air is filled with deafening noise and sumptuous smells .
Switch on the television and it is the same .
Between channels blasting out voluptuous Bollywood love stories and pop videos , an endless stream of news channels dissect the latest political scandals , and debauched lifestyles of the rich and famous .
Coming from China it is an almost shocking experience .
But after the initial delight at being in an open society , I started to notice other things .
Foreign tourists stared in bewilderment ; locals with the resigned look of those used to waiting
Then with the night - time temperature still well above 30C ( 86 F ) the power went out .
I lay for hours soaked in sweat trying , and failing , to get back to sleep and wishing I was back in Beijing where the lights never go out .
But getting back would not be easy .
Passenger queues
I looked at my plane ticket .
Departure time 0315 .
Surely that could not be right .
I called the front desk .
" That 's correct sir , " he said , " the airport is too small so many flights from Delhi leave in the middle of the night . "
He was not joking .
My taxi struggled along the Jaipur road towards the airport .
The two - lane road was clogged by an endless convoy of lorries .
Finally I arrived at Indira Gandhi International airport .
Despite the hour it was teeming with people .
The queues snaked around the airport and back to where they had started .
Foreign tourists stared in bewilderment .
Locals with the resigned look of those used to waiting .
I could not help feeling a sense of relief at being back in a country where things work
" Pretty much , " he sighed .
I was finally shepherded aboard the flight to Shanghai .
Next to me sat a friendly looking Indian man in shorts and running shoes .
" Is this your first trip to China ? " he asked me .
" No , " I replied , " I live there . "
" Really , " he said , his interest piqued , " what should I expect ? "
" I think , " I said , " you should expect to be surprised . "
Jaw dropping
Six hours later , our plane taxied to a halt in front of the soaring glass and steel of Shanghai 's Pudong International Airport .
In Delhi I had been shocked to see thousands of people sleeping rough on the streets every night , nothing but the few rags they slept in to call their own
" I was not expecting this , " he said , his eyes wide in wonder .
" Oh no , I definitely was not expecting this " .
I also found myself looking at China afresh .
Later that day as I drove home from Beijing airport along the smooth six - lane highway I could not help feeling a sense of relief at being back in a country where things work .
And it was not just the airports and roads .
Driving through a village on the edge of Beijing I was struck by how well everyone was dressed .
In Delhi , I had been shocked to see thousands of people sleeping rough on the streets every night , nothing but the few rags they slept in to call their own .
Even deep in China 's countryside that is not something you will see .
In Delhi I had been told of the wonders of India 's new economy , of the tens of thousands of bright young graduates churning out the world 's latest computer software .
I thought of China 's new economy , of the tens of millions of rural migrants who slave away in factories , making everything from plimsolls to plasma televisions .
And of the same rural migrants , heading home to their villages at Chinese New Year festival loaded down with gifts , their pockets stuffed full of cash .
China is not a free society , and it has immense problems .
But its successes should not be underestimated .
They are ones that India , even with its open and democratic society , is still far from matching .

If President Bush continues to ask North Korea to " kneel , " war " will be inevitable , " and it would begin on the Korean Peninsula , North Korean Gen .
Ri Chan Bok told " Good Morning America " anchor Diane Sawyer , in an exclusive interview inside North Korea .
President Bush wants the country to kneel down , Ri said , and North Koreans cannot agree with that .
Sawyer visited the general in a ceremonial hall .
For decades , the general has been in charge of the flash point demilitarized zone , the 2.5 - mile stretch between North Korea and South Korea .
In the interview , Sawyer read
Ri the president 's statement warning of grave consequences for North Korea should the nation continue nuclear testing or transfer nuclear technologies to third - party countries .
She asked whether the general had a reaction .
Ri told Sawyer that he did n't tend to believe what Bush said .
" Can the general guarantee or reassure the American people that this nuclear information will not be passed to terrorists ? "
Sawyer asked .
" We have nuclear weapons to defend our country and our people , " he said .
The general said he could guarantee that these weapons were to defend North Korea and not to earn money or be sent to third parties .
He added that North Korea did not have a relationship with terrorist organizations .
Sawyer asked him what the words of North Korea meant when leaders said there would be a merciless blow in response to any sanctions .
Ri said he could n't say specifically , but pointed out that North Korea had short - and long - range missiles .
Sawyer asked whether the country 's nuclear technology was weaponized and whether it could be loaded on missiles .
He would not say whether he could nuclearize the country 's weapons , but said to be assured that the country had the facilities to deliver nuclear weapons .
" North Korea is ready , " he said .
When talking about the possibility of talks , the general said the country did n't care if the talks were bilateral or six - party , but he said the sanctions must be lifted for progress to begin .
He said if all this happened , then North Korea would be ready to stand down on its nuclear program .
The general also had a message for President Bush .
" He keeps talking about North Korea as the ' axis of evil , ' as an outpost of tyranny , as an unacceptable government that makes its own people hungry , " he said .
" We would ask him please to stop making these bad comments on our nation , and I 'm speaking not just for myself but for all people in this country . "
The procedure would take about 10 hours
Doctors in the US have already carried out the procedure on bodies donated for medical research .
Now the Cleveland Clinic team will choose a patient whose face is disfigured to receive a " new " face from a dead donor .
The chance it will work is around 50 % and experts have expressed safety and ethical concerns about the procedure .
A new face
The recipient would have to take powerful anti-rejection drugs for life , which carry considerable long - term health risks , says the Royal College of Surgeons of England , which formed a working party to look at the issue earlier this year .
Also , it is not known how well an individual and their loved ones would adapt psychologically to a completely new face .
There are a great many questions to which answers are needed
Changing Faces charity
It is hard to predict what the person would look like after a face transplant .
The procedure would involve taking skin and underlying tissues from a dead donor and placing them on the living recipient .
Computer modelling suggests the new face would neither resemble the donor nor recipient 's pre-injury self .
The face should take on more of the characteristics of the skeleton of the recipient than the soft tissues of the donor .
The recipient should be able to eat , drink and communicate again through a wide variety of facial expressions and mannerisms .
Picking a patient
The working party said it was not against facial transplants in theory , saying they could offer a major breakthrough in restoration of quality of life to those whose faces have been destroyed by accidents or disease .
You want to choose patients who are really disfigured , not someone who has a little scar
Surgeon Maria Siemionow
But it cautioned : " Until there is further research and the prospect of better control of these complications , it would be unwise to proceed with human facial transplantation . "
After a year of discussions , the Cleveland Clinic won approval to go ahead with the operation from an internal review board , which included surgeons , psychiatrists , social workers , therapists , nurses and patient advocates .
Surgeon Maria Siemionow and her team will interview five men and seven women as potential candidates for the 8 - 10 hour operation .
Dr Siemionow told Associated Press : " You want to choose patients who are really disfigured , not someone who has a little scar . "
Yet they will have to have enough healthy skin for traditional grafts in case the transplant fails .
They will be told that their face would be removed and replaced with one from a cadaver , matched for tissue type , age , sex and skin colour .
Charity Changing Faces said : " There are a great many questions to which answers are needed before this extremely risky and experimental surgery could be considered a viable option for patients with severe facial disfigurements .
" It is our view that today 's excellent conventional surgery combined with the very best psychological and social rehabilitation programmes can very effectively enable patients with severe disfigurements to live full and active lives .
" The continuing speculation about face transplants is not helpful for people with disfigurements . "
The current american ' marketplace of ideas ' is the scene of the crime for ' invisible hand ' jobs performed at 1080 p .

Children have long been caught up in Sri Lanka 's conflict
A senior UN official said there was " credible evidence " that troops had rounded up children to fight with the renegade rebel group led by Col Karuna .
His faction split from the Tamil Tigers , long accused of using children .
Sri Lankan security forces say they are " perturbed " by the " completely misleading " allegations .
A Karuna spokesman also denied the allegations , saying his group merely offered protection to children fleeing fighting with the rival Tamil Tigers .
Complicity
But Allan Rock , a special adviser to the UN representative for children and armed conflict , said government forces had forcibly rounded up young Tamil children to fight with Col Karuna 's group .
" We encountered both direct and indirect evidence of ... complicity and participation , " he said of the government security services .
Sri Lankan security forces rounded up children to be recruited by the Karuna faction
Allan Rock , UN official
Child soldiers : Your views Death and discipline Analysis : Child soldiers
The BBC's Dumeetha Luthra , in Colombo , says the allegation , the first of its kind made by the UN against the Sri Lankan military , follows a 10 - day fact - finding mission .
The army has long denied allegations that it actively supports the efforts of the rebel faction led by Col Karuna , following his split from the Tamil Tigers in 2004 .
' Corroding law '
Mr Rock spoke of 13 and 14 - year - old children being kidnapped from villages , and no arrests or investigation being carried out by the security forces .
He said there was both eyewitness and anecdotal evidence to back up his claims .
In a statement the Sri Lankan Armed forces said Mr Rock 's claims that government troops were actively involved in the recruitment of child soldiers were " regrettable " .
" Security forces ... vehemently deny having any involvement whatsoever with the LTTE breakaway group for abductions in Batticaloa . "
Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse has promised a full investigation into the allegations .
Mr Rock said the fact that Sri Lankan troops were complicit in the recruitment of child soldiers meant that Tamil Tiger rebels would continue to do so , as it corroded the rule of law .
At least 2,000 people have been killed in violence this year in Sri Lanka , the military and ceasefire monitors say .
The Tamil Tigers are fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east of the country , and claim that ethnic Tamils have suffered decades of discrimination at the hands of Sri Lanka 's Sinhalese majority .
Study : Chemotherapy can alter brain by killing cells Doctors once dismissed complaints of " chemobrain , " a common side effect of cancer therapy in which patients experience memory problems or mental fuzziness .
Research now shows that chemotherapy can cause real changes in the brain , ranging from forgetfulness to seizures , vision loss and even dementia .
More than 80 % of cancer patients develop memory and concentration problems , according to a study in June from the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York .
In a paper in today 's Journal of Biology , scientists found that even low levels of chemotherapy can kill brain cells .
The study showed that cancer drugs were even more toxic to healthy cells than to malignant ones , says Mark Noble , a professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
Noble tested three common chemo drugs — cisplatin , cytarabine and carmustine — on rats and in human cells in lab dishes .
Chemo killed 40 % to 80 % of cancer cells , but 70 % to 100 % of healthy brain cells .
Some of the normal cells continued to die for several weeks after treatment , according to the study , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the James P. Wilmot Foundation .
Significantly , chemo killed not just rapidly dividing cells — the typical target of cancer therapy — but brain cells that were n't reproducing , including those responsible for creating the insulation around nerve cells , Noble says .
This insulation is important because it helps nerve signals travel quickly .
Other recent studies also document chemo's effects on the brain .
In a study to be published in January in Cancer , researchers studying breast cancer patients found that chemo may temporarily shrink certain brain areas .
And in a small study published last month in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment , Daniel Silverman of the University of California - Los Angeles found that women with chemobrain symptoms had changes in the functioning of their brain 's frontal cortex .
Silverman , head of UCLA 's neuronuclear imaging section , says Noble 's paper does n't definitively prove that killing brain cells causes cognitive problems .
He says something else may actually cause chemobrain .
To really prove the connection between chemobrain and cell death , Silverman says , researchers should repeat the experiments , but also test the lab rats to see if those who lost brain cells have more trouble than others on intelligence tests .
But Patricia Duffner , a professor at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute at the University of Buffalo , says Noble 's study is " likely to act as a wake - up call . "
Doctors have long recognized that radiation can damage the brain , says Duffner , who wrote a review accompanying Noble 's article .
She says researchers should look more closely at ways to protect the brain from chemotherapy .
" It was imperative to define the problem , " Noble says .
" Now it is imperative to find ways to treat it . "
On his CNN TV program , Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post interviewed Thomas Ricks , the Post 's Pentagon reporter and author of the book Fiasco : The American Military Adventure in Iraq .
Ricks told Kurtz , " One of the things that is going on , according to some U.S. military analysts , is that Israel purposely has left pockets of Hezbollah rockets in Lebanon , because as long as they 're being rocketed , they can continue to have a sort of moral equivalency in their operations in Lebanon . "
Kurtz responded , " Hold on , you 're suggesting that Israel has deliberately allowed Hezbollah to retain some of its fire power , essentially for PR purposes , because having Israeli civilians killed helps them in the public relations war here ? "
Ricks replied , " Yes , that 's what military analysts have told me . "
Kurtz remarked " that 's an extraordinary testament to the notion that having people on your own side killed actually works to your benefit in that nobody wants to see your own citizens killed but it works to your benefit in terms of the battle of perceptions here . "
Ricks replied " It helps you with the moral high ground problem , because you know your operations in Lebanon are going to be killing civilians as well . "
I really am naive .
I did not expect this degree of unpreparedness and incompetence .
I did not expect this even though I knew that the Bush administration is worse than you can imagine , even after having taken account of the fact that it is worse than you can imagine .
Paul Krugman more than half expected this .
Another sign that he 's wiser and more reality - based than I am :
Paul Krugman A Can't - Do Government - New York Times : Before 9/11 the Federal Emergency Management Agency listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters facing America : a terrorist attack on New York , a major earthquake in San Francisco and a hurricane strike on New Orleans ....
So why were New Orleans and the nation so unprepared ?
After 9/11 , hard questions were deferred in the name of national unity , then buried under a thick coat of whitewash ....
Why have aid and security taken so long to arrive ?
Katrina hit five days ago - and it was already clear by last Friday that Katrina could do immense damage along the Gulf Coast ....
[ T ]he evidence points , above all , to a stunning lack of both preparation and urgency in the federal government 's response .
Even military resources in the right place were n't ordered into action .
" On Wednesday , " said an editorial in The Sun Herald in Biloxi , Miss. , " reporters listening to horrific stories of death and survival at the Biloxi Junior High School shelter looked north across Irish Hill Road and saw Air Force personnel playing basketball and performing calisthenics . " ...
Why was n't more preventive action taken ?...
[ T ]he Army Corps of Engineers ...
" never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in Iraq , as well as homeland security - coming at the same time as federal tax cuts - was the reason for the strain . "
In 2002 the corps ' chief resigned , reportedly under threat of being fired , after he criticized the administration 's proposed cuts in the corps ' budget , including flood - control spending ....
Did the Bush administration destroy FEMA 's effectiveness ?
The administration has , by all accounts , treated the emergency management agency like an unwanted stepchild ....
Last year James Lee Witt , who won bipartisan praise for his leadership of the agency during the Clinton years , said at a Congressional hearing : " I am extremely concerned that the ability of our nation to prepare for and respond to disasters has been sharply eroded .
I hear from emergency managers , local and state leaders , and first responders nearly every day that the FEMA they knew and worked well with has now disappeared . "
I do n't think this is a simple tale of incompetence .
The reason the military was n't rushed in to help along the Gulf Coast is , I believe , the same reason nothing was done to stop looting after the fall of Baghdad .
Flood control was neglected for the same reason our troops in Iraq did n't get adequate armor ....
[ O ] ur current leaders just are n't serious about ... the essential functions of government ....
Yesterday Mr. Bush made an utterly fantastic claim : that nobody expected the breach of the levees .
In fact , there had been repeated warnings about exactly that risk ....
America ... has a can't - do government that makes excuses instead of doing its job ...
Nor did I expect blame - the - victim to start so early , especially not from federal officials who did nothing to roll a single busload of refugees out of New Orleans before the hurricane hit .
Tim Burke writes :
Tim Burke : Michael Brown , director of FEMA , may or may not be incompetent in technical terms .
But blaming people for not evacuating , and that 's exactly what he 's doing ....
It 's a kind of whining , an anti-leadership .
What , he thinks it is not appropriate to talk now about why megamillions in contingency planning failed so grotesquely but it is appropriate right now to scapegoat people who mostly lacked the means to evacuate and were provisioned with no meaningful assistance in evacuating ?
Yes , some people just decided to stay , for a variety of reasons .
However , look at the people we 've been seeing on television : it 's plain that many of them could not get out unless someone expressly helped them get out .
There was no consistent provision of such assistance ....
There 's ... the ability of political and bureaucratic leaders as well as pundits and ordinary folk to show a kind of common - sense decency in grappling with the situation , in understanding its meaning to us as human beings ....
There are many leaders and observers and ordinary folk who are making me proud to be American .
Michael Brown makes me feel the opposite .
Jonah Goldberg , cracking cheap jokes about Waterworld and then making a non-apology apology that 's almost worse , makes me feel the opposite .
Whomever the deranged assholes are who are shooting at helicopters and threatening to loot hospitals make me feel the opposite .
There are two tests here : can we do better as a society in understanding and solving major problems , and can we be decent , can we demonstrate character ...
And here we have FEMA head Michael Brown :
WSJ.com - Katrina News Tracker : FEMA 's Michael Brown tells Ted Koppel : " We were not prepared " for the thousands of people who did not evacuate the city despite calls to do so .
" We move in when its safe to move in , we worked with the state . "
Jim Henley is polite in response :
Unqualified Offerings : The Hurricane Pam exercise ( discussed downblog ) leaves no doubt that federal , state and local agencies recognized in advance that hundreds of thousands of people would remain behind because they were too poor to get out .
The White House itself was briefed .
So it 's beyond unforgiveable for people like Brown and Chertoff to pepper their comments with " people who chose to stay behind "s .
Kevin Drum is a little less polite :
The Washington Monthly : EVACUATING THE POOR ....
Why did so many people who lacked the means to evacuate New Orleans get left behind ?
Brian Wolshon , an engineering professor at Louisiana State University who served as a consultant on the state 's evacuation plan , said little attention was paid to moving out New Orleans 's " low - mobility " population -- the elderly , the infirm and the poor without cars or other means of fleeing the city , about 100,000 people .
At disaster planning meetings , he said , " the answer was often silence . "
It 's not that no one had thought of this problem .
They just did n't consider it important enough to spend any time on .
Patrick Nielsen
Hayden cannot be polite any longer :
Making Light : Another term for it would be " lying sack of shit " :
The director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Thursday those New Orleans residents who chose not to heed warnings to evacuate before Hurricane Katrina bear some responsibility for their fates .
Michael Brown also agreed with other public officials that the death toll in the city could reach into the thousands .
" Unfortunately , that 's going to be attributable a lot to people who did not heed the advance warnings , " Brown told CNN .
" I do n't make judgments about why people chose not to leave but , you know , there was a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans , " he said ....
Asked later on CNN how he could blame the victims , many of whom could not flee the storm because they had no transportation or were too frail to evacuate on their own , Brown said he was not blaming anyone .
" Now is not the time to be blaming , " Brown said .
Summing up :
If you did n't leave New Orleans before the storm , your problems are your own fault .
Not that we " make judgements " , of course .
And remember , " now is not the time to be blaming . "
And the thought briefly , briefly penetrates Jonah Goldberg 's lizard brain that he's on the side of the bad guys :
Rising Hegemon :
No longer such a joke is it ? : Jonah Goldberg has something rare in today 's Republican enablers ... an attack of guilt .
So the question is , would the money have been better spent if the Republicans had n't gotten their way ?
And , though it sickens me to say so , that is at best an open question .
I have the utmost faith in the kleptocratic and dysfunctional governments of New Orleans and Louisiana to waste and steal money .
But , we were supposed to be preparing -- at the national level -- for a major terrorist attack for the last four years .
I just do n't see much evidence of that preparation .
Congress re-assembled lickity - split to deal with Terri Schiavo -- a decision that did n't and does not bother me the way it bothers some .
But however you define the issues involved in that case , in terms of real human suffering they are very hard to stack - up against what 's happened in New Orleans .
Congress should have convened yesterday and rescinded the highway bill .
It should have broken - open the farm bill like a piñata and reallocated the monies therein .
But the moment is brief .
In the next paragraph all sign of intelligent thought vanishes :
For supporters of the war , this spectacle is going to be particularly hard to accomodate because it is in the interests of the political classes to keep their pork and it is in the interests of the antiwar left to frame this as a choice between Baghdad and New Orleans ...
Impeach George W. Bush .
Impeach him now .
We 've seen it before : an embattled president so swathed in his inner circle that he completely loses touch with the public and wanders around among small knots of people who agree with him .
There was Lyndon Johnson in the 1960's , Richard Nixon in the 1970's , and George H. W. Bush in the 1990's .
Now it 's his son 's turn .
It has been obvious for months that Americans do n't believe the war is going just fine , and they needed to hear that President Bush gets that .
They wanted to see that he had learned from his mistakes and adjusted his course , and that he had a measurable and realistic plan for making Iraq safe enough to withdraw United States troops .
Americans did n't need to be convinced of Mr. Bush 's commitment to his idealized version of the war .
They needed to be reassured that he recognized the reality of the war .
Instead , Mr. Bush traveled 32 miles from the White House to the Naval Academy and spoke to yet another of the well - behaved , uniformed audiences that have screened him from the rest of America lately .
If you do not happen to be a midshipman , you 'd have to have been watching cable news at midmorning on a weekday to catch him .
The address was accompanied by a voluminous handout entitled " National Strategy for Victory in Iraq , " which the White House grandly calls the newly declassified version of the plan that has been driving the war .
If there was something secret about that plan , we can't figure out what it was .
The document , and Mr. Bush 's speech , were almost entirely a rehash of the same tired argument that everything 's going just fine .
Mr. Bush also offered the usual false choice between sticking to his policy and beating a hasty and cowardly retreat .
Mr Masri is seeking damages from the CIA
Munich prosecutors confirmed that the warrants were linked to the case of Khaled al - Masri , a German national of Lebanese descent .
Mr Masri says he was seized in Macedonia , flown to a secret prison in Afghanistan and mistreated there .
He says he was released in Albania five months later when the Americans realised they had the wrong man .
Mr Masri says his case is an example of the US policy of " extraordinary rendition " - a practice whereby the US government flies foreign terror suspects to third countries without judicial process for interrogation or detention .
Code names
Prosecutors in Munich said in a statement that the city 's court had issued the warrants on suspicion of abduction and grievous bodily harm .
The suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so - called code names of CIA agents
Munich prosecutors ' statement
EU states knew of flights
The information on which the warrants were based came from Mr Masri 's lawyers and a journalist and officials in Spain , where the flight carrying Mr Masri is thought to have originated .
The names and nationalities concerned were not released but prosecutors said the names identified were thought to be the code names of CIA agents .
" The investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects , " they said .
Speaking at a news conference , Mr Masri 's lawyer , Manfred Gnjidic , said the arrest warrants were " a very important step in the rehabilitation of Masri " .
" It shows us that we were right in putting our trust in the German authorities and the German prosecutors , " he said .
German arrest warrants are not valid in the US but if the suspects were to travel to the European Union they could be arrested .
Italian case
Mr Masri says he was abducted by US agents in the Macedonian capital , Skopje , on 31 December 2003 .
He is seeking to sue the US government over his detention , but in May a judge dismissed a lawsuit he filed against the CIA , citing national security considerations .
The US government is not assisting the German authorities with the case .
Meanwhile in the Italian city of Milan , court hearings to decide whether to indict 25 alleged CIA agents and several Italians accused of kidnapping a Muslim cleric in 2003 are under way .
Osama Mustafa Hassan , or Abu Omar , says he was abducted from the streets of Milan and then tortured in Egypt .
If the case proceeds to trial , it would be the first criminal prosecution over America 's rendition policy .
The practice has drawn widespread criticism from human rights groups , legal experts and the international community .
But last week a European Parliament committee approved a report saying EU states knew about secret CIA flights over Europe , the abduction of terror suspects by US agents and the existence of clandestine detention camps .
Meine Familie und ich nicht
Die Qualitätsprobleme des „ Spiegels “ und die neue Titelgeschichte zum Kindermangel der Deutschen
Kinder , Kinder , war das ein Spiegel - Titel !
Verfasser Matthias Matussek hat den Untergang der deutschen Familie mit der Präzision einer Dampfwalze nachgezeichnet .
Kein Mutterglück nirgends , „ nicht einmal in Zeiten der Pest “ gab es weniger Gebärfreude .
Und die seltenen Kids , die noch zur Welt kommen , sind entweder adipös und motorikgestört , oder die Eltern lassen sie verhungern .
Oder marodierende türkisch - arabische Jugendbanden „ im Dschungel Neuköllns “ machen sie nieder .
Der Rest sind lauter kleine ETs .
O - Ton Matussek : „ Kinder , die heute zur Welt kommen , werden von den Eltern beäugt wie Außerirdische . “
Matussek , ganz Vulgärapokalyptiker , zeigt das Bild einer untergehenden Gesellschaft im Gebärstreik .
Gleichzeitig betet er die Konkursmasse der bürgerlichen Familie mit religiöser Inbrunst an .
Die Familie als „ Kernzelle unseres Lebens , unserer Menschwerdung “ sei von den 68er Kommunarden „ zertrümmert “ worden , weint er , und mit ihr „ das Urvertrauen “ .
Ideologischen Input für sein krudes Familienepos erhielt der Spiegel - Mann von FAZ - Herausgeber Frank Schirrmacher , dessen Buch „ Minimum “ über den „ biologischen GAU “ im deutschen Kinderzimmer er mit dem Eifer eines katholischen Ministranten nacherzählt .
Schirrmacher darf dann auch noch im Spiegel - Gespräch seine verquasten Thesen zur „ Überlebensfabrik Familie “ ausbreiten .
Interviewer Matussek gibt den kritiklosen Claqueur und findet , dass die kinderlosen Deutschen eine „ kulturelle Lücke “ reißen , in die der „ familienstarke Islam hineinstößt “ .
Gleitgel dabei ist „ die Identitätsschwäche der atomisierten westlichen Gesellschaft “ .
So viel intellektueller Magerquark war den Spiegel - Kollegen , die von dem Kulturchef mit den extrabreiten Hosenträgern einiges gewohnt sind , dann doch zu viel .
Empörung , Fassungslosigkeit und schlichte Scham kennzeichneten die montägliche Blattkritik , bei der Matussek fehlte .
Die Titelgeschichte wurde von allen Seiten als „ rein ideologisch “ , „ weitgehend faktenfrei “ oder als „ gedruckte Jesuitenpredigt “ abgekanzelt .
Auch Redakteure des Berliner Büros hatten ihr Entsetzen formuliert .
Der Geist der 50er - Jahre und „ biologistische Weltsichten “ machten sich breit .
Chefredakteur Stefan Aust ertrug die Blattkritik wie ein Dackel den Gewitterregen .
Er selbst hatte den Titel bei Matussek bestellt – eine Neuauflage der Kumpanei zwischen Schirrmacher und dem Spiegel - Chefredakteur , bei der die Bücher der jeweils anderen Seite hochgejazzt werden .
Für die Kritiker im eigenen Haus sind die Qualitätsprobleme des Spiegels mit diesem Titel dramatisch bestätigt worden .
Auch sonst wimmelt es vor Fehlern .
Der neue Bundespräsident ist plötzlich erst „ seit einem Dreivierteljahr “ im Amt ( Seite 30 ) , für Arbeit ist neuerdings Wirtschaftsminister Glos zuständig ( S. 22 ) und der Fraktionsgeschäftsführer der Union heißt jetzt Rüttgers statt Röttgen .
Und dies noch : Matussek und Schirrmacher , die beiden Granden des Spiegel - Titels , bringen es zusammen auf gerade zwei Kinderchen und ziemlich bunte familiäre Verhältnisse .
Obacht , dass da nicht der Islamist hineinstößt .

HOWTO : using gprof with multithreaded applications
What is gprof ?
gprof is the GNU Profiler , a tool used when tracking which functions are eating CPU in your program .
Anyway , you should already be familiar with it if you got interested in this page .
One problem with gprof under certain kernels ( such as Linux ) is that it does n’t behave correctly with multithreaded applications .
It actually only profiles the main thread , which is quite useless .
Workaround
There is an easy , but surprisingly not very widespread fix for this annoying gprof behaviour .
Basically , gprof uses the internal ITIMER_PROF timer which makes the kernel deliver a signal to the application whenever it expires .
So we just need to pass this timer data to all spawned threads .
Example
It would n’t be too hard to put a call to setitimer in each function spawned by a thread , but I thought it would be more elegant to implement a wrapper for pthread_create .
Daniel Jönsson enhanced my code so that it could be used in a preload library without having to modify the program .
It can also be very useful for libraries that spawn threads without warning , such as libSDL .
The result code is shown below and can be downloaded ( gprof - helper . c ) :
Jokes , observations , how the world should run ... you get the idea .
Kind of like Howard Stern with shorter hair or David Letterman with , well , hair .
Not really for kids .
On a good day , I 'd like to think it 's funny like Jon Stewart or Lewis Black .
On a bad day it 's funny like old mayonnaise .
Enjoy ... please .
Last month , we reported on yet another election botched by defective Diebold voting machines .
Maryland primaries were plagued by machine crashes and human error , leading Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. to insist that the state shelve the $ 100 million voting machines and return to paper ballots until the problems could be resolved .
The state Board of Elections administrator vowed to " work around the clock " and put pressure on Diebold to ensure that the machines worked for the upcoming election .
During a mock election yesterday intended to test Diebold 's latest fixes , the problems continued but with much less severity .
How did Diebold fix the most serious problems that affected the digital poll books and voting machines ?
The company provided a mouse for each of the touchscreen devices , and insisted that users refrain from touching the screen .
That 's right , the Diebold touchscreens do n't like to be touched .
When a user neglected to heed Diebold 's warning and operated the electronic poll book by touching the screen during the mock election , the device lost synchronization with other poll books and had to be rebooted .
The company claims that it can develop a software fix for the problem , and they have offered to either provide the state with 5,500 mice or install the software update so that the touchscreen can be used .
Although many of the other problems with the machines seem to have been resolved , and crashes are no longer frequent occurrences , Governor Ehrlich remains unimpressed .
The Republican Governor , who attended the mock election test run , continues to encourage voters to use absentee ballots in order to avoid the flawed machines .
Diebold has been hit with a steady stream of bad press for the past two years .
Already banned in some states , the voting machine company 's products are a frequent target of criticism as security experts continue to find egregious flaws in the technology , including vulnerability to self - propagating viruses .
The voting machines recently disrupted elections in Alaska , where the state Democratic Party now considers voting machine accountability a high political priority .
With considerable criticism from both sides of the political aisle in multiple states , it is hard to believe that anybody is willing to buy these machines at all .
The Maryland election will be a major test .
If it runs smoothly , it will be an indication that the technical problems with the machines can be resolved .
Even if that is the case , security experts believe that the machines will have to be completely replaced in order to eliminate the most serious security defects .
Without a paper - trail and the ability to perform election audits , voters will never be certain that the machines properly functioned .
When John Buettner of Chestertown , Md. , wants to buy books , he heads to a used bookstore .
The price is right , he says , and " there is a certain ' hunting ' appeal to the whole process . "
George Simpson of New York takes a different approach :
He goes to his computer and shops for used books online .
A few clicks of the mouse , a few taps of the keys , and his order is complete .
Both men represent enthusiastic customers in one of the fastest - growing segments of the book industry : used books .
Last year , US consumers spent more than $ 2.2 billion to buy 111 million used books .
That 's up 11 percent from 2003 , according to a landmark study by the Book Industry Study Group .
Most significantly , the growth is happening on the Internet .
Online sales of used trade books - those aimed at a general audience - jumped 33 percent last year .
By contrast , trade - book sales at traditional bookstores rose 4.6 percent .
" Used trade books have been growing 25 percent a year , " says Jeff Hayes , group director of InfoTrends / CAP Ventures , a research firm in Weymouth , Mass .
" New trade books are growing only a couple percent a year . "
As these " pre-owned " volumes become an increasingly popular choice for millions of readers , they are shaking off their once - dusty image .
They are also beginning to shake up an industry that until now has paid little attention to them .
Publishers and authors worry that they will siphon off sales from new books .
Others see their rising allure as part of an emerging shift in how Americans view ownership .
" The used - book market is just beginning to burgeon , " says Dan Nissanoff , author of the forthcoming book " Futureshop . "
" Culturally , buying used books as a way to acquire a book is becoming mainstream and acceptable . "
He traces the shift to an " auction culture " that " promotes temporary ownership as an efficient way to live a better life .
" We 've historically been a society that accumulates , that views acquisition as permanent , " Mr. Nissanoff continues .
" Now channels such as Amazon.com , eBay , and Barnes & Noble have made it easy for us not only to buy books but sell our books as well .
They 're accelerating the auction culture and pushing this behavior to the mainstream .
It 's beginning to have a big impact on the book industry . "
Buyers of used books span all ages and demographic groups .
Less than 3 percent of consumers buy only used books , Mr. Hayes says .
About 30 percent purchase new books exclusively .
The majority buy both .
" The more avid readers are much more likely to buy both new and used , " Hayes says .
" Those who buy only a few titles a year buy new . "
Adding to the appeal of used books is the increasing availability of " gently used " books in excellent condition , often for sale soon after publication .
Referring to the books he purchases online , Mr. Simpson says , " I have never gotten one that was n't nearly new in condition . "
Stephen Andrews , book review editor of the Journal of American History , explains the appeal that secondhand titles hold for him .
" A used book has more value than a new one because it has passed through someone 's hands , acquired notation and comments , and become a living thing .
I 'm less interested in books that are in pristine condition . "
Mr. Andrews 's wife , Elizabeth , describes him as an " avid buyer of used books , with packages arriving almost every day from Amazon . "
Hardcovers account for the majority of sales of used books , Hayes says .
Yet Rich Fitzpatrick , owner of the Braintree ( Mass . )
Book Rack , finds the market for used hardcovers " very weak . "
He sells most used hardcovers for a dollar , but used paperbacks are priced at $ 3 or $ 4 .
Customers like the portability of paperbacks , he says .
For customers , the widespread availability of used books offers many advantages .
" The Internet creates a whole new market and almost a whole new pricing , " says Richard Davies , a spokesman for online bookseller Abebooks.com .
" You have a series of prices lined up side by side , " which gives buyers choices .
One issue the study does not answer is the impact that used book sales are having on new book sales .
" That remains an open question , " says Jeff Abraham , executive director of the Book Industry Study Group .
" Some people might argue that it cannibalizes new book sales .
Some argue that it spurs new book sales by making more books available and by bringing them to new locations . "
Whatever the answer to that question , not every customer is lured by the siren call of Internet bookselling .
" To me , roaming along the shelves of a used book store is like searching for seashells along the beach , " says Michael Robertson of Charleston , S.C. " Sometimes I leave the store with a full pail , other times I do not . "
Booksellers like Mr. Fitzpatrick also remain optimistic that there will always be bricks - and - mortar stores , and room for a variety of ways of marketing the printed word .
" We 're doing great , " he says , although he notes that two used - book exchanges in nearby suburbs have closed within the past month .
" There are a lot of doomsayers .
But my attitude is , for the last 400 years a lot of people have been making a good living selling books , and I think that will continue . "
High resolution 4 Pi microscopy vs. traditional confocal microscopy .
3 - dimensional 4 Pi microscopy visualization of Hela H2AX ( green ) and gamma - H2AX ( red ) chromatin clusters at 100 nm resolution ( center image ) is shown in front of a traditional overview z - projected data stack of HeLa cells stained for H2AX , gamma -H2AX and DAPI taken with a confocal microscope .
Confocal light microscopy has been an important tool for biomedical scientists as they work to unravel molecular events occurring within human cells .
Less than two decades ago , an important advance in microscopy technology was achieved with Dr. Stefan Hell ’s invention of “ 4 Pi microscopy . ”
Recently developed and commercialized by Leica Microsystems , 4 Pi technology offers a significant increase in resolution ; however , fundamental optical limitations prevented scientists from visualizing molecules in the cell ’s nucleus using this new method .
Now , through the work of Brian Bennett , PhD , of the University of Massachusetts Medical School ( UMMS ) Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Pharmacology and Leica Microsystems , UMMS Associate Professor of Biochemistry & Molecular Pharmacology Kendall Knight , PhD , and collaborator Jörg Bewersdorf , PhD , of the Institute for Molecular Biophysics at The Jackson Laboratory , this limitation has been overcome — for the first time high resolution 4 Pi microscope images of endogenous nuclear proteins in human cells have been realized .
In “ H2AX chromatin structures and their response to DNA damage revealed by 4 Pi microscopy , ” published online this week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Drs. Bewersdorf , Bennett and Knight used the Leica TCS 4 Pi microscope to examine histones , nuclear proteins that are involved in packaging and protecting DNA as well as in processes that repair damaged DNA .
Exposure to environmental carcinogens can lead to a particularly devastating form of DNA damage , DNA double - strand breaks .
The occurrence of such DNA breaks invokes a rapid and highly coordinated series of molecular events within the nucleus , and defects in this process correlate with increased risks for cancer , as well as developmental and immunological abnormalities .
Bewersdorf , Bennett and Knight examined a specific histone protein , H2AX .
Within seconds after DNA damage has occurred , H2AX undergoes a subtle but functionally significant molecular modification , which in turn plays an important role in coordinating the recruitment of proteins that will repair the break .
Prior to these results , researchers had been unable to visualize how H2AX is distributed throughout the nucleus .
However , this study provides never - before - seen high resolution 3D images of H2AX , demonstrating that it exists in distinct clusters that are themselves evenly distributed throughout the entire nuclear volume .
This finding suggests that H2AX clusters provide a platform from which signaling and repair events can be coordinated .
Additionally , high resolution 4 Pi images of modified H2AX reveal for the first time the complex three - dimensional character and dynamics of molecular associations that occur at the site of a DNA break .
“ We are very excited to have finally overcome the obstacle that had prevented visualization of nuclear proteins , ” said Bennett , who devised the solution enabling the use of 4 Pi microscopy during his PhD thesis work in the Knight lab .
“ The collaborations between myself , Drs. Knight and Bewersdorf , and those at Leica Microsystems were critical in achieving this first step .
We look forward to continuing our investigations with the analysis of other nuclear proteins involved in cancer prevention and the repair of DNA damage . ”

When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad writers .
What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction , so I assumed that was the highest form of writing .
Mistake number one .
The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which people suffered in complicated ways .
Anything funny or gripping was ipso facto suspect , unless it was old enough to be hard to understand , like Shakespeare or Chaucer .
Mistake number two .
The ideal medium seemed the short story , which I 've since learned had quite a brief life , roughly coincident with the peak of magazine publishing .
But since their size made them perfect for use in high school classes , we read a lot of them , which gave us the impression the short story was flourishing .
Mistake number three .
And because they were so short , nothing really had to happen ; you could just show a randomly truncated slice of life , and that was considered advanced .
Mistake number four .
The result was that I wrote a lot of stories in which nothing happened except that someone was unhappy in a way that seemed deep .
For most of college I was a philosophy major .
I was very impressed by the papers published in philosophy journals .
They were so beautifully typeset , and their tone was just captivating — alternately casual and buffer - overflowingly technical .
A fellow would be walking along a street and suddenly modality qua modality would spring upon him .
I did n't ever quite understand these papers , but I figured I 'd get around to that later , when I had time to reread them more closely .
In the meantime I tried my best to imitate them .
This was , I can now see , a doomed undertaking , because they were n't really saying anything .
No philosopher ever refuted another , for example , because no one said anything definite enough to refute .
Needless to say , my imitations did n't say anything either .
In grad school I was still wasting time imitating the wrong things .
There was then a fashionable type of program called an expert system , at the core of which was something called an inference engine .
I looked at what these things did and thought " I could write that in a thousand lines of code . "
And yet eminent professors were writing books about them , and startups were selling them for a year 's salary a copy .
What an opportunity , I thought ; these impressive things seem easy to me ; I must be pretty sharp .
Wrong .
It was simply a fad .
The books the professors wrote about expert systems are now ignored .
They were not even on a path to anything interesting .
And the customers paying so much for them were largely the same government agencies that paid thousands for screwdrivers and toilet seats .
How do you avoid copying the wrong things ?
Copy only what you genuinely like .
That would have saved me in all three cases .
I did n't enjoy the short stories we had to read in English classes ; I did n't learn anything from philosophy papers ; I did n't use expert systems myself .
I believed these things were good because they were admired .
It can be hard to separate the things you like from the things you 're impressed with .
One trick is to ignore presentation .
Whenever I see a painting impressively hung in a museum , I ask myself : how much would I pay for this if I found it at a garage sale , dirty and frameless , and with no idea who painted it ?
If you walk around a museum trying this experiment , you 'll find you get some truly startling results .
Do n't ignore this data point just because it 's an outlier .
Another way to figure out what you like is to look at what you enjoy as guilty pleasures .
Many things people like , especially if they 're young and ambitious , they like largely for the feeling of virtue in liking them .
99 % of people reading Ulysses are thinking " I'm reading Ulysses " as they do it .
A guilty pleasure is at least a pure one .
What do you read when you do n't feel up to being virtuous ?
What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there 's only half of it left , instead of being impressed that you 're half way through ?
That 's what you really like .
Even when you find genuinely good things to copy , there 's another pitfall to be avoided .
Be careful to copy what makes them good , rather than their flaws .
It 's easy to be drawn into imitating flaws , because they 're easier to see , and of course easier to copy too .
For example , most painters in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries used brownish colors .
They were imitating the great painters of the Renaissance , whose paintings by that time were brown with dirt .
Those paintings have since been cleaned , revealing brilliant colors ; their imitators are of course still brown .
It was painting , incidentally , that cured me of copying the wrong things .
Halfway through grad school I decided I wanted to try being a painter , and the art world was so manifestly corrupt that it snapped the leash of credulity .
These people made philosophy professors seem as scrupulous as mathematicians .
It was so clearly a choice of doing good work xor being an insider that I was forced to see the distinction .
It 's there to some degree in almost every field , but I had till then managed to avoid facing it .
That was one of the most valuable things I learned from painting : you have to figure out for yourself what 's good .
You can't trust authorities .
They 'll lie to you on this one .

Why Apple Failed promised to reveal an accidental discovery that was key to Apple 's recovery .
The great minds of Slashdot took various guesses over the weekend , but here 's the real reason Apple was able to create new growth in the Mac platform .
Why Apple Bounced Back : Software
As noted in The Rise and Fall of Platforms : Planting Software Seeds , Apple had observed how Adobe 's PostScript technology had driven the development of desktop publishing as a killer application for the Mac , and hoped to similarly deliver the basis of a new wave of multimedia applications using its own QuickTime software .
QuickTime not only drove adoption of Macs , but it preserved the Mac platform through the 90s by helping to establish it in the field of content creation .
Why Apple Failed described how Apple was at the mercy of its developers , and particularly the four majors : Microsoft , Adobe , Macromedia , and Quark .
All four had originally established their graphic applications on the Mac , but were moving toward Windows .
Windows itself was the result of Microsoft seeking to broaden its sales of Word and Excel from the Mac onto DOS PCs .
As Windows gained adoption , it created a huge potential market for graphic applications that had only ever been available on the Mac .
Developers naturally followed Microsoft to reach that huge new market .
The Cross Platform Threat
Adobe , Quark , Macromedia and other Mac developers built their own in - house cross-platform development systems to allow them to deploy versions of their software on both Windows and the Mac .
This new style of " lowest common denominator " cross platform development resulted in Apple 's customers having fewer reasons to stick with the Mac platform .
Apple could invent all sorts of new software technologies , but if these features complicated developer 's cross - platform efforts , they simply would n't ever get adopted .
This helped to kill any value remaining in developments like PowerTalk and QuickDraw GX .
Adoption of new Apple features would add value to Macs , but did n't do anything for developers apart from making their work harder .
Third party developers were n't anti-Mac ; they were simply acting in their own best interests .
The same situation has also threatened Microsoft and other platform vendors ; both Sun 's Java and Netscape 's web platform threatened to create software that worked anywhere , which would erase any differentiation or value from Windows as a platform .
Microsoft worked hard to stop them .
DIY Software
Apple needed to differentiate the Mac platform with innovative software applications , but it increasingly had less and less power to do so , as big developers ignored its unique features and toolkits .
If Apple wanted unique applications for its Mac platform , it would have learn how to deliver them itself .
There was a huge risk involved : it seemed impossibly difficult to create software without angering third party developers .
Prior to the Mac , Apple had shipped its 1983 Lisa computer with a full suite of Apple designed office software .
The Lisa 's commercial failure was partly attributed to the perceived lack of opportunity for third party developers .
Realizing the importance of a healthy third party development ecosystem , Apple determined not to repeat the same mistake with the Macintosh .
When Apple released the Mac , it only shipped it with the simple MacWrite and MacPaint applications , which were supposed to serve as placeholder demonstrations .
However , third party developers were still annoyed that these Apple titles limited the potential market for retail software .
To placate these developers , Apple spun off its internally developed Mac software into a new Claris subsidiary in 1987 .
Claris later acquired the developer of the FileMaker and rebranded its various software titles with a common Claris look .
It eventually became Apple policy that all application software would be handled by Claris .
By the time NeXT arrived to reinvent Apple a decade later , the once innovative Claris software portfolio was largely dead , apart from its basic ClarisWorks suite and the popular FileMaker Pro .
The new Apple renamed Claris to FileMaker , Inc. and scraped the remains , apart from ClarisWorks , which Apple itself began to sell under the name AppleWorks .
After a decade of pointedly avoiding application software , Apple was now back in the development business , even if it did n't yet realize how important that would be to the Mac ’s recovery .
Apple Strikes Gold with KeyGrip
In the same late 90s timeframe , Macromedia hired the development team of Adobe 's Premier , lead by Randy Ubillos , in order to develop a rival new professional level video editing application based on QuickTime .
The product was tentatively called KeyGrip and then Final Cut .
Shortly after starting work on its " Premier killer , " Macromedia decided to stop competing directly with Adobe .
Instead , it would target the market for web development tools , and leave the video and print markets to Adobe .
Macromedia put the unfinished project up for sale , but could n't find a buyer .
Apple bought the product from Macromedia in 1998 to prevent it from simply being abandoned .
After being unable to find a developer interested in continuing work on it , Apple completed the project itself , releasing it the next year as Final Cut Pro .
What began as a fortunate accident would become Apple 's new killer app for the Mac .
Final Cut Pro Cleans Up
Final Cut Pro quickly destroyed Adobe 's Premier .
Apple 's new product was essentially an entirely reworked new version of Premier , while Adobe had let its Premier languish as it focused on graphic design and print production .
The desktop market for video editing was still small , so the challenge hardly mattered .
It was an easy victory .
Apple really broke ground with Final Cut Pro when it took on industry leader Avid .
Avid started out on the original Macintosh II in the late 80s , and had since become the leading vendor in delivering video editing workstations .
Initially , Final Cut Pro was n't seen as much of a threat .
The film industry was strongly entrenched behind Avid solutions , and Final Cut Pro only offered a limited subset of its features .
What Final Cut Pro did offer was easy access to the power of QuickTime .
It allowed both large and small studios to set up a relatively inexpensive Mac to do their simple post production tasks at much lower cost than if they were to tie up their own Avid , or have to rent access to an expensive Avid studio .
After allowing Apple an entry into professional post production and broadcast graphics , Final Cut Pro has been able to grow into a serious competitor .
The Turnaround Discovery
Final Cut Pro was a great demonstration of the flexibility of Quicktime , and importantly for Apple , distinguished the Mac platform .
Apple had canned the development of Final Cut for Windows , making Mac hardware the only way to run Final Cut Pro .
The new Apple suddenly discovered that the way to sell more Macs was to offer compelling new software that was only available on the Mac .
This might seem obvious in retrospect , but the company had been cautiously avoiding the application software market for over a decade .
Claris had even ported FileMaker to Windows .
The initial worry that bundled software would chill third party development had been overwhelmed by the much greater fear that the Mac would cease to matter unless Apple differentiated its platform with unique software , something that the big third party software developers saw no need to do .
Apple 's Software Explosion
Hot off the heels of Final Cut Pro 's emerging success as a new Mac application , the new Apple went on a buying frenzy to acquire other strategic software projects and their development teams .
In 2000 , Apple bought DVDirector and the DVD technology portfolio from Astarte GmBH , and hired its entire development team .
It released the product the next year as DVD Studio Pro .
Combined with Final Cut Pro , it supported an emerging new market of pro , freelance , and small corporate film studios producing their own DVDs .
In addition to professional level applications , Apple released iMovie in 2000 as a simple consumer version of its video editor , followed by iTunes and iDVD in 2001 , and iPhoto in 2002 .
Apple bundled all these applications with new Macs for free .
Suddenly users had compelling new reason to buy a Mac over a PC :
Macs came bundled with a lot of unique software that just worked .
It would cost a couple hundred bucks to assemble a similar suite from third party Windows developers .
That effectively erased the price advantage held by cheaper , low - end PC makers .
In 2002 , Apple acquired the high end video compositing software Shake in its purchase of Nothing Real , and then bought Emagic , a German software developer of professional level music studio tools .
Apple shocked analysts by dumping the Windows version of both Shake and Logic , and releasing new versions as Mac OS X only .
In 2003 , Apple bundled its consumer applications into a package called iLife , and began selling the new product for $ 49 , or about $ 15 per application .
It also launched Keynote , a new presentation application , as well as a new prosumer version of Final Cut Pro branded as Express .
The following year , Apple included a new consumer version of its music software as GarageBand , and a prosumer version called Logic Express .
Apple also released Motion as a new motion graphics application .
In 2005 , Apple launched Pages , which it bundled with Keynote to create a new business suite called iWork .
Apple refers to iWork as the ' in progress successor ' to AppleWorks .
Later in the year it introduced Aperture as a new pro photography post production tool ; earlier this year Apple added the iWeb to the iLife 06 suite .
Low Profit , High Value Software
From avoiding any software development at all under the Apple name , to becoming a significant developer of professional studio software , prosumer tools and two consumer suites , Apple clearly landed at the conclusion that it needed to deliver its own software or watch its Mac platform shrink into obscurity .
Apple did n't convert from a hardware company into a software developer however .
It continued to bundle iLife for free , and priced its retail versions of iWork and iLife at $ 79 .
At $ 15 - 40 per application , that leaves Apple 's consumer offerings in the price range of shareware .
Clearly , Apple is n't making huge revenues from developing consumer software .
It 's also not hard to understand why there is little competition in the market for personal content creation tools : there 's little profit .
Charging for annual updates allows Apple to follow the Notable Platform Lesson of incrementally advancing applications with regular , significant updates , creating real value for users and adding real value and differentiation to the Mac .
Selling Hardware with Software
Apple also released new hardware designed to exploit these software applications .
Apple added Firewire to all Macs especially for digital video work , and has updated its latest machines to all use optical digital audio ports ; few PCs offer either , particularly not in consumer models .
By building its own hardware , operating system , and application software , Apple can release new technologies and implement them at the same time , rather than simply wish that third party developers would adopt them , as the company did in the early 90's .
For example , Apple added Audio Units to Mac OS X as standardized plugins for audio processing , and later added support for them in Logic and GarageBand .
Apple also created Image Units for Mac OS X’s CoreImage , and used the technology to deliver Aperture .
If Apple had left Aperture for Adobe to develop , it is unlikely Apple 's Mac specific technologies would have been incorporated , because Adobe would have to replicate Apple 's technology to make it also run on Windows .
By shipping its own product , Apple can tune the best performance from its hardware offerings and deliver a better product for its customers .
The Suite Deal
Just as Microsoft compiled an office suite , and integrated it into its email server , server software , other back - end server tools , and development tools , Apple is pursuing similar integration , although Apple can also include specialized hardware into the mix .
For example , while some analysts seem to think Apple 's Xserve RAID is a blindly speculative entry into the Enterprise market , the most obvious application is by Final Cut Studio users who are dealing with enormous amounts of HD video content .
Similarly , Apple 's 30 " displays are n't a dance with Dell into the market for crazy high end gamers , but a product carefully targeted toward pro and prosumer users of Aperture and Final Cut Studio applications .
Apple has tightly integrated its product lines together in many ways , creating new applications and simplifying things for users .
For example , Apple 's iPod gains much of its simplicity through its tight integration with iTunes .
Apple later integrated iTunes with its wireless products to introduce AirTunes streaming .
Next year 's iTV promises to do the same for video .
It ’s also tightly integrated with Apple 's WebObjects based online store , and serves as a central catalog for music , podcasts and video clips which can then be used in iLife applications and shared wirelessly with other users .
NeXT 's resuscitation saved Apple , but its the software that has given new potential users a reason to buy Macs .
Still , there 's other key reasons behind Apple 's recovery .

The Encyclopedia Britannica has stepped up its attacks on the journal Nature by taking out large ads in both the New York Times and the London Times this past week .
The unusually public dispute began last year when Nature published a study showing that Britannica and Wikipedia had almost the same level of accuracy .
Britannica was obviously not pleased with this conclusion , but made no objections until March , when it at last published a set of objections to the study .
Not pleased with Nature 's response , Britannica is now taking the controversy to the masses .
The ads call on Nature to issue a " full and public retraction of the article , " and the Britannica editors give five major reasons why they believe the methodology of the study was deeply flawed .
You reviewed text that was not even from the Encyclopedia Britannica
You accused Britannica of " omissions , " on the basis of reviews of arbitrarily chosen excerpts of Britannica articles , not the articles themselves
You rearranged and re-edited Britannica articles
You failed to distinguish minor inaccuracies from major errors
Your headline contradicted the body of your article
At the end , the editors of Britannica call on Nature to " renew its long - standing commitment to good scholarship and send us the complete , unabridged reviewer reports on which the study was based . "
They also suggest that a " complete retraction of the article is in order .
Nature should make the retraction promptly , if not for Britannica 's sake , then for the sake of Nature 's reputation and in the interest of good science . "
Britannica is certainly not holding anything back in this battle , which is understandable , as it goes to the very heart of their corporate mission ( and profit margins ) .
Their criticisms certainly do make the Nature study sound flawed .
Britannica claims , for instance , that " several of the articles you sent to reviewers were not from the Britannica at all .
In one case a reviewer criticized us for text that we simply cannot identify .
We do know , however , that it was not ours . "
How could Nature make such egregious mistakes as these ?
Nature 's response is simple and direct — they are standing by their original results .
In their view , it is Britannica that is simply mistaken .
" Another Britannica criticism concerns the fact that we provided material from other Britannica publications , such as the Britannica Book of the Year .
This was deliberate : the aim of our story , as we made clear , was to compare the online material available from Britannica and Wikipedia .
When users search Britannica online , they get results from several Britannica publications .
They have no reason to think that any one is less reliable than the others .
In the case of some year - book entries , Britannica itself asks readers to reference the articles as coming from ' Encyclopaedia Britannica Online ' ?- exactly the source we set out to compare .
" Other objections are simply incorrect .
The company has , for example , claimed that in one case we sent a reviewer material that did not come from any Britannica publication .
When the company made this point to us in private we asked for details , but it provided none .
Now Britannica has identified the review in question as being on ethanol .
We have checked the original e-mail that we sent to the reviewer who looked at the Britannica article on ethanol , and it is clear to us that all the reviewer 's comments refer to specific paragraphs from Britannica . "
Nature 's larger point is that , in the end , specific mistakes do not matter much anyway , since the study was conducted blind .
Errors made by the reviewers would have tended to affect both Britannica and Wikipedia equally .
" Our reviewers may have made some mistakes -- we have been open about our methodology and never claimed otherwise -- but the entries they reviewed were blinded : they did not know which entry came from Wikipedia and which from Britannica .
We see no reason to believe that any misidentifications of errors would adversely affect one publication more than the other .
And of the 123 purported errors in question , Britannica takes issue with fewer than half . "
Britannica 's biggest gripe , though , has still not been addressed .
They mention several times in their advertisements that Nature has been unwilling to turn over all of the documentation behind the study , and Nature 's response does not indicate that they will do so .
The battle underscores the way in which projects such as Wikipedia can undermine established authorities and business models .
Whether this is wholly a good thing remains to be seen , as Wikipedia 's own founder has told users not to cite his online encyclopedia as a source due to concerns over its accuracy .
Hopefully , the competition between the two models will serve to improve both .
The archaeological site of Çatalhöyük , in present - day Turkey , is one of the most significant early Neolithic villages to have been excavated .
It was occupied ...
Excerpts of this report will be in Wednesday 's New York Times , Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal .
The study was conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health by sending teams of Iraqi doctors across Iraq from May through July .
Other tabulations using different methodologies put the range of total civilian fatalities so far from about 50,000 to more than 150,000 .
President Bush in December said " 30,000 , more or less " had died in Iraq during the invasion and in the violence since .
The Johns Hopkins team conducted its study using a methodology known as " cluster sampling . "
That involved randomly picking 47 clusters of households for a total 1,849 households , scattered across Iraq .
Team members interviewed each household about any deaths in the family during the 40 months since the invasion , as well as in the year before the invasion .
The team says it reviewed death certificates for 92 percent of all deaths reported .
Based on those figures , it tabulated national mortality rates for various periods before and after the start of the war .
The mortality rate last year was nearly four times the preinvasion rate , the study found .
" Since March 2003 , an additional 2.5 percent of Iraq 's population has died above what would have occurred without conflict , " the report said .
The country`s population is roughly 24 million people .

About Julius
" Julius " is a high - performance , small - footprint large vocabulary continuous speech recognition ( LVCSR ) decoder software for speech - related researchers and developers .
Based on word N - gram and context - dependent HMM , it can perform real - time decoding on various computers and devices from micro-computer to cloud server .
The algorithm is based on 2 - pass tree - trellis search , which fully incorporates major decoding techniques such as tree - organized lexicon , 1 - best / word - pair context approximation , rank / score pruning , N - gram factoring , cross - word context dependency handling , enveloped beam search , Gaussian pruning , Gaussian selection , etc .
Besides search efficiency , it is also modularized to be independent from model structures , and wide variety of HMM structures are supported such as shared - state triphones and tied - mixture models , with any number of mixtures , states , or phone sets .
It also can run multi-instance recognition , running dictation , grammar - based recognition or isolated word recognition simultaneously in a single thread .
Standard formats are adopted for the models to cope with other speech / language modeling toolkit such as HTK , SRILM , etc. Recent version also supports Deep Neural Network ( DNN ) based real - time decoding .
The main platform is Linux and other Unix - based system , as well as Windows , Mac , Androids and other platforms .
Julius has been developed as a research software for Japanese LVCSR since 1997 , and the work was continued under IPA Japanese dictation toolkit project ( 1997 -2000 ) , Continuous Speech Recognition Consortium , Japan ( CSRC ) ( 2000 - 2003 ) and Interactive Speech Technology Consortium ( ISTC ) .
The main developer / maintainer is Akinobu Lee ( ri@nitech.ac.jp ) .

Tools and Assets
There are also toolkit and assets to run Julius .
They are maintained by the Julius development team .
You can get them from the following Github pages :
A set of Julius executables and Japanese LM / AM .
You can test 60 k - word Japanese dictation with this kit .
For AM , triphone HMMs of both GMM and DNN are included .
For DNN , a front - end DNN module , separated from Julius , computes the state probabilities of HMM for each input frame and send them to Julius via socket to perform real - time DNN decoding .
For LM , 60 k - word 3 - gram trained by BCCWJ corpus is included .
You can get it from its GitHub page .
Documents , sample files and conversion tools to use and build a recognition grammar for Julius .
You can get it from the GitHub page .
This is a handy toolkit to do phoneme segmentation ( aka phoneme alignments ) for speech audio file using Julius .
Given pairs of speech audio file and its transcription , this toolkit perform Viterbi alignment to get the beginning and ending time of each phoneme .
This toolkit is available at its GitHub page .
Prompter is a perl / Tkx based tiny program that displays recognition results of Julius in a scrolling caption style .
About Models
Since Julius itself is a language - independent decoding program , you can make a recognizer of a language if given an appropriate language model and acoustic model for the target language .
The recognition accuracy largely depends on the models .
Julius adopts acoustic models in HTK ascii format , pronunciation dictionary in almost HTK format , and word 3 - gram language models in ARPA standard format ( forward 2 - gram and reverse N - gram trained from same corpus ) .
We had already examined English dictations with Julius , and another researcher has reported that Julius has also worked well in English , Slovenian ( see pp.681--684 of Proc. ICSLP2002 ) , French , Thai language , and many other Languages .
Here you can get Japanese and English language / acoustic models .
Japanese
Japanese language model ( 60 k - word trained by balanced corpus ) and acoustic models ( triphone GMM / DNN ) are included in the Japanese dictation kit .
More various types of Japanese N - gram LM and acoustic models are available at CSRC .
For more detail , please contact csrc@astem.or.jp .
English
There are some user - contributed English models for Julius available on the Web .
JuliusModels hosts English and Polish models for Julius .
All of the models are based on HTK modelling software and data sets available freely on the Internet .
They can be downloaded from a project website which I created for this purpose .
Please note that DNN version of these models require minor changes which the author included in a modified version of Julius on Github at https://github.com/palles77/julius .
The VoxForge - project is working on the creation of an open - source acoustic model for the English language .
If you have any language or acoustic model that can be distributed as a freeware , would you please contact us ?
We want to run dictation kit on various languages other than Japanese , and share them freely to provide a free speech recognition system available for various languages .

ブックマーク記述言 語 「 XBEL 」
XBEL 用途 ブックマーク交換 実行 - 日本語 ○ 対応環境 XML 入手 仕様書は無 償
どんなソフトにも対応可能
XBEL の名は 、 「 XML Bookmark Exchange Language ( XML による ブックマーク交換のための言語 ) 」の略です。XBEL はブックマークの保存形式の ひとつですが、オープンな規格である XML を使っているのが 強みです 。XML も XBEL もシンプルなので、対応したソフトを作成するのは 比較的簡単です。しかも、拡張性を考えて設計されています。 ちなみに 、Python.org で Python 言語 用の XML 処理ライブラリを開発した歳に生まれたものだそうです。
しかし、そんなにいいモノだとしても、なんの役に立つのでしょう?
ブックマークの形式なんて、ソフトを使う人には関係ないのでは?
……という疑問もわいたかもしれません。
XBEL の最大の目的は、ブックマークを保存することではありません。 あるブラウザの形式で保存されたブックマークを他の形式に変換したいときに、
XBEL を 「 中間言語 」として使うのです。つまり、 例えば Internet Explorer の形式を Navigator の形式に変換する場合、 直接変換するのではなく 、Internet Explorer の形式から一度 XBEL に変換し、 それから改めて Navigator の形式に変換するのです 。
「 1 対 1」の変換だと手間が増えて損な気がしますが、これが「多対多」だと
話が違います。ブラウザにはいくつも種類がありますし、同じブラウザでも
バージョンが違うと形式が変わったりします。仮に 10 種類の形式しかないとしても、 「 1 対 1」の方法で変換すると、すべての形式で互いに変換できるように するには 90 通りのプログラムが必要になってしまいます。一度
XBEL に 変換する場合は、各形式と XBEL が互いに変換できればいいので、 たった 20 通りですんでしまいます 。
一般には、変換を行なうと情報が減ってしまいます 。Navigator 形式の ブックマークを Internet Explorer に変換すると Navigator 形式独自の 情報は抜け落ちてしまうため、再び Navigator 形式に変換し直しても その情報は元に戻らないのです 。XBEL ではこのような特定のブラウザ専用の情報も 保存できるように工夫されています 。
さらに、XBEL はウェブブラウザだけでなく巡回エージェントと呼ばれる種類の
ソフトにも対応できます。つまり、Navigator 形式を WWWC 形式に変化したりすることも 考えられるわけです 。XBEL 形式でそのまま保存して、人に渡すこともできます。 受け取った方では 、XBEL を自分のブラウザや巡回エージェントの形式に変換する ソフトを見つけるだけですみます。 「
おすすめのリンク集」をプリクラみたいに 交換することもできるわけです。
XBEL 文書の構 成
さて、ここからは XBEL の実際の形式について紹介します。 XML に関する知識が必要ですので、知らんという方はこの機会に XML についても 学んでみるといいかもしれません 。
仕様書が公開されている XBEL 1.0 に登場する要素は 9 種類あります。 文書ルートの xbel 要素の他、 ブックマーク ( bookmark ) 、 フォルダ ( folder ) 、 エイリアス ( alias ) 、 セパレータ ( separator ) を表す 要素 ( 以下、この 4 つをまとめてブックマークノードと呼びます ) と、 それらについての情報を記述するための 要素 ( title 、 info 、 metadata 、 desc ) があります。各ブックマークを登録した 日時などはブックマークの要素に属性として保存されます。
以下の内容は 、XBEL 1.0 の文書型定義と仕様書を元に作成したものです。

<!ELEMENT bookmark ( title ? , info ? , desc ? ) >
<!
ATTLIST bookmark % node.att ; %url.att ; >
意味 個々のブックマーク、つまりネットワーク上のリソースへの参照を表します。 ユーザーインタフェースでは、 title 要素があれば、 それを使って表示され、ユーザーの指示に応じて desc などの 内容も表示されるでしょう。それ以外の動作はソフトウェアによります。 親要素 xbel 、 folder 子要素 title ( 0 または 1 個 ) 、 info ( 0 または 1 個 ) 、 desc ( 0 または 1 個 ) をこの順で 属性 href= " URI " ブックマークが参照するリソースの URI を示す CDATA 値。必ず指定します。 id = " ID " このブックマーク の ID 値。XML のリンク機構や alias 要素の ref 属性に使われます。省略可能。 added= " 日時 " 登録された日時を表す CDATA 値。省略可能。 modified= " 日時 " ブックマークが示すリソースが最後に変更された日時を表す

<!ELEMENT separator EMPTY >
意味 xbel や folder 内の ブックマークやフォルダを、グループごとに分ける境目を表します。 folder が階層構造を作るのに対して、 separator は構造を作るわけではありません。表示される際は、 水平線がはいったりや行間が大目に取られたり、読み上げに間を置かれたりします。 親要素 xbel 、 folder 内容 なし 属性 なし
<!ELEMENT alias EMPTY > <!ATTLIST alias ref IDREF #REQUIRED >
意味 ブックマークやフォルダの分身 ( いわゆるエイリアス ) を表します。 ひとつの XBEL 文書内での参照を想定しています。ユーザーインタフェースでは、 通常のブックマークやフォルダとは表示方法が異なるべきです。 例えば Netscape Navigator の場合、エイリアスは斜体で表示されます。 それ以外の点では、ユーザーはエイリアスが参照するブックマークやフォルダ そのもののように操作できます。ソフトウェアは、循環参照に陥らないように 注意する必要があります。 親要素 xbel 、 folder 内容 なし 属性 ref= " 参照する ID " 参照するブックマークやフォルダの ID ( IDREF 値) 。必ず指定します 。

Families who lost everything lived in filth and fear for days
Tired , hungry and traumatised by days spent under the damaged roof of a once - gleaming football stadium , the refugees of New Orleans have spoken of a nightmarish week living among the crazed and the desperate .
Stories of rape , murder and suicide have emerged .
Medical teams delivered babies in filthy conditions , with human faeces never far away and fresh water in short supply .
At least three were reported to have died .
Amid the filth and the crime , some snapped .
" One guy jumped off a balcony , " said Charles Womack , a 30 - year - old roofer who was beaten and injured during his time at the Superdome .
" I saw him do it .
He was talking to a lady about it .
He said it reminded him of the war and he could n't leave . "
Deadly night - time
Fear ratcheted up the tension , with disturbing reports of mistaken identity emerging from the chaos .
Police and national guardsmen were accused of killing innocent people .
" They killed a man here last night , " Steve Banka , 28 , told the Reuters news agency before he left on Sunday .
Death was everywhere , both inside and outside the Superdome
" And the sounds of her screaming got to this man and so he ran out into the street to get help from troops , to try to flag down a passing truck of them .
" He jumped up on the truck 's windscreen and they shot him dead , " Mr Banka said .
Another man died in mysterious circumstances on Friday as a police car passed the New Orleans Convention Center , where equally squalid conditions forced many to sleep outside among streets full of rubbish .
More than 24 hours later , his body , like so many others , had not been moved .
" Right where he fell , " Larry Martin told the Los Angeles Times .
" Like roadkill . "
On Saturday morning Africa Brumfield , 32 , sat with relatives near the corpse of a young man in streets around the convention centre .
He had died on Friday night as he walked in the street .
" There is rapes going on here .
Women can not go to the bathroom without men .
They are raping them and slitting their throats , " she told Reuters .
Rotting
Inside the Superdome , a National Guard soldier charged with keeping order confirmed the brutal reality of life after Katrina .
" We found a young girl raped and killed in the bathroom .
Then the crowd got the man and they beat him to death . "
National Guardsmen arrested those suspected of causing trouble
" It 's been a long time coming , " Derek Dabon , 29 , said as he queued for a security check .
Hillary Snowton , 40 , sat with a white sheet wrapped around his face to shield himself from the smell of a dead body that lay , untouched , just metres away .
He had watched the body lie there for the past four days , decomposing in the sultry Louisiana climate .
He did n't see the point in moving away from the corpse , he told the Associated Press .
" It stinks everywhere . "
A 70 - year - old blew herself up in a Hamas attack .
She may be just the first of many elderly recruits
In the centre of Beit Hanoun , there is nothing left of the 800 - year - old mosque but the minaret .
It looks like a lighthouse stranded in a sea of rubble .
People whose homes were demolished during the latest Israeli army incursion sit on plastic chairs around bonfires .
At night they bunk down with the neighbours .
One of them is Watfa Kafarna .
' I saw the Israeli soldiers eye - to - eye , ' she said .
' They took my four - year - old grandson , Mahadi , who has Down 's syndrome .
They shook him and yelled : " Where are the guns ? "
Now he is traumatised and wets the bed every night . '
Not his own bed - the Kafarna family is homeless , living off the charity of friends .
Tears run from Watfa 's eyes as she looks at her son , daughter - in - law and grandchild huddled around a brazier .
Her husband , Diab , shuffles across the ruins towards his wife .
' Bossa ! ' he says , ' A kiss ! '
In a highly unconventional move , Diab kisses his wife on the mouth .
' She is my heart , my eyes , my light .
We have lost our house but not each other . '
During the incursion , Israeli soldiers detained all men aged 16 - 40 , including Watfa and Diab 's sons and grandsons .
The army targeted the mosque , attempting to arrest militants hiding there .
The women put up their own resistance , gathering as human shields around the mosque to help the militants escape .
' I am 72 , says Watfa , ' but by doing this I felt 20 , young and useful and ready to act . '
She pulls off her long veil and holds it high in her right hand .
' I waved my hijab as a white flag and prayed with the other women in front of the holy mosque .
But the Israelis continued to destroy it .'
Two women were killed by the Israeli Defence Force that day .
Watfa was bruised , as was 70 - year - old Fatma Najar , hit by a bulldozer .
Three weeks later , Najar blew herself up near Israeli soldiers , wounding two .
In Gaza she is seen as a heroine .
' If the Israelis came to my house to gun down my children and I had a belt , I would do the same , ' says Watfa .
' The woman is the biggest loser here , ' says Khola , a neighbour , standing on the remains of a kitchen where flour is mixed with pulverised masonry .
Two hundred homes were destroyed in Beit Hanoun .
' Fatma Najar , an old woman , did what many people do n't have the guts to do .
If you go back and research Fatma , ' says Khola , ' you will see her home was destroyed on top of her head , her sons jailed , her grandson killed . '
' We want to believe in peace , but how can we when the warplanes still fly over our heads every night , ' asks Watfa , ' making our grandchildren cry and wet themselves ?
When there are still tank movements on the border ?
I can't believe there will be peace . '
Najar 's family heard of her attack on the radio .
' We thought it must be another Fatma Najar , ' said her son , Jihad , 35 .
' It never occurred to us it could have been my mother .
Then the crowds started to arrive and we knew it was true .
We had mixed feelings , sadness at her irreplaceable loss .
But pride too . '
There is a huge shaheed - ' martyr ' - poster of Najar on her house .
It is shocking to see an old woman carrying an M16 .
Some of her 70 grandchildren and great - grandchildren play beneath the picture .
Israa , six , wears a pink top with ' Happy Childhood ' embroidered on it .
' My grandmother 's gone to heaven .
Because she shot the Israelis , ' she says .
The funeral tent is empty now , the three days of official mourning over .
On the first evening , men from the Qassam Brigades , the military wing of Hamas , arrived .
Her son Inam said : ' They told us : " Your mother has been asking to do this for two years .
We said no .
Finally she said , if you do n't give me a belt I will go anyway and get killed and my blood will be on your hands .
We gave in " .'
Other old women now want to become suicide bombers .
The family talks of why she did it .
Perhaps it was her grandson 's death .
' My son , Adil , was 18 when he was killed , ' says Fathiya , 52 , Najar 's eldest daughter .
' He was throwing stones at the Israelis . '
Then there was Fathiya 's other son , Sha'aban .
He attacked an Israeli soldier with a knife .
He was shot 72 times , lost a leg and is paralysed .
The family show a photo of Fatma , a sweet - faced woman in a white cotton scarf .
Neighbours crowd in with stories of her generosity , how she gave sweets to local children , told stories , played .
Najar was a religious woman , involved with mosque committees and close to memorising the Koran .
It was only after her death , her family discovered she had been working for Hamas : ' They told us she had carried food , water , ammunition to the resistance at the front line .
We had no idea . '
The night before her suicide operation , Najar went to visit all of her children and grandchildren .
She brought clothes and sweets .
' But she was always so good to us , ' says Inam .
' As she left me for the last time , she looked back in a way that made me wonder , but then she was gone . '
' On the day she acted like it was a normal day .
She baked the bread in the clay oven .
She took a shower , put on a new dress and went out , ' said Jihad .
' I think the final straw was the Beit Hanoun massacre [ a family of 17 killed at dawn when Israeli shells hit their house ] .
Mother went to the family 's home and asked the women : " Why leave it to your sons to die ?
If Allah allows , I will become a martyr . "
They said : " You think they will take an old lady like you ? " '
A fortnight later she was a suicide bomber , injuring two Israelis , decapitating herself .
This weekend Hamas held a ceremony in Beit Hanoun , in memory of the 140 Palestinians killed in November .
Thousands attended , waving Hamas flags .
The mayor , Dr Nazek el - Kafarna , made a speech in honour of Najar : ' This old lady looked at the houses destroyed and the trees uprooted .
She looked at how our people had been humiliated .
She took her soul in her hand and rushed to her martyrdom . '
Huda Haim , a Hamas PLC member , believes Najar 's act begins a new culture .
' We know behind the Israeli leaders there are decision - makers studying the behaviour of the Palestinians .
Fatma told them they can't end the Palestinian issue with violence .'
The audience was thronged with women , many elderly , many clinging to photographs of their dead .
' We all want to be like Fatma , ' they shouted .
' I am happy about the ceasefire , ' says Zaifa .
' But if the Israelis come back , they will see what we will do , we will be like Fatma Najar . '
' I know at least 20 of us who want to put on the belt , ' said Fatma Naouk , 65 .
' Now is the time of the women .
Now the old women have found a use for themselves . '
CONCORD , Mass. , Oct. 27 — Rainbow looks like any other Labrador retriever , but she is not a pet .
Trained by a prison inmate , her mission is to help Roland Paquette , an injured veteran of the conflict in Afghanistan , stay on his new feet , the ones he got after an explosion destroyed his legs .
While veterans who lose their sight or hearing or must use a wheelchair have long had “ service ” dogs as companions , Rainbow is one of the first dogs in the country trained to work with someone who uses both a wheelchair and prosthetics to get around .
Mr. Paquette ’s hope is that eventually Rainbow will allow him to abandon his canes altogether and rely only on the metal handle attached to the harness she wears around her torso .
“ I ’d much rather be able to walk with her at my side than with the canes , ” said Mr. Paquette , who is 28 .
“ It makes me less obvious . ”
Frida Berrigan on “ Democracy Now ” radio :
“ Israel ’s relationship with the United States is unique in a number of ways .
And one of those ways is that essentially the United States provides 20 % of the Israeli military budget on an annual basis , and then about 70 % of that money that is given from the United States , from U.S. taxpayers , to Israel is then spent on weapons from Lockheed Martin and Boeing and Raytheon .
Most other countries do n’t have that sort of cash relationship , where they go straight to U.S. corporations with U.S. money to buy weapons that are then used in the Occupied Territories and against Lebanon . ”
In short , Â the U.S. is paying forÂ Israel ’s brutal invasion of Lebanon — and Â American war profiteers are making piles of money .
It isÂ militarism as an economic system , what one might call “ war capitalism ” — which is , in reality , totally state - controlled and politically determined , Â as farÂ fromÂ the system of free enterprises as a nation could possibly get , short of Lenin ’s “ war communism . ”
Â
The ruling comes with no penalty , but under federal law the department is supposed to report the violations to the White House and Congress .
In the course of its work , the accountability office discovered a previously undisclosed instance in which the Education Department had commissioned a newspaper article .
The article , on the " declining science literacy of students , " was distributed by the North American Precis Syndicate and appeared in numerous small newspapers around the country .
Readers were not informed of the government 's role in the writing of the article , which praised the department 's role in promoting science education .
The auditors denounced a prepackaged television story disseminated by the Education Department .
The segment , a " video news release " narrated by a woman named Karen Ryan , said that President Bush 's program for providing remedial instruction and tutoring to children " gets an A - plus . "
Ms. Ryan also narrated two videos praising the new Medicare drug benefit last year .
In those segments , as in the education video , the narrator ended by saying , " In Washington , I'm Karen Ryan reporting . "
The television news segments on education and on Medicare did not state that they had been prepared and distributed by the government .
The G.A.O. did not say how many stations carried the reports .
The public relations efforts came to light weeks before Margaret Spellings became education secretary in January .
Susan Aspey , a spokeswoman for the secretary , said on Friday that Ms. Spellings regarded the efforts as " stupid , wrong and ill - advised . "
She said Ms. Spellings had taken steps " to ensure these types of missteps do n't happen again . "
The investigation by the accountability office was requested by Senators Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , both Democrats .
Mr. Lautenberg expressed concern about a section of the report in which investigators said they could not find records to confirm that Mr. Williams had performed all the activities for which he billed the government .

Rilke writes that " the external shrinks into less and less " :
Where once an enduring house was ,
now a cerebral structure crosses our path , completely
belonging to the realm of concepts , as though it still stood in the brain .
Our age has built itself vast reservoirs of power ,
formless as the straining energy that it wrests from the earth .
Temples are no longer known .
In this context , it seems almost like an act of religious sarcasm that the MareNostrum computer – pictured at the top of this post – has been housed in a chapel .
( Of course , a consecrated supercomputer is certainly a stunning intellectual possibility – perhaps setting up the plot of Da Vinci Code 2 , wherein future archaeologists discover that the Vatican is not a complex of buildings at all but a fully functioning Jesuit supercomputer ) .
In any case , because all harddrives are actually geological objects – careful rearrangements of minerals under the influence of manmade magnetic fields – then these are mathematical terrains in the most exciting sense : the surface of the earth dreaming of spherical velocities inside otherwise undetectable stellar detonations .

So if I were forced to take issue with the existence of these machines , it would not be because of their use in modeling new nuclear warheads – as Norfolk makes clear they do – but in something far more secondary , even faintly absurd : what I 'd call the lack of a supercomputer poetics , or a more imaginative role for these machines to play in our literary and even religious lives .

" They can map every molecule of the billions on a human DNA string ; scrutinise at the atomic level the collision between two pieces of plutonium in an exploding bomb ; or sketch the gravitational pull of every star in the galaxy upon every other star in the galaxy .
These are not questions that humans could grapple with given plenty of time , a notebook and a sharp pencil .

" Rilke writes that " the external shrinks into less and less " :

Finally , Giordano Bruno , following Giulio Camillo , wrote extensively about the idea of a Memory Palace , or Memory Theater .
As Victoria Nelson tells us , the basic idea was that an " esoterically trained memory was a godlike vessel for encapsulating the entire universe within a single human mind . "
This was part of what Nelson calls a Neoplatonic " quasi- religion " that " venerated memory as an organ possessing magical and world - ordering powers . "
Neoplatonists believed that " the whole cosmos could be ' memorized ' in a much more overt imitatio dei and by this act magically incorporated into the human organism " – or , of course , into the air - cooled circuits of a supercomputer .

A battle has erupted over who governs the internet , with America demanding to maintain a key role in the network it helped create and other countries demanding more control .
The European commission is warning that if a deal cannot be reached at a meeting in Tunisia next month the internet will split apart .
At issue is the role of the US government in overseeing the internet 's address structure , called the domain name system ( DNS ) , which enables communication between the world 's computers .
It is managed by the California - based , not - for - profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( Icann ) under contract to the US department of commerce .
A meeting of officials in Geneva last month was meant to formulate a way of sharing internet governance which politicians could unveil at the UN - sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis on November 16 - 18 .
A European Union plan that goes a long way to meeting the demands of developing countries to make the governance more open collapsed in the face of US opposition .
Viviane Reding , European IT commissioner , says that if a multilateral approach cannot be agreed , countries such as China , Russia , Brazil and some Arab states could start operating their own versions of the internet and the ubiquity that has made it such a success will disappear .
" We have to have a platform where leaders of the world can express their thoughts about the internet , " she said .
" If they have the impression that the internet is dominated by one nation and it does not belong to all the nations then the result could be that the internet falls apart . "
The US argues that many of the states demanding a more open internet are no fans of freedom of expression .
Michael Gallagher , President Bush 's internet adviser and head of the national telecommunications and information administration , believes they are seizing on the only " central " part of the system in an effort to exert control .
" They are looking for a handle , thinking that the DNS is the meaning of life .
But the meaning of life lies within their own borders and the policies that they create there . "
The US government , which funded the development of the internet in the 60s , said in June it intended to retain its role overseeing Icann , reneging on a pledge made during Bill Clinton 's presidency .
Since Icann was created , the US commerce department has not once interfered with its decisions .
David Gross , who headed the US delegation at the Geneva talks , said untested models of internet governance could disrupt the 250,000 - plus networks , all using the same technical standards ( TCP / IP ) , which allows over a billion people to get online for 27bn daily user sessions .
" The internet has been a remarkably reliable and stable network of networks and it has grown at a rate unprecedented in human history , " he said .
" What we are looking for is a continued evolution of the internet that is technically driven .
We do not think the creation of new or use of existing multilateral institutions in the governance of essentially technical institutions is a way to promote technological change . "
' Valuable dot '
According to Emily Taylor , director of legal and policy issues at Nominet , which oversees the address categories such as .co or .org - root zone files known as top - level domain names - bearing Britain 's .uk suffix , the spat in Geneva was " all about the root - the valuable dot at the end of domain names " .
At present Icann decides what new top - level domain names to create and who should run the existing domains , in consultation with a panel called the Governmental Advisory Committee .
In practice the GAC exerts more pressure on Icann than the US department of commerce ever has .
It was at the GAC 's urging that a recent request to create more top - level domain names was reviewed .
The commerce department does have the power to clear Icann 's decisions .
Icann 's president , Paul Twomey , shares many of the US government concerns .
He is adamant that his organisation should be allowed to evolve rather than be brushed aside in favour of some untried model of state - led internet governance .
" We are firmly committed to a multi- stakeholder approach , " he said .
" We expect to evolve , we expect to keep changing .
We are concerned about stability [ of the internet ] and we think it 's best to evolve existing institutions .
Our present corporate structure is a matter of history , not of any particular design . "
But designing new structures is exactly what the international community seems intent on doing .
At one end of the spectrum are Iran , Pakistan and other so - called control - oriented states that want to create a new governing council for the web to which Icann would be accountable .
The remit of this council seems broad enough to include questions of content , a worry for advocates of free speech on the web .
Two week 's ago the EU proposed its own structure , which consists of what it calls a " cooperation model " to deal with Icann and a forum which would allow governments , interested organisations and industry to discuss internet issues and swap best practice .
' Lightweight '
" What we are talking about is a governance structure that is extremely lightweight , where the government oversight of internet functions is limited just to the list of essential tasks , " said one EU negotiator .
While the forum " does not decide anything , it is a place where people can come to a view and generally participate in thinking about the internet and the way it is governed " .
The EU plan was applauded by states such as Saudi Arabia and Iran , leading the former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt to express misgivings on his weblog : " It seems as if the European position has been hijacked by officials that have been driven by interests that should not be ours .
" We really can't have a Europe that is applauded by China and Iran and Saudi Arabia on the future governance of the internet .
Even those critical of the United States must see where such a position risks taking us . "
But EU negotiators are adamant that they reject calls for state control of the content of the internet .
" None of this is about content and that is a big difference between the EU position and the position of China and Brazil , " the negotiator said .
" The proposals that came from Brazil and the others to amend our own proposal were not acceptable , they were trying to drag us closer to their position .
We are very alive to that . "
Calls from Argentina for a continuing debate while Icann is restructured are believed to have garnered support from countries such as Canada which do not like the perceived power that the US has over the internet but are wary of opening up the web to overall state control .
Just before the meeting in Tunis , there will be a three - day gathering of bureaucrats to try to thrash out a deal on internet governance .
Getting the parties - especially the US - to agree to anything looks like a near impossible task but Mrs Reding believes it is crucial to find common ground or see the global communication network disintegrate .
The firm US stand makes that prospect of an end to ubiquity seem imminent .
Although any decision from the Tunis summit would have no legal standing , the current deal between Icann and the US government is due to come to an end in September next year , by which time the organisation is supposed to be made independent under the deal made during the Clinton presidency .
Mr Gallagher said that after the Tunis meeting there will be further discussion with governments and the private sector about the future of the organisation .
" But we are not going to bureaucratise , politicise and retard the management of the DNS .
Period , " he said .
" That will not happen .
We will not agree to it in November and we will not do it in September 2006 . "
Footnotes
Domain Name System
The DNS is the address book of the internet , matching numeric IP addresses to alphabetic addresses such as www.amazon.co.uk, which people find easier to remember .
But instead of one central list of everyone 's internet address , which would be massive , it splits addresses into their constituent parts - called domains - and gives each machine in the network enough information to know where to locate the next machine down the line .
This is known as a distributed database .
Icann
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a not - for - profit organisation that manages the DNS .
It decides who gets to operate the most basic domains , the top - level domains such as .com and .org as well as all the world 's country codes .
It is responsible for allocating space on the internet .
It was set up in California under contract to the department of commerce and as such it is subject to California state law and any disagreements have to be taken up with that state 's courts .
TCP and IP
Internet Protocol ( IP ) is the technology that allows data to cross networks , using a destination address ( IP address ) to make sure it reaches the right place .
Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) , meanwhile , ensures the correct delivery of that data or its re-transmission if it gets lost .
Together they are the tarmac of the information superhighway .
Root zone file
Although the DNS is a distributed database it needs a starting point , a list of where to go for the first part of an internet address and start a search for a particular machine .
This list of where to start is called the root zone file .
It is a list of 248 country code top - level domains ( ccTLDs ) - such as .uk and . fr - as well as 14 generic top - level domains ( gTLDs ) , which are subject - based such as .com and .net and .org .
The list , held on 13 machines across the world , says who runs these domains and where to find them .
